<p>Author: Harish G. Ramaswamy, Shivani Agarwal, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: The design of convex, calibrated surrogate losses, whose minimization entails consistency with respect to a desired target loss, is an important concept to have emerged in the theory of machine learning in recent years. We give an explicit construction of a convex least-squares type surrogate loss that can be designed to be calibrated for any multiclass learning problem for which the target loss matrix has a low-rank structure; the surrogate loss operates on a surrogate target space of dimension at most the rank of the target loss. We use this result to design convex calibrated surrogates for a variety of subset ranking problems, with target losses including the precision@q, expected rank utility, mean average precision, and pairwise disagreement. 1</p><p>3 0.17642936 <a title="313-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Regression-tree_Tuning_in_a_Streaming_Setting.html">269 nips-2013-Regression-tree Tuning in a Streaming Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of maintaining the data-structures of a partition-based regression procedure in a setting where the training data arrives sequentially over time. We prove that it is possible to maintain such a structure in time O (log n) at ˜ any time step n while achieving a nearly-optimal regression rate of O n−2/(2+d) in terms of the unknown metric dimension d. Finally we prove a new regression lower-bound which is independent of a given data size, and hence is more appropriate for the streaming setting. 1</p><p>4 0.13847579 <a title="313-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lijun Zhang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that the optimal convergence rate for stochastic optimization of √ smooth functions is O(1/ T ), which is same as stochastic optimization of Lipschitz continuous convex functions. This is in contrast to optimizing smooth functions using full gradients, which yields a convergence rate of O(1/T 2 ). In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as Mixed Optimization, which allows to access both a stochastic oracle and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to signiﬁcantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle. We show that, with an O(ln T ) calls to the full gradient oracle and an O(T ) calls to the stochastic oracle, the proposed mixed optimization algorithm is able to achieve an optimization error of O(1/T ). 1</p><p>5 0.12613103 <a title="313-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Theory_for_High-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixtures_with_Sparse_Mean_Separation.html">192 nips-2013-Minimax Theory for High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with Sparse Mean Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Azizyan, Aarti Singh, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: While several papers have investigated computationally and statistically efﬁcient methods for learning Gaussian mixtures, precise minimax bounds for their statistical performance as well as fundamental limits in high-dimensional settings are not well-understood. In this paper, we provide precise information theoretic bounds on the clustering accuracy and sample complexity of learning a mixture of two isotropic Gaussians in high dimensions under small mean separation. If there is a sparse subset of relevant dimensions that determine the mean separation, then the sample complexity only depends on the number of relevant dimensions and mean separation, and can be achieved by a simple computationally efﬁcient procedure. Our results provide the ﬁrst step of a theoretical basis for recent methods that combine feature selection and clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.12140258 <a title="313-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Linear_Convergence_with_Condition_Number_Independent_Access_of_Full_Gradients.html">175 nips-2013-Linear Convergence with Condition Number Independent Access of Full Gradients</a></p>

<p>Author: Akshay Balsubramani, Sanjoy Dasgupta, Yoav Freund</p><p>Abstract: We consider a situation in which we see samples Xn ∈ Rd drawn i.i.d. from some distribution with mean zero and unknown covariance A. We wish to compute the top eigenvector of A in an incremental fashion - with an algorithm that maintains an estimate of the top eigenvector in O(d) space, and incrementally adjusts the estimate with each new data point that arrives. Two classical such schemes are due to Krasulina (1969) and Oja (1983). We give ﬁnite-sample convergence rates for both. 1</p><p>4 0.58420593 <a title="313-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Linear_Convergence_of_the_Proximal_Gradient_Method_for_Trace_Norm_Regularization.html">222 nips-2013-On the Linear Convergence of the Proximal Gradient Method for Trace Norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Hou, Zirui Zhou, Anthony Man-Cho So, Zhi-Quan Luo</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by various applications in machine learning, the problem of minimizing a convex smooth loss function with trace norm regularization has received much attention lately. Currently, a popular method for solving such problem is the proximal gradient method (PGM), which is known to have a sublinear rate of convergence. In this paper, we show that for a large class of loss functions, the convergence rate of the PGM is in fact linear. Our result is established without any strong convexity assumption on the loss function. A key ingredient in our proof is a new Lipschitzian error bound for the aforementioned trace norm–regularized problem, which may be of independent interest.</p><p>5 0.56214273 <a title="313-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Better_Approximation_and_Faster_Algorithm_Using_the_Proximal_Average.html">56 nips-2013-Better Approximation and Faster Algorithm Using the Proximal Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Yao-Liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: It is a common practice to approximate “complicated” functions with more friendly ones. In large-scale machine learning applications, nonsmooth losses/regularizers that entail great computational challenges are usually approximated by smooth functions. We re-examine this powerful methodology and point out a nonsmooth approximation which simply pretends the linearity of the proximal map. The new approximation is justiﬁed using a recent convex analysis tool— proximal average, and yields a novel proximal gradient algorithm that is strictly better than the one based on smoothing, without incurring any extra overhead. Numerical experiments conducted on two important applications, overlapping group lasso and graph-guided fused lasso, corroborate the theoretical claims. 1</p><p>6 0.53251338 <a title="313-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Divyanshu Vats, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately estimating a high-dimensional sparse vector using a small number of linear measurements that are contaminated by noise. It is well known that standard computationally tractable sparse recovery algorithms, such as the Lasso, OMP, and their various extensions, perform poorly when the measurement matrix contains highly correlated columns. We develop a simple greedy algorithm, called SWAP, that iteratively swaps variables until a desired loss function cannot be decreased any further. SWAP is surprisingly effective in handling measurement matrices with high correlations. We prove that SWAP can easily be used as a wrapper around standard sparse recovery algorithms for improved performance. We theoretically quantify the statistical guarantees of SWAP and complement our analysis with numerical results on synthetic and real data.</p><p>3 0.89272159 <a title="313-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Estimating_LASSO_Risk_and_Noise_Level.html">109 nips-2013-Estimating LASSO Risk and Noise Level</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohsen Bayati, Murat A. Erdogdu, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: We study the fundamental problems of variance and risk estimation in high dimensional statistical modeling. In particular, we consider the problem of learning a coefﬁcient vector θ0 ∈ Rp from noisy linear observations y = Xθ0 + w ∈ Rn (p > n) and the popular estimation procedure of solving the 1 -penalized least squares objective known as the LASSO or Basis Pursuit DeNoising (BPDN). In this context, we develop new estimators for the 2 estimation risk θ − θ0 2 and the variance of the noise when distributions of θ0 and w are unknown. These can be used to select the regularization parameter optimally. Our approach combines Stein’s unbiased risk estimate [Ste81] and the recent results of [BM12a][BM12b] on the analysis of approximate message passing and the risk of LASSO. We establish high-dimensional consistency of our estimators for sequences of matrices X of increasing dimensions, with independent Gaussian entries. We establish validity for a broader class of Gaussian designs, conditional on a certain conjecture from statistical physics. To the best of our knowledge, this result is the ﬁrst that provides an asymptotically consistent risk estimator for the LASSO solely based on data. In addition, we demonstrate through simulations that our variance estimation outperforms several existing methods in the literature. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.88779181 <a title="313-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Majorization-Minimization_Algorithms_for_Large-Scale_Optimization.html">313 nips-2013-Stochastic Majorization-Minimization Algorithms for Large-Scale Optimization</a></p>

Because of its simplicity and its wide applicability, this principle has been very popular in statistics and in signal processing. In this paper, we intend to make this principle scalable. We introduce a stochastic majorization-minimization scheme which is able to deal with largescale or possibly inﬁnite data sets. When applied to convex optimization problems under suitable assumptions, we show that it achieves an expected convergence √ rate of O(1/ n) after n iterations, and of O(1/n) for strongly convex functions. Equally important, our scheme almost surely converges to stationary points for a large class of non-convex problems. We develop several efﬁcient algorithms based on our framework. First, we propose a new stochastic proximal gradient method, which experimentally matches state-of-the-art solvers for large-scale ℓ1 logistic regression. Second, we develop an online DC programming algorithm for non-convex sparse estimation. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for solving large-scale structured matrix factorization problems. 1</p><p>5 0.86949813 <a title="313-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Confidence_Intervals_and_Hypothesis_Testing_for_High-Dimensional_Statistical_Models.html">68 nips-2013-Confidence Intervals and Hypothesis Testing for High-Dimensional Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Adel Javanmard, Andrea Montanari</p><p>Abstract: Fitting high-dimensional statistical models often requires the use of non-linear parameter estimation procedures. As a consequence, it is generally impossible to obtain an exact characterization of the probability distribution of the parameter estimates. This in turn implies that it is extremely challenging to quantify the uncertainty associated with a certain parameter estimate. Concretely, no commonly accepted procedure exists for computing classical measures of uncertainty and statistical signiﬁcance as conﬁdence intervals or p-values. We consider here a broad class of regression problems, and propose an efﬁcient algorithm for constructing conﬁdence intervals and p-values. The resulting conﬁdence intervals have nearly optimal size. When testing for the null hypothesis that a certain parameter is vanishing, our method has nearly optimal power. Our approach is based on constructing a ‘de-biased’ version of regularized Mestimators. The new construction improves over recent work in the ﬁeld in that it does not assume a special structure on the design matrix. Furthermore, proofs are remarkably simple. We test our method on a diabetes prediction problem. 1</p><p>6 0.86727619 <a title="313-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Model_Selection_for_High-Dimensional_Regression_under_the_Generalized_Irrepresentability_Condition.html">194 nips-2013-Model Selection for High-Dimensional Regression under the Generalized Irrepresentability Condition</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>3 0.1220899 <a title="128-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Generalized_Random_Utility_Models_with_Multiple_Types.html">129 nips-2013-Generalized Random Utility Models with Multiple Types</a></p>

<p>Author: Jie Liu, David Page</p><p>Abstract: In large-scale applications of undirected graphical models, such as social networks and biological networks, similar patterns occur frequently and give rise to similar parameters. In this situation, it is beneﬁcial to group the parameters for more efﬁcient learning. We show that even when the grouping is unknown, we can infer these parameter groups during learning via a Bayesian approach. We impose a Dirichlet process prior on the parameters. Posterior inference usually involves calculating intractable terms, and we propose two approximation algorithms, namely a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm with auxiliary variables and a Gibbs sampling algorithm with “stripped” Beta approximation (Gibbs SBA). Simulations show that both algorithms outperform conventional maximum likelihood estimation (MLE). Gibbs SBA’s performance is close to Gibbs sampling with exact likelihood calculation. Models learned with Gibbs SBA also generalize better than the models learned by MLE on real-world Senate voting data. 1</p><p>5 0.064542077 <a title="128-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Using_multiple_samples_to_learn_mixture_models.html">344 nips-2013-Using multiple samples to learn mixture models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Lee, Ran Gilad-Bachrach, Rich Caruana</p><p>Abstract: In the mixture models problem it is assumed that there are K distributions θ1 , . . . , θK and one gets to observe a sample from a mixture of these distributions with unknown coeﬃcients. The goal is to associate instances with their generating distributions, or to identify the parameters of the hidden distributions. In this work we make the assumption that we have access to several samples drawn from the same K underlying distributions, but with diﬀerent mixing weights. As with topic modeling, having multiple samples is often a reasonable assumption. Instead of pooling the data into one sample, we prove that it is possible to use the diﬀerences between the samples to better recover the underlying structure. We present algorithms that recover the underlying structure under milder assumptions than the current state of art when either the dimensionality or the separation is high. The methods, when applied to topic modeling, allow generalization to words not present in the training data. 1</p><p>6 0.060514066 <a title="128-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification.html">83 nips-2013-Deep Fisher Networks for Large-Scale Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yao-Liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: The proximal map is the key step in gradient-type algorithms, which have become prevalent in large-scale high-dimensional problems. For simple functions this proximal map is available in closed-form while for more complicated functions it can become highly nontrivial. Motivated by the need of combining regularizers to simultaneously induce different types of structures, this paper initiates a systematic investigation of when the proximal map of a sum of functions decomposes into the composition of the proximal maps of the individual summands. We not only unify a few known results scattered in the literature but also discover several new decompositions obtained almost effortlessly from our theory. 1</p><p>5 0.42003864 <a title="128-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Scoring_Workers_in_Crowdsourcing%3A_How_Many_Control_Questions_are_Enough%3F.html">290 nips-2013-Scoring Workers in Crowdsourcing: How Many Control Questions are Enough?</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alex Ihler, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices, probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach. A challenging aspect of combining the crowd’s answers is that workers’ reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse. Control items with known answers can be used to evaluate workers’ performance, and hence improve the combined results on the target items with unknown answers. This raises the problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa. We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. As a byproduct, we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods. 1</p><p>6 0.41634127 <a title="128-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_and_using_language_via_recursive_pragmatic_reasoning_about_other_agents.html">164 nips-2013-Learning and using language via recursive pragmatic reasoning about other agents</a></p>

<p>Author: Gilles Louppe, Louis Wehenkel, Antonio Sutera, Pierre Geurts</p><p>Abstract: Despite growing interest and practical use in various scientiﬁc areas, variable importances derived from tree-based ensemble methods are not well understood from a theoretical point of view. In this work we characterize the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) variable importances as measured by an ensemble of totally randomized trees in asymptotic sample and ensemble size conditions. We derive a three-level decomposition of the information jointly provided by all input variables about the output in terms of i) the MDI importance of each input variable, ii) the degree of interaction of a given input variable with the other input variables, iii) the different interaction terms of a given degree. We then show that this MDI importance of a variable is equal to zero if and only if the variable is irrelevant and that the MDI importance of a relevant variable is invariant with respect to the removal or the addition of irrelevant variables. We illustrate these properties on a simple example and discuss how they may change in the case of non-totally randomized trees such as Random Forests and Extra-Trees. 1 Motivation An important task in many scientiﬁc ﬁelds is the prediction of a response variable based on a set of predictor variables. In many situations though, the aim is not only to make the most accurate predictions of the response but also to identify which predictor variables are the most important to make these predictions, e.g. in order to understand the underlying process. Because of their applicability to a wide range of problems and their capability to both build accurate models and, at the same time, to provide variable importance measures, Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) and variants such as Extra-Trees (Geurts et al., 2006) have become a major data analysis tool used with success in various scientiﬁc areas. Despite their extensive use in applied research, only a couple of works have studied the theoretical properties and statistical mechanisms of these algorithms. Zhao (2000), Breiman (2004), Biau et al. (2008); Biau (2012), Meinshausen (2006) and Lin and Jeon (2006) investigated simpliﬁed to very realistic variants of these algorithms and proved the consistency of those variants. Little is known however regarding the variable importances computed by Random Forests like algorithms, and – as far as we know – the work of Ishwaran (2007) is indeed the only theoretical study of tree-based variable importance measures. In this work, we aim at ﬁlling this gap and present a theoretical analysis of the Mean Decrease Impurity importance derived from ensembles of randomized trees. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2, we provide the background about ensembles of randomized trees and recall how variable importances can be derived from them; in section 3, we then derive a characterization in asymptotic conditions and show how variable importances derived from totally randomized trees offer a three-level decomposition of the information jointly contained in the input variables about the output; section 4 shows that this characterization only depends on the relevant variables and section 5 1 discusses theses ideas in the context of variants closer to the Random Forest algorithm; section 6 then illustrates all these ideas on an artiﬁcial problem; ﬁnally, section 7 includes our conclusions and proposes directions of future works. 2 Background In this section, we ﬁrst describe decision trees, as well as forests of randomized trees. Then, we describe the two major variable importances measures derived from them – including the Mean Decrease Impurity (MDI) importance that we will study in the subsequent sections. 2.1 Single classiﬁcation and regression trees and random forests A binary classiﬁcation (resp. regression) tree (Breiman et al., 1984) is an input-output model represented by a tree structure T , from a random input vector (X1 , ..., Xp ) taking its values in X1 × ... × Xp = X to a random output variable Y ∈ Y . Any node t in the tree represents a subset of the space X , with the root node being X itself. Internal nodes t are labeled with a binary test (or split) st = (Xm < c) dividing their subset in two subsets1 corresponding to their two children tL and tR , while the terminal nodes (or leaves) are labeled with a best guess value of the output ˆ variable2 . The predicted output Y for a new instance is the label of the leaf reached by the instance when it is propagated through the tree. A tree is built from a learning sample of size N drawn from P (X1 , ..., Xp , Y ) using a recursive procedure which identiﬁes at each node t the split st = s∗ for which the partition of the Nt node samples into tL and tR maximizes the decrease ∆i(s, t) = i(t) − pL i(tL ) − pR i(tR ) (1) of some impurity measure i(t) (e.g., the Gini index, the Shannon entropy, or the variance of Y ), and where pL = NtL /Nt and pR = NtR /Nt . The construction of the tree stops , e.g., when nodes become pure in terms of Y or when all variables Xi are locally constant. Single trees typically suffer from high variance, which makes them not competitive in terms of accuracy. A very efﬁcient and simple way to address this ﬂaw is to use them in the context of randomization-based ensemble methods. Speciﬁcally, the core principle is to introduce random perturbations into the learning procedure in order to produce several different decision trees from a single learning set and to use some aggregation technique to combine the predictions of all these trees. In Bagging (Breiman, 1996), trees are built on random bootstrap copies of the original data, hence producing different decision trees. In Random Forests (Breiman, 2001), Bagging is extended and combined with a randomization of the input variables that are used when considering candidate variables to split internal nodes t. In particular, instead of looking for the best split s∗ among all variables, the Random Forest algorithm selects, at each node, a random subset of K variables and then determines the best split over these latter variables only. 2.2 Variable importances In the context of ensembles of randomized trees, Breiman (2001, 2002) proposed to evaluate the importance of a variable Xm for predicting Y by adding up the weighted impurity decreases p(t)∆i(st , t) for all nodes t where Xm is used, averaged over all NT trees in the forest: Imp(Xm ) = 1 NT p(t)∆i(st , t) T (2) t∈T :v(st )=Xm and where p(t) is the proportion Nt /N of samples reaching t and v(st ) is the variable used in split st . When using the Gini index as impurity function, this measure is known as the Gini importance or Mean Decrease Gini. However, since it can be deﬁned for any impurity measure i(t), we will refer to Equation 2 as the Mean Decrease Impurity importance (MDI), no matter the impurity measure i(t). We will characterize and derive results for this measure in the rest of this text. 1 More generally, splits are deﬁned by a (not necessarily binary) partition of the range Xm of possible values of a single variable Xm . 2 e.g. determined as the majority class j(t) (resp., the average value y (t)) within the subset of the leaf t. ¯ 2 In addition to MDI, Breiman (2001, 2002) also proposed to evaluate the importance of a variable Xm by measuring the Mean Decrease Accuracy (MDA) of the forest when the values of Xm are randomly permuted in the out-of-bag samples. For that reason, this latter measure is also known as the permutation importance. Thanks to popular machine learning softwares (Breiman, 2002; Liaw and Wiener, 2002; Pedregosa et al., 2011), both of these variable importance measures have shown their practical utility in an increasing number of experimental studies. Little is known however regarding their inner workings. Strobl et al. (2007) compare both MDI and MDA and show experimentally that the former is biased towards some predictor variables. As explained by White and Liu (1994) in case of single decision trees, this bias stems from an unfair advantage given by the usual impurity functions i(t) towards predictors with a large number of values. Strobl et al. (2008) later showed that MDA is biased as well, and that it overestimates the importance of correlated variables – although this effect was not conﬁrmed in a later experimental study by Genuer et al. (2010). From a theoretical point of view, Ishwaran (2007) provides a detailed theoretical development of a simpliﬁed version of MDA, giving key insights for the understanding of the actual MDA. 3 Variable importances derived from totally randomized tree ensembles Let us now consider the MDI importance as deﬁned by Equation 2, and let us assume a set V = {X1 , ..., Xp } of categorical input variables and a categorical output Y . For the sake of simplicity we will use the Shannon entropy as impurity measure, and focus on totally randomized trees; later on we will discuss other impurity measures and tree construction algorithms. Given a training sample L of N joint observations of X1 , ..., Xp , Y independently drawn from the joint distribution P (X1 , ..., Xp , Y ), let us assume that we infer from it an inﬁnitely large ensemble of totally randomized and fully developed trees. In this setting, a totally randomized and fully developed tree is deﬁned as a decision tree in which each node t is partitioned using a variable Xi picked uniformly at random among those not yet used at the parent nodes of t, and where each t is split into |Xi | sub-trees, i.e., one for each possible value of Xi , and where the recursive construction process halts only when all p variables have been used along the current branch. Hence, in such a tree, leaves are all at the same depth p, and the set of leaves of a fully developed tree is in bijection with the set X of all possible joint conﬁgurations of the p input variables. For example, if the input variables are all binary, the resulting tree will have exactly 2p leaves. Theorem 1. The MDI importance of Xm ∈ V for Y as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of fully developed totally randomized trees and an inﬁnitely large training sample is: p−1 Imp(Xm ) = k=0 1 1 k Cp p − k I(Xm ; Y |B), (3) B∈Pk (V −m ) where V −m denotes the subset V \ {Xm }, Pk (V −m ) is the set of subsets of V −m of cardinality k, and I(Xm ; Y |B) is the conditional mutual information of Xm and Y given the variables in B. Proof. See Appendix B. Theorem 2. For any ensemble of fully developed trees in asymptotic learning sample size conditions (e.g., in the same conditions as those of Theorem 1), we have that p Imp(Xm ) = I(X1 , . . . , Xp ; Y ). (4) m=1 Proof. See Appendix C. Together, theorems 1 and 2 show that variable importances derived from totally randomized trees in asymptotic conditions provide a three-level decomposition of the information I(X1 , . . . , Xp ; Y ) contained in the set of input variables about the output variable. The ﬁrst level is a decomposition among input variables (see Equation 4 of Theorem 2), the second level is a decomposition along the 3 degrees k of interaction terms of a variable with the other ones (see the outer sum in Equation 3 of Theorem 1), and the third level is a decomposition along the combinations B of interaction terms of ﬁxed size k of possible interacting variables (see the inner sum in Equation 3). We observe that the decomposition includes, for each variable, each and every interaction term of each and every degree weighted in a fashion resulting only from the combinatorics of possible interaction terms. In particular, since all I(Xm ; Y |B) terms are at most equal to H(Y ), the prior entropy of Y , the p terms of the outer sum of Equation 3 are each upper bounded by 1 1 1 1 1 H(Y ) = k C k H(Y ) = H(Y ). k Cp p − k Cp p − k p−1 p −m B∈Pk (V ) As such, the second level decomposition resulting from totally randomized trees makes the p sub1 1 importance terms C k p−k B∈Pk (V −m ) I(Xm ; Y |B) to equally contribute (at most) to the total p importance, even though they each include a combinatorially different number of terms. 4 Importances of relevant and irrelevant variables Following Kohavi and John (1997), let us deﬁne as relevant to Y with respect to V a variable Xm for which there exists at least one subset B ⊆ V (possibly empty) such that I(Xm ; Y |B) > 0.3 Thus we deﬁne as irrelevant to Y with respect to V a variable Xi for which, for all B ⊆ V , I(Xi ; Y |B) = 0. Remark that if Xi is irrelevant to Y with respect to V , then by deﬁnition it is also irrelevant to Y with respect to any subset of V . Theorem 3. Xi ∈ V is irrelevant to Y with respect to V if and only if its inﬁnite sample size importance as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of fully developed totally randomized trees built on V for Y is 0. Proof. See Appendix D. Lemma 4. Let Xi ∈ V be an irrelevant variable for Y with respect to V . The inﬁnite sample size / importance of Xm ∈ V as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of fully developed totally randomized trees built on V for Y is the same as the importance derived when using V ∪ {Xi } to build the ensemble of trees for Y . Proof. See Appendix E. Theorem 5. Let VR ⊆ V be the subset of all variables in V that are relevant to Y with respect to V . The inﬁnite sample size importance of any variable Xm ∈ VR as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of fully developed totally randomized trees built on VR for Y is the same as its importance computed in the same conditions by using all variables in V . That is: p−1 Imp(Xm ) = k=0 r−1 = l=0 1 1 k Cp p − k 1 1 l Cr r − l I(Xm ; Y |B) B∈Pk (V −m ) (5) I(Xm ; Y |B) −m B∈Pl (VR ) where r is the number of relevant variables in VR . Proof. See Appendix F. Theorems 3 and 5 show that the importances computed with an ensemble of totally randomized trees depends only on the relevant variables. Irrelevant variables have a zero importance and do not affect the importance of relevant variables. Practically, we believe that such properties are desirable conditions for a sound criterion assessing the importance of a variable. Indeed, noise should not be credited of any importance and should not make any other variable more (or less) important. 3 Among the relevant variables, we have the marginally relevant ones, for which I(Xm ; Y ) > 0, the strongly relevant ones, for which I(Xm ; Y |V −m ) > 0, and the weakly relevant variables, which are relevant but not strongly relevant. 4 5 Random Forest variants In this section, we consider and discuss variable importances as computed with other types of ensembles of randomized trees. We ﬁrst show how our results extend to any other impurity measure, and then analyze importances computed by depth-pruned ensemble of randomized trees and those computed by randomized trees built on random subspaces of ﬁxed size. Finally, we discuss the case of non-totally randomized trees. 5.1 Generalization to other impurity measures Although our characterization in sections 3 and 4 uses Shannon entropy as the impurity measure, we show in Appendix I that theorems 1, 3 and 5 hold for other impurity measures, simply substituting conditional mutual information for conditional impurity reduction in the different formulas and in the deﬁnition of irrelevant variables. In particular, our results thus hold for the Gini index in classiﬁcation and can be extended to regression problems using variance as the impurity measure. 5.2 Pruning and random subspaces In sections 3 and 4, we considered totally randomized trees that were fully developed, i.e. until all p variables were used within each branch. When totally randomized trees are developed only up to some smaller depth q ≤ p, we show in Proposition 6 that the variable importances as computed by these trees is limited to the q ﬁrst terms of Equation 3. We then show in Proposition 7 that these latter importances are actually the same as when each tree of the ensemble is fully developed over a random subspace (Ho, 1998) of q variables drawn prior to its construction. Proposition 6. The importance of Xm ∈ V for Y as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of pruned totally randomized trees built up to depth q ≤ p and an inﬁnitely large training sample is: q−1 Imp(Xm ) = k=0 1 1 k p−k Cp I(Xm ; Y |B) (6) B∈Pk (V −m ) Proof. See Appendix G. Proposition 7. The importance of Xm ∈ V for Y as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of pruned totally randomized trees built up to depth q ≤ p and an inﬁnitely large training sample is identical to the importance as computed for Y with an inﬁnite ensemble of fully developed totally randomized trees built on random subspaces of q variables drawn from V . Proof. See Appendix H. As long as q ≥ r (where r denotes the number of relevant variables in V ), it can easily be shown that all relevant variables will still obtain a strictly positive importance, which will however differ in general from the importances computed by fully grown totally randomized trees built over all variables. Also, each irrelevant variable of course keeps an importance equal to zero, which means that, in asymptotic conditions, these pruning and random subspace methods would still allow us identify the relevant variables, as long as we have a good upper bound q on r. 5.3 Non-totally randomized trees In our analysis in the previous sections, trees are built totally at random and hence do not directly relate to those built in Random Forests (Breiman, 2001) or in Extra-Trees (Geurts et al., 2006). To better understand the importances as computed by those algorithms, let us consider a close variant of totally randomized trees: at each node t, let us instead draw uniformly at random 1 ≤ K ≤ p variables and let us choose the one that maximizes ∆i(t). Notice that, for K = 1, this procedure amounts to building ensembles of totally randomized trees as deﬁned before, while, for K = p, it amounts to building classical single trees in a deterministic way. First, the importance of Xm ∈ V as computed with an inﬁnite ensemble of such randomized trees is not the same as Equation 3. For K > 1, masking effects indeed appear: at t, some variables are 5 never selected because there always is some other variable for which ∆i(t) is larger. Such effects tend to pull the best variables at the top of the trees and to push the others at the leaves. As a result, the importance of a variable no longer decomposes into a sum including all I(Xm ; Y |B) terms. The importance of the best variables decomposes into a sum of their mutual information alone or conditioned only with the best others – but not conditioned with all variables since they no longer ever appear at the bottom of trees. By contrast, the importance of the least promising variables now decomposes into a sum of their mutual information conditioned only with all variables – but not alone or conditioned with a couple of others since they no longer ever appear at the top of trees. In other words, because of the guided structure of the trees, the importance of Xm now takes into account only some of the conditioning sets B, which may over- or underestimate its overall relevance. To make things clearer, let us consider a simple example. Let X1 perfectly explains Y and let X2 be a slightly noisy copy of X1 (i.e., I(X1 ; Y ) ≈ I(X2 ; Y ), I(X1 ; Y |X2 ) = and I(X2 ; Y |X1 ) = 0). Using totally randomized trees, the importances of X1 and X2 are nearly equal – the importance of X1 being slightly higher than the importance of X2 : 1 1 1 Imp(X1 ) = I(X1 ; Y ) + I(X1 ; Y |X2 ) = I(X1 ; Y ) + 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 Imp(X2 ) = I(X2 ; Y ) + I(X2 ; Y |X1 ) = I(X2 ; Y ) + 0 2 2 2 In non-totally randomized trees, for K = 2, X1 is always selected at the root node and X2 is always used in its children. Also, since X1 perfectly explains Y , all its children are pure and the reduction of entropy when splitting on X2 is null. As a result, ImpK=2 (X1 ) = I(X1 ; Y ) and ImpK=2 (X2 ) = I(X2 ; Y |X1 ) = 0. Masking effects are here clearly visible: the true importance of X2 is masked by X1 as if X2 were irrelevant, while it is only a bit less informative than X1 . As a direct consequence of the example above, for K > 1, it is no longer true that a variable is irrelevant if and only if its importance is zero. In the same way, it can also be shown that the importances become dependent on the number of irrelevant variables. Let us indeed consider the following counter-example: let us add in the previous example an irrelevant variable Xi with respect to {X1 , X2 } and let us keep K = 2. The probability of selecting X2 at the root node now becomes positive, which means that ImpK=2 (X2 ) now includes I(X2 ; Y ) > 0 and is therefore strictly larger than the importance computed before. For K ﬁxed, adding irrelevant variables dampens masking effects, which thereby makes importances indirectly dependent on the number of irrelevant variables. In conclusion, the importances as computed with totally randomized trees exhibit properties that do not possess, by extension, neither random forests nor extra-trees. With totally randomized trees, the importance of Xm only depends on the relevant variables and is 0 if and only if Xm is irrelevant. As we have shown, it may no longer be the case for K > 1. Asymptotically, the use of totally randomized trees for assessing the importance of a variable may therefore be more appropriate. In a ﬁnite setting (i.e., a limited number of samples and a limited number of trees), guiding the choice of the splitting variables remains however a sound strategy. In such a case, I(Xm ; Y |B) cannot be measured neither for all Xm nor for all B. It is therefore pragmatic to promote those that look the most promising – even if the resulting importances may be biased. 6 Illustration on a digit recognition problem In this section, we consider the digit recognition problem of (Breiman et al., 1984) for illustrating variable importances as computed with totally randomized trees. We verify that they match with our theoretical developments and that they decompose as foretold. We also compare these importances with those computed by an ensemble of non-totally randomized trees, as discussed in section 5.3, for increasing values of K. Let us consider a seven-segment indicator displaying numerals using horizontal and vertical lights in on-off combinations, as illustrated in Figure 1. Let Y be a random variable taking its value in {0, 1, ..., 9} with equal probability and let X1 , ..., X7 be binary variables whose values are each determined univocally given the corresponding value of Y in Table 1. Since Table 1 perfectly deﬁnes the data distribution, and given the small dimensionality of the problem, it is practicable to directly apply Equation 3 to compute variable importances.

Importances at K = 1 follow their theoretical values, as predicted by Equation 3 in Theorem 1. However, as K increases, importances diverge due to masking effects. In accordance with Theorem 2, their sum is also always equal to I(X1 , . . . , X7 ; Y ) = H(Y ) = log2 (10) = 3.321 since inputs allow to perfectly predict the output. theoretical developments, we then compare in Table 2 variable importances as computed by Equation 3 and those yielded by an ensemble of 10000 totally randomized trees (K = 1). Note that given the known structure of the problem, building trees on a sample of ﬁnite size that perfectly follows the data distribution amounts to building them on a sample of inﬁnite size. At best, trees can thus be built on a 10-sample dataset, containing exactly one sample for each of the equiprobable outcomes of Y . As the table illustrates, the importances yielded by totally randomized trees match those computed by Equation 3, which conﬁrms Theorem 1. Small differences stem from the fact that a ﬁnite number of trees were built in our simulations, but those discrepancies should disappear as the size of the ensemble grows towards inﬁnity. It also shows that importances indeed add up to I(X1 , ...X7 ; Y ), which conﬁrms Theorem 2. Regarding the actual importances, they indicate that X5 is stronger than all others, followed – in that order – by X2 , X4 and X3 which also show large importances. X1 , X7 and X6 appear to be the less informative. The table also reports importances for increasing values of K. As discussed before, we see that a large value of K yields importances that can be either overestimated (e.g., at K = 7, the importances of X2 and X5 are larger than at K = 1) or underestimated due to masking effects (e.g., at K = 7, the importances of X1 , X3 , X4 and X6 are smaller than at K = 1, as if they were less important). It can also be observed that masking effects may even induce changes in the variable rankings (e.g., compare the rankings at K = 1 and at K = 7), which thus conﬁrms that importances are differently affected. To better understand why a variable is important, it is also insightful to look at its decomposition into its p sub-importances terms, as shown in Figure 2. Each row in the plots of the ﬁgure corresponds to one the p = 7 variables and each column to a size k of conditioning sets. As such, the value at row m and column k corresponds the importance of Xm when conditioned with k other variables 1 1 (e.g., to the term C k p−k B∈Pk (V −m ) I(Xm ; Y |B) in Equation 3 in the case of totally randomized p trees). In the left plot, for K = 1, the ﬁgure ﬁrst illustrates how importances yielded by totally randomized trees decomposes along the degrees k of interactions terms. We can observe that they each equally contribute (at most) the total importance of a variable. The plot also illustrates why X5 is important: it is informative either alone or conditioned with any combination of the other variables (all of its terms are signiﬁcantly larger than 0). By contrast, it also clearly shows why 7 K=1 0.5 K=7 X1 X1 X2 X3 X4 X4 X5 X5 X6 X6 X7 0.375 X2 X3 X7 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.25 0.125 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.0 Figure 2: Decomposition of variable importances along the degrees k of interactions of one variable with the other ones. At K = 1, all I(Xm ; Y |B) are accounted for in the total importance, while at K = 7 only some of them are taken into account due to masking effects. X6 is not important: neither alone nor combined with others X6 seems to be very informative (all of its terms are close to 0). More interestingly, this ﬁgure also highlights redundancies: X7 is informative alone or conditioned with a couple of others (the ﬁrst terms are signiﬁcantly larger than 0), but becomes uninformative when conditioned with many others (the last terms are closer to 0). The right plot, for K = 7, illustrates the decomposition of importances when variables are chosen in a deterministic way. The ﬁrst thing to notice is masking effects. Some of the I(Xm ; Y |B) terms are indeed clearly never encountered and their contribution is therefore reduced to 0 in the total importance. For instance, for k = 0, the sub-importances of X2 and X5 are positive, while all others are null, which means that only those two variables are ever selected at the root node, hence masking the others. As a consequence, this also means that the importances of the remaining variables is biased and that it actually only accounts of their relevance when conditioned to X2 or X5 , but not of their relevance in other contexts. At k = 0, masking effects also amplify the contribution of I(X2 ; Y ) (resp. I(X5 ; Y )) since X2 (resp. X5 ) appears more frequently at the root node than in totally randomized trees. In addition, because nodes become pure before reaching depth p, conditioning sets of size k ≥ 4 are never actually encountered, which means that we can no longer know whether variables are still informative when conditioned to many others. All in all, this ﬁgure thus indeed conﬁrms that importances as computed with non-totally randomized trees take into account only some of the conditioning sets B, hence biasing the measured importances. 7 Conclusions In this work, we made a ﬁrst step towards understanding variable importances as computed with a forest of randomized trees. In particular, we derived a theoretical characterization of the Mean Decrease Impurity importances as computed by totally randomized trees in asymptotic conditions. We showed that they offer a three-level decomposition of the information jointly provided by all input variables about the output (Section 3). We then demonstrated (Section 4) that MDI importances as computed by totally randomized trees exhibit desirable properties for assessing the relevance of a variable: it is equal to zero if and only if the variable is irrelevant and it depends only on the relevant variables. We discussed the case of Random Forests and Extra-Trees (Section 5) and ﬁnally illustrated our developments on an artiﬁcial but insightful example (Section 6). There remain several limitations to our framework that we would like address in the future. First, our results should be adapted to binary splits as used within an actual Random Forest-like algorithm. In this setting, any node t is split in only two subsets, which means that any variable may then appear one or several times within a branch, and thus should make variable importances now dependent on the cardinalities of the input variables. In the same direction, our framework should also be extended to the case of continuous variables. Finally, results presented in this work are valid in an asymptotic setting only. An important direction of future work includes the characterization of the distribution of variable importances in a ﬁnite setting. Acknowledgements.

<p>Author: Hossein Azari Soufiani, William Chen, David C. Parkes, Lirong Xia</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a class of efﬁcient Generalized Method-of-Moments (GMM) algorithms for computing parameters of the Plackett-Luce model, where the data consists of full rankings over alternatives. Our technique is based on breaking the full rankings into pairwise comparisons, and then computing parameters that satisfy a set of generalized moment conditions. We identify conditions for the output of GMM to be unique, and identify a general class of consistent and inconsistent breakings. We then show by theory and experiments that our algorithms run signiﬁcantly faster than the classical Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm, while achieving competitive statistical efﬁciency. 1</p><p>3 0.84300101 <a title="128-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Message_Passing_Inference_with_Chemical_Reaction_Networks.html">189 nips-2013-Message Passing Inference with Chemical Reaction Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nils E. Napp, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on molecular programming has explored new possibilities for computational abstractions with biomolecules, including logic gates, neural networks, and linear systems. In the future such abstractions might enable nanoscale devices that can sense and control the world at a molecular scale. Just as in macroscale robotics, it is critical that such devices can learn about their environment and reason under uncertainty. At this small scale, systems are typically modeled as chemical reaction networks. In this work, we develop a procedure that can take arbitrary probabilistic graphical models, represented as factor graphs over discrete random variables, and compile them into chemical reaction networks that implement inference. In particular, we show that marginalization based on sum-product message passing can be implemented in terms of reactions between chemical species whose concentrations represent probabilities. We show algebraically that the steady state concentration of these species correspond to the marginal distributions of the random variables in the graph and validate the results in simulations. As with standard sum-product inference, this procedure yields exact results for tree-structured graphs, and approximate solutions for loopy graphs.</p><p>4 0.80520111 <a title="128-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Projected_Natural_Actor-Critic.html">257 nips-2013-Projected Natural Actor-Critic</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas, William C. Dabney, Stephen Giguere, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: Natural actor-critics form a popular class of policy search algorithms for ﬁnding locally optimal policies for Markov decision processes. In this paper we address a drawback of natural actor-critics that limits their real-world applicability—their lack of safety guarantees. We present a principled algorithm for performing natural gradient descent over a constrained domain. In the context of reinforcement learning, this allows for natural actor-critic algorithms that are guaranteed to remain within a known safe region of policy space. While deriving our class of constrained natural actor-critic algorithms, which we call Projected Natural ActorCritics (PNACs), we also elucidate the relationship between natural gradient descent and mirror descent. 1</p><p>5 0.76809627 <a title="128-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Optimal_Algorithms_for_Unconstrained_Linear_Optimization.html">191 nips-2013-Minimax Optimal Algorithms for Unconstrained Linear Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan McMahan, Jacob Abernethy</p><p>Abstract: We design and analyze minimax-optimal algorithms for online linear optimization games where the player’s choice is unconstrained. The player strives to minimize regret, the difference between his loss and the loss of a post-hoc benchmark strategy. While the standard benchmark is the loss of the best strategy chosen from a bounded comparator set, we consider a very broad range of benchmark functions. The problem is cast as a sequential multi-stage zero-sum game, and we give a thorough analysis of the minimax behavior of the game, providing characterizations for the value of the game, as well as both the player’s and the adversary’s optimal strategy. We show how these objects can be computed efﬁciently under certain circumstances, and by selecting an appropriate benchmark, we construct a novel hedging strategy for an unconstrained betting game. 1</p><p>6 0.74324775 <a title="128-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Online_Experimental_Design_for_Mapping_Neural_Microcircuits.html">49 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Online Experimental Design for Mapping Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem are often categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. As our ﬁrst main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD(λ)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of softgreedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward an optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations (either in state estimation or in value function representation), the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality. 1</p><p>3 0.33534601 <a title="79-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>4 0.28530422 <a title="79-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimizing_Instructional_Policies.html">241 nips-2013-Optimizing Instructional Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Lindsey, Michael Mozer, William J. Huggins, Harold Pashler</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists are interested in developing instructional policies that boost student learning. An instructional policy speciﬁes the manner and content of instruction. For example, in the domain of concept learning, a policy might specify the nature of exemplars chosen over a training sequence. Traditional psychological studies compare several hand-selected policies, e.g., contrasting a policy that selects only diﬃcult-to-classify exemplars with a policy that gradually progresses over the training sequence from easy exemplars to more diﬃcult (known as fading). We propose an alternative to the traditional methodology in which we deﬁne a parameterized space of policies and search this space to identify the optimal policy. For example, in concept learning, policies might be described by a fading function that speciﬁes exemplar diﬃculty over time. We propose an experimental technique for searching policy spaces using Gaussian process surrogate-based optimization and a generative model of student performance. Instead of evaluating a few experimental conditions each with many human subjects, as the traditional methodology does, our technique evaluates many experimental conditions each with a few subjects. Even though individual subjects provide only a noisy estimate of the population mean, the optimization method allows us to determine the shape of the policy space and to identify the global optimum, and is as eﬃcient in its subject budget as a traditional A-B comparison. We evaluate the method via two behavioral studies, and suggest that the method has broad applicability to optimization problems involving humans outside the educational arena. 1</p><p>5 0.26671454 <a title="79-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Variational_Policy_Search_via_Trajectory_Optimization.html">348 nips-2013-Variational Policy Search via Trajectory Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Levine, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: In order to learn effective control policies for dynamical systems, policy search methods must be able to discover successful executions of the desired task. While random exploration can work well in simple domains, complex and highdimensional tasks present a serious challenge, particularly when combined with high-dimensional policies that make parameter-space exploration infeasible. We present a method that uses trajectory optimization as a powerful exploration strategy that guides the policy search. A variational decomposition of a maximum likelihood policy objective allows us to use standard trajectory optimization algorithms such as differential dynamic programming, interleaved with standard supervised learning for the policy itself. We demonstrate that the resulting algorithm can outperform prior methods on two challenging locomotion tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.26372138 <a title="79-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Point_Based_Value_Iteration_with_Optimal_Belief_Compression_for_Dec-POMDPs.html">248 nips-2013-Point Based Value Iteration with Optimal Belief Compression for Dec-POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Aswin Raghavan, Roni Khardon, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. Our ﬁrst contribution is a symbolic implementation of Modiﬁed Policy Iteration (MPI) for factored actions that views policy evaluation as policy-constrained value iteration (VI). Unfortunately, a na¨ve approach ı to enforce policy constraints can lead to large memory requirements, sometimes making symbolic MPI worse than VI. We address this through our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent algorithm lying between VI and MPI, that applies policy constraints if it does not increase the size of the value function representation, and otherwise performs VI backups. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners. 1</p><p>3 0.82657278 <a title="79-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_Finally_Performs_Well_in_the_Game_of_Tetris.html">38 nips-2013-Approximate Dynamic Programming Finally Performs Well in the Game of Tetris</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Bruno Scherrer</p><p>Abstract: Tetris is a video game that has been widely used as a benchmark for various optimization techniques including approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithms. A look at the literature of this game shows that while ADP algorithms that have been (almost) entirely based on approximating the value function (value function based) have performed poorly in Tetris, the methods that search directly in the space of policies by learning the policy parameters using an optimization black box, such as the cross entropy (CE) method, have achieved the best reported results. This makes us conjecture that Tetris is a game in which good policies are easier to represent, and thus, learn than their corresponding value functions. So, in order to obtain a good performance with ADP, we should use ADP algorithms that search in a policy space, instead of the more traditional ones that search in a value function space. In this paper, we put our conjecture to test by applying such an ADP algorithm, called classiﬁcation-based modiﬁed policy iteration (CBMPI), to the game of Tetris. Our experimental results show that for the ﬁrst time an ADP algorithm, namely CBMPI, obtains the best results reported in the literature for Tetris in both small 10 × 10 and large 10 × 20 boards. Although the CBMPI’s results are similar to those of the CE method in the large board, CBMPI uses considerably fewer (almost 1/6) samples (calls to the generative model) than CE. 1</p><p>4 0.8106454 <a title="79-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandros Paraschos, Christian Daniel, January Peters, Gerhard Neumann</p><p>Abstract: Movement Primitives (MP) are a well-established approach for representing modular and re-usable robot movement generators. Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83573824 <a title="79-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-DESPOT%3A_Online_POMDP_Planning_with_Regularization.html">79 nips-2013-DESPOT: Online POMDP Planning with Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Adhiraj Somani, Nan Ye, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee</p><p>Abstract: POMDPs provide a principled framework for planning under uncertainty, but are computationally intractable, due to the “curse of dimensionality” and the “curse of history”. This paper presents an online POMDP algorithm that alleviates these difﬁculties by focusing the search on a set of randomly sampled scenarios. A Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT) compactly captures the execution of all policies on these scenarios. Our Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT) algorithm searches the DESPOT for a policy, while optimally balancing the size of the policy and its estimated value obtained under the sampled scenarios. We give an output-sensitive performance bound for all policies derived from a DESPOT, and show that R-DESPOT works well if a small optimal policy exists. We also give an anytime algorithm that approximates R-DESPOT. Experiments show strong results, compared with two of the fastest online POMDP algorithms.

<p>Author: Xiaoxiao Guo, Satinder Singh, Richard L. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: We consider how to transfer knowledge from previous tasks (MDPs) to a current task in long-lived and bounded agents that must solve a sequence of tasks over a ﬁnite lifetime. A novel aspect of our transfer approach is that we reuse reward functions. While this may seem counterintuitive, we build on the insight of recent work on the optimal rewards problem that guiding an agent’s behavior with reward functions other than the task-specifying reward function can help overcome computational bounds of the agent. Speciﬁcally, we use good guidance reward functions learned on previous tasks in the sequence to incrementally train a reward mapping function that maps task-specifying reward functions into good initial guidance reward functions for subsequent tasks. We demonstrate that our approach can substantially improve the agent’s performance relative to other approaches, including an approach that transfers policies. 1</p><p>4 0.77264076 <a title="79-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_Influence_Estimation_in_Continuous-Time_Diffusion_Networks.html">288 nips-2013-Scalable Influence Estimation in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: If a piece of information is released from a media site, can we predict whether it may spread to one million web pages, in a month ? This inﬂuence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for inﬂuence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the inﬂuence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of using n = O(1/ 2 ) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy inﬂuence maximization approach, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd a set of C nodes with the inﬂuence of at least (1 − 1/e) OPT −2C , where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while signiﬁcantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated inﬂuence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the inﬂuence. 1</p><p>5 0.77262962 <a title="79-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Graphical_Models_for_Inference_with_Missing_Data.html">134 nips-2013-Graphical Models for Inference with Missing Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Karthika Mohan, Judea Pearl, Jin Tian</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of recoverability i.e. deciding whether there exists a consistent estimator of a given relation Q, when data are missing not at random. We employ a formal representation called ‘Missingness Graphs’ to explicitly portray the causal mechanisms responsible for missingness and to encode dependencies between these mechanisms and the variables being measured. Using this representation, we derive conditions that the graph should satisfy to ensure recoverability and devise algorithms to detect the presence of these conditions in the graph. 1</p><p>6 0.77240139 <a title="79-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Policy_Shaping%3A_Integrating_Human_Feedback_with_Reinforcement_Learning.html">250 nips-2013-Policy Shaping: Integrating Human Feedback with Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

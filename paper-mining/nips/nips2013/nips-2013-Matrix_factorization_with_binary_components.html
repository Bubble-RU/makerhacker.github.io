<p>Author: Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We study low rank matrix and tensor completion and propose novel algorithms that employ adaptive sampling schemes to obtain strong performance guarantees. Our algorithms exploit adaptivity to identify entries that are highly informative for learning the column space of the matrix (tensor) and consequently, our results hold even when the row space is highly coherent, in contrast with previous analyses. In the absence of noise, we show that one can exactly recover a n ⇥ n matrix of rank r from merely ⌦(nr3/2 log(r)) matrix entries. We also show that one can recover an order T tensor using ⌦(nrT 1/2 T 2 log(r)) entries. For noisy recovery, our algorithm consistently estimates a low rank matrix corrupted with noise using ⌦(nr3/2 polylog(n)) entries. We complement our study with simulations that verify our theory and demonstrate the scalability of our algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.085972674 <a title="186-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Dirty_Statistical_Models.html">91 nips-2013-Dirty Statistical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Eunho Yang, Pradeep Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We provide a uniﬁed framework for the high-dimensional analysis of “superposition-structured” or “dirty” statistical models: where the model parameters are a superposition of structurally constrained parameters. We allow for any number and types of structures, and any statistical model. We consider the general class of M -estimators that minimize the sum of any loss function, and an instance of what we call a “hybrid” regularization, that is the inﬁmal convolution of weighted regularization functions, one for each structural component. We provide corollaries showcasing our uniﬁed framework for varied statistical models such as linear regression, multiple regression and principal component analysis, over varied superposition structures. 1</p><p>4 0.084320322 <a title="186-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_Completion_From_any_Given_Set_of_Observations.html">185 nips-2013-Matrix Completion From any Given Set of Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Troy Lee, Adi Shraibman</p><p>Abstract: In the matrix completion problem the aim is to recover an unknown real matrix from a subset of its entries. This problem comes up in many application areas, and has received a great deal of attention in the context of the netﬂix prize. A central approach to this problem is to output a matrix of lowest possible complexity (e.g. rank or trace norm) that agrees with the partially speciﬁed matrix. The performance of this approach under the assumption that the revealed entries are sampled randomly has received considerable attention (e.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]). In practice, often the set of revealed entries is not chosen at random and these results do not apply. We are therefore left with no guarantees on the performance of the algorithm we are using. We present a means to obtain performance guarantees with respect to any set of initial observations. The ﬁrst step remains the same: ﬁnd a matrix of lowest possible complexity that agrees with the partially speciﬁed matrix. We give a new way to interpret the output of this algorithm by next ﬁnding a probability distribution over the non-revealed entries with respect to which a bound on the generalization error can be proven. The more complex the set of revealed entries according to a certain measure, the better the bound on the generalization error. 1</p><p>5 0.082697563 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-Optimal_Entrywise_Sampling_for_Data_Matrices.html">206 nips-2013-Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling for Data Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Dimitris Achlioptas, Zohar S. Karnin, Edo Liberty</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of selecting non-zero entries of a matrix A in order to produce a sparse sketch of it, B, that minimizes A B 2 . For large m n matrices, such that n m (for example, representing n observations over m attributes) we give sampling distributions that exhibit four important properties. First, they have closed forms computable from minimal information regarding A. Second, they allow sketching of matrices whose non-zeros are presented to the algorithm in arbitrary order as a stream, with O 1 computation per non-zero. Third, the resulting sketch matrices are not only sparse, but their non-zero entries are highly compressible. Lastly, and most importantly, under mild assumptions, our distributions are provably competitive with the optimal ofﬂine distribution. Note that the probabilities in the optimal ofﬂine distribution may be complex functions of all the entries in the matrix. Therefore, regardless of computational complexity, the optimal distribution might be impossible to compute in the streaming model. 1</p><p>6 0.080949366 <a title="186-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-What_do_row_and_column_marginals_reveal_about_your_dataset%3F.html">352 nips-2013-What do row and column marginals reveal about your dataset?</a></p>

<p>Author: Behzad Golshan, John Byers, Evimaria Terzi</p><p>Abstract: Numerous datasets ranging from group memberships within social networks to purchase histories on e-commerce sites are represented by binary matrices. While this data is often either proprietary or sensitive, aggregated data, notably row and column marginals, is often viewed as much less sensitive, and may be furnished for analysis. Here, we investigate how these data can be exploited to make inferences about the underlying matrix H. Instead of assuming a generative model for H, we view the input marginals as constraints on the dataspace of possible realizations of H and compute the probability density function of particular entries H(i, j) of interest. We do this for all the cells of H simultaneously, without generating realizations, but rather via implicitly sampling the datasets that satisfy the input marginals. The end result is an efﬁcient algorithm with asymptotic running time the same as that required by standard sampling techniques to generate a single dataset from the same dataspace. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates the efﬁciency and the efﬁcacy of our framework in multiple settings. 1</p><p>3 0.81321436 <a title="186-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-Near-Optimal_Entrywise_Sampling_for_Data_Matrices.html">206 nips-2013-Near-Optimal Entrywise Sampling for Data Matrices</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Xin Wang</p><p>Abstract: Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a popular data analysis method, the objective of which is to approximate a matrix with all nonnegative components into the product of two nonnegative matrices. In this work, we describe a new simple and efﬁcient algorithm for multi-factor nonnegative matrix factorization (mfNMF) problem that generalizes the original NMF problem to more than two factors. Furthermore, we extend the mfNMF algorithm to incorporate a regularizer based on the Dirichlet distribution to encourage the sparsity of the components of the obtained factors. Our sparse mfNMF algorithm affords a closed form and an intuitive interpretation, and is more efﬁcient in comparison with previous works that use ﬁx point iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of our algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.78851765 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_Completion_From_any_Given_Set_of_Observations.html">185 nips-2013-Matrix Completion From any Given Set of Observations</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepti Pachauri, Risi Kondor, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The problem of matching not just two, but m different sets of objects to each other arises in many contexts, including ﬁnding the correspondence between feature points across multiple images in computer vision. At present it is usually solved by matching the sets pairwise, in series. In contrast, we propose a new method, Permutation Synchronization, which ﬁnds all the matchings jointly, in one shot, via a relaxation to eigenvector decomposition. The resulting algorithm is both computationally efﬁcient, and, as we demonstrate with theoretical arguments as well as experimental results, much more stable to noise than previous methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.98375946 <a title="186-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_factorization_with_binary_components.html">186 nips-2013-Matrix factorization with binary components</a></p>

<p>Author: Isik B. Fidaner, Taylan Cemgil</p><p>Abstract: Inﬁnite mixture models are commonly used for clustering. One can sample from the posterior of mixture assignments by Monte Carlo methods or ﬁnd its maximum a posteriori solution by optimization. However, in some problems the posterior is diffuse and it is hard to interpret the sampled partitionings. In this paper, we introduce novel statistics based on block sizes for representing sample sets of partitionings and feature allocations. We develop an element-based deﬁnition of entropy to quantify segmentation among their elements. Then we propose a simple algorithm called entropy agglomeration (EA) to summarize and visualize this information. Experiments on various inﬁnite mixture posteriors as well as a feature allocation dataset demonstrate that the proposed statistics are useful in practice.</p><p>4 0.97983348 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Mapping_paradigm_ontologies_to_and_from_the_brain.html">183 nips-2013-Mapping paradigm ontologies to and from the brain</a></p>
<p>Author: Yannick Schwartz, Bertrand Thirion, Gael Varoquaux</p><p>Abstract: Imaging neuroscience links brain activation maps to behavior and cognition via correlational studies. Due to the nature of the individual experiments, based on eliciting neural response from a small number of stimuli, this link is incomplete, and unidirectional from the causal point of view. To come to conclusions on the function implied by the activation of brain regions, it is necessary to combine a wide exploration of the various brain functions and some inversion of the statistical inference. Here we introduce a methodology for accumulating knowledge towards a bidirectional link between observed brain activity and the corresponding function. We rely on a large corpus of imaging studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to ﬁnd commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus. The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus. To our knowledge, our approach is the ﬁrst demonstration of predicting the cognitive content of completely new brain images. To that end, we propose a method that predicts the experimental paradigms across different studies. 1</p><p>5 0.97434992 <a title="186-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multisensory_Encoding%2C_Decoding%2C_and_Identification.html">205 nips-2013-Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurel A. Lazar, Yevgeniy Slutskiy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive ﬁelds in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identiﬁcation of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identiﬁed. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identiﬁcation algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.96624494 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Accelerated_Mini-Batch_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">19 nips-2013-Accelerated Mini-Batch Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>

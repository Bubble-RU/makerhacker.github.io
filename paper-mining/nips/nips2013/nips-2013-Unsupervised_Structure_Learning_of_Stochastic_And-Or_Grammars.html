<p>Author: Vikash Mansinghka, Tejas D. Kulkarni, Yura N. Perov, Josh Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: The idea of computer vision as the Bayesian inverse problem to computer graphics has a long history and an appealing elegance, but it has proved difﬁcult to directly implement. Instead, most vision tasks are approached via complex bottom-up processing pipelines. Here we show that it is possible to write short, simple probabilistic graphics programs that deﬁne ﬂexible generative models and to automatically invert them to interpret real-world images. Generative probabilistic graphics programs (GPGP) consist of a stochastic scene generator, a renderer based on graphics software, a stochastic likelihood model linking the renderer’s output and the data, and latent variables that adjust the ﬁdelity of the renderer and the tolerance of the likelihood. Representations and algorithms from computer graphics are used as the deterministic backbone for highly approximate and stochastic generative models. This formulation combines probabilistic programming, computer graphics, and approximate Bayesian computation, and depends only on generalpurpose, automatic inference techniques. We describe two applications: reading sequences of degraded and adversarially obscured characters, and inferring 3D road models from vehicle-mounted camera images. Each of the probabilistic graphics programs we present relies on under 20 lines of probabilistic code, and yields accurate, approximately Bayesian inferences about real-world images. 1</p><p>3 0.040167142 <a title="343-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Modeling_Overlapping_Communities_with_Node_Popularities.html">196 nips-2013-Modeling Overlapping Communities with Node Popularities</a></p>
<p>Author: Prem Gopalan, Chong Wang, David Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach for accurate network modeling using node popularities within the framework of the mixed-membership stochastic blockmodel (MMSB). Our model integrates two basic properties of nodes in social networks: homophily and preferential connection to popular nodes. We develop a scalable algorithm for posterior inference, based on a novel nonconjugate variant of stochastic variational inference. We evaluate the link prediction accuracy of our algorithm on nine real-world networks with up to 60,000 nodes, and on simulated networks with degree distributions that follow a power law. We demonstrate that the AMP predicts signiﬁcantly better than the MMSB. 1</p><p>4 0.039503109 <a title="343-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Visual_Concept_Learning%3A_Combining_Machine_Vision_and_Bayesian_Generalization_on_Concept_Hierarchies.html">349 nips-2013-Visual Concept Learning: Combining Machine Vision and Bayesian Generalization on Concept Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Joshua T. Abbott, Joseph Austerweil, Thomas Griffiths, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Learning a visual concept from a small number of positive examples is a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Current methods typically fail to ﬁnd the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classiﬁers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a signiﬁcant advantage results from combining visual classiﬁers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization. 1</p><p>5 0.039408281 <a title="343-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Computing_the_Stationary_Distribution_Locally.html">66 nips-2013-Computing the Stationary Distribution Locally</a></p>
<p>Author: Christina E. Lee, Asuman Ozdaglar, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Computing the stationary distribution of a large ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite state space Markov Chain (MC) has become central in many problems such as statistical inference and network analysis. Standard methods involve large matrix multiplications as in power iteration, or simulations of long random walks, as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Power iteration is costly, as it involves computation at every state. For MCMC, it is difﬁcult to determine whether the random walks are long enough to guarantee convergence. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm that answers whether a chosen state in a MC has stationary probability larger than some ∆ ∈ (0, 1), and outputs an estimate of the stationary probability. Our algorithm is constant time, using information from a local neighborhood of the state on the graph induced by the MC, which has constant size relative to the state space. The multiplicative error of the estimate is upper bounded by a function of the mixing properties of the MC. Simulation results show MCs for which this method gives tight estimates. 1</p><p>6 0.038726509 <a title="343-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Modeling_Clutter_Perception_using_Parametric_Proto-object_Partitioning.html">195 nips-2013-Modeling Clutter Perception using Parametric Proto-object Partitioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Toby Sharp, Pushmeet Kohli, Sebastian Nowozin, John Winn, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Randomized decision trees and forests have a rich history in machine learning and have seen considerable success in application, perhaps particularly so for computer vision. However, they face a fundamental limitation: given enough data, the number of nodes in decision trees will grow exponentially with depth. For certain applications, for example on mobile or embedded processors, memory is a limited resource, and so the exponential growth of trees limits their depth, and thus their potential accuracy. This paper proposes decision jungles, revisiting the idea of ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and shows these to be compact and powerful discriminative models for classiﬁcation. Unlike conventional decision trees that only allow one path to every node, a DAG in a decision jungle allows multiple paths from the root to each leaf. We present and compare two new node merging algorithms that jointly optimize both the features and the structure of the DAGs efﬁciently. During training, node splitting and node merging are driven by the minimization of exactly the same objective function, here the weighted sum of entropies at the leaves. Results on varied datasets show that, compared to decision forests and several other baselines, decision jungles require dramatically less memory while considerably improving generalization. 1</p><p>4 0.59120989 <a title="343-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Efficient_Online_Inference_for_Bayesian_Nonparametric_Relational_Models.html">104 nips-2013-Efficient Online Inference for Bayesian Nonparametric Relational Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Dae Il Kim, Prem Gopalan, David Blei, Erik Sudderth</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic block models characterize observed network relationships via latent community memberships. In large social networks, we expect entities to participate in multiple communities, and the number of communities to grow with the network size. We introduce a new model for these phenomena, the hierarchical Dirichlet process relational model, which allows nodes to have mixed membership in an unbounded set of communities. To allow scalable learning, we derive an online stochastic variational inference algorithm. Focusing on assortative models of undirected networks, we also propose an efﬁcient structured mean ﬁeld variational bound, and online methods for automatically pruning unused communities. Compared to state-of-the-art online learning methods for parametric relational models, we show signiﬁcantly improved perplexity and link prediction accuracy for sparse networks with tens of thousands of nodes. We also showcase an analysis of LittleSis, a large network of who-knows-who at the heights of business and government. 1</p><p>5 0.57725674 <a title="343-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Binary_to_Bushy%3A_Bayesian_Hierarchical_Clustering_with_the_Beta_Coalescent.html">58 nips-2013-Binary to Bushy: Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering with the Beta Coalescent</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuening Hu, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Hal Daume III, Z. Irene Ying</p><p>Abstract: Discovering hierarchical regularities in data is a key problem in interacting with large datasets, modeling cognition, and encoding knowledge. A previous Bayesian solution—Kingman’s coalescent—provides a probabilistic model for data represented as a binary tree. Unfortunately, this is inappropriate for data better described by bushier trees. We generalize an existing belief propagation framework of Kingman’s coalescent to the beta coalescent, which models a wider range of tree structures. Because of the complex combinatorial search over possible structures, we develop new sampling schemes using sequential Monte Carlo and Dirichlet process mixture models, which render inference efﬁcient and tractable. We present results on synthetic and real data that show the beta coalescent outperforms Kingman’s coalescent and is qualitatively better at capturing data in bushy hierarchies. 1 The Need For Bushy Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental data analysis problem: given observations, what hierarchical grouping of those observations effectively encodes the similarities between observations? This is a critical task for understanding and describing observations in many domains [1, 2], including natural language processing [3], computer vision [4], and network analysis [5]. In all of these cases, natural and intuitive hierarchies are not binary but are instead bushy, with more than two children per parent node. Our goal is to provide efﬁcient algorithms to discover bushy hierarchies. We review existing nonparametric probabilistic clustering algorithms in Section 2, with particular focus on Kingman’s coalescent [6] and its generalization, the beta coalescent [7, 8]. While Kingman’s coalescent has attractive properties—it is probabilistic and has edge “lengths” that encode how similar clusters are—it only produces binary trees. The beta coalescent (Section 3) does not have this restriction. However, na¨ve inference is impractical, because bushy trees are more complex: we need ı to consider all possible subsets of nodes to construct each internal nodes in the hierarchy. Our ﬁrst contribution is a generalization of the belief propagation framework [9] for beta coalescent to compute the joint probability of observations and trees (Section 3). After describing sequential Monte Carlo posterior inference for the beta coalescent, we develop efﬁcient inference strategies in Section 4, where we use proposal distributions that draw on the connection between Dirichlet processes—a ubiquitous Bayesian nonparametric tool for non-hierarchical clustering—and hierarchical coalescents to make inference tractable. We present results on both synthetic and real data that show the beta coalescent captures bushy hierarchies and outperforms Kingman’s coalescent (Section 5). 2 Bayesian Clustering Approaches Recent hierarchical clustering techniques have been incorporated inside statistical models; this requires formulating clustering as a statistical—often Bayesian—problem. Heller et al. [10] build 1 binary trees based on the marginal likelihoods, extended by Blundell et al. [11] to trees with arbitrary branching structure. Ryan et al. [12] propose a tree-structured stick-breaking process to generate trees with unbounded width and depth, which supports data observations at leaves and internal nodes.1 However, these models do not distinguish edge lengths, an important property in distinguishing how “tight” the clustering is at particular nodes. Hierarchical models can be divided into complementary “fragmentation” and “coagulation” frameworks [7]. Both produce hierarchical partitions of a dataset. Fragmentation models start with a single partition and divide it into ever more speciﬁc partitions until only singleton partitions remain. Coagulation frameworks repeatedly merge singleton partitions until only one partition remains. Pitman-Yor diffusion trees [13], a generalization of Dirichlet diffusion trees [14], are an example of a bushy fragmentation model, and they model edge lengths and build non-binary trees. Instead, our focus is on bottom-up coalescent models [8], one of the coagulation models and complementary to diffusion trees, which can also discover hierarchies and edge lengths. In this model, n nodes are observed (we use both observed to emphasize that nodes are known and leaves to emphasize topology). These observed nodes are generated through some unknown tree with latent edges and unobserved internal nodes. Each node (both observed and latent) has a single parent. The convention in such models is to assume our observed nodes come at time t = 0, and at time −∞ all nodes share a common ur-parent through some sequence of intermediate parents. Consider a set of n individuals observed at the present (time t = 0). All individuals start in one of n singleton sets. After time ti , a set of these nodes coalesce into a new node. Once a set merges, their parent replaces the original nodes. This is called a coalescent event. This process repeats until there is only one node left, and a complete tree structure π (Figure 1) is obtained. Different coalescents are deﬁned by different probabilities of merging a set of nodes. This is called the coalescent rate, deﬁned by a general family of coalescents: the lambda coalescent [7, 15]. We represent the rate via the symbol λk , the rate at which k out of n nodes merge into a parent node. n From a collection of n nodes, k ≤ n can coalesce at some coalescent event (k can be different for different coalescent events). The rate of a fraction γ of the nodes coalescing is given by γ −2 Λ(dγ), where Λ(dγ) is a ﬁnite measure on [0, 1]. So k nodes merge at rate 1 λk = n γ k−2 (1 − γ)n−k Λ(dγ) (2 ≤ k ≤ n). (1) 0 Choosing different measures yields different coalescents. A degenerate Dirac delta measure at 0 results in Kingman’s coalescent [6], where λk is 1 when k = 2 and zero otherwise. Because this n gives zero probability to non-binary coalescent events, this only creates binary trees. Alternatively, using a beta distribution BETA(2 − α, α) as the measure Λ yields the beta coalescent. When α is closer to 1, the tree is bushier; as α approaches 2, it becomes Kingman’s coalescent. If we have ni−1 nodes at time ti−1 in a beta coalescent, the rate λkii−1 for a children set of ki nodes at time n ti and the total rate λni−1 of any children set merging—summing over all possible mergers—is λkii−1 = n Γ(ki − α)Γ(ni−1 − ki + α) and λni−1 = Γ(2 − α)Γ(α)Γ(ni−1 ) ni−1 ni−1 ki λkii−1 . n (2) ki =2 Each coalescent event also has an edge length—duration—δi . The duration of an event comes from an exponential distribution, δi ∼ exp(λni−1 ), and the parent node forms at time ti = ti−1 − δi . Shorter durations mean that the children more closely resemble their parent (the mathematical basis for similarity is speciﬁed by a transition kernel, Section 3). Analogous to Kingman’s coalescent, the prior probability of a complete tree π is the product of all of its constituent coalescent events i = 1, . . . m, merging ki children after duration δi , m m λkii−1 · exp(−λni−1 δi ). n p(ki |ni−1 ) · p(δi |ki , ni−1 ) = p(π) = i=1 Merge ki nodes After duration δi (3) i=1 1 This is appropriate where the entirety of a population is known—both ancestors and descendants. We focus on the case where only the descendants are known. For a concrete example, see Section 5.2. 2 Algorithm 1 MCMC inference for generating a tree 1: for Particle s = 1, 2, · · · , S do s 2: Initialize ns = n, i = 0, ts = 0, w0 = 1. 0 s 3: Initialize the node set V = {ρ0 , ρ1 , · · · , ρn }. 4: while ∃s ∈ {1 · · · S} where ns > 1 do 5: Update i = i + 1. 6: for Particle s = 1, 2, · · · , S do (a) Kingman’s coalescent 7: if ns == 1 then 8: Continue. s 9: Propose a duration δi by Equation 10. s 10: Set coalescent time ts = ts − δi . i i−1 11: Sample partitions ps from DPMM. i s 12: Propose a set ρci according to Equation 11. s 13: Update weight wi by Equation 13. s s s 14: Update n = n − |ρci | + 1. s (b) the beta coalescent 15: Remove ρci from V s , add ρs to V s . i 16: Compute effective sample size ESS [16].

In real clustering applications, we also care about a node’s children and features. In this section, we deﬁne the nodes and their features, and then review how we use message passing to compute the probabilities of trees. An internal node ρi is deﬁned as the merger of other nodes. The children set of node ρi , ρci , coalesces into a new node ρi ≡ ∪b∈ci ρb . This encodes the identity of the nodes that participate in speciﬁc coalescent events; Equation 3, in contrast, only considers the number of nodes involved in an event. In addition, each node is associated with a multidimensional feature vector yi . Two terms specify the relationship between nodes’ features: an initial distribution p0 (yi ) and a transition kernel κti tb (yi , yb ). The initial distribution can be viewed as a prior or regularizer for feature representations. The transition kernel encourages a child’s feature yb (at time tb ) to resemble feature yi (formed at ti ); shorter durations tb − ti increase the resemblance. Intuitively, the transition kernel can be thought as a similarity score; the more similar the features are, the more likely nodes are. For Brownian diffusion (discussed in Section 4.3), the transition kernel follows a Gaussian distribution centered at a feature. The covariance matrix Σ is decided by the mutation rate µ [18, 9], the probability of a mutation in an individual. Different kernels (e.g., multinomial, tree kernels) can be applied depending on modeling assumptions of the feature representations. To compute the probability of the beta coalescent tree π and observed data x, we generalize the belief propagation framework used by Teh et al. [9] for Kingman’s coalescent; this is a more scalable alternative to other approaches for computing the probability of a Beta coalescent tree [19]. We deﬁne a subtree structure θi = {θi−1 , δi , ρci }, thus the tree θm after the ﬁnal coalescent event m is a complete tree π. The message for node ρi marginalizes over the features of the nodes in its children set.2 The total message for a parent node ρi is −1 Mρi (yi ) = Zρi (x|θi ) κti tb (yi , yb )Mρb (yb )dyb . (4) b∈ci where Zρi (x|θi ) is the local normalizer, which can be computed as the combination of initial distribution and messages from a set of children, Zρi (x|θi ) = p0 (yi ) κti tb (yi , yb )Mρb (yb )dyb dyi . b∈ci 2 When ρb is a leaf, the message Mρb (yb ) is a delta function centered on the observation. 3 (5) Recursively performing this marginalization through message passing provides the joint probability of a complete tree π and the observations x. At the root, Z−∞ (x|θm ) = p0 (y−∞ )κ−∞,tm (y−∞ , ym )Mρm (ym )dym dy−∞ (6) where p0 (y−∞ ) is the initial feature distribution and m is the number of coalescent events. This gives the marginal probability of the whole tree, m p(x|π) = Z−∞ (x|θm ) Zρi (x|θi ), (7) i=1 The joint probability of a tree π combines the prior (Equation 3) and likelihood (Equation 7), m λkii−1 exp(−λni−1 δi ) · Zρi (x|θi ). n p(x, π) = Z−∞ (x|θm ) (8) i=1 3.1 Sequential Monte Carlo Inference Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)—often called particle ﬁlters—estimates a structured sequence of hidden variables based on observations [20]. For coalescent models, this estimates the posterior distribution over tree structures given observations x. Initially (i = 0) each observation is in a singleton cluster;3 in subsequent particles (i > 0), points coalesce into more complicated tree s structures θi , where s is the particle index and we add superscript s to all the related notations to distinguish between particles. We use sequential importance resampling [21, SIR] to weight each s particle s at time ti , denoted as wi . The weights from SIR approximate the posterior. Computing the weights requires a conditional distris s s bution of data given a latent state p(x|θi ), a transition distribution between latent states p(θi |θi−1 ), s s and a proposal distribution f (θi |θi−1 , x). Together, these distributions deﬁne weights s s wi = wi−1 s s s p(x | θi )p(θi | θi−1 ) . s s f (θi | θi−1 , x) (9) Then we can approximate the posterior distribution of the hidden structure using the normalized weights, which become more accurate with more particles. To apply SIR inference to belief propagation with the beta coalescent prior, we ﬁrst deﬁne the particle s space structure. The sth particle represents a subtree θi−1 at time ts , and a transition to a new i−1 s s s s subtree θi takes a set of nodes ρci from θi−1 , and merges them at ts , where ts = ts − δi and i i i−1 s s s s s θi = {θi−1 , δi , ρci }. Our proposal distribution must provide the duration δi and the children set ρsi c s to merge based on the previous subtree θi−1 . s We propose the duration δi from the prior exponential distribution and propose a children set from the posterior distribution based on the local normalizers. 4 This is the “priorpost” method in Teh et al. [9]. However, this approach is intractable. Given ni−1 nodes at time ti , we must consider all possible n children sets ni−1 + ni−1 + · · · + ni−1 . The computational complexity grows from O(n2 ) i−1 i−1 2 3 ni−1 (Kingman’s coalescent) to O(2 ) (beta coalescent). 4 Efﬁciently Finding Children Sets with DPMM We need a more efﬁcient way to consider possible children sets. Even for Kingman’s coalescent, which only considers pairs of nodes, Gorur et al. [22] do not exhaustively consider all pairs. Instead, they use data structures from computational geometry to select the R closest pairs as their restriction set, reducing inference to O(n log n). While ﬁnding closest pairs is a traditional problem in computational geometry, discovering arbitrary-sized sets is less studied. 3 The relationship between time and particles is non-intuitive. Time t goes backward with subsequent particles. When we use time-speciﬁc adjectives for particles, this is with respect to inference. 4 This is a special case of Section 4.2’s algorithm, where the restriction set Ωi is all possible subsets. 4 In this section, we describe how we use a Dirichlet process mixture model [23, DPMM] to discover a restriction set Ω, integrating DPMMs into the SMC proposal. We ﬁrst brieﬂy review what DPMMs are, describe why they are attractive, and then describe how we incorporate DPMMs in SMC inference. The DPMM is deﬁned by a concentration β and a base distribution G0 . A distribution over mixtures is drawn from a Dirichlet process (DP): G ∼ DP(β, G0 ). Each observation xi is assigned to a mixture component µi drawn from G. Because the Dirichlet process is a discrete distribution, observations i and j can have the same mixture component (µi = µj ). When this happens, points are said to be in the same partition. Posterior inference can discover a distribution over partitions. A full derivation of these sampling equations appears in the supplemental material. 4.1 Attractive Properties of DPMMs DPMM s and Coalescents Berestycki et al. [8] showed that the distribution over partitions in a Dirichlet process is equivalent to the distribution over coalescents’ allelic partitions—the set of members that have the same feature representation—when the mutation rate µ of the associated kernel is half of the Dirichlet concentration β (Section 3). For Brownian diffusion, we can connect DPMM with coalescents by setting the kernel covariance Σ = µI to Σ = β/2I. The base distribution G0 is also related with nodes’ feature. The base distribution G0 of a Dirichlet process generates the probability measure G for each block, which generates the nodes in a block. As a result, we can select a base distribution which ﬁts the distribution of the samples in coalescent process. For example, if we use Gaussian distribution for the transition kernel and prior, a Gaussian is also appropriate as the DPMM base distribution. Effectiveness as a Proposal The necessary condition for a valid proposal [24] is that it should have support on a superset of the true posterior. In our case, the distribution over partitions provided by the DPMM considers all possible children sets that could be merged in the coalescent. Thus the new proposal with DPMM satisﬁes this requirement, and it is a valid proposal. In addition, Chen [25] gives a set of desirable criteria for a good proposal distribution: accounts for outliers, considers the likelihood, and lies close to the true posterior. The DPMM fulﬁlls these criteria. First, the DPMM provides a distribution over all partitions. Varying the concentration parameter β can control the length of the tail of the distribution over partitions. Second, choosing the base distribution of the DPMM appropriately models the feature likelihood; i.e., ensuring the DPMM places similar nodes together in a partition with high probability. Third, the DPMM qualitatively provides reasonable children sets when compared with exhaustively considering all children sets (Figure 2(c)). 4.2 Incorporating DPMM in SMC Proposals To address the inference intractability in Section 3.1, we use the DPMM to obtain a distribution over partitions of nodes. Each partition contains clusters of nodes, and we take a union over all partitions to create a restriction set Ωi = {ωi1 , ωi2 , · · · }, where each ωij is a subset of the ni−1 nodes. A standard Gibbs sampler provides these partitions (see supplemental). s With this restriction set Ωi , we propose the duration time δi from the exponential distribution and s propose a children set ρci based on the local normalizers s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρsi ) c s s s s s s · I ρci ∈ Ωs , (11) fi (ρci |δi , θi−1 ) = fi (δi ) = λs i−1 exp(−λs i−1 δi ) (10) i n n Z0 s where Ωs restricts the candidate children sets, I is the indicator, and we replace Zρi (x|θi ) with i s s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρci ) since they are equivalent here. The normalizer is Z0 = ρc s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ) · I [ρc ∈ Ωs ] = i ρc ∈Ωs i s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ). (12) Applying the true distribution (the ith multiplicand from Equation 8) and the proposal distribution (Equation 10 and Equation 11) to the SIR weight update (Equation 9), |ρs | c s s wi = wi−1 i λni−1 · ρc ∈Ωs i s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ) λs i−1 n 5 , (13) |ρs | c s i where |ρsi | is the size of children set ρci ; parameter λni−1 is the rate of the children set ρsi (Equac c s tion 2); and λni−1 is the rate of all possible sets given a total number of nodes ni−1 (Equation 2). We can view this new proposal as a coarse-to-ﬁne process: DPMM proposes candidate children sets; SMC selects a children set from DPMM to coalesce. Since the coarse step is faster and ﬁlters “bad” children sets, the slower ﬁner step considers fewer children sets, saving computation time (Algorithm 1). If Ωi has all children sets, it recovers exhaustive SMC. We estimate the effective sample size [16] and resample [17] when needed. For smaller sets, the DPMM is sometimes impractical (and only provides singleton clusters). In such cases it is simpler to enumerate all children sets. 4.3 Example Transition Kernel: Brownian Diffusion This section uses Brownian diffusion as an example for message passing framework. The initial distribution p0 (y) of each node is N (0, ∞); the transition kernel κti tb (y, ·) is a Gaussian centered at y with variance (ti − tb )Σ, where Σ = µI, µ = β/2, β is the concentration parameter of DPMM. Then the local normalizer Zρi (x|θi ) is Zρi (x|θi ) = N (yi ; 0, ∞) b∈ci N (yi ; yb , Σ(vρb + tb − ti ))dyi , ˆ (14) and the node message Mρi (yi ) is normally distributed Mρi (yi ) ∼ N (yi ; yρi , Σvρi ), where ˆ vρi = 5 b∈ci (vρb + tb − ti )−1 −1 , yρi = ˆ b∈ci yρb ˆ vρ b + t b − t i vρ i . Experiments: Finding Bushy Trees In this section, we compare trees built by the beta coalescent (beta) against those built by Kingman’s coalescent (kingman) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering [26, hac] on both synthetic and real data. We show beta performs best and can capture data in more interpretable, bushier trees. Setup The parameter α for the beta coalescent is between 1 and 2. The closer α is to 1, bushier the tree is, and we set α = 1.2.5 We set the mutation rate as 1, thus the DPMM parameter is initialized as β = 2, and updated using slice sampling [27]. All experiments use 100 initial iterations of DPMM inference with 30 more iterations after each coalescent event (forming a new particle). Metrics We use three metrics to evaluate the quality of the trees discovered by our algorithm: purity, subtree and path length. The dendrogram purity score [28, 10] measures how well the leaves in a subtree belong to the same class. For any two leaf nodes, we ﬁnd the least common subsumer node s and—for the subtree rooted at s—measure the fraction of leaves with same class labels. The subtree score [9] is the ratio between the number of internal nodes with all children in the same class and the total number of internal nodes. The path length score is the average difference—over all pairs—of the lowest common subsumer distance between the true tree and the generated tree, where the lowest common subsumer distance is the distance between the root and the lowest common subsumer of two nodes. For purity and subtree, higher is better, while for length, lower is better. Scores are in expectation over particles and averaged across chains. 5.1 Synthetic Hierarchies To test our inference method, we generated synthetic data with edge length (full details available in the supplemental material); we also assume each child of the root has a unique label and the descendants also have the same label as their parent node (except the root node). We compared beta against kingman and hac by varying the number of observations (Figure 2(a)) and feature dimensions (Figure 2(b)). In both cases, beta is comparable to kingman and hac (no edge length). While increasing the feature dimension improves both scores, more observations do not: for synthetic data, a small number of observations sufﬁce to construct a good tree. 5 With DPMM proposals, α has a negligible effect, so we elide further analysis for different α values. 6 0.8 0.6 beta hac kingman 0.4 0.8 0.6 beta hac kingman 8 60 80 100 beta kingman length Number of Observations Scores 0.6 beta kingman 0.4 0.2 0.0 4 6 length Dimension 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 20 40 60 80 100 0.6 beta 2 4 6 length Dimension 0.6 8 enum beta 10 enum 0.4 0.2 0.0 2 Number of Observations (a) Increasing observations 0.8 0.4 2 Scores 40 1.0 10 0.4 20 Scores purity 1.0 Scores purity Scores Scores purity 1.0 4 6 8 Dimension (b) Increasing dimension 10 2 4 6 8 10 Dimension (c) beta v.s. enum Figure 2: Figure 2(a) and 2(b) show the effect of changing the underlying data size or number of dimension. Figure 2(c) shows that our DPMM proposal for children sets is comparable to an exhaustive enumeration of all possible children sets (enum). To evaluate the effectiveness of using our DPMM as a proposal distribution, we compare exhaustively enumerating all children set candidates (enum) while keeping the SMC otherwise unchanged; this experiment uses ten data points (enum is completely intractable on larger data). Beta uses the DPMM and achieved similar accuracy (Figure 2(c)) while greatly improving efﬁciency. 5.2 Human Tissue Development Our ﬁrst real dataset is based on the developmental biology of human tissues. As a human develops, tissues specialize, starting from three embryonic germ layers: the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. These eventually form all human tissues. For example, one developmental pathway is ectoderm → neural crest → cranial neural crest → optic vesicle → cornea. Because each germ layer specializes into many different types of cells at speciﬁc times, it is inappropriate to model this development as a binary tree, or with clustering models lacking path lengths. Historically, uncovering these specialization pathways is a painstaking process, requiring inspection of embryos at many stages of development; however, massively parallel sequencing data make it possible to efﬁciently form developmental hypotheses based on similar patterns of gene expression. To investigate this question we use the transcriptome of 27 tissues with known, unambiguous, time-speciﬁc lineages [29]. We reduce the original 182727 dimensions via principle component analysis [30, PCA]. We use ﬁve chains with ﬁve particles per chain. Using reference developmental trees, beta performs better on all three scores (Table 1) because beta builds up a bushy hierarchy more similar to the true tree. The tree recovered by beta (Figure 3) reﬂects human development. The ﬁrst major differentiation is the division of embryonic cells into three layers of tissue: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. These go on to form almost all adult organs and cells. The placenta (magenta), however, forms from a fourth cell type, the trophoblast; this is placed in its own cluster at the root of the tree. It also successfully captures ectodermal tissue lineage. However, mesodermic and endodermic tissues, which are highly diverse, do not cluster as well. Tissues known to secrete endocrine hormones (dashed borders) cluster together. 5.3 Clustering 20-newsgroups Data Following Heller et al. [10], we also compare the three models on 20-newsgroups,6 a multilevel hierarchy ﬁrst dividing into general areas (rec, space, and religion) before specializing into areas such as baseball or hockey.7 This true hierarchy is inset in the bottom right of Figure 4, and we assume each edge has the same length. We apply latent Dirichlet allocation [31] with 50 topics to this corpus, and use the topic distribution for each document as the document feature. We use ﬁve chains with eighty particles per chain. 6 http://qwone.com/˜jason/20Newsgroups/ 7 We use “rec.autos”, “rec.sport.baseball”, “rec.sport.hockey”, “sci.space” newsgroups but also—in contrast to Heller et al. [10]—added “soc.religion.christian”. 7 ectoderm Stomach Pancreas mesoderm placenta Placenta endoderm Bone Marrow Thyroid Colon Kidney Heart PeripheralBlood Lymphocytes Brain Hypothalamus Brain Amygdala Prostate Uterus Lung Brain Thalamus BrainCorpus Callosum Spleen Thymus Spinal Cord Brain Cerebellum BrainCaudate Nucleus Doc Label rec.sport.baseball rec.autos rec.sport.hocky sci.space soc.religion.christian Trachea Small Intestine Retina Monocytes Mammary Gland ... purity ↑ subtree ↑ length ↓ ... ... ... ... Bladder Figure 3: One sample hierarchy of human tissue from beta. Color indicates germ layer origin of tissue. Dashed border indicates secretory function.

As with the biological data, beta performs best on all scores for 20-newsgroups. Figure 4 shows a bushy tree built by beta, which mostly recovered the true hierarchy. Documents within a newsgroup merge ﬁrst, then the three “rec” groups, followed by “space” and “religion” groups. We only use topic distribution as features, so better results could be possible with more comprehensive features. 6 Conclusion This paper generalizes Bayesian hierarchical clustering, moving from Kingman’s coalescent to the beta coalescent. Our novel inference scheme based on SMC and DPMM make this generalization practical and efﬁcient. This new model provides a bushier tree, often a more realistic view of data. While we only consider real-valued vectors, which we model through the ubiquitous Gaussian, other likelihoods might be better suited to other applications. For example, for discrete data such as in natural language processing, a multinomial likelihood may be more appropriate. This is a straightforward extension of our model via other transition kernels and DPMM base distributions. Recent work uses the coalescent as a means of producing a clustering in tandem with a downstream task such as classiﬁcation [32]. Hierarchies are often taken a priori in natural language processing. Particularly for linguistic tasks, a fully statistical model like the beta coalescent that jointly learns the hierarchy and a downstream task could improve performance in dependency parsing [33] (clustering parts of speech), multilingual sentiment [34] (ﬁnding sentiment-correlated words across languages), or topic modeling [35] (ﬁnding coherent words that should co-occur in a topic).

<p>Author: Kewei Tu, Maria Pavlovskaia, Song-Chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic And-Or grammars compactly represent both compositionality and reconﬁgurability and have been used to model different types of data such as images and events. We present a uniﬁed formalization of stochastic And-Or grammars that is agnostic to the type of the data being modeled, and propose an unsupervised approach to learning the structures as well as the parameters of such grammars. Starting from a trivial initial grammar, our approach iteratively induces compositions and reconﬁgurations in a uniﬁed manner and optimizes the posterior probability of the grammar. In our empirical evaluation, we applied our approach to learning event grammars and image grammars and achieved comparable or better performance than previous approaches. 1</p><p>2 0.7113077 <a title="343-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Variance_Reduction_for_Stochastic_Gradient_Optimization.html">345 nips-2013-Variance Reduction for Stochastic Gradient Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Chong Wang, Xi Chen, Alex Smola, Eric Xing</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic gradient optimization is a class of widely used algorithms for training machine learning models. To optimize an objective, it uses the noisy gradient computed from the random data samples instead of the true gradient computed from the entire dataset. However, when the variance of the noisy gradient is large, the algorithm might spend much time bouncing around, leading to slower convergence and worse performance. In this paper, we develop a general approach of using control variate for variance reduction in stochastic gradient. Data statistics such as low-order moments (pre-computed or estimated online) is used to form the control variate. We demonstrate how to construct the control variate for two practical problems using stochastic gradient optimization. One is convex—the MAP estimation for logistic regression, and the other is non-convex—stochastic variational inference for latent Dirichlet allocation. On both problems, our approach shows faster convergence and better performance than the classical approach. 1</p><p>3 0.63652396 <a title="343-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Fast_Algorithms_for_Gaussian_Noise_Invariant_Independent_Component_Analysis.html">117 nips-2013-Fast Algorithms for Gaussian Noise Invariant Independent Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: James R. Voss, Luis Rademacher, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: The performance of standard algorithms for Independent Component Analysis quickly deteriorates under the addition of Gaussian noise. This is partially due to a common ﬁrst step that typically consists of whitening, i.e., applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and rescaling the components to have identity covariance, which is not invariant under Gaussian noise. In our paper we develop the ﬁrst practical algorithm for Independent Component Analysis that is provably invariant under Gaussian noise. The two main contributions of this work are as follows: 1. We develop and implement an efﬁcient, Gaussian noise invariant decorrelation (quasi-orthogonalization) algorithm using Hessians of the cumulant functions. 2. We propose a very simple and efﬁcient ﬁxed-point GI-ICA (Gradient Iteration ICA) algorithm, which is compatible with quasi-orthogonalization, as well as with the usual PCA-based whitening in the noiseless case. The algorithm is based on a special form of gradient iteration (different from gradient descent). We provide an analysis of our algorithm demonstrating fast convergence following from the basic properties of cumulants. We also present a number of experimental comparisons with the existing methods, showing superior results on noisy data and very competitive performance in the noiseless case. 1 Introduction and Related Works In the Blind Signal Separation setting, it is assumed that observed data is drawn from an unknown distribution. The goal is to recover the latent signals under some appropriate structural assumption. A prototypical setting is the so-called cocktail party problem: in a room, there are d people speaking simultaneously and d microphones, with each microphone capturing a superposition of the voices. The objective is to recover the speech of each individual speaker. The simplest modeling assumption is to consider each speaker as producing a signal that is a random variable independent of the others, and to take the superposition to be a linear transformation independent of time. This leads to the following formalization: We observe samples from a random vector x distributed according to the equation x = As + b + η where A is a linear mixing matrix, b ∈ Rd is a constant vector, s is a latent random vector with independent coordinates, and η is an unknown random noise independent 1 of s. For simplicity, we assume A ∈ Rd×d is square and of full rank. The latent components of s are viewed as containing the information describing the makeup of the observed signal (voices of individual speakers in the cocktail party setting). The goal of Independent Component Analysis is to approximate the matrix A in order to recover the latent signal s. In practice, most methods ignore the noise term, leaving the simpler problem of recovering the mixing matrix A when x = As is observed. Arguably the two most widely used ICA algorithms are FastICA [13] and JADE [6]. Both of these algorithms are based on a two step process: (1) The data is centered and whitened, that is, made to have identity covariance matrix. This is typically done using principal component analysis (PCA) and rescaling the appropriate components. In the noiseless case this procedure orthogonalizes and rescales the independent components and thus recovers A up to an unknown orthogonal matrix R. (2) Recover the orthogonal matrix R. Most practical ICA algorithms differ only in the second step. In FastICA, various objective functions are used to perform a projection pursuit style algorithm which recovers the columns of R one at a time. JADE uses a fourth-cumulant based technique to simultaneously recover all columns of R. Step 1 of ICA is affected by the addition of a Gaussian noise. Even if the noise is white (has a scalar times identity covariance matrix) the PCA-based whitening procedure can no longer guarantee the whitening of the underlying independent components. Hence, the second step of the process is no longer justiﬁed. This failure may be even more signiﬁcant if the noise is not white, which is likely to be the case in many practical situations. Recent theoretical developments (see, [2] and [3]) consider the case where the noise η is an arbitrary (not necessarily white) additive Gaussian variable drawn independently from s. In [2], it was observed that certain cumulant-based techniques for ICA can still be applied for the second step if the underlying signals can be orthogonalized.1 Orthogonalization of the latent signals (quasi-orthogonalization) is a signiﬁcantly less restrictive condition as it does not force the underlying signal to have identity covariance (as in whitening in the noiseless case). In the noisy setting, the usual PCA cannot achieve quasi-orthogonalization as it will whiten the mixed signal, but not the underlying components. In [3], we show how quasi-orthogonalization can be achieved in a noise-invariant way through a method based on the fourth-order cumulant tensor. However, a direct implementation of that method requires estimating the full fourth-order cumulant tensor, which is computationally challenging even in relatively low dimensions. In this paper we derive a practical version of that algorithm based on directional Hessians of the fourth univariate cumulant, thus reducing the complexity dependence on the data dimensionality from d4 to d3 , and also allowing for a fully vectorized implementation. We also develop a fast and very simple gradient iteration (not to be confused with gradient descent) algorithm, GI-ICA, which is compatible with the quasi-orthogonalization step and can be shown to have convergence of order r − 1, when implemented using a univariate cumulant of order r. For the cumulant of order four, commonly used in practical applications, we obtain cubic convergence. We show how these convergence rates follow directly from the properties of the cumulants, which sheds some light on the somewhat surprising cubic convergence seen in fourth-order based ICA methods [13, 18, 22]. The update step has complexity O(N d) where N is the number of samples, giving a total algorithmic complexity of O(N d3 ) for step 1 and O(N d2 t) for step 2, where t is the number of iterations for convergence in the gradient iteration. Interestingly, while the techniques are quite different, our gradient iteration algorithm turns out to be closely related to Fast ICA in the noiseless setting, in the case when the data is whitened and the cumulants of order three or four are used. Thus, GI-ICA can be viewed as a generalization (and a conceptual simpliﬁcation) of Fast ICA for more general quasi-orthogonalized data. We present experimental results showing superior performance in the case of data contaminated by Gaussian noise and very competitive performance for clean data. We also note that the GIICA algorithms are fast in practice, allowing us to process (decorrelate and detect the independent 1 This process of orthogonalizing the latent signals was called quasi-whitening in [2] and later in [3]. However, this conﬂicts with the deﬁnition of quasi-whitening given in [12] which requires the latent signals to be whitened. To avoid the confusion we will use the term quasi-orthogonalization for the process of orthogonalizing the latent signals. 2 components) 100 000 points in dimension 5 in well under a second on a standard desktop computer. Our Matlab implementation of GI-ICA is available for download at http://sourceforge. net/projects/giica/. Finally, we observe that our method is partially compatible with the robust cumulants introduced in [20]. We brieﬂy discuss how GI-ICA can be extended using these noise-robust techniques for ICA to reduce the impact of sparse noise. The paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss the relevant properties of cumulants, and discuss results from prior work which allows for the quasi-orthogonalization of signals with non-zero fourth cumulant. In section 3, we discuss the connection between the fourth-order cumulant tensor method for quasi-orthogonalization discussed in section 2 with Hessian-based techniques seen in [2] and [11]. We use this connection to create a more computationally efﬁcient and practically implementable version of the quasi-orthogonalization algorithm discussed in section 2. In section 4, we discuss new, fast, projection-pursuit style algorithms for the second step of ICA which are compatible with quasi-orthogonalization. In order to simplify the presentation, all algorithms are stated in an abstract form as if we have exact knowledge of required distribution parameters. Section 5 discusses the estimators of required distribution parameters to be used in practice. Section 6 discusses numerical experiments demonstrating the applicability of our techniques. Related Work. The name Independent Component Analysis refers to a broad range of algorithms addressing the blind signal separation problem as well as its variants and extensions. There is an extensive literature on ICA in the signal processing and machine learning communities due to its applicability to a variety of important practical situations. For a comprehensive introduction see the books [8, 14]. In this paper we develop techniques for dealing with noisy data by introducing new and more efﬁcient techniques for quasi-orthogonalization and subsequent component recovery. The quasi-orthogonalization step was introduced in [2], where the authors proposed an algorithm for the case when the fourth cumulants of all independent components are of the same sign. A general algorithm with complete theoretical analysis was provided in [3]. That algorithm required estimating the full fourth-order cumulant tensor. We note that Hessian based techniques for ICA were used in [21, 2, 11], with [11] and [2] using the Hessian of the fourth-order cumulant. The papers [21] and [11] proposed interesting randomized one step noise-robust ICA algorithms based on the cumulant generating function and the fourth cumulant respectively in primarily theoretical settings. The gradient iteration algorithm proposed is closely related to the work [18], which provides a gradient-based algorithm derived from the fourth moment with cubic convergence to learn an unknown parallelepiped in a cryptographic setting. For the special case of the fourth cumulant, the idea of gradient iteration has appeared in the context of FastICA with a different justiﬁcation, see e.g. [16, Equation 11 and Theorem 2]. We also note the work [12], which develops methods for Gaussian noise-invariant ICA under the assumption that the noise parameters are known. Finally, there are several papers that considered the problem of performing PCA in a noisy framework. [5] gives a provably robust algorithm for PCA under a sparse noise model. [4] performs PCA robust to white Gaussian noise, and [9] performs PCA robust to white Gaussian noise and sparse noise. 2 Using Cumulants to Orthogonalize the Independent Components Properties of Cumulants: Cumulants are similar to moments and can be expressed in terms of certain polynomials of the moments. However, cumulants have additional properties which allow independent random variables to be algebraically separated. We will be interested in the fourth order multi-variate cumulants, and univariate cumulants of arbitrary order. Denote by Qx the fourth order cumulant tensor for the random vector x. So, (Qx )ijkl is the cross-cumulant between the random variables xi , xj , xk , and xl , which we alternatively denote as Cum(xi , xj , xk , xl ). Cumulant tensors are symmetric, i.e. (Qx )ijkl is invariant under permutations of indices. Multivariate cumulants have the following properties (written in the case of fourth order cumulants): 1. (Multilinearity) Cum(αxi , xj , xk , xl ) = α Cum(xi , xj , xk , xl ) for random vector x and scalar α. If y is a random variable, then Cum(xi +y, xj , xk , xl ) = Cum(xi , xj , xk , xl )+Cum(y, xj , xk , xl ). 2. (Independence) If xi and xj are independent random variables, then Cum(xi , xj , xk , xl ) = 0. When x and y are independent, Qx+y = Qx + Qy . 3. (Vanishing Gaussian) Cumulants of order 3 and above are zero for Gaussian random variables. 3 The ﬁrst order cumulant is the mean, and the second order multivariate cumulant is the covariance matrix. We will denote by κr (x) the order-r univariate cumulant, which is equivalent to the crosscumulant of x with itself r times: κr (x) := Cum(x, x, . . . , x) (where x appears r times). Univariate r-cumulants are additive for independent random variables, i.e. κr (x + y) = κr (x) + κr (y), and homogeneous of degree r, i.e. κr (αx) = αr κr (x). Quasi-Orthogonalization Using Cumulant Tensors. Recalling our original notation, x = As + b + η gives the generative ICA model. We deﬁne an operation of fourth-order tensors on matrices: For Q ∈ Rd×d×d×d and M ∈ Rd×d , Q(M ) is the matrix such that d d Q(M )ij := Qijkl mlk . (1) k=1 l=1 We can use this operation to orthogonalize the latent random signals. Deﬁnition 2.1. A matrix W is called a quasi-orthogonalization matrix if there exists an orthogonal matrix R and a nonsingular diagonal matrix D such that W A = RD. We will need the following results from [3]. Here we use Aq to denote the q th column of A. Lemma 2.2. Let M ∈ Rd×d be an arbitrary matrix. Then, Qx (M ) = ADAT where D is a diagonal matrix with entries dqq = κ4 (sq )AT M Aq . q Theorem 2.3. Suppose that each component of s has non-zero fourth cumulant. Let M = Qx (I), and let C = Qx (M −1 ). Then C = ADAT where D is a diagonal matrix with entries dqq = 1/ Aq 2 . In particular, C is positive deﬁnite, and for any factorization BB T of C, B −1 is a quasi2 orthogonalization matrix. 3 Quasi-Orthogonalization using Cumulant Hessians We have seen in Theorem 2.3 a tensor-based method which can be used to quasi-orthogonalize observed data. However, this method na¨vely requires the estimation of O(d4 ) terms from data. ı There is a connection between the cumulant Hessian-based techniques used in ICA [2, 11] and the tensor-based technique for quasi-orthogonalization described in Theorem 2.3 that allows the tensor-method to be rewritten using a series of Hessian operations. We make this connection precise below. The Hessian version requires only O(d3 ) terms to be estimated from data and simpliﬁes the computation to consist of matrix and vector operations. Let Hu denote the Hessian operator with respect to a vector u ∈ Rd . The following lemma connects Hessian methods with our tensor-matrix operation (a special case is discussed in [2, Section 2.1]). Lemma 3.1. Hu (κ4 (uT x)) = ADAT where dqq = 12(uT Aq )2 κ4 (sq ). In Lemma 3.1, the diagonal entries can be rewritten as dqq = 12κ4 (sq )(AT (uuT )Aq ). By comq paring with Lemma 2.2, we see that applying Qx against a symmetric, rank one matrix uuT can be 1 rewritten in terms of the Hessian operations: Qx (uuT ) = 12 Hu (κ4 (uT x)). This formula extends to arbitrary symmetric matrices by the following Lemma. Lemma 3.2. Let M be a symmetric matrix with eigen decomposition U ΛU T such that U = d 1 (u1 , u2 , . . . , ud ) and Λ = diag(λ1 , λ2 , . . . , λd ). Then, Qx (M ) = 12 i=1 λi Hui κ4 (uT x). i The matrices I and M −1 in Theorem 2.3 are symmetric. As such, the tensor-based method for quasi-orthogonalization can be rewritten using Hessian operations. This is done in Algorithm 1. 4 Gradient Iteration ICA In the preceding sections, we discussed techniques to quasi-orthogonalize data. For this section, we will assume that quasi-orthogonalization is accomplished, and discuss deﬂationary approaches that can quickly recover the directions of the independent components. Let W be a quasiorthogonalization matrix. Then, deﬁne y := W x = W As + W η. Note that since η is Gaussian noise, so is W η. There exists a rotation matrix R and a diagonal matrix D such that W A = RD. Let ˜ := Ds. The coordinates of ˜ are still independent random variables. Gaussian noise makes s s recovering the scaling matrix D impossible. We aim to recover the rotation matrix R. 4 Algorithm 1 Hessian-based algorithm to generate a quasi-orthogonalization matrix. 1: function F IND Q UASI O RTHOGONALIZATION M ATRIX(x) d 1 2: Let M = 12 i=1 Hu κ4 (uT x)|u=ei .

See Equation (4) for the estimator. 5: Factorize C as BB T . 6: return B −1 7: end function To see why recovery of D is impossible, we note that a white Gaussian random variable η 1 has independent components. It is impossible to distinguish between the case where η 1 is part of the signal, i.e. W A(s + η 1 ) + W η, and the case where Aη 1 is part of the additive Gaussian noise, i.e. W As + W (Aη 1 + η), when s, η 1 , and η are drawn independently. In the noise-free ICA setting, the latent signal is typically assumed to have identity covariance, placing the scaling information in the columns of A. The presence of additive Gaussian noise makes recovery of the scaling information impossible since the latent signals become ill-deﬁned. Following the idea popularized in FastICA, we will discuss a deﬂationary technique to recover the columns of R one at a time. Fast Recovery of a Single Independent Component. In the deﬂationary approach, a function f is ﬁxed that acts upon a directional vector u ∈ Rd . Based on some criterion (typically maximization or minimization of f ), an iterative optimization step is performed until convergence. This technique was popularized in FastICA, which is considered fast for the following reasons: 1. As an approximate Newton method, FastICA requires computation of u f and a quick-tocompute estimate of (Hu (f ))−1 at each iterative step. Due to the estimate, the computation runs in O(N d) time, where N is the number of samples. 2. The iterative step in FastICA has local quadratic order convergence using arbitrary functions, and global cubic-order convergence when using the fourth cumulant [13]. We note that cubic convergence rates are not unique to FastICA and have been seen using gradient descent (with the correct step-size) when choosing f as the fourth moment [18]. Our proposed deﬂationary algorithm will be comparable with FastICA in terms of computational complexity, and the iterative step will take on a conceptually simpler form as it only relies on u κr . We provide a derivation of fast convergence rates that relies entirely on the properties of cumulants. As cumulants are invariant with respect to the additive Gaussian noise, the proposed methods will be admissible for both standard and noisy ICA. While cumulants are essentially unique with the additivity and homogeneity properties [17] when no restrictions are made on the probability space, the preprocessing step of ICA gives additional structure (like orthogonality and centering), providing additional admissible functions. In particular, [20] designs “robust cumulants” which are only minimally effected by sparse noise. Welling’s robust cumulants have versions of the additivity and homogeneity properties, and are consistent with our update step. For this reason, we will state our results in greater generality. Let G be a function of univariate random variables that satisﬁes the additivity, degree-r (r ≥ 3) homogeneity, and (for the noisy case) the vanishing Gaussians properties of cumulants. Then for a generic choice of input vector v, Algorithm 2 will demonstrate order r−1 convergence. In particular, if G is κ3 , then we obtain quadratic convergence; and if G is κ4 , we obtain cubic convergence. Lemma 4.1 helps explain why this is true. Lemma 4.1. v G(v · y) = r d i=1 (v · Ri )r−1 G(˜i )Ri . s If we consider what is happening in the basis of the columns of R, then up to some multiplicative constant, each coordinate is raised to the r − 1 power and then renormalized during each step of Algorithm 2. This ultimately leads to the order r − 1 convergence. Theorem 4.2. If for a unit vector input v to Algorithm 2 h = arg maxi |(v · Ri )r−2 G(˜i )| has a s unique answer, then v has order r − 1 convergence to Rh up to sign. In particular, if the following conditions are met: (1) There exists a coordinate random variable si of s such that G(si ) = 0. (2) v inputted into Algorithm 2 is chosen uniformly at random from the unit sphere S d−1 . Then Algorithm 2 converges to a column of R (up to sign) almost surely, and convergence is of order r − 1. 5 Algorithm 2 A fast algorithm to recover a single column of R when v is drawn generically from the unit sphere. Equations (2) and (3) provide k-statistic based estimates of v κ3 and v κ4 , which can be used as practical choices of v G on real data. 1: function GI-ICA(v, y) 2: repeat 3: v ← v G(vT y) 4: v ← v/ v 2 5: until Convergence return v 6: end function ˜ Algorithm 3 Algorithm for ICA in the presence of Gaussian noise.

This can occur if G(˜i ) < 0 and r is odd. Due to space limitations, the proof is s omitted. Recovering all Independent Components. As a Corollary to Theorem 4.2 we get: Corollary 4.3. Suppose R1 , R2 , . . . , Rk are known for some k < d. Suppose there exists i > k such that G(si ) = 0. If v is drawn uniformly at random from S d−1 ∩ span(R1 , . . . , Rk )⊥ where S d−1 denotes the unit sphere in Rd , then Algorithm 2 with input v converges to a new column of R almost surely. Since the indexing of R is arbitrary, Corollary 4.3 gives a solution to noisy ICA, in Algorithm 3. In practice (not required by the theory), it may be better to enforce orthogonality between the columns of R, by orthogonalizing v against previously found columns of R at the end of each step in Algorithm 2. We expect the fourth or third cumulant function will typically be chosen for G. 5 Time Complexity Analysis and Estimation of Cumulants To implement Algorithms 1 and 2 requires the estimation of functions from data. We will limit our discussion to estimation of the third and fourth cumulants, as lower order cumulants are more statistically stable to estimate than higher order cumulants. κ3 is useful in Algorithm 2 for nonsymmetric distributions. However, since κ3 (si ) = 0 whenever si is a symmetric distribution, it is plausible that κ3 would not recover all columns of R. When s is suspected of being symmetric, it is prudent to use κ4 for G. Alternatively, one can fall back to κ4 from κ3 when κ3 is detected to be near 0. Denote by z (1) , z (2) , . . . , z (N ) the observed samples of a random variable z. Given a sample, each cumulant can be estimated in an unbiased fashion by its k-statistic. Denote by kr (z (i) ) the kN 1 statistic sample estimate of κr (z). Letting mr (z (i) ) := N i=1 (z (i) − z )r give the rth sample ¯ central moment, then N 2 m3 (z (i) ) (N + 1)m4 (z (i) ) − 3(N − 1)m2 (z (i) )2 k3 (z (i) ) := , k4 (z (i) ) := N 2 (N − 1)(N − 2) (N − 1)(N − 2)(N − 3) 6 gives the third and fourth k-statistics [15]. However, we are interested in estimating the gradients (for Algorithm 2) and Hessians (for Algorithm 1) of the cumulants rather than the cumulants themselves. The following Lemma shows how to obtain unbiased estimates: Lemma 5.1. Let z be a d-dimensional random vector with ﬁnite moments up to order r. Let z(i) be α an iid sample of z. Let α ∈ Nd be a multi-index. Then ∂u kr (u · z(i) ) is an unbiased estimate for α ∂u κr (u · z). If we mean-subtract (via the sample mean) all observed random variables, then the resulting estimates are: N u k3 (u · y) = (N − 1)−1 (N − 2)−1 3N (u · y(i) )2 y(i) (2) i=1 u k4 (u · y) = N2 (N − 1)(N − 2)(N − 3) −12 Hu k4 (u · x) = N −1 − N2 N −1 N2 N +1 N N N ((u · y(i) ))3 y(i) i=1 N (u · y(i) )2 i=1 12N 2 (N − 1)(N − 2)(N − 3) N 4 (u · y(i) )y(i) (3) i=1 N +1 N N 2N − 2 (u · x(i) )2 (xxT )(i) − N2 i=1 i=1 N ((u · x(i) ))2 (xxT )(i) (4) i=1 N (u · x(i) )x(i) i=1 T N (u · x(i) )x(i) i=1    Using (4) to estimate Hu κ4 (uT x) from data when implementing Algorithm 1, the resulting quasiorthogonalization algorithm runs in O(N d3 ) time. Using (2) or (3) to estimate u G(vT y) (with G chosen to be κ3 or κ4 respectively) when implementing Algorithm 2 gives an update step that runs in O(N d) time. If t bounds the number of iterations to convergence in Algorithm 2, then O(N d2 t) steps are required to recover all columns of R once quasi-orthogonalization has been achieved. 6 Simulation Results In Figure 1, we compare our algorithms to the baselines JADE [7] and versions of FastICA [10], using the code made available by the authors. Except for the choice of the contrast function for FastICA the baselines were run using default settings. All tests were done using artiﬁcially generated data. In implementing our algorithms (available at [19]), we opted to enforce orthogonality during the update step of Algorithm 2 with previously found columns of R. In Figure 1, comparison on ﬁve distributions indicates that each of the independent coordinates was generated from a distinct distribution among the Laplace distribution, the Bernoulli distribution with parameter 0.5, the tdistribution with 5 degrees of freedom, the exponential distribution, and the continuous uniform distribution. Most of these distributions are symmetric, making GI-κ3 inadmissible. When generating data for the ICA algorithm, we generate a random mixing matrix A with condition number 10 (minimum singular value 1 and maximum singular value 10), and intermediate singular values chosen uniformly at random. The noise magnitude indicates the strength of an additive white Gaussian noise. We deﬁne 100% noise magnitude to mean variance 10, with 25% noise and 50% noise indicating variances 2.5 and 5 respectively. Performance was measured using the Amari Index ˆ introduced in [1]. Let B denote the approximate demixing matrix returned by an ICA algorithm, |m | n n ˆ and let M = BA. Then, the Amari index is given by: E := i=1 j=1 maxk ij ik | − 1 + |m n j=1 n i=1 |mij | maxk |mkj | − 1 . The Amari index takes on values between 0 and the dimensionality d. It can be roughly viewed as the distance of M from the nearest scaled permutation matrix P D (where P is a permutation matrix and D is a diagonal matrix). From the noiseles data, we see that quasi-orthogonalization requires more data than whitening in order to provide accurate results. Once sufﬁcient data is provided, all fourth order methods (GI-κ4 , JADE, and κ4 -FastICA) perform comparably. The difference between GI-κ4 and κ4 -FastICA is not 7 ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=5, noisless data) ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=5, 25% noise magnitude) 1.00 ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=5, 50% noise magnitude) 1.00 1.00 GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) κ4−FastICA κ4−FastICA κ4−FastICA log cosh−FastICA JADE log cosh−FastICA JADE log cosh−FastICA JADE 0.10 0.01 100 0.10 0.01 100 1000 10000 100000 Number of Samples ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=10, noisless data) 10.00 Amari Index GI−κ4 (white) GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) Amari Index GI−κ4 (white) GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) Amari Index GI−κ4 (white) 0.10 0.01 100 1000 10000 100000 Number of Samples ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=10, 25% noise magnitude) 10.00 1000 10000 100000 Number of Samples ICA Comparison on 5 distributions (d=10, 50% noise magnitude) 10.00 GI−κ4 (white) GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) κ4−FastICA log cosh−FastICA JADE log cosh−FastICA JADE 0.10 0.01 100 0.10 1000 10000 Number of Samples 100000 κ4−FastICA log cosh−FastICA JADE 1.00 Amari Index 1.00 Amari Index Amari Index GI−κ4 (white) GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) κ4−FastICA 1.00 GI−κ4 (white) GI−κ4 (quasi−orthogonal) 0.01 100 0.10 1000 10000 Number of Samples 100000 0.01 100 1000 10000 Number of Samples 100000 Figure 1: Comparison of ICA algorithms under various levels of noise. White and quasi-orthogonal refer to the choice of the ﬁrst step of ICA. All baseline algorithms use whitening. Reported Amari indices denote the mean Amari index over 50 runs on different draws of both A and the data. d gives the data dimensionality, with two copies of each distribution used when d = 10. statistically signiﬁcant over 50 runs with 100 000 samples. We note that GI-κ4 under whitening and κ4 -FastICA have the same update step (up to a slightly different choice of estimators), with GI-κ4 differing to allow for quasi-orthogonalization. Where provided, the error bars give a 2σ conﬁdence interval on the mean Amari index. In all cases, error bars for our algorithms are provided, and error bars for the baseline algorithms are provided when they do not hinder readability. It is clear that all algorithms degrade with the addition of Gaussian noise. However, GI-κ4 under quasi-orthogonalization degrades far less when given sufﬁcient samples. For this reason, the quasi-orthogonalized GI-κ4 outperforms all other algorithms (given sufﬁcient samples) including the log cosh-FastICA, which performs best in the noiseless case. Contrasting the performance of GIκ4 under whitening with itself under quasi-orthogonalization, it is clear that quasi-orthogonalization is necessary to be robust to Gaussian noise. Run times were indeed reasonably fast. For 100 000 samples on the varied distributions (d = 5) with 50% Gaussian noise magnitude, GI-κ4 (including the orthogonalization step) had an average running time2 of 0.19 seconds using PCA whitening, and 0.23 seconds under quasi-orthogonalization. The corresponding average number of iterations to convergence per independent component (at 0.0001 error) were 4.16 and 4.08. In the following table, we report the mean number of steps to convergence (per independent component) over the 50 runs for the 50% noise distribution (d = 5), and note that once sufﬁciently many samples were taken, the number of steps to convergence becomes remarkably small.

<p>Author: Fajwel Fogel, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis Bach, Alexandre D'Aspremont</p><p>Abstract: Seriation seeks to reconstruct a linear order between variables using unsorted similarity information. It has direct applications in archeology and shotgun gene sequencing for example. We prove the equivalence between the seriation and the combinatorial 2-SUM problem (a quadratic minimization problem over permutations) over a class of similarity matrices. The seriation problem can be solved exactly by a spectral algorithm in the noiseless case and we produce a convex relaxation for the 2-SUM problem to improve the robustness of solutions in a noisy setting. This relaxation also allows us to impose additional structural constraints on the solution, to solve semi-supervised seriation problems. We present numerical experiments on archeological data, Markov chains and gene sequences. 1</p><p>5 0.57937992 <a title="343-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>6 0.57898021 <a title="343-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>

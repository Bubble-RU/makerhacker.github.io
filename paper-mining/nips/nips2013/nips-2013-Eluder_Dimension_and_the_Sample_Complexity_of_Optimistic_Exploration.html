<p>Author: Sebastien Bubeck, Che-Yu Liu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem with a prior distribution on the reward distributions. We are interested in studying prior-free and priordependent regret bounds, very much in the same spirit than the usual distributionfree and distribution-dependent bounds for the non-Bayesian stochastic bandit. We ﬁrst show that Thompson Sampling attains an optimal prior-free bound in the sense that for any prior distribution its Bayesian regret is bounded from above by √ 14 nK. This result is unimprovable in the sense that there exists a prior distribution such that any algorithm has a Bayesian regret bounded from below by √ 1 20 nK. We also study the case of priors for the setting of Bubeck et al. [2013] (where the optimal mean is known as well as a lower bound on the smallest gap) and we show that in this case the regret of Thompson Sampling is in fact uniformly bounded over time, thus showing that Thompson Sampling can greatly take advantage of the nice properties of these priors. 1</p><p>3 0.34302413 <a title="106-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Thompson_Sampling_for_1-Dimensional_Exponential_Family_Bandits.html">330 nips-2013-Thompson Sampling for 1-Dimensional Exponential Family Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathaniel Korda, Emilie Kaufmann, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a ﬁnite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families. 1</p><p>4 0.31261992 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-High-Dimensional_Gaussian_Process_Bandits.html">137 nips-2013-High-Dimensional Gaussian Process Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Josip Djolonga, Andreas Krause, Volkan Cevher</p><p>Abstract: Many applications in machine learning require optimizing unknown functions deﬁned over a high-dimensional space from noisy samples that are expensive to obtain. We address this notoriously hard challenge, under the assumptions that the function varies only along some low-dimensional subspace and is smooth (i.e., it has a low norm in a Reproducible Kernel Hilbert Space). In particular, we present the SI-BO algorithm, which leverages recent low-rank matrix recovery techniques to learn the underlying subspace of the unknown function and applies Gaussian Process Upper Conﬁdence sampling for optimization of the function. We carefully calibrate the exploration–exploitation tradeoff by allocating the sampling budget to subspace estimation and function optimization, and obtain the ﬁrst subexponential cumulative regret bounds and convergence rates for Bayesian optimization in high-dimensions under noisy observations. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in difﬁcult scenarios. 1</p><p>5 0.27716205 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Ofer Dekel, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We study the power of different types of adaptive (nonoblivious) adversaries in the setting of prediction with expert advice, under both full-information and bandit feedback. We measure the player’s performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary’s adaptiveness to the player’s behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize —in a nearly complete manner— the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switch� ing costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is Θ(T 2/3 ). Interestingly, this √ rate is signiﬁcantly worse than the Θ( T ) rate attainable with switching costs in the full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also � show that a bounded memory adversary can force Θ(T 2/3 ) regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a new stochastic adversary strategy that generates loss processes with strong dependencies. 1</p><p>6 0.26367581 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas Bonald, Alexandre Proutiere</p><p>Abstract: We consider an inﬁnite-armed bandit problem with Bernoulli rewards. The mean rewards are independent, uniformly distributed over [0, 1]. Rewards 0 and 1 are referred to as a success and a failure, respectively. We propose a novel algorithm where the decision to exploit any arm is based on two successive targets, namely, the total number of successes until the ﬁrst failure and until the ﬁrst m failures, respectively, where m is a ﬁxed parameter. This two-target algorithm achieves a √ long-term average regret in 2n for a large parameter m and a known time horizon n. This regret is optimal and strictly less than the regret achieved by the best √ known algorithms, which is in 2 n. The results are extended to any mean-reward distribution whose support contains 1 and to unknown time horizons. Numerical experiments show the performance of the algorithm for ﬁnite time horizons. 1</p><p>5 0.65904796 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Sequential_Transfer_in_Multi-armed_Bandit_with_Finite_Set_of_Models.html">292 nips-2013-Sequential Transfer in Multi-armed Bandit with Finite Set of Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Gheshlaghi azar, Alessandro Lazaric, Emma Brunskill</p><p>Abstract: Learning from prior tasks and transferring that experience to improve future performance is critical for building lifelong learning agents. Although results in supervised and reinforcement learning show that transfer may signiﬁcantly improve the learning performance, most of the literature on transfer is focused on batch learning tasks. In this paper we study the problem of sequential transfer in online learning, notably in the multi–armed bandit framework, where the objective is to minimize the total regret over a sequence of tasks by transferring knowledge from prior tasks. We introduce a novel bandit algorithm based on a method-of-moments approach for estimating the possible tasks and derive regret bounds for it. 1</p><p>6 0.63026613 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-%28More%29_Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_via_Posterior_Sampling.html">1 nips-2013-(More) Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Posterior Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Eftychios A. Pnevmatikakis, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compressed sensing (CS) calcium imaging framework for monitoring large neuronal populations, where we image randomized projections of the spatial calcium concentration at each timestep, instead of measuring the concentration at individual locations. We develop scalable nonnegative deconvolution methods for extracting the neuronal spike time series from such observations. We also address the problem of demixing the spatial locations of the neurons using rank-penalized matrix factorization methods. By exploiting the sparsity of neural spiking we demonstrate that the number of measurements needed per timestep is signiﬁcantly smaller than the total number of neurons, a result that can potentially enable imaging of larger populations at considerably faster rates compared to traditional raster-scanning techniques. Unlike traditional CS setups, our problem involves a block-diagonal sensing matrix and a non-orthogonal sparse basis that spans multiple timesteps. We provide tight approximations to the number of measurements needed for perfect deconvolution for certain classes of spiking processes, and show that this number undergoes a “phase transition,” which we characterize using modern tools relating conic geometry to compressed sensing. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80914128 <a title="106-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Eluder_Dimension_and_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Optimistic_Exploration.html">106 nips-2013-Eluder Dimension and the Sample Complexity of Optimistic Exploration</a></p>

Compared to UCB algorithm regret bounds for speciﬁc model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. 1</p><p>3 0.80476809 <a title="106-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-The_Power_of_Asymmetry_in_Binary_Hashing.html">326 nips-2013-The Power of Asymmetry in Binary Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Behnam Neyshabur, Nati Srebro, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Yury Makarychev, Payman Yadollahpour</p><p>Abstract: When approximating binary similarity using the hamming distance between short binary hashes, we show that even if the similarity is symmetric, we can have shorter and more accurate hashes by using two distinct code maps. I.e. by approximating the similarity between x and x as the hamming distance between f (x) and g(x ), for two distinct binary codes f, g, rather than as the hamming distance between f (x) and f (x ). 1</p><p>4 0.8028217 <a title="106-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Locally_Adaptive_Bayesian_Multivariate_Time_Series.html">178 nips-2013-Locally Adaptive Bayesian Multivariate Time Series</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniele Durante, Bruno Scarpa, David Dunson</p><p>Abstract: In modeling multivariate time series, it is important to allow time-varying smoothness in the mean and covariance process. In particular, there may be certain time intervals exhibiting rapid changes and others in which changes are slow. If such locally adaptive smoothness is not accounted for, one can obtain misleading inferences and predictions, with over-smoothing across erratic time intervals and under-smoothing across times exhibiting slow variation. This can lead to miscalibration of predictive intervals, which can be substantially too narrow or wide depending on the time. We propose a continuous multivariate stochastic process for time series having locally varying smoothness in both the mean and covariance matrix. This process is constructed utilizing latent dictionary functions in time, which are given nested Gaussian process priors and linearly related to the observed data through a sparse mapping. Using a differential equation representation, we bypass usual computational bottlenecks in obtaining MCMC and online algorithms for approximate Bayesian inference. The performance is assessed in simulations and illustrated in a ﬁnancial application. 1 1.1</p><p>5 0.79924119 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Compete_to_Compute.html">64 nips-2013-Compete to Compute</a></p>
<p>Author: Rupesh K. Srivastava, Jonathan Masci, Sohrob Kazerounian, Faustino Gomez, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Local competition among neighboring neurons is common in biological neural networks (NNs). In this paper, we apply the concept to gradient-based, backprop-trained artiﬁcial multilayer NNs. NNs with competing linear units tend to outperform those with non-competing nonlinear units, and avoid catastrophic forgetting when training sets change over time. 1</p><p>6 0.79889679 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>

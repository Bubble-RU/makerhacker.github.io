</p><p>2 We then present an approach that exploits a speciﬁc feature of real-world datasets when the number of labels is large: many labels (almost) never appear together. [sent-10, score-0.604]
</p><p>3 The standard approach to MLC is the one-vs-all reduction, also called Binary Relevance (BR) [16], in which one binary classiﬁer is trained for each label to predict whether the label should be predicted for that input. [sent-14, score-0.685]
</p><p>4 The second issue is to design methods that scale to a large number of labels (e. [sent-17, score-0.293]
</p><p>5 thousands or more), potentially at the expense of prediction performances, by learning compressed representations of labels sets with lossy compression schemes that are efﬁcient when label sets have small cardinality [6]. [sent-19, score-0.756]
</p><p>6 A “MLC dataset” refers here to a dataset with a large number of labels (at least hundreds to thousands), in which the target label sets are smaller than the number of labels by one or several orders of magnitude, which is the common in large-scale MLC datasets collected from the Web. [sent-21, score-0.883]
</p><p>7 The major difﬁculty in large-scale MLC problems is that the computational complexity of training and inference of standard methods is at least linear in the number of labels L. [sent-22, score-0.297]
</p><p>8 In order to scale better with L, our approach to MLC is to encode individual labels on K-sparse bit vectors of dimension B, where B L, and use a disjunctive encoding of label sets (i. [sent-23, score-1.003]
</p><p>9 bitwise-OR of the codes of the labels that appear in the label set). [sent-25, score-0.541]
</p><p>10 Then, we learn one binary classiﬁer for each of the B bits of the coding vector, similarly to BR (where K = 1 and B = L). [sent-26, score-0.285]
</p><p>11 By setting K > 1, one can encode individual labels unambiguously on far less than L bits while keeping the disjunctive encoding unambiguous 1  for a large number of labels sets of small cardinality. [sent-27, score-1.098]
</p><p>12 The critical point of our method is a simple scheme to select the K representative bits (i. [sent-29, score-0.424]
</p><p>13 First, the encoding of “relevant” label sets are unambiguous with the disjunctive encoding. [sent-32, score-0.547]
</p><p>14 Secondly, the decoding step, which recovers a label set from an encoding vector, is robust to prediction errors in the encoding vector: in particular, we prove that the number of incorrectly predicted labels is no more than twice the number of incorrectly predicted bits. [sent-33, score-1.575]
</p><p>15 Our (label) encoding scheme relies on the existence of mutually exclusive clusters of labels in real-life MLC datasets, where labels in different clusters (almost) never appear in the same label set, but labels from the same clusters can. [sent-34, score-1.889]
</p><p>16 Our encoding scheme makes that B becomes smaller as more clusters of similar size can be found. [sent-35, score-0.327]
</p><p>17 Bloom ﬁlters use exactly the principle of encoding objects (in our case, labels) by K-sparse vectors and encode a set with the disjunctive encoding of its members. [sent-39, score-0.413]
</p><p>18 Such “random” Bloom ﬁlter encodings are our main baseline, and we consider our approach as a new design of the hash functions and of the decoding algorithm to make Bloom ﬁlter robust to errors in the encoding vector. [sent-42, score-0.689]
</p><p>19 The design of hash functions and the decoding algorithm are then described in Section 3, where we also discuss the properties of our method compared to related works of [12, 15, 4]. [sent-44, score-0.395]
</p><p>20 Framework Given a set of labels L of size L, MLC is the problem of learning a prediction function c that, for each possible input x, predicts a subset of L. [sent-49, score-0.325]
</p><p>21 , (xn , yn )) of inputs for which the desired label sets are known; we assume the examples are drawn i. [sent-54, score-0.298]
</p><p>22 Then, each of the B bits are learnt independently by training a sequence of binary classiﬁers ˆ = (ˆ1 , . [sent-62, score-0.307]
</p><p>23 Given a new instance x, the encoding ˆ(x) is ˆ e predicted, and the ﬁnal multilabel classiﬁer c is obtained by decoding ˆ(x), i. [sent-69, score-0.421]
</p><p>24 e e The goal of this paper is to design the encoding and decoding functions so that two conditions are met. [sent-72, score-0.353]
</p><p>25 Second, the reduction should be robust in the sense that the ﬁnal performance, measured by the expected Hamming loss HL (c) between the target label sets y and the predictions c(x) is not much larger than HB (ˆ), the average error of the classiﬁers we e learn. [sent-74, score-0.389]
</p><p>26 (middle-left) For each label, the hash functions give the index of the bits that are set to 1 in the 6-bit boolean vector. [sent-81, score-0.505]
</p><p>27 (middle-right) Example of a false positive: the representation of the subset { 1 , 4 } includes all the representative bits of label 3 so that is 3 would be decoded erroneously. [sent-83, score-0.736]
</p><p>28 (right) Example of propagation of errors: a single erroneous bit in the label set encoding, together with a false positive, leads to three label errors in the ﬁnal prediction. [sent-84, score-0.807]
</p><p>29 Bloom Filters Given the set of labels L, a Bloom ﬁlter (BF) of size B uses K hash functions from L to {1, . [sent-85, score-0.526]
</p><p>30 non-zero bits) of each label: each singleton { } for ∈ L is encoded by a bit vector of size B with at most K non-zero bits, and each hash function gives the index of one of these nonzero bits in the bit vector. [sent-100, score-0.868]
</p><p>31 Then, the Bloom ﬁlter encodes a subset y ⊆ L by a bit vector of size B, deﬁned by the bitwise OR of the bit vectors of the elements of y. [sent-101, score-0.416]
</p><p>32 Given the encoding of a set, the Bloom ﬁlter can be queried to test the membership of any label ; the ﬁlter answers positively if all the representative bits of are set to 1, and negatively otherwise. [sent-102, score-0.881]
</p><p>33 First, the distribution of label sets in usual MLC datasets is far from uniform. [sent-109, score-0.333]
</p><p>34 Second and more importantly, the decoding approach of BFs is far from robust to errors in the predicted representation. [sent-111, score-0.316]
</p><p>35 Indeed, BFs are able to encode subsets on B L bits because each bit is representative for several labels. [sent-112, score-0.628]
</p><p>36 In the context of MLC, the consequence is that any single bit incorrectly predicted may include in (or exclude from) the predicted label set all the labels for which it is representative. [sent-113, score-1.073]
</p><p>37 Our main contribution, which we detail in the next section, is to use the non-uniform distribution of label sets to design the hash functions and a decoding algorithm to make sure that any incorrectly predicted bit has a limited impact on the predicted label set. [sent-115, score-1.491]
</p><p>38 It improves over random hash functions by relying on a structural feature of the label sets in MLC datasets: many labels are never observed in the same target set, or co-occur with a probability that is small enough to be neglected. [sent-117, score-0.823]
</p><p>39 We ﬁrst formalize the structural feature we use, which is a notion of mutually exclusive clusters of labels, then we describe the hash functions and the robust decoding algorithm that we propose. [sent-118, score-0.764]
</p><p>40 , LP ) are mutually exclusive clusters if no target set contains labels from more than one of each Lp , p = 1. [sent-126, score-0.629]
</p><p>41 For the disjunctive encoding of Bloom ﬁlters, this assumption implies that if we design the hash functions such that the false positives for a label set y belong to a cluster that is mutually exclusive with (at least one) label in y, then the decoding step can detect and correct it. [sent-133, score-1.591]
</p><p>42 To that end, it is sufﬁcient to ensure that for each bit of the Bloom ﬁlter, all the labels for which this bit is representative belong to mutually exclusive clusters. [sent-134, score-1.032]
</p><p>43 This will lead us to a simple two-step decoding algorithm cluster identiﬁcation/label set prediction in the cluster. [sent-135, score-0.292]
</p><p>44 In terms of compression ratio B , we can directly see that the more mutually exclusive clusters, the L more labels can share a single bit of the Bloom ﬁlter. [sent-136, score-0.735]
</p><p>45 Thus, more (balanced) mutually exclusive clusters will result in smaller encoding vectors B, making our method more efﬁcient overall. [sent-137, score-0.52]
</p><p>46 The prediction for the remaining labels is then constrained to predict labels from at most one of the clusters. [sent-141, score-0.58]
</p><p>47 From the point of view of prediction performance, we loose the possibility of predicting arbitrary label sets, but gain the possibility of correcting a non-negligible part of the incorrectly predicted bits. [sent-142, score-0.531]
</p><p>48 What really needs to be compressed is the large set of labels that occur rarely. [sent-145, score-0.318]
</p><p>49 To ﬁnd the label clustering, we ﬁrst build the co-occurrence graph and remove the hubs using the degree centrality measure. [sent-146, score-0.423]
</p><p>50 The remaining labels are then clustered using Louvain algorithm [1]; to control the number of clusters, a maximum size is ﬁxed and larger clusters are recursively clustered until they reach the desired size. [sent-147, score-0.459]
</p><p>51 Both the number of hubs and the cluster size are parameters of the algorithm, and, in Section 4, we show how to choose them before training at negligible computational cost. [sent-149, score-0.315]
</p><p>52 2  Hash functions and decoding  From now on, we assume that we have access to a partition of L into mutually exclusive clusters (in practice, this corresponds to the labels that remain after removal of the hubs). [sent-151, score-0.798]
</p><p>53 two labels from the same cluster cannot share any representative bit; 2. [sent-153, score-0.546]
</p><p>54 two labels from different clusters can share at most K − 1 representative bits. [sent-154, score-0.548]
</p><p>55 The injective mapping between labels and subsets of bits is deﬁned by g : → {g1 ( ) = (1 + )/6, g2 ( ) = 1 + mod 6} for ∈ {1, . [sent-157, score-0.544]
</p><p>56 Finding an encoding that satisﬁes the conditions above is not difﬁcult if we consider, for each label, the set of its representative bits. [sent-164, score-0.321]
</p><p>57 In the rest of the paragraph, we say that a bit of the Bloom ﬁlter “is used for the encoding of a label” when this bit may be a representative bit of the label. [sent-165, score-0.87]
</p><p>58 If the bit “is not used for the encoding of a label”, then it cannot be a representative bit of the label. [sent-166, score-0.687]
</p><p>59 Let us consider the P mutually exclusive label clusters, and denote by R the size of the largest Q cluster. [sent-167, score-0.522]
</p><p>60 , rQ) is used only for the encoding of the r-th label of each cluster. [sent-179, score-0.432]
</p><p>61 That way, each batch of Q bits is used for the encoding of a single label per cluster (enforcing the ﬁrst condition) but can be used for the encoding of P labels overall. [sent-180, score-1.235]
</p><p>62 We then injectively map the (at most) P labels to the subsets of size K to deﬁne the K representative bits of these labels. [sent-183, score-0.719]
</p><p>63 K labels partitioned into P ≤ K mutually exclusive clusters of size at most R. [sent-186, score-0.649]
</p><p>64 Decoding and Robustness We now present the decoding algorithm, followed by a theoretical guarantee that each incorrectly predicted bit in the Bloom ﬁlter cannot imply more than 2 incorrectly predicted labels. [sent-192, score-0.799]
</p><p>65 Given an example x and its predicted encoding ˆ(x), the predicted label set d(ˆ(x)) is computed e e with the following two-step process, in which we say that a bit is “representative of one cluster” if it is a representative bit of one label in the cluster: a. [sent-193, score-1.447]
</p><p>66 (Cluster Identiﬁcation) For each cluster Lp , compute its cluster score sp deﬁned as the number of its representative bits that are set to 1 in ˆ(x). [sent-194, score-0.65]
</p><p>67 (Label Set Prediction) For each label ∈ Lp , let s be the number of representative bits of ˆ s set to 1 in ˆ(x); add to d(ˆ(x)) with probability K . [sent-199, score-0.667]
</p><p>68 In case of ties in the cluster identiﬁcation, we restrict our attention to the clusters that maximize the cluster score, and we recompute their cluster scores using the posterior probabilities instead of the binary decision. [sent-202, score-0.524]
</p><p>69 The choice of a randomized prediction for the labels avoids a single incorrectly predicted bit to result in too many incorrectly predicted labels. [sent-204, score-0.98]
</p><p>70 The robustness of the encoding/decoding scheme is proved below: Theorem 1 Let the label set L , and let (L1 , . [sent-205, score-0.289]
</p><p>71 We compare the expected number of incorrectly predicted labels H L (y, d(ˆ(x))) = E |d(ˆ(x)) ∆ y| (expectation taken over the randomized prediction) and e e B the number of incorrectly predicted bits H B (ˆ(x) , e(y)) = j=1 1{ˆj (x)=ej(y)} . [sent-215, score-1.013]
</p><p>72 Let us denote by e e ∗ p the index of the cluster in which y is included, and p the index of the cluster chosen in step a. [sent-216, score-0.288]
</p><p>73 We ˆ consider the two following cases: p = p∗ : if the cluster is correctly identiﬁed then each incorrectly predicted bit that is representative ˆ 1 e for the cluster costs K in H L (y, d(ˆ(x))). [sent-217, score-0.805]
</p><p>74 e e p = p∗ : If the cluster is not correctly identiﬁed, then H L (y, d(ˆ(x))) is the sum of (1) the number ˆ e of labels that should be predicted but are not (|y|), and (2) the labels that are in the predicted HL e label set but that should not. [sent-220, score-1.16]
</p><p>75 To bound the ratio H B(y,d(ˆ(x))) , we ﬁrst notice that there are (ˆ e(x),e(y)) at least as much representative bits predicted as 1 for Lp than for Lp∗ . [sent-221, score-0.532]
</p><p>76 Since each label ˆ of Lp shares at most K − 1 representative bits with a label of Lp∗ , there are at least |y| ˆ incorrect bits. [sent-222, score-0.933]
</p><p>77 Moreover, the maximum contribution to labels predicted in the incorrect 1 cluster by correctly predicted bits is at most K−1 |y|. [sent-223, score-0.865]
</p><p>78 Each additional contribution of K K L in H (y, d(ˆ(x))) comes from a bit that is incorrectly predicted to 1 instead of 0 (and is e representative for Lp ). [sent-224, score-0.573]

</p><p>80 Their approach has the advantage of a theoretical guarantee in terms of regret (rather than error as we do), without strong structural assumptions on the label sets; the complexity of learning scales in O(C ln(L)) where C is the number of labels in label sets. [sent-232, score-0.807]

</p><p>91 For CS, following [4], we used orthogonal matching poursuit (CS-OMP) for decoding and selected the number of labels to predict in the range {1, 2, . [sent-264, score-0.421]
</p><p>92 The code size B can be freely set for all methods except for Robust BF, where different settings of the maximum cluster size and the number of hubs may lead to the same code size. [sent-273, score-0.427]
</p><p>93 Since the use of a label clustering in R-BF leads to unrecoverable errors even if the classiﬁers perform perfectly well (because labels of different clusters cannot be predicted together), we chose the max cluster size among {10, 20, . [sent-274, score-1.026]
</p><p>94 Nonetheless, we can observe on the ﬁgure that the UHL rapidly reaches a very low value, conﬁrming that the label clustering assumption is reasonable in practice. [sent-285, score-0.296]
</p><p>95 This is because the size of the predicted label sets is ﬁxed for CS, which increases recall but leads to poor precision. [sent-375, score-0.432]

Our approach is a reduction to binary classiﬁcation in which label sets are represented by low dimensional binary vectors. This representation follows the principle of Bloom ﬁlters, a space-efﬁcient data structure originally designed for approximate membership testing. We show that a naive application of Bloom ﬁlters in MLC is not robust to individual binary classiﬁers’ errors. We then present an approach that exploits a speciﬁc feature of real-world datasets when the number of labels is large: many labels (almost) never appear together. Our approach is provably robust, has sublinear training and inference complexity with respect to the number of labels, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms on two large scale multilabel datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.14316793 <a title="279-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2013-The_Power_of_Asymmetry_in_Binary_Hashing.html">326 nips-2013-The Power of Asymmetry in Binary Hashing</a></p>

<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.11121452 <a title="279-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-DeViSE%3A_A_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Embedding_Model.html">81 nips-2013-DeViSE: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Greg S. Corrado, Jon Shlens, Samy Bengio, Jeff Dean, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Tomas Mikolov</p><p>Abstract: Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to the increasing difﬁculty of acquiring sufﬁcient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model. 1</p><p>5 0.097594932 <a title="279-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Beyond_Pairwise%3A_Provably_Fast_Algorithms_for_Approximate_%24k%24-Way__Similarity_Search.html">57 nips-2013-Beyond Pairwise: Provably Fast Algorithms for Approximate $k$-Way  Similarity Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Anshumali Shrivastava, Ping Li</p><p>Abstract: We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with k-way similarity functions. In this paper, we focus on problems related to 3-way Jaccard similarity: R3way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | , S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C, where C is a |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | size n collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate R3way similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees, analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. In the process, we extend traditional framework of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of R3way search is shown on the “Google Sets” application. In addition, we demonstrate the advantage of R3way resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality. 1 Introduction and Motivation Similarity search (near neighbor search) is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Science. The task is to identify a small set of data points which are “most similar” to a given input query. Similarity search algorithms have been one of the basic building blocks in numerous applications including search, databases, learning, recommendation systems, computer vision, etc. One widely used notion of similarity on sets is the Jaccard similarity or resemblance [5, 10, 18, 20]. Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, the resemblance R2way between S1 and S2 is deﬁned as: R2way = |S1 ∩S2 | . Existing notions of similarity in search problems mainly work with |S1 ∪S2 | pairwise similarity functions. In this paper, we go beyond this notion and look at the problem of k-way similarity search, where the similarity function of interest involves k sets (k ≥ 2). Our work exploits the fact that resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance similarity [18, 21], deﬁned over k sets {S1 , S2 , ..., Sk } as Rk−way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩...∩Sk | . |S1 ∪S2 ∪...∪Sk | Binary high-dimensional data The current web datasets are typically binary, sparse, and extremely high-dimensional, largely due to the wide adoption of the “Bag of Words” (BoW) representations for documents and images. It is often the case, in BoW representations, that just the presence or absence (0/1) of speciﬁc feature words captures sufﬁcient information [7, 16, 20], especially with (e.g.,) 3-grams or higher-order models. And so, the web can be imagined as a giant storehouse of ultra high-dimensional sparse binary vectors. Of course, binary vectors can also be equivalently viewed as sets (containing locations of the nonzero features). We list four practical scenarios where k-way resemblance search would be a natural choice. (i) Google Sets: (http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/11/google-sets-still-available.html) Google Sets is among the earliest google projects, which allows users to generate list of similar words by typing only few related keywords. For example, if the user types “mazda” and “honda” the application will automatically generate related words like “bmw”, “ford”, “toyota”, etc. This application is currently available in google spreadsheet. If we assume the term document binary representation of each word w in the database, then given query w1 and w2 , we show that |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| turns out to be a very good similarity measure for this application (see Section 7.1). 1 (ii) Joint recommendations: Users A and B would like to watch a movie together. The proﬁle of each person can be represented as a sparse vector over a giant universe of attributes. For example, a user proﬁle may be the set of actors, actresses, genres, directors, etc, which she/he likes. On the other hand, we can represent a movie M in the database over the same universe based on attributes associated with the movie. If we have to recommend movie M, jointly to users A and B, then a natural measure to maximize is |A∩B∩M | . The problem of group recommendation [3] is applicable |A∪B∪M | in many more settings such as recommending people to join circles, etc. (iii) Improving retrieval quality: We are interested in ﬁnding images of a particular type of object, and we have two or three (possibly noisy) representative images. In such a scenario, a natural expectation is that retrieving images simultaneously similar to all the representative images should be more reﬁned than just retrieving images similar to any one of them. In Section 7.2, we demonstrate that in cases where we have more than one element to search for, we can reﬁne our search quality using k-way resemblance search. In a dynamic feedback environment [4], we can improve subsequent search quality by using k-way similarity search on the pages already clicked by the user. (iv) Beyond pairwise clustering: While machine learning algorithms often utilize the data through pairwise similarities (e.g., inner product or resemblance), there are natural scenarios where the afﬁnity relations are not pairwise, but rather triadic, tetradic or higher [2, 30]. The computational cost, of course, will increase exponentially if we go beyond pairwise similarity. Efﬁciency is crucial With the data explosion in modern applications, the brute force way of scanning all the data for searching is prohibitively expensive, specially in user-facing applications like search. The need for k-way similarity search can only be fulﬁlled if it admits efﬁcient algorithms. This paper fulﬁlls this requirement for k-way resemblance and its derived similarities. In particular, we show fast algorithms with provable query time guarantees for approximate k-way resemblance search. Our algorithms and analysis naturally provide a framework to extend classical LSH framework [14, 13] to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. Organization In Section 2, we review approximate near neighbor search and classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In Section 3, we formulate the 3-way similarity search problems. Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe provable fast algorithms for several search problems. Section 7 demonstrates the applicability of 3-way resemblance search in real applications. 2 Classical c-NN and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Initial attempts of ﬁnding efﬁcient (sub-linear time) algorithms for exact near neighbor search, based on space partitioning, turned out to be a disappointment with the massive dimensionality of current datasets [11, 28]. Approximate versions of the problem were proposed [14, 13] to break the linear query time bottleneck. One widely adopted formalism is the c-approximate near neighbor (c-NN). Deﬁnition 1 (c-Approximate Near Neighbor or c-NN). Consider a set of points, denoted by P, in a D-dimensional space RD , and parameters R0 > 0, δ > 0. The task is to construct a data structure which, given any query point q, if there exist an R0 -near neighbor of q in P, it reports some cR0 -near neighbor of q in P with probability 1 − δ. The usual notion of c-NN is for distance. Since we deal with similarities, we deﬁne R0 -near neighbor of point q as a point p with Sim(q, p) ≥ R0 , where Sim is the similarity function of interest. Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [14, 13] is a popular framework for c-NN problems. LSH is a family of functions, with the property that similar input objects in the domain of these functions have a higher probability of colliding in the range space than non-similar ones. In formal terms, consider H a family of hash functions mapping RD to some set S Deﬁnition 2 (Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)). A family H is called (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 )-sensitive if for any two points x, y ∈ RD and h chosen uniformly from H satisﬁes the following: • if Sim(x, y) ≥ R0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≥ p1 • if Sim(x, y) ≤ cR0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≤ p2 For approximate nearest neighbor search typically, p1 > p2 and c < 1 is needed. Note, c < 1 as we are deﬁning neighbors in terms of similarity. Basically, LSH trades off query time with extra preprocessing time and space which can be accomplished off-line. 2 Fact 1 Given a family of (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 ) -sensitive hash functions, one can construct a data structure for c-NN with O(nρ log1/p2 n) query time and space O(n1+ρ ), where ρ = log 1/p1 . log 1/p2 Minwise Hashing for Pairwise Resemblance One popular choice of LSH family of functions associated with resemblance similarity is, Minwise Hashing family [5, 6, 13]. Minwise Hashing family applies an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, on the given set S ⊆ Ω, and looks at the minimum element under π, i.e. min(π(S)). Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, it can be shown by elementary probability argument that P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 ))) = |S1 ∩ S2 | = R2way . |S1 ∪ S2 | (1) The recent work on b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] provides an improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of the hashed values: min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )). [26] implemented the idea of building hash tables for near neighbor search, by directly using the bits from b-bit minwise hashing. 3 3-way Similarity Search Formulation Our focus will remain on binary vectors which can also be viewed as sets. We illustrate our method |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | using 3-way resemblance similarity function Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) = |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | . The algorithm and guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. Given a size n collection C ⊆ 2Ω of sets (or binary vectors), we are particularly interested in the following three problems: 1. Given two query sets S1 and S2 , ﬁnd S3 ∈ C that maximizes Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 2. Given a query set S1 , ﬁnd two sets S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 3. Find three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). The brute force way of enumerating all possibilities leads to the worst case query time of O(n), O(n2 ) and O(n3 ) for problem 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In a hope to break this barrier, just like the case of pairwise near neighbor search, we deﬁne the c-approximate (c < 1) versions of the above three problems. As in the case of c-NN, we are given two parameters R0 > 0 and δ > 0. For each of the following three problems, the guarantee is with probability at least 1 − δ: 1. (3-way c-Near Neighbor or 3-way c-NN) Given two query sets S1 and S2 , if there ′ exists S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report some S3 ∈ C so that ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 2. (3-way c-Close Pair or 3-way c-CP) Given a query set S1 , if there exists a pair of ′ ′ set S2 , S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S2 , S3 ∈ C so that ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 3. (3-way c-Best Cluster or 3-way c-BC) If there exist sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C with ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C so that Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 4 Sub-linear Algorithm for 3-way c-NN The basic philosophy behind sub-linear search is bucketing, which allows us to preprocess dataset in a fashion so that we can ﬁlter many bad candidates without scanning all of them. LSH-based techniques rely on randomized hash functions to create buckets that probabilistically ﬁlter bad candidates. This philosophy is not restricted for binary similarity functions and is much more general. Here, we ﬁrst focus on 3-way c-NN problem for binary data. Theorem 1 For R3way c-NN one can construct a data structure with O(nρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument for 2-way resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance. Speciﬁcally, given three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ⊆ Ω and an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, we have: P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S3 ))) = R3way . (2) Eq.( 2) shows that minwise hashing, although it operates on sets individually, preserves all 3-way (in fact k-way) similarity structure of the data. The existence of such a hash function is the key requirement behind the existence of efﬁcient approximate search. For the pairwise case, the probability event was a simple hash collision, and the min-hash itself serves as the bucket index. In case 3 of 3-way (and higher) c-NN problem, we have to take care of a more complicated event to create an indexing scheme. In particular, during preprocessing we need to create buckets for each individual S3 , and while querying we need to associate the query sets S1 and S2 to the appropriate bucket. We need extra mechanisms to manipulate these minwise hashes to obtain a bucketing scheme. Proof of Theorem 1: We use two additional functions: f1 : Ω → N for manipulating min(π(S3 )) and f2 : Ω × Ω → N for manipulating both min(π(S1 )) and min(π(S2 )). Let a ∈ N+ such that |Ω| = D < 10a . We deﬁne f1 (x) = (10a + 1) × x and f2 (x, y) = 10a x + y. This choice ensures that given query S1 and S2 , for any S3 ∈ C, f1 (min(π(S3 ))) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))) holds if and only if min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S2 )), and thus we get a bucketing scheme. To complete the proof, we introduce two integer parameters K and L. Deﬁne a new hash function by concatenating K events. To be more precise, while preprocessing, for every element S3 ∈ C create buckets g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hK (S3 ))] where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise hashing family. For given query points S1 and S2 , retrieve only points in the bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) = [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hK (S1 ), hK (S2 ))]. Repeat this process L times independently. For any K S3 ∈ C, with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , is retrieved with probability at least 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Using log 1/c log K = ⌈ log n ⌉ and L = ⌈nρ log( 1 )⌉, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 , the proof can be obtained 1 δ cR0 using standard concentration arguments used to prove Fact 1, see [14, 13]. It is worth noting that the probability guarantee parameter δ gets absorbed in the constants as log( 1 ). Note, the process is δ stopped as soon as we ﬁnd some element with R3way ≥ cR0 . Theorem 1 can be easily extended to k-way resemblance with same query time and space guarantees. Note that k-way c-NN is at least as hard as k ∗ -way c-NN for any k ∗ ≤ k, because we can always choose (k −k ∗ +1) identical query sets in k-way c-NN, and it reduces to k ∗ -way c-NN problem. So, any improvements in R3way c-NN implies improvement in the classical min-hash LSH for Jaccard similarity. The proposed analysis is thus tight in this sense. The above observation makes it possible to also perform the traditional pairwise c-NN search using the same hash tables deployed for 3-way c-NN. In the query phase we have an option, if we have two different queries S1 , S2 , then we retrieve from bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) and that is usual 3-way c-NN search. If we are just interested in pairwise near neighbor search given one query S1 , then we will look into bucket g2 (S1 , S1 ), and we know that the 3-way resemblance between S1 , S1 , S3 boils down to the pairwise resemblance between S1 and S3 . So, the same hash tables can be used for both the purposes. This property generalizes, and hash tables created for k-way c-NN can be used for any k ∗ -way similarity search so long as k ∗ ≤ k. The approximation guarantees still holds. This ﬂexibility makes k-way c-NN bucketing scheme more advantageous over the pairwise scheme. ρ 1 One of the peculiarity of LSH based techniques is that the query complexity exponent ρ < 1 is dependent on the choice R0=0.01 0.8 of the threshold R0 we are interested in and the value of c 0.05 0.1 0.3 0.6 which is the approximation ratio that we will tolerate. Figure 1 0.2 0.4 0.8 log 1/c 0.5 plots ρ = 1− log 1/c+log 1/R0 with respect to c, for selected R0 0.4 0.6 0.9 0.7 values from 0.01 to 0.99. For instance, if we are interested in 0.2 0.95 highly similar pairs, i.e. R0 ≈ 1, then we are looking at near R =0.99 0 O(log n) query complexity for c-NN problem as ρ ≈ 0. On 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 the other hand, for very lower threshold R0 , there is no much c log 1/c of hope of time-saving because ρ is close to 1. Figure 1: ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . 5 Other Efﬁcient k-way Similarities We refer to the k-way similarities for which there exist sub-linear algorithms for c-NN search with query and space complexity exactly as given in Theorem 1 as efﬁcient . We have demonstrated existence of one such example of efﬁcient similarities, which is the k-way resemblance. This leads to a natural question: “Are there more of them?”. [9] analyzed all the transformations on similarities that preserve existence of efﬁcient LSH search. In particular, they showed that if S is a similarity for which there exists an LSH family, then there also exists an LSH family for any similarity which is a probability generating function (PGF) transfor∑∞ mation on S. PGF transformation on S is deﬁned as P GF (S) = i=1 pi S i , where S ∈ [0, 1] and ∑∞ pi ≥ 0 satisﬁes i=1 pi = 1. Similar theorem can also be shown in the case of 3-way resemblance. 4 Theorem 2 Any PGF transformation on 3-way resemblance R3way is efﬁcient. Recall in the proof of Theorem 1, we created hash assignments f1 (min(π(S3 ))) and f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))), which lead to a bucketing scheme for the 3-way resemblance search, where the collision event E = {f1 (min(π(S3 )) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )))} happens with probability P r(E) = R3way . To prove the above Theorem 2, we will need to create hash events ∑∞ i having probability P GF (R3way ) = i=1 pi (R3way ) . Note that 0 ≤ P GF (R3way ) ≤ 1. We will make use of the following simple lemma. Lemma 1 (R3way )n is efﬁcient for all n ∈ N. n n Proof: Deﬁne new hash assignments g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hn (S3 ))] and g2 (S1 , S2 ) = n n [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hn (S1 ), hn (S2 ))]. The collision event g1 (S3 ) = g2 (S1 , S2 ) has n n probability (R3way )n . We now use the pair < g1 , g2 > instead of < f1 , f2 > and obtain same 3way n guarantees, as in Theorem 1, for (R ) as well. i i Proof of Theorem 2: From Lemma 1, let < g1 , g2 > be the hash pair corresponding to (R3way )i i i as used in above lemma. We sample one hash pair from the set {< g1 , g2 >: i ∈ N}, where i i the probability of sampling < g1 , g2 > is proportional to pi . Note that pi ≥ 0, and satisﬁes ∑∞ is i=1 pi = 1, and so the above sampling ∑ valid. It is not difﬁcult to see that the collision of the ∞ sampled hash pair has probability exactly i=1 pi (R3way )i . Theorem 2 can be naturally extended to k-way similarity for any k ≥ 2. Thus, we now have inﬁnitely many k-way similarity functions admitting efﬁcient sub-linear search. One, that might be interesting, because of its radial basis kernel like nature, is shown in the following corollary. Corollary 1 eR k−way −1 is efﬁcient. Proof: Use the expansion of eR k−way normalized by e to see that eR k−way −1 is a PGF on Rk−way . 6 Fast Algorithms for 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC Problems For 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC problems, using bucketing scheme with minwise hashing family will save even more computations. Theorem 3 For R3way c-Close Pair Problem (or c-CP) one can construct a data structure with log 1/c O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+2ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . Note that we can switch the role of f1 and f2 in the proof of Theorem 1. We are thus left with a c-NN problem with search space O(n2 ) (all pairs) instead of n. A bit of analysis, similar to Theorem 1, will show that this procedure achieves the required query time O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n), but uses a lot more space, O(n2(1+ρ )), than shown in the above theorem. It turns out that there is a better way of doing c-CP that saves us space. Proof of Theorem 3: We again start with constructing hash tables. For every element Sc ∈ C, we create a hash-table and store Sc in bucket B(Sc ) = [h1 (Sc ); h2 (Sc ); ...; hK (Sc )], where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise independent family of hash functions H. We create L such hash-tables. For a query element Sq we look for all pairs in bucket B(Sq ) = [h1 (Sq ); h2 (Sq ); ...; hK (Sq )] and repeat this for each of the L tables. Note, we do not form pairs of elements retrieved from different tables as they do not satisfy Eq. (2). If there exists a pair S1 , S2 ∈ C with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ R0 , using K Eq. (2), we can see that we will ﬁnd that pair in bucket B(Sq ) with probability 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Here, we cannot use traditional choice of K and L, similar to what we did in Theorem 1, as there 2 log are O(n2 ) instead of O(n) possible pairs. We instead use K = ⌈ log 1n ⌉ and L = ⌈n2ρ log( 1 )⌉, δ cR0 log 1/c with ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . With this choice of K and L, the result follows. Note, the process is stopped as soon as we ﬁnd pairs S1 and S2 with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ cR0 . The key argument that saves space from O(n2(1+ρ) ) to O(n1+2ρ ) is that we hash n points individually. Eq. (2) makes it clear that hashing all possible pairs is not needed when every point can be processed individually, and pairs formed within each bucket itself ﬁlter out most of the unnecessary combinations. 5 Theorem 4 For R3way c-Best Cluster Problem (or c-BC) there exist an algorithm with running time log 1/c O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n), where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument similar to one used in proof of Theorem 3 leads to the running time of O(n1+3ρ log1/cR0 n) as we need L = O(n3ρ ), and we have to processes all points at least once. Proof of Theorem 4: Repeat c-CP problem n times for every element in collection C acting as query once. We use the same set of hash tables and hash functions every time. The preprocessing time is O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n) evaluations of hash functions and the total querying time is O(n × n2ρ log1/cR0 n), which makes the total running time O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n). For k-way c-BC Problem, we can achieve O(n1+(k−1)ρ log1/cR0 n) running time. If we are interested in very high similarity cluster, with R0 ≈ 1, then ρ ≈ 0, and the running time is around O(n log n). This is a huge saving over the brute force O(nk ). In most practical cases, specially in big data regime where we have enormous amount of data, we can expect the k-way similarity of good clusters to be high and ﬁnding them should be efﬁcient. We can see that with increasing k, hashing techniques save more computations. 7 Experiments In this section, we demonstrate the usability of 3-way and higher-order similarity search using (i) Google Sets, and (ii) Improving retrieval quality. 7.1 Google Sets: Generating Semantically Similar Words Here, the task is to retrieve words which are “semantically” similar to the given set of query words. We collected 1.2 million random documents from Wikipedia and created a standard term-doc binary vector representation of each term present in the collected documents after removing standard stop words and punctuation marks. More speciﬁcally, every word is represented as a 1.2 million dimension binary vector indicating its presence or absence in the corresponding document. The total number of terms (or words) was around 60,000 in this experiment. Since there is no standard benchmark available for this task, we show qualitative evaluations. For querying, we used the following four pairs of semantically related words: (i) “jaguar” and “tiger”; (ii) “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence”; (iii) “milky” and “way” ; (iv) “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Given the query words w1 and w2 , we compare the results obtained by the following four methods. • Google Sets: We use Google’s algorithm and report 5 words from Google spreadsheets [1]. This is Google’s algorithm which uses its own data. • 3-way Resemblance (3-way): We use 3-way resemblance |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| to rank every word |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| w and report top 5 words based on this ranking. • Sum Resemblance (SR): Another intuitive method is to use the sum of pairwise resem|w2 ∩w| blance |w1 ∩w| + |w2 ∪w| and report top 5 words based on this ranking. |w1 ∪w| • Pairwise Intersection (PI): We ﬁrst retrieve top 100 words based on pairwise resemblance for each w1 and w2 independently. We then report the words common in both. If there is no word in common we do not report anything. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that using 3-way resemblance retrieves reasonable candidates for these four queries. An interesting query is “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Finger Lakes is a region in upstate New York. Google could only relate it to New York, while 3-way resemblance could even retrieve the names of cities and lakes in the region. Also, for query “milky” and “way”, we can see some (perhaps) unrelated words like “dance” returned by Google. We do not see such random behavior with 3-way resemblance. Although we are not aware of the algorithm and the dataset used by Google, we can see that 3-way resemblance appears to be a right measure for this application. The above results also illustrate the problem with using the sum of pairwise similarity method. The similarity value with one of the words dominates the sum and hence we see for queries “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence” that all the retrieved words are mostly related to the word “intelligence”. Same is the case with query “ﬁnger” and “lakes” as well as “jaguar” and “tiger”. Note that “jaguar” is also a car brand. In addition, for all 4 queries, there was no common word in the top 100 words similar to the each query word individually and so PI method never returns anything. 6 Table 1: Top ﬁve words retrieved using various methods for different queries. “JAGUAR” AND “ TIGER” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR LION LEOPARD CHEETAH CAT DOG LEOPARD CHEETAH LION PANTHER CAT CAT LEOPARD LITRE BMW CHASIS “MILKY” AND “ WAY” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR DANCE STARS SPACE THE UNIVERSE GALAXY STARS EARTH LIGHT SPACE EVEN ANOTHER STILL BACK TIME PI — — — — — “ARTIFICIAL” AND “INTELLIGENCE” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR PI COMPUTER COMPUTER SECURITY — PROGRAMMING SCIENCE WEAPONS — INTELLIGENT SECRET — SCIENCE ROBOT HUMAN ATTACKS — ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY HUMAN — PI — — — — — G OOGLE NEW YORK NY PARK CITY “FINGER” AND “LAKES” 3- WAY SR SENECA CAYUGA ERIE ROCHESTER IROQUOIS RIVERS FRESHWATER FISH STREAMS FORESTED PI — — — — — We should note the importance of the denominator term in 3-way resemblance, without which frequent words will be blindly favored. The exciting contribution of this paper is that 3-way resemblance similarity search admits provable sub-linear guarantees, making it an ideal choice. On the other hand, no such provable guarantees are known for SR and other heuristic based search methods. 7.2 Improving Retrieval Quality in Similarity Search We also demonstrate how the retrieval quality of traditional similarity search can be boosted by utilizing more query candidates instead of just one. For the evaluations we choose two public datasets: MNIST and WEBSPAM, which were used in a recent related paper [26] for near neighbor search with binary data using b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23]. The two datasets reﬂect diversity both in terms of task and scale that is encountered in practice. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digit samples. Each sample is an image of 28 × 28 pixel yielding a 784 dimension vector with the associated class label (digit 0 − 9). We binarize the data by settings all non zeros to be 1. We used the standard partition of MNIST, which consists of 10,000 samples in one set and 60,000 in the other. The WEBSPAM dataset, with 16,609,143 features, consists of sparse vector representation of emails labeled as spam or not. We randomly sample 70,000 data points and partitioned them into two independent sets of size 35,000 each. Table 2: Percentage of top candidates with the same labels as that of query retrieved using various similarity criteria. More indicates better retrieval quality (Best marked in bold). T OP Pairwise 3-way NNbor 4-way NNbor 1 94.20 96.90 97.70 MNIST 10 20 92.33 91.10 96.13 95.36 96.89 96.28 50 89.06 93.78 95.10 1 98.45 99.75 99.90 WEBSPAM 10 20 96.94 96.46 98.68 97.80 98.87 98.15 50 95.12 96.11 96.45 For evaluation, we need to generate potential similar search query candidates for k-way search. It makes no sense in trying to search for object simultaneously similar to two very different objects. To generate such query candidates, we took one independent set of the data and partition it according to the class labels. We then run a cheap k-mean clustering on each class, and randomly sample triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > from each cluster for evaluating 2-way, 3-way and 4-way similarity search. For MNIST dataset, the standard 10,000 test set was partitioned according to the labels into 10 sets, each partition was then clustered into 10 clusters, and we choose 10 triplets randomly from each cluster. In all we had 100 such triplets for each class, and thus 1000 overall query triplets. For WEBSPAM, which consists only of 2 classes, we choose one of the independent set and performed the same procedure. We selected 100 triplets from each cluster. We thus have 1000 triplets from each class making the total number of 2000 query candidates. The above procedures ensure that the elements in each triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > are not very far from each other and are of the same class label. For each triplet < x1 , x2 , x3 >, we sort all the points x in the other independent set based on the following: • Pairwise: We only use the information in x1 and rank x based on resemblance 7 |x1 ∩x| |x1 ∪x| . • 3-way NN: We rank x based on 3-way resemblance • 4-way NN: We rank x based on 4-way resemblance |x1 ∩x2 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x| . |x1 ∩x2 ∩x3 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x3 ∪x| . We look at the top 1, 10, 20 and 50 points based on orderings described above. Since, all the query triplets are of the same label, The percentage of top retrieved candidates having same label as that of the query items is a natural metric to evaluate the retrieval quality. This percentage values accumulated over all the triplets are summarized in Table 2. We can see that top candidates retrieved by 3-way resemblance similarity, using 2 query points, are of better quality than vanilla pairwise similarity search. Also 4-way resemblance, with 3 query points, further improves the results compared to 3-way resemblance similarity search. This clearly demonstrates that multi-way resemblance similarity search is more desirable whenever we have more than one representative query in mind. Note that, for MNIST, which contains 10 classes, the boost compared to pairwise retrieval is substantial. The results follow a consistent trend. 8 Future Work While the work presented in this paper is promising for efﬁcient 3-way and k-way similarity search in binary high-dimensional data, there are numerous interesting and practical research problems we can study as future work. In this section, we mention a few such examples. One-permutation hashing. Traditionally, building hash tables for near neighbor search required many (e.g., 1000) independent hashes. This is both time- and energy-consuming, not only for building tables but also for processing un-seen queries which have not been processed. One permutation hashing [22] provides the hope of reducing many permutations to merely one. The version in [22], however, was not applicable to near neighbor search due to the existence of many empty bins (which offer no indexing capability). The most recent work [27] is able to ﬁll the empty bins and works well for pairwise near neighbor search. It will be interesting to extend [27] to k-way search. Non-binary sparse data. This paper focuses on minwise hashing for binary data. Various extensions to real-valued data are possible. For example, our results naturally apply to consistent weighted sampling [25, 15], which is one way to handle non-binary sparse data. The problem, however, is not solved if we are interested in similarities such as (normalized) k-way inner products, although the line of work on Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) [19, 18] may be promising. CRS works on non-binary sparse data by storing a bottom subset of nonzero entries after applying one permutation to (real-valued) sparse data matrix. CRS performs very well for certain applications but it does not work in our context because the bottom (nonzero) subsets are not properly aligned. Building hash tables by directly using bits from minwise hashing. This will be a different approach from the way how the hash tables are constructed in this paper. For example, [26] directly used the bits from b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] to build hash tables and demonstrated the signiﬁcant advantages compared to sim-hash [8, 12] and spectral hashing [29]. It would be interesting to see the performance of this approach in k-way similarity search. k-Way sign random projections. It would be very useful to develop theory for k-way sign random projections. For usual (real-valued) random projections, it is known that the volume (which is related to the determinant) is approximately preserved [24, 17]. We speculate that the collision probability of k-way sign random projections might be also a (monotonic) function of the determinant. 9 Conclusions We formulate a new framework for k-way similarity search and obtain fast algorithms in the case of k-way resemblance with provable worst-case approximation guarantees. We show some applications of k-way resemblance search in practice and demonstrate the advantages over traditional search. Our analysis involves the idea of probabilistic hashing and extends the well-known LSH family beyond the pairwise case. We believe the idea of probabilistic hashing still has a long way to go.

<p>Author: Moustapha M. Cisse, Nicolas Usunier, Thierry Artières, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to multilabel classiﬁcation (MLC) with a large number of labels. Our approach is a reduction to binary classiﬁcation in which label sets are represented by low dimensional binary vectors. This representation follows the principle of Bloom ﬁlters, a space-efﬁcient data structure originally designed for approximate membership testing. We show that a naive application of Bloom ﬁlters in MLC is not robust to individual binary classiﬁers’ errors. We then present an approach that exploits a speciﬁc feature of real-world datasets when the number of labels is large: many labels (almost) never appear together. Our approach is provably robust, has sublinear training and inference complexity with respect to the number of labels, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms on two large scale multilabel datasets. 1</p><p>2 0.67148536 <a title="279-lsi-2" href="./nips-2013-The_Power_of_Asymmetry_in_Binary_Hashing.html">326 nips-2013-The Power of Asymmetry in Binary Hashing</a></p>

<p>Author: Nagarajan Natarajan, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we theoretically study the problem of binary classiﬁcation in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise — the learner, instead of seeing the true labels, sees labels that have independently been ﬂipped with some small probability. Moreover, random label noise is class-conditional — the ﬂip probability depends on the class. We provide two approaches to suitably modify any given surrogate loss function. First, we provide a simple unbiased estimator of any loss, and obtain performance bounds for empirical risk minimization in the presence of iid data with noisy labels. If the loss function satisﬁes a simple symmetry condition, we show that the method leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for empirical minimization. Second, by leveraging a reduction of risk minimization under noisy labels to classiﬁcation with weighted 0-1 loss, we suggest the use of a simple weighted surrogate loss, for which we are able to obtain strong empirical risk bounds. This approach has a very remarkable consequence — methods used in practice such as biased SVM and weighted logistic regression are provably noise-tolerant. On a synthetic non-separable dataset, our methods achieve over 88% accuracy even when 40% of the labels are corrupted, and are competitive with respect to recently proposed methods for dealing with label noise in several benchmark datasets.</p><p>4 0.59147418 <a title="279-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Beyond_Pairwise%3A_Provably_Fast_Algorithms_for_Approximate_%24k%24-Way__Similarity_Search.html">57 nips-2013-Beyond Pairwise: Provably Fast Algorithms for Approximate $k$-Way  Similarity Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Anshumali Shrivastava, Ping Li</p><p>Abstract: We go beyond the notion of pairwise similarity and look into search problems with k-way similarity functions. In this paper, we focus on problems related to 3-way Jaccard similarity: R3way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | , S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C, where C is a |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | size n collection of sets (or binary vectors). We show that approximate R3way similarity search problems admit fast algorithms with provable guarantees, analogous to the pairwise case. Our analysis and speedup guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. In the process, we extend traditional framework of locality sensitive hashing (LSH) to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. The applicability of R3way search is shown on the “Google Sets” application. In addition, we demonstrate the advantage of R3way resemblance over the pairwise case in improving retrieval quality. 1 Introduction and Motivation Similarity search (near neighbor search) is one of the fundamental problems in Computer Science. The task is to identify a small set of data points which are “most similar” to a given input query. Similarity search algorithms have been one of the basic building blocks in numerous applications including search, databases, learning, recommendation systems, computer vision, etc. One widely used notion of similarity on sets is the Jaccard similarity or resemblance [5, 10, 18, 20]. Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, the resemblance R2way between S1 and S2 is deﬁned as: R2way = |S1 ∩S2 | . Existing notions of similarity in search problems mainly work with |S1 ∪S2 | pairwise similarity functions. In this paper, we go beyond this notion and look at the problem of k-way similarity search, where the similarity function of interest involves k sets (k ≥ 2). Our work exploits the fact that resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance similarity [18, 21], deﬁned over k sets {S1 , S2 , ..., Sk } as Rk−way = |S1 ∩S2 ∩...∩Sk | . |S1 ∪S2 ∪...∪Sk | Binary high-dimensional data The current web datasets are typically binary, sparse, and extremely high-dimensional, largely due to the wide adoption of the “Bag of Words” (BoW) representations for documents and images. It is often the case, in BoW representations, that just the presence or absence (0/1) of speciﬁc feature words captures sufﬁcient information [7, 16, 20], especially with (e.g.,) 3-grams or higher-order models. And so, the web can be imagined as a giant storehouse of ultra high-dimensional sparse binary vectors. Of course, binary vectors can also be equivalently viewed as sets (containing locations of the nonzero features). We list four practical scenarios where k-way resemblance search would be a natural choice. (i) Google Sets: (http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/11/google-sets-still-available.html) Google Sets is among the earliest google projects, which allows users to generate list of similar words by typing only few related keywords. For example, if the user types “mazda” and “honda” the application will automatically generate related words like “bmw”, “ford”, “toyota”, etc. This application is currently available in google spreadsheet. If we assume the term document binary representation of each word w in the database, then given query w1 and w2 , we show that |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| turns out to be a very good similarity measure for this application (see Section 7.1). 1 (ii) Joint recommendations: Users A and B would like to watch a movie together. The proﬁle of each person can be represented as a sparse vector over a giant universe of attributes. For example, a user proﬁle may be the set of actors, actresses, genres, directors, etc, which she/he likes. On the other hand, we can represent a movie M in the database over the same universe based on attributes associated with the movie. If we have to recommend movie M, jointly to users A and B, then a natural measure to maximize is |A∩B∩M | . The problem of group recommendation [3] is applicable |A∪B∪M | in many more settings such as recommending people to join circles, etc. (iii) Improving retrieval quality: We are interested in ﬁnding images of a particular type of object, and we have two or three (possibly noisy) representative images. In such a scenario, a natural expectation is that retrieving images simultaneously similar to all the representative images should be more reﬁned than just retrieving images similar to any one of them. In Section 7.2, we demonstrate that in cases where we have more than one element to search for, we can reﬁne our search quality using k-way resemblance search. In a dynamic feedback environment [4], we can improve subsequent search quality by using k-way similarity search on the pages already clicked by the user. (iv) Beyond pairwise clustering: While machine learning algorithms often utilize the data through pairwise similarities (e.g., inner product or resemblance), there are natural scenarios where the afﬁnity relations are not pairwise, but rather triadic, tetradic or higher [2, 30]. The computational cost, of course, will increase exponentially if we go beyond pairwise similarity. Efﬁciency is crucial With the data explosion in modern applications, the brute force way of scanning all the data for searching is prohibitively expensive, specially in user-facing applications like search. The need for k-way similarity search can only be fulﬁlled if it admits efﬁcient algorithms. This paper fulﬁlls this requirement for k-way resemblance and its derived similarities. In particular, we show fast algorithms with provable query time guarantees for approximate k-way resemblance search. Our algorithms and analysis naturally provide a framework to extend classical LSH framework [14, 13] to handle higher-order similarities, which could be of independent theoretical interest. Organization In Section 2, we review approximate near neighbor search and classical Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH). In Section 3, we formulate the 3-way similarity search problems. Sections 4, 5, and 6 describe provable fast algorithms for several search problems. Section 7 demonstrates the applicability of 3-way resemblance search in real applications. 2 Classical c-NN and Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) Initial attempts of ﬁnding efﬁcient (sub-linear time) algorithms for exact near neighbor search, based on space partitioning, turned out to be a disappointment with the massive dimensionality of current datasets [11, 28]. Approximate versions of the problem were proposed [14, 13] to break the linear query time bottleneck. One widely adopted formalism is the c-approximate near neighbor (c-NN). Deﬁnition 1 (c-Approximate Near Neighbor or c-NN). Consider a set of points, denoted by P, in a D-dimensional space RD , and parameters R0 > 0, δ > 0. The task is to construct a data structure which, given any query point q, if there exist an R0 -near neighbor of q in P, it reports some cR0 -near neighbor of q in P with probability 1 − δ. The usual notion of c-NN is for distance. Since we deal with similarities, we deﬁne R0 -near neighbor of point q as a point p with Sim(q, p) ≥ R0 , where Sim is the similarity function of interest. Locality sensitive hashing (LSH) [14, 13] is a popular framework for c-NN problems. LSH is a family of functions, with the property that similar input objects in the domain of these functions have a higher probability of colliding in the range space than non-similar ones. In formal terms, consider H a family of hash functions mapping RD to some set S Deﬁnition 2 (Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH)). A family H is called (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 )-sensitive if for any two points x, y ∈ RD and h chosen uniformly from H satisﬁes the following: • if Sim(x, y) ≥ R0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≥ p1 • if Sim(x, y) ≤ cR0 then P rH (h(x) = h(y)) ≤ p2 For approximate nearest neighbor search typically, p1 > p2 and c < 1 is needed. Note, c < 1 as we are deﬁning neighbors in terms of similarity. Basically, LSH trades off query time with extra preprocessing time and space which can be accomplished off-line. 2 Fact 1 Given a family of (R0 , cR0 , p1 , p2 ) -sensitive hash functions, one can construct a data structure for c-NN with O(nρ log1/p2 n) query time and space O(n1+ρ ), where ρ = log 1/p1 . log 1/p2 Minwise Hashing for Pairwise Resemblance One popular choice of LSH family of functions associated with resemblance similarity is, Minwise Hashing family [5, 6, 13]. Minwise Hashing family applies an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, on the given set S ⊆ Ω, and looks at the minimum element under π, i.e. min(π(S)). Given two sets S1 , S2 ⊆ Ω = {0, 1, 2, ..., D − 1}, it can be shown by elementary probability argument that P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 ))) = |S1 ∩ S2 | = R2way . |S1 ∪ S2 | (1) The recent work on b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] provides an improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of the hashed values: min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )). [26] implemented the idea of building hash tables for near neighbor search, by directly using the bits from b-bit minwise hashing. 3 3-way Similarity Search Formulation Our focus will remain on binary vectors which can also be viewed as sets. We illustrate our method |S1 ∩S2 ∩S3 | using 3-way resemblance similarity function Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) = |S1 ∪S2 ∪S3 | . The algorithm and guarantees naturally extend to k-way resemblance. Given a size n collection C ⊆ 2Ω of sets (or binary vectors), we are particularly interested in the following three problems: 1. Given two query sets S1 and S2 , ﬁnd S3 ∈ C that maximizes Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 2. Given a query set S1 , ﬁnd two sets S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). 3. Find three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C maximizing Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ). The brute force way of enumerating all possibilities leads to the worst case query time of O(n), O(n2 ) and O(n3 ) for problem 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In a hope to break this barrier, just like the case of pairwise near neighbor search, we deﬁne the c-approximate (c < 1) versions of the above three problems. As in the case of c-NN, we are given two parameters R0 > 0 and δ > 0. For each of the following three problems, the guarantee is with probability at least 1 − δ: 1. (3-way c-Near Neighbor or 3-way c-NN) Given two query sets S1 and S2 , if there ′ exists S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report some S3 ∈ C so that ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 2. (3-way c-Close Pair or 3-way c-CP) Given a query set S1 , if there exists a pair of ′ ′ set S2 , S3 ∈ C with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S2 , S3 ∈ C so that ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 3. (3-way c-Best Cluster or 3-way c-BC) If there exist sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C with ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ ′ Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , then we report sets S1 , S2 , S3 ∈ C so that Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ cR0 . 4 Sub-linear Algorithm for 3-way c-NN The basic philosophy behind sub-linear search is bucketing, which allows us to preprocess dataset in a fashion so that we can ﬁlter many bad candidates without scanning all of them. LSH-based techniques rely on randomized hash functions to create buckets that probabilistically ﬁlter bad candidates. This philosophy is not restricted for binary similarity functions and is much more general. Here, we ﬁrst focus on 3-way c-NN problem for binary data. Theorem 1 For R3way c-NN one can construct a data structure with O(nρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument for 2-way resemblance can be naturally extended to k-way resemblance. Speciﬁcally, given three sets S1 , S2 , S3 ⊆ Ω and an independent random permutation π : Ω → Ω, we have: P r (min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S3 ))) = R3way . (2) Eq.( 2) shows that minwise hashing, although it operates on sets individually, preserves all 3-way (in fact k-way) similarity structure of the data. The existence of such a hash function is the key requirement behind the existence of efﬁcient approximate search. For the pairwise case, the probability event was a simple hash collision, and the min-hash itself serves as the bucket index. In case 3 of 3-way (and higher) c-NN problem, we have to take care of a more complicated event to create an indexing scheme. In particular, during preprocessing we need to create buckets for each individual S3 , and while querying we need to associate the query sets S1 and S2 to the appropriate bucket. We need extra mechanisms to manipulate these minwise hashes to obtain a bucketing scheme. Proof of Theorem 1: We use two additional functions: f1 : Ω → N for manipulating min(π(S3 )) and f2 : Ω × Ω → N for manipulating both min(π(S1 )) and min(π(S2 )). Let a ∈ N+ such that |Ω| = D < 10a . We deﬁne f1 (x) = (10a + 1) × x and f2 (x, y) = 10a x + y. This choice ensures that given query S1 and S2 , for any S3 ∈ C, f1 (min(π(S3 ))) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))) holds if and only if min(π(S1 )) = min(π(S2 )) = min(π(S2 )), and thus we get a bucketing scheme. To complete the proof, we introduce two integer parameters K and L. Deﬁne a new hash function by concatenating K events. To be more precise, while preprocessing, for every element S3 ∈ C create buckets g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hK (S3 ))] where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise hashing family. For given query points S1 and S2 , retrieve only points in the bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) = [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hK (S1 ), hK (S2 ))]. Repeat this process L times independently. For any K S3 ∈ C, with Sim(S1 , S2 , S3 ) ≥ R0 , is retrieved with probability at least 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Using log 1/c log K = ⌈ log n ⌉ and L = ⌈nρ log( 1 )⌉, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 , the proof can be obtained 1 δ cR0 using standard concentration arguments used to prove Fact 1, see [14, 13]. It is worth noting that the probability guarantee parameter δ gets absorbed in the constants as log( 1 ). Note, the process is δ stopped as soon as we ﬁnd some element with R3way ≥ cR0 . Theorem 1 can be easily extended to k-way resemblance with same query time and space guarantees. Note that k-way c-NN is at least as hard as k ∗ -way c-NN for any k ∗ ≤ k, because we can always choose (k −k ∗ +1) identical query sets in k-way c-NN, and it reduces to k ∗ -way c-NN problem. So, any improvements in R3way c-NN implies improvement in the classical min-hash LSH for Jaccard similarity. The proposed analysis is thus tight in this sense. The above observation makes it possible to also perform the traditional pairwise c-NN search using the same hash tables deployed for 3-way c-NN. In the query phase we have an option, if we have two different queries S1 , S2 , then we retrieve from bucket g2 (S1 , S2 ) and that is usual 3-way c-NN search. If we are just interested in pairwise near neighbor search given one query S1 , then we will look into bucket g2 (S1 , S1 ), and we know that the 3-way resemblance between S1 , S1 , S3 boils down to the pairwise resemblance between S1 and S3 . So, the same hash tables can be used for both the purposes. This property generalizes, and hash tables created for k-way c-NN can be used for any k ∗ -way similarity search so long as k ∗ ≤ k. The approximation guarantees still holds. This ﬂexibility makes k-way c-NN bucketing scheme more advantageous over the pairwise scheme. ρ 1 One of the peculiarity of LSH based techniques is that the query complexity exponent ρ < 1 is dependent on the choice R0=0.01 0.8 of the threshold R0 we are interested in and the value of c 0.05 0.1 0.3 0.6 which is the approximation ratio that we will tolerate. Figure 1 0.2 0.4 0.8 log 1/c 0.5 plots ρ = 1− log 1/c+log 1/R0 with respect to c, for selected R0 0.4 0.6 0.9 0.7 values from 0.01 to 0.99. For instance, if we are interested in 0.2 0.95 highly similar pairs, i.e. R0 ≈ 1, then we are looking at near R =0.99 0 O(log n) query complexity for c-NN problem as ρ ≈ 0. On 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 the other hand, for very lower threshold R0 , there is no much c log 1/c of hope of time-saving because ρ is close to 1. Figure 1: ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . 5 Other Efﬁcient k-way Similarities We refer to the k-way similarities for which there exist sub-linear algorithms for c-NN search with query and space complexity exactly as given in Theorem 1 as efﬁcient . We have demonstrated existence of one such example of efﬁcient similarities, which is the k-way resemblance. This leads to a natural question: “Are there more of them?”. [9] analyzed all the transformations on similarities that preserve existence of efﬁcient LSH search. In particular, they showed that if S is a similarity for which there exists an LSH family, then there also exists an LSH family for any similarity which is a probability generating function (PGF) transfor∑∞ mation on S. PGF transformation on S is deﬁned as P GF (S) = i=1 pi S i , where S ∈ [0, 1] and ∑∞ pi ≥ 0 satisﬁes i=1 pi = 1. Similar theorem can also be shown in the case of 3-way resemblance. 4 Theorem 2 Any PGF transformation on 3-way resemblance R3way is efﬁcient. Recall in the proof of Theorem 1, we created hash assignments f1 (min(π(S3 ))) and f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 ))), which lead to a bucketing scheme for the 3-way resemblance search, where the collision event E = {f1 (min(π(S3 )) = f2 (min(π(S1 )), min(π(S2 )))} happens with probability P r(E) = R3way . To prove the above Theorem 2, we will need to create hash events ∑∞ i having probability P GF (R3way ) = i=1 pi (R3way ) . Note that 0 ≤ P GF (R3way ) ≤ 1. We will make use of the following simple lemma. Lemma 1 (R3way )n is efﬁcient for all n ∈ N. n n Proof: Deﬁne new hash assignments g1 (S3 ) = [f1 (h1 (S3 )); ...; f1 (hn (S3 ))] and g2 (S1 , S2 ) = n n [f2 (h1 (S1 ), h1 (S2 )); ...; f2 (hn (S1 ), hn (S2 ))]. The collision event g1 (S3 ) = g2 (S1 , S2 ) has n n probability (R3way )n . We now use the pair < g1 , g2 > instead of < f1 , f2 > and obtain same 3way n guarantees, as in Theorem 1, for (R ) as well. i i Proof of Theorem 2: From Lemma 1, let < g1 , g2 > be the hash pair corresponding to (R3way )i i i as used in above lemma. We sample one hash pair from the set {< g1 , g2 >: i ∈ N}, where i i the probability of sampling < g1 , g2 > is proportional to pi . Note that pi ≥ 0, and satisﬁes ∑∞ is i=1 pi = 1, and so the above sampling ∑ valid. It is not difﬁcult to see that the collision of the ∞ sampled hash pair has probability exactly i=1 pi (R3way )i . Theorem 2 can be naturally extended to k-way similarity for any k ≥ 2. Thus, we now have inﬁnitely many k-way similarity functions admitting efﬁcient sub-linear search. One, that might be interesting, because of its radial basis kernel like nature, is shown in the following corollary. Corollary 1 eR k−way −1 is efﬁcient. Proof: Use the expansion of eR k−way normalized by e to see that eR k−way −1 is a PGF on Rk−way . 6 Fast Algorithms for 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC Problems For 3-way c-CP and 3-way c-BC problems, using bucketing scheme with minwise hashing family will save even more computations. Theorem 3 For R3way c-Close Pair Problem (or c-CP) one can construct a data structure with log 1/c O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n) query time and O(n1+2ρ ) space, where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . Note that we can switch the role of f1 and f2 in the proof of Theorem 1. We are thus left with a c-NN problem with search space O(n2 ) (all pairs) instead of n. A bit of analysis, similar to Theorem 1, will show that this procedure achieves the required query time O(n2ρ log1/cR0 n), but uses a lot more space, O(n2(1+ρ )), than shown in the above theorem. It turns out that there is a better way of doing c-CP that saves us space. Proof of Theorem 3: We again start with constructing hash tables. For every element Sc ∈ C, we create a hash-table and store Sc in bucket B(Sc ) = [h1 (Sc ); h2 (Sc ); ...; hK (Sc )], where hi is chosen uniformly from minwise independent family of hash functions H. We create L such hash-tables. For a query element Sq we look for all pairs in bucket B(Sq ) = [h1 (Sq ); h2 (Sq ); ...; hK (Sq )] and repeat this for each of the L tables. Note, we do not form pairs of elements retrieved from different tables as they do not satisfy Eq. (2). If there exists a pair S1 , S2 ∈ C with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ R0 , using K Eq. (2), we can see that we will ﬁnd that pair in bucket B(Sq ) with probability 1 − (1 − R0 )L . Here, we cannot use traditional choice of K and L, similar to what we did in Theorem 1, as there 2 log are O(n2 ) instead of O(n) possible pairs. We instead use K = ⌈ log 1n ⌉ and L = ⌈n2ρ log( 1 )⌉, δ cR0 log 1/c with ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . With this choice of K and L, the result follows. Note, the process is stopped as soon as we ﬁnd pairs S1 and S2 with Sim(Sq , S1 , S2 ) ≥ cR0 . The key argument that saves space from O(n2(1+ρ) ) to O(n1+2ρ ) is that we hash n points individually. Eq. (2) makes it clear that hashing all possible pairs is not needed when every point can be processed individually, and pairs formed within each bucket itself ﬁlter out most of the unnecessary combinations. 5 Theorem 4 For R3way c-Best Cluster Problem (or c-BC) there exist an algorithm with running time log 1/c O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n), where ρ = 1 − log 1/c+log 1/R0 . The argument similar to one used in proof of Theorem 3 leads to the running time of O(n1+3ρ log1/cR0 n) as we need L = O(n3ρ ), and we have to processes all points at least once. Proof of Theorem 4: Repeat c-CP problem n times for every element in collection C acting as query once. We use the same set of hash tables and hash functions every time. The preprocessing time is O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n) evaluations of hash functions and the total querying time is O(n × n2ρ log1/cR0 n), which makes the total running time O(n1+2ρ log1/cR0 n). For k-way c-BC Problem, we can achieve O(n1+(k−1)ρ log1/cR0 n) running time. If we are interested in very high similarity cluster, with R0 ≈ 1, then ρ ≈ 0, and the running time is around O(n log n). This is a huge saving over the brute force O(nk ). In most practical cases, specially in big data regime where we have enormous amount of data, we can expect the k-way similarity of good clusters to be high and ﬁnding them should be efﬁcient. We can see that with increasing k, hashing techniques save more computations. 7 Experiments In this section, we demonstrate the usability of 3-way and higher-order similarity search using (i) Google Sets, and (ii) Improving retrieval quality. 7.1 Google Sets: Generating Semantically Similar Words Here, the task is to retrieve words which are “semantically” similar to the given set of query words. We collected 1.2 million random documents from Wikipedia and created a standard term-doc binary vector representation of each term present in the collected documents after removing standard stop words and punctuation marks. More speciﬁcally, every word is represented as a 1.2 million dimension binary vector indicating its presence or absence in the corresponding document. The total number of terms (or words) was around 60,000 in this experiment. Since there is no standard benchmark available for this task, we show qualitative evaluations. For querying, we used the following four pairs of semantically related words: (i) “jaguar” and “tiger”; (ii) “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence”; (iii) “milky” and “way” ; (iv) “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Given the query words w1 and w2 , we compare the results obtained by the following four methods. • Google Sets: We use Google’s algorithm and report 5 words from Google spreadsheets [1]. This is Google’s algorithm which uses its own data. • 3-way Resemblance (3-way): We use 3-way resemblance |w1 ∩w2 ∩w| to rank every word |w1 ∪w2 ∪w| w and report top 5 words based on this ranking. • Sum Resemblance (SR): Another intuitive method is to use the sum of pairwise resem|w2 ∩w| blance |w1 ∩w| + |w2 ∪w| and report top 5 words based on this ranking. |w1 ∪w| • Pairwise Intersection (PI): We ﬁrst retrieve top 100 words based on pairwise resemblance for each w1 and w2 independently. We then report the words common in both. If there is no word in common we do not report anything. The results in Table 1 demonstrate that using 3-way resemblance retrieves reasonable candidates for these four queries. An interesting query is “ﬁnger” and “lakes”. Finger Lakes is a region in upstate New York. Google could only relate it to New York, while 3-way resemblance could even retrieve the names of cities and lakes in the region. Also, for query “milky” and “way”, we can see some (perhaps) unrelated words like “dance” returned by Google. We do not see such random behavior with 3-way resemblance. Although we are not aware of the algorithm and the dataset used by Google, we can see that 3-way resemblance appears to be a right measure for this application. The above results also illustrate the problem with using the sum of pairwise similarity method. The similarity value with one of the words dominates the sum and hence we see for queries “artiﬁcial” and “intelligence” that all the retrieved words are mostly related to the word “intelligence”. Same is the case with query “ﬁnger” and “lakes” as well as “jaguar” and “tiger”. Note that “jaguar” is also a car brand. In addition, for all 4 queries, there was no common word in the top 100 words similar to the each query word individually and so PI method never returns anything. 6 Table 1: Top ﬁve words retrieved using various methods for different queries. “JAGUAR” AND “ TIGER” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR LION LEOPARD CHEETAH CAT DOG LEOPARD CHEETAH LION PANTHER CAT CAT LEOPARD LITRE BMW CHASIS “MILKY” AND “ WAY” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR DANCE STARS SPACE THE UNIVERSE GALAXY STARS EARTH LIGHT SPACE EVEN ANOTHER STILL BACK TIME PI — — — — — “ARTIFICIAL” AND “INTELLIGENCE” G OOGLE 3- WAY SR PI COMPUTER COMPUTER SECURITY — PROGRAMMING SCIENCE WEAPONS — INTELLIGENT SECRET — SCIENCE ROBOT HUMAN ATTACKS — ROBOTICS TECHNOLOGY HUMAN — PI — — — — — G OOGLE NEW YORK NY PARK CITY “FINGER” AND “LAKES” 3- WAY SR SENECA CAYUGA ERIE ROCHESTER IROQUOIS RIVERS FRESHWATER FISH STREAMS FORESTED PI — — — — — We should note the importance of the denominator term in 3-way resemblance, without which frequent words will be blindly favored. The exciting contribution of this paper is that 3-way resemblance similarity search admits provable sub-linear guarantees, making it an ideal choice. On the other hand, no such provable guarantees are known for SR and other heuristic based search methods. 7.2 Improving Retrieval Quality in Similarity Search We also demonstrate how the retrieval quality of traditional similarity search can be boosted by utilizing more query candidates instead of just one. For the evaluations we choose two public datasets: MNIST and WEBSPAM, which were used in a recent related paper [26] for near neighbor search with binary data using b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23]. The two datasets reﬂect diversity both in terms of task and scale that is encountered in practice. The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digit samples. Each sample is an image of 28 × 28 pixel yielding a 784 dimension vector with the associated class label (digit 0 − 9). We binarize the data by settings all non zeros to be 1. We used the standard partition of MNIST, which consists of 10,000 samples in one set and 60,000 in the other. The WEBSPAM dataset, with 16,609,143 features, consists of sparse vector representation of emails labeled as spam or not. We randomly sample 70,000 data points and partitioned them into two independent sets of size 35,000 each. Table 2: Percentage of top candidates with the same labels as that of query retrieved using various similarity criteria. More indicates better retrieval quality (Best marked in bold). T OP Pairwise 3-way NNbor 4-way NNbor 1 94.20 96.90 97.70 MNIST 10 20 92.33 91.10 96.13 95.36 96.89 96.28 50 89.06 93.78 95.10 1 98.45 99.75 99.90 WEBSPAM 10 20 96.94 96.46 98.68 97.80 98.87 98.15 50 95.12 96.11 96.45 For evaluation, we need to generate potential similar search query candidates for k-way search. It makes no sense in trying to search for object simultaneously similar to two very different objects. To generate such query candidates, we took one independent set of the data and partition it according to the class labels. We then run a cheap k-mean clustering on each class, and randomly sample triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > from each cluster for evaluating 2-way, 3-way and 4-way similarity search. For MNIST dataset, the standard 10,000 test set was partitioned according to the labels into 10 sets, each partition was then clustered into 10 clusters, and we choose 10 triplets randomly from each cluster. In all we had 100 such triplets for each class, and thus 1000 overall query triplets. For WEBSPAM, which consists only of 2 classes, we choose one of the independent set and performed the same procedure. We selected 100 triplets from each cluster. We thus have 1000 triplets from each class making the total number of 2000 query candidates. The above procedures ensure that the elements in each triplets < x1 , x2 , x3 > are not very far from each other and are of the same class label. For each triplet < x1 , x2 , x3 >, we sort all the points x in the other independent set based on the following: • Pairwise: We only use the information in x1 and rank x based on resemblance 7 |x1 ∩x| |x1 ∪x| . • 3-way NN: We rank x based on 3-way resemblance • 4-way NN: We rank x based on 4-way resemblance |x1 ∩x2 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x| . |x1 ∩x2 ∩x3 ∩x| |x1 ∪x2 ∪x3 ∪x| . We look at the top 1, 10, 20 and 50 points based on orderings described above. Since, all the query triplets are of the same label, The percentage of top retrieved candidates having same label as that of the query items is a natural metric to evaluate the retrieval quality. This percentage values accumulated over all the triplets are summarized in Table 2. We can see that top candidates retrieved by 3-way resemblance similarity, using 2 query points, are of better quality than vanilla pairwise similarity search. Also 4-way resemblance, with 3 query points, further improves the results compared to 3-way resemblance similarity search. This clearly demonstrates that multi-way resemblance similarity search is more desirable whenever we have more than one representative query in mind. Note that, for MNIST, which contains 10 classes, the boost compared to pairwise retrieval is substantial. The results follow a consistent trend. 8 Future Work While the work presented in this paper is promising for efﬁcient 3-way and k-way similarity search in binary high-dimensional data, there are numerous interesting and practical research problems we can study as future work. In this section, we mention a few such examples. One-permutation hashing. Traditionally, building hash tables for near neighbor search required many (e.g., 1000) independent hashes. This is both time- and energy-consuming, not only for building tables but also for processing un-seen queries which have not been processed. One permutation hashing [22] provides the hope of reducing many permutations to merely one. The version in [22], however, was not applicable to near neighbor search due to the existence of many empty bins (which offer no indexing capability). The most recent work [27] is able to ﬁll the empty bins and works well for pairwise near neighbor search. It will be interesting to extend [27] to k-way search. Non-binary sparse data. This paper focuses on minwise hashing for binary data. Various extensions to real-valued data are possible. For example, our results naturally apply to consistent weighted sampling [25, 15], which is one way to handle non-binary sparse data. The problem, however, is not solved if we are interested in similarities such as (normalized) k-way inner products, although the line of work on Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) [19, 18] may be promising. CRS works on non-binary sparse data by storing a bottom subset of nonzero entries after applying one permutation to (real-valued) sparse data matrix. CRS performs very well for certain applications but it does not work in our context because the bottom (nonzero) subsets are not properly aligned. Building hash tables by directly using bits from minwise hashing. This will be a different approach from the way how the hash tables are constructed in this paper. For example, [26] directly used the bits from b-bit minwise hashing [20, 23] to build hash tables and demonstrated the signiﬁcant advantages compared to sim-hash [8, 12] and spectral hashing [29]. It would be interesting to see the performance of this approach in k-way similarity search. k-Way sign random projections. It would be very useful to develop theory for k-way sign random projections. For usual (real-valued) random projections, it is known that the volume (which is related to the determinant) is approximately preserved [24, 17]. We speculate that the collision probability of k-way sign random projections might be also a (monotonic) function of the determinant. 9 Conclusions We formulate a new framework for k-way similarity search and obtain fast algorithms in the case of k-way resemblance with provable worst-case approximation guarantees. We show some applications of k-way resemblance search in practice and demonstrate the advantages over traditional search. Our analysis involves the idea of probabilistic hashing and extends the well-known LSH family beyond the pairwise case. We believe the idea of probabilistic hashing still has a long way to go.

<p>Author: Ping Li, Gennady Samorodnitsk, John Hopcroft</p><p>Abstract: The method of stable random projections is useful for efﬁciently approximating the lα distance (0 < α ≤ 2) in high dimension and it is naturally suitable for data streams. In this paper, we propose to use only the signs of the projected data and we analyze the probability of collision (i.e., when the two signs differ). Interestingly, when α = 1 (i.e., Cauchy random projections), we show that the probability of collision can be accurately approximated as functions of the chi-square (χ2 ) similarity. In text and vision applications, the χ2 similarity is a popular measure when the features are generated from histograms (which are a typical example of data streams). Experiments conﬁrm that the proposed method is promising for large-scale learning applications. The full paper is available at arXiv:1308.1009. There are many future research problems. For example, when α → 0, the collision probability is a function of the resemblance (of the binary-quantized data). This provides an effective mechanism for resemblance estimation in data streams. 1</p><p>6 0.52944386 <a title="279-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Relationship_Between_Binary_Classification%2C_Bipartite_Ranking%2C_and_Binary_Class_Probability_Estimation.html">223 nips-2013-On the Relationship Between Binary Classification, Bipartite Ranking, and Binary Class Probability Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuening Hu, Jordan Boyd-Graber, Hal Daume III, Z. Irene Ying</p><p>Abstract: Discovering hierarchical regularities in data is a key problem in interacting with large datasets, modeling cognition, and encoding knowledge. A previous Bayesian solution—Kingman’s coalescent—provides a probabilistic model for data represented as a binary tree. Unfortunately, this is inappropriate for data better described by bushier trees. We generalize an existing belief propagation framework of Kingman’s coalescent to the beta coalescent, which models a wider range of tree structures. Because of the complex combinatorial search over possible structures, we develop new sampling schemes using sequential Monte Carlo and Dirichlet process mixture models, which render inference efﬁcient and tractable. We present results on synthetic and real data that show the beta coalescent outperforms Kingman’s coalescent and is qualitatively better at capturing data in bushy hierarchies. 1 The Need For Bushy Hierarchical Clustering Hierarchical clustering is a fundamental data analysis problem: given observations, what hierarchical grouping of those observations effectively encodes the similarities between observations? This is a critical task for understanding and describing observations in many domains [1, 2], including natural language processing [3], computer vision [4], and network analysis [5]. In all of these cases, natural and intuitive hierarchies are not binary but are instead bushy, with more than two children per parent node. Our goal is to provide efﬁcient algorithms to discover bushy hierarchies. We review existing nonparametric probabilistic clustering algorithms in Section 2, with particular focus on Kingman’s coalescent [6] and its generalization, the beta coalescent [7, 8]. While Kingman’s coalescent has attractive properties—it is probabilistic and has edge “lengths” that encode how similar clusters are—it only produces binary trees. The beta coalescent (Section 3) does not have this restriction. However, na¨ve inference is impractical, because bushy trees are more complex: we need ı to consider all possible subsets of nodes to construct each internal nodes in the hierarchy. Our ﬁrst contribution is a generalization of the belief propagation framework [9] for beta coalescent to compute the joint probability of observations and trees (Section 3). After describing sequential Monte Carlo posterior inference for the beta coalescent, we develop efﬁcient inference strategies in Section 4, where we use proposal distributions that draw on the connection between Dirichlet processes—a ubiquitous Bayesian nonparametric tool for non-hierarchical clustering—and hierarchical coalescents to make inference tractable. We present results on both synthetic and real data that show the beta coalescent captures bushy hierarchies and outperforms Kingman’s coalescent (Section 5). 2 Bayesian Clustering Approaches Recent hierarchical clustering techniques have been incorporated inside statistical models; this requires formulating clustering as a statistical—often Bayesian—problem. Heller et al. [10] build 1 binary trees based on the marginal likelihoods, extended by Blundell et al. [11] to trees with arbitrary branching structure. Ryan et al. [12] propose a tree-structured stick-breaking process to generate trees with unbounded width and depth, which supports data observations at leaves and internal nodes.1 However, these models do not distinguish edge lengths, an important property in distinguishing how “tight” the clustering is at particular nodes. Hierarchical models can be divided into complementary “fragmentation” and “coagulation” frameworks [7]. Both produce hierarchical partitions of a dataset. Fragmentation models start with a single partition and divide it into ever more speciﬁc partitions until only singleton partitions remain. Coagulation frameworks repeatedly merge singleton partitions until only one partition remains. Pitman-Yor diffusion trees [13], a generalization of Dirichlet diffusion trees [14], are an example of a bushy fragmentation model, and they model edge lengths and build non-binary trees. Instead, our focus is on bottom-up coalescent models [8], one of the coagulation models and complementary to diffusion trees, which can also discover hierarchies and edge lengths. In this model, n nodes are observed (we use both observed to emphasize that nodes are known and leaves to emphasize topology). These observed nodes are generated through some unknown tree with latent edges and unobserved internal nodes. Each node (both observed and latent) has a single parent. The convention in such models is to assume our observed nodes come at time t = 0, and at time −∞ all nodes share a common ur-parent through some sequence of intermediate parents. Consider a set of n individuals observed at the present (time t = 0). All individuals start in one of n singleton sets. After time ti , a set of these nodes coalesce into a new node. Once a set merges, their parent replaces the original nodes. This is called a coalescent event. This process repeats until there is only one node left, and a complete tree structure π (Figure 1) is obtained. Different coalescents are deﬁned by different probabilities of merging a set of nodes. This is called the coalescent rate, deﬁned by a general family of coalescents: the lambda coalescent [7, 15]. We represent the rate via the symbol λk , the rate at which k out of n nodes merge into a parent node. n From a collection of n nodes, k ≤ n can coalesce at some coalescent event (k can be different for different coalescent events). The rate of a fraction γ of the nodes coalescing is given by γ −2 Λ(dγ), where Λ(dγ) is a ﬁnite measure on [0, 1]. So k nodes merge at rate 1 λk = n γ k−2 (1 − γ)n−k Λ(dγ) (2 ≤ k ≤ n). (1) 0 Choosing different measures yields different coalescents. A degenerate Dirac delta measure at 0 results in Kingman’s coalescent [6], where λk is 1 when k = 2 and zero otherwise. Because this n gives zero probability to non-binary coalescent events, this only creates binary trees. Alternatively, using a beta distribution BETA(2 − α, α) as the measure Λ yields the beta coalescent. When α is closer to 1, the tree is bushier; as α approaches 2, it becomes Kingman’s coalescent. If we have ni−1 nodes at time ti−1 in a beta coalescent, the rate λkii−1 for a children set of ki nodes at time n ti and the total rate λni−1 of any children set merging—summing over all possible mergers—is λkii−1 = n Γ(ki − α)Γ(ni−1 − ki + α) and λni−1 = Γ(2 − α)Γ(α)Γ(ni−1 ) ni−1 ni−1 ki λkii−1 . n (2) ki =2 Each coalescent event also has an edge length—duration—δi . The duration of an event comes from an exponential distribution, δi ∼ exp(λni−1 ), and the parent node forms at time ti = ti−1 − δi . Shorter durations mean that the children more closely resemble their parent (the mathematical basis for similarity is speciﬁed by a transition kernel, Section 3). Analogous to Kingman’s coalescent, the prior probability of a complete tree π is the product of all of its constituent coalescent events i = 1, . . . m, merging ki children after duration δi , m m λkii−1 · exp(−λni−1 δi ). n p(ki |ni−1 ) · p(δi |ki , ni−1 ) = p(π) = i=1 Merge ki nodes After duration δi (3) i=1 1 This is appropriate where the entirety of a population is known—both ancestors and descendants. We focus on the case where only the descendants are known. For a concrete example, see Section 5.2. 2 Algorithm 1 MCMC inference for generating a tree 1: for Particle s = 1, 2, · · · , S do s 2: Initialize ns = n, i = 0, ts = 0, w0 = 1. 0 s 3: Initialize the node set V = {ρ0 , ρ1 , · · · , ρn }. 4: while ∃s ∈ {1 · · · S} where ns > 1 do 5: Update i = i + 1. 6: for Particle s = 1, 2, · · · , S do (a) Kingman’s coalescent 7: if ns == 1 then 8: Continue. s 9: Propose a duration δi by Equation 10. s 10: Set coalescent time ts = ts − δi . i i−1 11: Sample partitions ps from DPMM. i s 12: Propose a set ρci according to Equation 11. s 13: Update weight wi by Equation 13. s s s 14: Update n = n − |ρci | + 1. s (b) the beta coalescent 15: Remove ρci from V s , add ρs to V s . i 16: Compute effective sample size ESS [16].

In real clustering applications, we also care about a node’s children and features. In this section, we deﬁne the nodes and their features, and then review how we use message passing to compute the probabilities of trees. An internal node ρi is deﬁned as the merger of other nodes. The children set of node ρi , ρci , coalesces into a new node ρi ≡ ∪b∈ci ρb . This encodes the identity of the nodes that participate in speciﬁc coalescent events; Equation 3, in contrast, only considers the number of nodes involved in an event. In addition, each node is associated with a multidimensional feature vector yi . Two terms specify the relationship between nodes’ features: an initial distribution p0 (yi ) and a transition kernel κti tb (yi , yb ). The initial distribution can be viewed as a prior or regularizer for feature representations. The transition kernel encourages a child’s feature yb (at time tb ) to resemble feature yi (formed at ti ); shorter durations tb − ti increase the resemblance. Intuitively, the transition kernel can be thought as a similarity score; the more similar the features are, the more likely nodes are. For Brownian diffusion (discussed in Section 4.3), the transition kernel follows a Gaussian distribution centered at a feature. The covariance matrix Σ is decided by the mutation rate µ [18, 9], the probability of a mutation in an individual. Different kernels (e.g., multinomial, tree kernels) can be applied depending on modeling assumptions of the feature representations. To compute the probability of the beta coalescent tree π and observed data x, we generalize the belief propagation framework used by Teh et al. [9] for Kingman’s coalescent; this is a more scalable alternative to other approaches for computing the probability of a Beta coalescent tree [19]. We deﬁne a subtree structure θi = {θi−1 , δi , ρci }, thus the tree θm after the ﬁnal coalescent event m is a complete tree π. The message for node ρi marginalizes over the features of the nodes in its children set.2 The total message for a parent node ρi is −1 Mρi (yi ) = Zρi (x|θi ) κti tb (yi , yb )Mρb (yb )dyb . (4) b∈ci where Zρi (x|θi ) is the local normalizer, which can be computed as the combination of initial distribution and messages from a set of children, Zρi (x|θi ) = p0 (yi ) κti tb (yi , yb )Mρb (yb )dyb dyi . b∈ci 2 When ρb is a leaf, the message Mρb (yb ) is a delta function centered on the observation. 3 (5) Recursively performing this marginalization through message passing provides the joint probability of a complete tree π and the observations x. At the root, Z−∞ (x|θm ) = p0 (y−∞ )κ−∞,tm (y−∞ , ym )Mρm (ym )dym dy−∞ (6) where p0 (y−∞ ) is the initial feature distribution and m is the number of coalescent events. This gives the marginal probability of the whole tree, m p(x|π) = Z−∞ (x|θm ) Zρi (x|θi ), (7) i=1 The joint probability of a tree π combines the prior (Equation 3) and likelihood (Equation 7), m λkii−1 exp(−λni−1 δi ) · Zρi (x|θi ). n p(x, π) = Z−∞ (x|θm ) (8) i=1 3.1 Sequential Monte Carlo Inference Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC)—often called particle ﬁlters—estimates a structured sequence of hidden variables based on observations [20]. For coalescent models, this estimates the posterior distribution over tree structures given observations x. Initially (i = 0) each observation is in a singleton cluster;3 in subsequent particles (i > 0), points coalesce into more complicated tree s structures θi , where s is the particle index and we add superscript s to all the related notations to distinguish between particles. We use sequential importance resampling [21, SIR] to weight each s particle s at time ti , denoted as wi . The weights from SIR approximate the posterior. Computing the weights requires a conditional distris s s bution of data given a latent state p(x|θi ), a transition distribution between latent states p(θi |θi−1 ), s s and a proposal distribution f (θi |θi−1 , x). Together, these distributions deﬁne weights s s wi = wi−1 s s s p(x | θi )p(θi | θi−1 ) . s s f (θi | θi−1 , x) (9) Then we can approximate the posterior distribution of the hidden structure using the normalized weights, which become more accurate with more particles. To apply SIR inference to belief propagation with the beta coalescent prior, we ﬁrst deﬁne the particle s space structure. The sth particle represents a subtree θi−1 at time ts , and a transition to a new i−1 s s s s subtree θi takes a set of nodes ρci from θi−1 , and merges them at ts , where ts = ts − δi and i i i−1 s s s s s θi = {θi−1 , δi , ρci }. Our proposal distribution must provide the duration δi and the children set ρsi c s to merge based on the previous subtree θi−1 . s We propose the duration δi from the prior exponential distribution and propose a children set from the posterior distribution based on the local normalizers. 4 This is the “priorpost” method in Teh et al. [9]. However, this approach is intractable. Given ni−1 nodes at time ti , we must consider all possible n children sets ni−1 + ni−1 + · · · + ni−1 . The computational complexity grows from O(n2 ) i−1 i−1 2 3 ni−1 (Kingman’s coalescent) to O(2 ) (beta coalescent). 4 Efﬁciently Finding Children Sets with DPMM We need a more efﬁcient way to consider possible children sets. Even for Kingman’s coalescent, which only considers pairs of nodes, Gorur et al. [22] do not exhaustively consider all pairs. Instead, they use data structures from computational geometry to select the R closest pairs as their restriction set, reducing inference to O(n log n). While ﬁnding closest pairs is a traditional problem in computational geometry, discovering arbitrary-sized sets is less studied. 3 The relationship between time and particles is non-intuitive. Time t goes backward with subsequent particles. When we use time-speciﬁc adjectives for particles, this is with respect to inference. 4 This is a special case of Section 4.2’s algorithm, where the restriction set Ωi is all possible subsets. 4 In this section, we describe how we use a Dirichlet process mixture model [23, DPMM] to discover a restriction set Ω, integrating DPMMs into the SMC proposal. We ﬁrst brieﬂy review what DPMMs are, describe why they are attractive, and then describe how we incorporate DPMMs in SMC inference. The DPMM is deﬁned by a concentration β and a base distribution G0 . A distribution over mixtures is drawn from a Dirichlet process (DP): G ∼ DP(β, G0 ). Each observation xi is assigned to a mixture component µi drawn from G. Because the Dirichlet process is a discrete distribution, observations i and j can have the same mixture component (µi = µj ). When this happens, points are said to be in the same partition. Posterior inference can discover a distribution over partitions. A full derivation of these sampling equations appears in the supplemental material. 4.1 Attractive Properties of DPMMs DPMM s and Coalescents Berestycki et al. [8] showed that the distribution over partitions in a Dirichlet process is equivalent to the distribution over coalescents’ allelic partitions—the set of members that have the same feature representation—when the mutation rate µ of the associated kernel is half of the Dirichlet concentration β (Section 3). For Brownian diffusion, we can connect DPMM with coalescents by setting the kernel covariance Σ = µI to Σ = β/2I. The base distribution G0 is also related with nodes’ feature. The base distribution G0 of a Dirichlet process generates the probability measure G for each block, which generates the nodes in a block. As a result, we can select a base distribution which ﬁts the distribution of the samples in coalescent process. For example, if we use Gaussian distribution for the transition kernel and prior, a Gaussian is also appropriate as the DPMM base distribution. Effectiveness as a Proposal The necessary condition for a valid proposal [24] is that it should have support on a superset of the true posterior. In our case, the distribution over partitions provided by the DPMM considers all possible children sets that could be merged in the coalescent. Thus the new proposal with DPMM satisﬁes this requirement, and it is a valid proposal. In addition, Chen [25] gives a set of desirable criteria for a good proposal distribution: accounts for outliers, considers the likelihood, and lies close to the true posterior. The DPMM fulﬁlls these criteria. First, the DPMM provides a distribution over all partitions. Varying the concentration parameter β can control the length of the tail of the distribution over partitions. Second, choosing the base distribution of the DPMM appropriately models the feature likelihood; i.e., ensuring the DPMM places similar nodes together in a partition with high probability. Third, the DPMM qualitatively provides reasonable children sets when compared with exhaustively considering all children sets (Figure 2(c)). 4.2 Incorporating DPMM in SMC Proposals To address the inference intractability in Section 3.1, we use the DPMM to obtain a distribution over partitions of nodes. Each partition contains clusters of nodes, and we take a union over all partitions to create a restriction set Ωi = {ωi1 , ωi2 , · · · }, where each ωij is a subset of the ni−1 nodes. A standard Gibbs sampler provides these partitions (see supplemental). s With this restriction set Ωi , we propose the duration time δi from the exponential distribution and s propose a children set ρci based on the local normalizers s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρsi ) c s s s s s s · I ρci ∈ Ωs , (11) fi (ρci |δi , θi−1 ) = fi (δi ) = λs i−1 exp(−λs i−1 δi ) (10) i n n Z0 s where Ωs restricts the candidate children sets, I is the indicator, and we replace Zρi (x|θi ) with i s s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρci ) since they are equivalent here. The normalizer is Z0 = ρc s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ) · I [ρc ∈ Ωs ] = i ρc ∈Ωs i s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ). (12) Applying the true distribution (the ith multiplicand from Equation 8) and the proposal distribution (Equation 10 and Equation 11) to the SIR weight update (Equation 9), |ρs | c s s wi = wi−1 i λni−1 · ρc ∈Ωs i s s Zρi (x|θi−1 , δi , ρc ) λs i−1 n 5 , (13) |ρs | c s i where |ρsi | is the size of children set ρci ; parameter λni−1 is the rate of the children set ρsi (Equac c s tion 2); and λni−1 is the rate of all possible sets given a total number of nodes ni−1 (Equation 2). We can view this new proposal as a coarse-to-ﬁne process: DPMM proposes candidate children sets; SMC selects a children set from DPMM to coalesce. Since the coarse step is faster and ﬁlters “bad” children sets, the slower ﬁner step considers fewer children sets, saving computation time (Algorithm 1). If Ωi has all children sets, it recovers exhaustive SMC. We estimate the effective sample size [16] and resample [17] when needed. For smaller sets, the DPMM is sometimes impractical (and only provides singleton clusters). In such cases it is simpler to enumerate all children sets. 4.3 Example Transition Kernel: Brownian Diffusion This section uses Brownian diffusion as an example for message passing framework. The initial distribution p0 (y) of each node is N (0, ∞); the transition kernel κti tb (y, ·) is a Gaussian centered at y with variance (ti − tb )Σ, where Σ = µI, µ = β/2, β is the concentration parameter of DPMM. Then the local normalizer Zρi (x|θi ) is Zρi (x|θi ) = N (yi ; 0, ∞) b∈ci N (yi ; yb , Σ(vρb + tb − ti ))dyi , ˆ (14) and the node message Mρi (yi ) is normally distributed Mρi (yi ) ∼ N (yi ; yρi , Σvρi ), where ˆ vρi = 5 b∈ci (vρb + tb − ti )−1 −1 , yρi = ˆ b∈ci yρb ˆ vρ b + t b − t i vρ i . Experiments: Finding Bushy Trees In this section, we compare trees built by the beta coalescent (beta) against those built by Kingman’s coalescent (kingman) and hierarchical agglomerative clustering [26, hac] on both synthetic and real data. We show beta performs best and can capture data in more interpretable, bushier trees. Setup The parameter α for the beta coalescent is between 1 and 2. The closer α is to 1, bushier the tree is, and we set α = 1.2.5 We set the mutation rate as 1, thus the DPMM parameter is initialized as β = 2, and updated using slice sampling [27]. All experiments use 100 initial iterations of DPMM inference with 30 more iterations after each coalescent event (forming a new particle). Metrics We use three metrics to evaluate the quality of the trees discovered by our algorithm: purity, subtree and path length. The dendrogram purity score [28, 10] measures how well the leaves in a subtree belong to the same class. For any two leaf nodes, we ﬁnd the least common subsumer node s and—for the subtree rooted at s—measure the fraction of leaves with same class labels. The subtree score [9] is the ratio between the number of internal nodes with all children in the same class and the total number of internal nodes. The path length score is the average difference—over all pairs—of the lowest common subsumer distance between the true tree and the generated tree, where the lowest common subsumer distance is the distance between the root and the lowest common subsumer of two nodes. For purity and subtree, higher is better, while for length, lower is better. Scores are in expectation over particles and averaged across chains. 5.1 Synthetic Hierarchies To test our inference method, we generated synthetic data with edge length (full details available in the supplemental material); we also assume each child of the root has a unique label and the descendants also have the same label as their parent node (except the root node). We compared beta against kingman and hac by varying the number of observations (Figure 2(a)) and feature dimensions (Figure 2(b)). In both cases, beta is comparable to kingman and hac (no edge length). While increasing the feature dimension improves both scores, more observations do not: for synthetic data, a small number of observations sufﬁce to construct a good tree. 5 With DPMM proposals, α has a negligible effect, so we elide further analysis for different α values. 6 0.8 0.6 beta hac kingman 0.4 0.8 0.6 beta hac kingman 8 60 80 100 beta kingman length Number of Observations Scores 0.6 beta kingman 0.4 0.2 0.0 4 6 length Dimension 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.0 20 40 60 80 100 0.6 beta 2 4 6 length Dimension 0.6 8 enum beta 10 enum 0.4 0.2 0.0 2 Number of Observations (a) Increasing observations 0.8 0.4 2 Scores 40 1.0 10 0.4 20 Scores purity 1.0 Scores purity Scores Scores purity 1.0 4 6 8 Dimension (b) Increasing dimension 10 2 4 6 8 10 Dimension (c) beta v.s. enum Figure 2: Figure 2(a) and 2(b) show the effect of changing the underlying data size or number of dimension. Figure 2(c) shows that our DPMM proposal for children sets is comparable to an exhaustive enumeration of all possible children sets (enum). To evaluate the effectiveness of using our DPMM as a proposal distribution, we compare exhaustively enumerating all children set candidates (enum) while keeping the SMC otherwise unchanged; this experiment uses ten data points (enum is completely intractable on larger data). Beta uses the DPMM and achieved similar accuracy (Figure 2(c)) while greatly improving efﬁciency. 5.2 Human Tissue Development Our ﬁrst real dataset is based on the developmental biology of human tissues. As a human develops, tissues specialize, starting from three embryonic germ layers: the endoderm, ectoderm, and mesoderm. These eventually form all human tissues. For example, one developmental pathway is ectoderm → neural crest → cranial neural crest → optic vesicle → cornea. Because each germ layer specializes into many different types of cells at speciﬁc times, it is inappropriate to model this development as a binary tree, or with clustering models lacking path lengths. Historically, uncovering these specialization pathways is a painstaking process, requiring inspection of embryos at many stages of development; however, massively parallel sequencing data make it possible to efﬁciently form developmental hypotheses based on similar patterns of gene expression. To investigate this question we use the transcriptome of 27 tissues with known, unambiguous, time-speciﬁc lineages [29]. We reduce the original 182727 dimensions via principle component analysis [30, PCA]. We use ﬁve chains with ﬁve particles per chain. Using reference developmental trees, beta performs better on all three scores (Table 1) because beta builds up a bushy hierarchy more similar to the true tree. The tree recovered by beta (Figure 3) reﬂects human development. The ﬁrst major differentiation is the division of embryonic cells into three layers of tissue: endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm. These go on to form almost all adult organs and cells. The placenta (magenta), however, forms from a fourth cell type, the trophoblast; this is placed in its own cluster at the root of the tree. It also successfully captures ectodermal tissue lineage. However, mesodermic and endodermic tissues, which are highly diverse, do not cluster as well. Tissues known to secrete endocrine hormones (dashed borders) cluster together. 5.3 Clustering 20-newsgroups Data Following Heller et al. [10], we also compare the three models on 20-newsgroups,6 a multilevel hierarchy ﬁrst dividing into general areas (rec, space, and religion) before specializing into areas such as baseball or hockey.7 This true hierarchy is inset in the bottom right of Figure 4, and we assume each edge has the same length. We apply latent Dirichlet allocation [31] with 50 topics to this corpus, and use the topic distribution for each document as the document feature. We use ﬁve chains with eighty particles per chain. 6 http://qwone.com/˜jason/20Newsgroups/ 7 We use “rec.autos”, “rec.sport.baseball”, “rec.sport.hockey”, “sci.space” newsgroups but also—in contrast to Heller et al. [10]—added “soc.religion.christian”. 7 ectoderm Stomach Pancreas mesoderm placenta Placenta endoderm Bone Marrow Thyroid Colon Kidney Heart PeripheralBlood Lymphocytes Brain Hypothalamus Brain Amygdala Prostate Uterus Lung Brain Thalamus BrainCorpus Callosum Spleen Thymus Spinal Cord Brain Cerebellum BrainCaudate Nucleus Doc Label rec.sport.baseball rec.autos rec.sport.hocky sci.space soc.religion.christian Trachea Small Intestine Retina Monocytes Mammary Gland ... purity ↑ subtree ↑ length ↓ ... ... ... ...

Each small square is a document colored by its class label. Large rectangles represent a subtree with all the enclosed documents as leaf nodes.

Biological Data kingman beta 0.474 ± 0.029 0.492 ± 0.028 0.302 ± 0.033 0.331 ± 0.050 0.654 ± 0.041 0.586 ± 0.051 hac 0.465 0.571 − 20-newsgroups Data kingman beta 0.510 ± 0.047 0.565 ± 0.081 0.651 ± 0.013 0.720 ± 0.013 0.477 ± 0.027 0.333 ± 0.047 Table 1: Comparing the three models: beta performs best on all three scores. As with the biological data, beta performs best on all scores for 20-newsgroups. Figure 4 shows a bushy tree built by beta, which mostly recovered the true hierarchy. Documents within a newsgroup merge ﬁrst, then the three “rec” groups, followed by “space” and “religion” groups. We only use topic distribution as features, so better results could be possible with more comprehensive features. 6 Conclusion This paper generalizes Bayesian hierarchical clustering, moving from Kingman’s coalescent to the beta coalescent. Our novel inference scheme based on SMC and DPMM make this generalization practical and efﬁcient. This new model provides a bushier tree, often a more realistic view of data. While we only consider real-valued vectors, which we model through the ubiquitous Gaussian, other likelihoods might be better suited to other applications. For example, for discrete data such as in natural language processing, a multinomial likelihood may be more appropriate. This is a straightforward extension of our model via other transition kernels and DPMM base distributions. Recent work uses the coalescent as a means of producing a clustering in tandem with a downstream task such as classiﬁcation [32]. Hierarchies are often taken a priori in natural language processing. Particularly for linguistic tasks, a fully statistical model like the beta coalescent that jointly learns the hierarchy and a downstream task could improve performance in dependency parsing [33] (clustering parts of speech), multilingual sentiment [34] (ﬁnding sentiment-correlated words across languages), or topic modeling [35] (ﬁnding coherent words that should co-occur in a topic).

<p>Author: Moustapha M. Cisse, Nicolas Usunier, Thierry Artières, Patrick Gallinari</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach to multilabel classiﬁcation (MLC) with a large number of labels. Our approach is a reduction to binary classiﬁcation in which label sets are represented by low dimensional binary vectors. This representation follows the principle of Bloom ﬁlters, a space-efﬁcient data structure originally designed for approximate membership testing. We show that a naive application of Bloom ﬁlters in MLC is not robust to individual binary classiﬁers’ errors. We then present an approach that exploits a speciﬁc feature of real-world datasets when the number of labels is large: many labels (almost) never appear together. Our approach is provably robust, has sublinear training and inference complexity with respect to the number of labels, and compares favorably to state-of-the-art algorithms on two large scale multilabel datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.82664961 <a title="279-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_Robust_PCA_via_Stochastic_Optimization.html">233 nips-2013-Online Robust PCA via Stochastic Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiashi Feng, Huan Xu, Shuicheng Yan</p><p>Abstract: Robust PCA methods are typically based on batch optimization and have to load all the samples into memory during optimization. This prevents them from efﬁciently processing big data. In this paper, we develop an Online Robust PCA (OR-PCA) that processes one sample per time instance and hence its memory cost is independent of the number of samples, signiﬁcantly enhancing the computation and storage efﬁciency. The proposed OR-PCA is based on stochastic optimization of an equivalent reformulation of the batch RPCA. Indeed, we show that OR-PCA provides a sequence of subspace estimations converging to the optimum of its batch counterpart and hence is provably robust to sparse corruption. Moreover, OR-PCA can naturally be applied for tracking dynamic subspace. Comprehensive simulations on subspace recovering and tracking demonstrate the robustness and efﬁciency advantages of the OR-PCA over online PCA and batch RPCA methods. 1</p><p>4 0.78384328 <a title="279-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Robust_Transfer_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Rank_Constraints.html">285 nips-2013-Robust Transfer Principal Component Analysis with Rank Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis (PCA), a well-established technique for data analysis and processing, provides a convenient form of dimensionality reduction that is effective for cleaning small Gaussian noises presented in the data. However, the applicability of standard principal component analysis in real scenarios is limited by its sensitivity to large errors. In this paper, we tackle the challenge problem of recovering data corrupted with errors of high magnitude by developing a novel robust transfer principal component analysis method. Our method is based on the assumption that useful information for the recovery of a corrupted data matrix can be gained from an uncorrupted related data matrix. Speciﬁcally, we formulate the data recovery problem as a joint robust principal component analysis problem on the two data matrices, with common principal components shared across matrices and individual principal components speciﬁc to each data matrix. The formulated optimization problem is a minimization problem over a convex objective function but with non-convex rank constraints. We develop an efﬁcient proximal projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the proposed optimization problem with convergence guarantees. Our empirical results over image denoising tasks show the proposed method can effectively recover images with random large errors, and signiﬁcantly outperform both standard PCA and robust PCA with rank constraints. 1</p><p>5 0.78045171 <a title="279-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Least_Informative_Dimensions.html">173 nips-2013-Least Informative Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian Sinz, Anna Stockl, January Grewe, January Benda</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel non-parametric method for ﬁnding a subspace of stimulus features that contains all information about the response of a system. Our method generalizes similar approaches to this problem such as spike triggered average, spike triggered covariance, or maximally informative dimensions. Instead of maximizing the mutual information between features and responses directly, we use integral probability metrics in kernel Hilbert spaces to minimize the information between uninformative features and the combination of informative features and responses. Since estimators of these metrics access the data via kernels, are easy to compute, and exhibit good theoretical convergence properties, our method can easily be generalized to populations of neurons or spike patterns. By using a particular expansion of the mutual information, we can show that the informative features must contain all information if we can make the uninformative features independent of the rest. 1</p><p>6 0.78006846 <a title="279-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Wavelets_on_Graphs_via_Deep_Learning.html">350 nips-2013-Wavelets on Graphs via Deep Learning</a></p>

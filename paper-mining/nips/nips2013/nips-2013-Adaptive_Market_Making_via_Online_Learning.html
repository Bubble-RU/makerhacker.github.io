<p>Author: Kareem Amin, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Umar Syed</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by real-time ad exchanges for online display advertising, we consider the problem of inferring a buyer’s value distribution for a good when the buyer is repeatedly interacting with a seller through a posted-price mechanism. We model the buyer as a strategic agent, whose goal is to maximize her long-term surplus, and we are interested in mechanisms that maximize the seller’s long-term revenue. We deﬁne the natural notion of strategic regret — the lost revenue as measured against a truthful (non-strategic) buyer. We present seller algorithms that are no(strategic)-regret when the buyer discounts her future surplus — i.e. the buyer prefers showing advertisements to users sooner rather than later. We also give a lower bound on strategic regret that increases as the buyer’s discounting weakens and shows, in particular, that any seller algorithm will suffer linear strategic regret if there is no discounting. 1</p><p>3 0.32611012 <a title="26-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-How_to_Hedge_an_Option_Against_an_Adversary%3A_Black-Scholes_Pricing_is_Minimax_Optimal.html">139 nips-2013-How to Hedge an Option Against an Adversary: Black-Scholes Pricing is Minimax Optimal</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Peter Bartlett, Rafael Frongillo, Andre Wibisono</p><p>Abstract: We consider a popular problem in ﬁnance, option pricing, through the lens of an online learning game between Nature and an Investor. In the Black-Scholes option pricing model from 1973, the Investor can continuously hedge the risk of an option by trading the underlying asset, assuming that the asset’s price ﬂuctuates according to Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). We consider a worst-case model, in which Nature chooses a sequence of price ﬂuctuations under a cumulative quadratic volatility constraint, and the Investor can make a sequence of hedging decisions. Our main result is to show that the value of our proposed game, which is the “regret” of hedging strategy, converges to the Black-Scholes option price. We use signiﬁcantly weaker assumptions than previous work—for instance, we allow large jumps in the asset price—and show that the Black-Scholes hedging strategy is near-optimal for the Investor even in this non-stochastic framework. 1</p><p>4 0.19866899 <a title="26-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Convex_Optimization_with_Multiple__Objectives.html">311 nips-2013-Stochastic Convex Optimization with Multiple  Objectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the development of efﬁcient algorithms for convex optimization problems in the simultaneous presence of multiple objectives and stochasticity in the ﬁrst-order information. We cast the stochastic multiple objective optimization problem into a constrained optimization problem by choosing one function as the objective and try to bound other objectives by appropriate thresholds. We ﬁrst examine a two stages exploration-exploitation based algorithm which ﬁrst approximates the stochastic objectives by sampling and then solves a constrained stochastic optimization problem by projected gradient method. This method attains a suboptimal convergence rate even under strong assumption on the objectives. Our second approach is an efﬁcient primal-dual stochastic algorithm. It leverages on the theory of Lagrangian method √ conin strained optimization and attains the optimal convergence rate of O(1/ T ) in high probability for general Lipschitz continuous objectives.</p><p>5 0.19494164 <a title="26-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-The_Pareto_Regret_Frontier.html">325 nips-2013-The Pareto Regret Frontier</a></p>
<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen</p><p>Abstract: Performance guarantees for online learning algorithms typically take the form of regret bounds, which express that the cumulative loss overhead compared to the best expert in hindsight is small. In the common case of large but structured expert sets we typically wish to keep the regret especially small compared to simple experts, at the cost of modest additional overhead compared to more complex others. We study which such regret trade-offs can be achieved, and how. We analyse regret w.r.t. each individual expert as a multi-objective criterion in the simple but fundamental case of absolute loss. We characterise the achievable and Pareto optimal trade-offs, and the corresponding optimal strategies for each sample size both exactly for each ﬁnite horizon and asymptotically. 1</p><p>6 0.19164005 <a title="26-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Min Xu, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu</p><p>Abstract: In search advertising, the search engine needs to select the most proﬁtable advertisements to display, which can be formulated as an instance of online learning with partial feedback, also known as the stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. In this paper, we show that the naive application of MAB algorithms to search advertising for advertisement selection will produce sample selection bias that harms the search engine by decreasing expected revenue and “estimation of the largest mean” (ELM) bias that harms the advertisers by increasing game-theoretic player-regret. We then propose simple bias-correction methods with beneﬁts to both the search engine and the advertisers. 1</p><p>5 0.38994026 <a title="26-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Convex_Optimization_with_Multiple__Objectives.html">311 nips-2013-Stochastic Convex Optimization with Multiple  Objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms.

We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>5 0.87941933 <a title="26-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_Finite_State_Transducers.html">342 nips-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of Finite State Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Raphael Bailly, Xavier Carreras, Ariadna Quattoni</p><p>Abstract: Finite-State Transducers (FST) are a standard tool for modeling paired inputoutput sequences and are used in numerous applications, ranging from computational biology to natural language processing. Recently Balle et al. [4] presented a spectral algorithm for learning FST from samples of aligned input-output sequences. In this paper we address the more realistic, yet challenging setting where the alignments are unknown to the learning algorithm. We frame FST learning as ﬁnding a low rank Hankel matrix satisfying constraints derived from observable statistics. Under this formulation, we provide identiﬁability results for FST distributions. Then, following previous work on rank minimization, we propose a regularized convex relaxation of this objective which is based on minimizing a nuclear norm penalty subject to linear constraints and can be solved efﬁciently. 1</p><p>6 0.86750954 <a title="26-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

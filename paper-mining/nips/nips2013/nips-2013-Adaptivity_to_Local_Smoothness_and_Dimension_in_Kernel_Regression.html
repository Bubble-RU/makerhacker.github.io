<p>Author: Ilya O. Tolstikhin, Yevgeny Seldin</p><p>Abstract: We present a PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality. The inequality is based on a combination of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique with an Empirical Bernstein bound. We show that when the empirical variance is signiﬁcantly smaller than the empirical loss the PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is signiﬁcantly tighter than the PAC-Bayes-kl inequality of Seeger (2002) and otherwise it is comparable. Our theoretical analysis is conﬁrmed empirically on a synthetic example and several UCI datasets. The PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein inequality is an interesting example of an application of the PAC-Bayesian bounding technique to self-bounding functions. 1</p><p>3 0.12015446 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Regression-tree_Tuning_in_a_Streaming_Setting.html">269 nips-2013-Regression-tree Tuning in a Streaming Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of maintaining the data-structures of a partition-based regression procedure in a setting where the training data arrives sequentially over time. We prove that it is possible to maintain such a structure in time O (log n) at ˜ any time step n while achieving a nearly-optimal regression rate of O n−2/(2+d) in terms of the unknown metric dimension d. Finally we prove a new regression lower-bound which is independent of a given data size, and hence is more appropriate for the streaming setting. 1</p><p>4 0.11499379 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Mid-level_Visual_Element_Discovery_as_Discriminative_Mode_Seeking.html">190 nips-2013-Mid-level Visual Element Discovery as Discriminative Mode Seeking</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Doersch, Abhinav Gupta, Alexei A. Efros</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on mid-level visual representations aims to capture information at the level of complexity higher than typical “visual words”, but lower than full-blown semantic objects. Several approaches [5, 6, 12, 23] have been proposed to discover mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difﬁcult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data. We also propose the Purity-Coverage plot as a principled way of experimentally analyzing and evaluating different visual discovery approaches, and compare our method against prior work on the Paris Street View dataset of [5]. We also evaluate our method on the task of scene classiﬁcation, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on the MIT Scene-67 dataset. 1</p><p>5 0.1110073 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-Ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish theoretical results concerning local optima of regularized M estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex. Our results show that as long as the loss satisﬁes restricted strong convexity and the penalty satisﬁes suitable regularity conditions, any local optimum of the composite objective lies within statistical precision of the true parameter vector. Our theory covers a broad class of nonconvex objective functions, including corrected versions of the Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models and regression in generalized linear models using nonconvex regularizers such as SCAD and MCP. On the optimization side, we show that a simple adaptation of composite gradient descent may be used to compute a global optimum up to the statistical precision stat in log(1/ stat ) iterations, the fastest possible rate for any ﬁrst-order method. We provide simulations to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.10648273 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Non-Uniform_Camera_Shake_Removal_Using_a_Spatially-Adaptive_Sparse_Penalty.html">212 nips-2013-Non-Uniform Camera Shake Removal Using a Spatially-Adaptive Sparse Penalty</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Zhang</p><p>Abstract: All the existing multi-task local learning methods are deﬁned on homogeneous neighborhood which consists of all data points from only one task. In this paper, different from existing methods, we propose local learning methods for multitask classiﬁcation and regression problems based on heterogeneous neighborhood which is deﬁned on data points from all tasks. Speciﬁcally, we extend the knearest-neighbor classiﬁer by formulating the decision function for each data point as a weighted voting among the neighbors from all tasks where the weights are task-speciﬁc. By deﬁning a regularizer to enforce the task-speciﬁc weight matrix to approach a symmetric one, a regularized objective function is proposed and an efﬁcient coordinate descent method is developed to solve it. For regression problems, we extend the kernel regression to multi-task setting in a similar way to the classiﬁcation case. Experiments on some toy data and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods. 1</p><p>3 0.6993733 <a title="31-lsi-3" href="./nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein_Inequality.html">242 nips-2013-PAC-Bayes-Empirical-Bernstein Inequality</a></p>

<p>Author: Ichiro Takeuchi, Tatsuya Hongo, Masashi Sugiyama, Shinichi Nakajima</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an extended formulation of multi-task learning (MTL) called parametric task learning (PTL) that can systematically handle inﬁnitely many tasks parameterized by a continuous parameter. Our key ﬁnding is that, for a certain class of PTL problems, the path of the optimal task-wise solutions can be represented as piecewise-linear functions of the continuous task parameter. Based on this fact, we employ a parametric programming technique to obtain the common shared representation across all the continuously parameterized tasks. We show that our PTL formulation is useful in various scenarios such as learning under non-stationarity, cost-sensitive learning, and quantile regression. We demonstrate the advantage of our approach in these scenarios.</p><p>5 0.66974211 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Abernethy, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We consider the design of strategies for market making in an exchange. A market maker generally seeks to proﬁt from the difference between the buy and sell price of an asset, yet the market maker also takes exposure risk in the event of large price movements. Proﬁt guarantees for market making strategies have typically required certain stochastic assumptions on the price ﬂuctuations of the asset in question; for example, assuming a model in which the price process is mean reverting. We propose a class of “spread-based” market making strategies whose performance can be controlled even under worst-case (adversarial) settings. We prove structural properties of these strategies which allows us to design a master algorithm which obtains low regret relative to the best such strategy in hindsight. We run a set of experiments showing favorable performance on recent real-world stock price data. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.9616164 <a title="31-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Adaptivity_to_Local_Smoothness_and_Dimension_in_Kernel_Regression.html">31 nips-2013-Adaptivity to Local Smoothness and Dimension in Kernel Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria-Florina Balcan, Vitaly Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We describe a framework for designing efﬁcient active learning algorithms that are tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise and differentially-private. The framework is based on active learning algorithms that are statistical in the sense that they rely on estimates of expectations of functions of ﬁltered random examples. It builds on the powerful statistical query framework of Kearns [30]. We show that any efﬁcient active statistical learning algorithm can be automatically converted to an efﬁcient active learning algorithm which is tolerant to random classiﬁcation noise as well as other forms of “uncorrelated” noise. We show that commonly studied concept classes including thresholds, rectangles, and linear separators can be efﬁciently actively learned in our framework. These results combined with our generic conversion lead to the ﬁrst computationally-efﬁcient algorithms for actively learning some of these concept classes in the presence of random classiﬁcation noise that provide exponential improvement in the dependence on the error over their passive counterparts. In addition, we show that our algorithms can be automatically converted to efﬁcient active differentially-private algorithms. This leads to the ﬁrst differentially-private active learning algorithms with exponential label savings over the passive case. 1</p><p>4 0.93441659 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Error-Minimizing_Estimates_and_Universal_Entry-Wise_Error_Bounds_for_Low-Rank_Matrix_Completion.html">108 nips-2013-Error-Minimizing Estimates and Universal Entry-Wise Error Bounds for Low-Rank Matrix Completion</a></p>
<p>Author: Franz Kiraly, Louis Theran</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general framework for reconstructing and denoising single entries of incomplete and noisy entries. We describe: effective algorithms for deciding if and entry can be reconstructed and, if so, for reconstructing and denoising it; and a priori bounds on the error of each entry, individually. In the noiseless case our algorithm is exact. For rank-one matrices, the new algorithm is fast, admits a highly-parallel implementation, and produces an error minimizing estimate that is qualitatively close to our theoretical and the state-of-the-art Nuclear Norm and OptSpace methods. 1</p><p>5 0.89191771 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type and the MAP estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process regression. 1</p><p>6 0.89098531 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Unsupervised_Spectral_Learning_of_Finite_State_Transducers.html">342 nips-2013-Unsupervised Spectral Learning of Finite State Transducers</a></p>

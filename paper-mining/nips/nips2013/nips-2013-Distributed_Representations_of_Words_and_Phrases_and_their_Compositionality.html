<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-valued word embeddings learned by neural language models have recently been shown to capture semantic and syntactic information about words very well, setting performance records on several word similarity tasks. The best results are obtained by learning high-dimensional embeddings from very large quantities of data, which makes scalability of the training method a critical factor. We propose a simple and scalable new approach to learning word embeddings based on training log-bilinear models with noise-contrastive estimation. Our approach is simpler, faster, and produces better results than the current state-of-theart method. We achieve results comparable to the best ones reported, which were obtained on a cluster, using four times less data and more than an order of magnitude less computing time. We also investigate several model types and ﬁnd that the embeddings learned by the simpler models perform at least as well as those learned by the more complex ones. 1</p><p>3 0.25916582 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-DeViSE%3A_A_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Embedding_Model.html">81 nips-2013-DeViSE: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Greg S. Corrado, Jon Shlens, Samy Bengio, Jeff Dean, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Tomas Mikolov</p><p>Abstract: Modern visual recognition systems are often limited in their ability to scale to large numbers of object categories. This limitation is in part due to the increasing difﬁculty of acquiring sufﬁcient training data in the form of labeled images as the number of object categories grows. One remedy is to leverage data from other sources – such as text data – both to train visual models and to constrain their predictions. In this paper we present a new deep visual-semantic embedding model trained to identify visual objects using both labeled image data as well as semantic information gleaned from unannotated text. We demonstrate that this model matches state-of-the-art performance on the 1000-class ImageNet object recognition challenge while making more semantically reasonable errors, and also show that the semantic information can be exploited to make predictions about tens of thousands of image labels not observed during training. Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model. 1</p><p>4 0.12112638 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>5 0.11412044 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Zero-Shot_Learning_Through_Cross-Modal_Transfer.html">356 nips-2013-Zero-Shot Learning Through Cross-Modal Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Milind Ganjoo, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually deﬁned semantic or visual features for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty detection strategies; the ﬁrst gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes’ accuracy high. 1</p><p>6 0.10177241 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Reasoning_With_Neural_Tensor_Networks_for_Knowledge_Base_Completion.html">263 nips-2013-Reasoning With Neural Tensor Networks for Knowledge Base Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Socher, Danqi Chen, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge bases are an important resource for question answering and other tasks but often suffer from incompleteness and lack of ability to reason over their discrete entities and relationships. In this paper we introduce an expressive neural tensor network suitable for reasoning over relationships between two entities. Previous work represented entities as either discrete atomic units or with a single entity vector representation. We show that performance can be improved when entities are represented as an average of their constituting word vectors. This allows sharing of statistical strength between, for instance, facts involving the “Sumatran tiger” and “Bengal tiger.” Lastly, we demonstrate that all models improve when these word vectors are initialized with vectors learned from unsupervised large corpora. We assess the model by considering the problem of predicting additional true relations between entities given a subset of the knowledge base. Our model outperforms previous models and can classify unseen relationships in WordNet and FreeBase with an accuracy of 86.2% and 90.0%, respectively. 1</p><p>4 0.69911391 <a title="96-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Translating_Embeddings_for_Modeling_Multi-relational_Data.html">336 nips-2013-Translating Embeddings for Modeling Multi-relational Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, Oksana Yakhnenko</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multirelational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples. 1</p><p>5 0.69522464 <a title="96-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_and_using_language_via_recursive_pragmatic_reasoning_about_other_agents.html">164 nips-2013-Learning and using language via recursive pragmatic reasoning about other agents</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathaniel J. Smith, Noah Goodman, Michael Frank</p><p>Abstract: Language users are remarkably good at making inferences about speakers’ intentions in context, and children learning their native language also display substantial skill in acquiring the meanings of unknown words. These two cases are deeply related: Language users invent new terms in conversation, and language learners learn the literal meanings of words based on their pragmatic inferences about how those words are used. While pragmatic inference and word learning have both been independently characterized in probabilistic terms, no current work uniﬁes these two. We describe a model in which language learners assume that they jointly approximate a shared, external lexicon and reason recursively about the goals of others in using this lexicon. This model captures phenomena in word learning and pragmatic inference; it additionally leads to insights about the emergence of communicative systems in conversation and the mechanisms by which pragmatic inferences become incorporated into word meanings. 1</p><p>6 0.6820578 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-DeViSE%3A_A_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Embedding_Model.html">81 nips-2013-DeViSE: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model</a></p>

In this paper, we show that the naive application of MAB algorithms to search advertising for advertisement selection will produce sample selection bias that harms the search engine by decreasing expected revenue and “estimation of the largest mean” (ELM) bias that harms the advertisers by increasing game-theoretic player-regret. We then propose simple bias-correction methods with beneﬁts to both the search engine and the advertisers. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74112839 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality.html">96 nips-2013-Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</a></p>

<p>Author: Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of learning a tensor from a set of linear measurements. A prominent methodology for this problem is based on a generalization of trace norm regularization, which has been used extensively for learning low rank matrices, to the tensor setting. In this paper, we highlight some limitations of this approach and propose an alternative convex relaxation on the Euclidean ball. We then describe a technique to solve the associated regularization problem, which builds upon the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experiments on one synthetic dataset and two real datasets indicate that the proposed method improves signiﬁcantly over tensor trace norm regularization in terms of estimation error, while remaining computationally tractable. 1</p><p>4 0.58961928 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>5 0.58680731 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Tang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or neural networks are popular models used for nonlinear regression and classiﬁcation tasks. As regressors, MLPs model the conditional distribution of the predictor variables Y given the input variables X. However, this predictive distribution is assumed to be unimodal (e.g. Gaussian). For tasks involving structured prediction, the conditional distribution should be multi-modal, resulting in one-to-many mappings. By using stochastic hidden variables rather than deterministic ones, Sigmoid Belief Nets (SBNs) can induce a rich multimodal distribution in the output space. However, previously proposed learning algorithms for SBNs are not efﬁcient and unsuitable for modeling real-valued data. In this paper, we propose a stochastic feedforward network with hidden layers composed of both deterministic and stochastic variables. A new Generalized EM training procedure using importance sampling allows us to efﬁciently learn complicated conditional distributions. Our model achieves superior performance on synthetic and facial expressions datasets compared to conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Mixture Density Networks. In addition, the latent features of our model improves classiﬁcation and can learn to generate colorful textures of objects. 1</p><p>6 0.58649093 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Prediction_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">200 nips-2013-Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

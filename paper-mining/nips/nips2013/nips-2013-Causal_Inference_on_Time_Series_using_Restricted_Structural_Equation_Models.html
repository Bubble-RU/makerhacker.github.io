<p>Author: Marius Pachitariu, Biljana Petreska, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Population neural recordings with long-range temporal structure are often best understood in terms of a common underlying low-dimensional dynamical process. Advances in recording technology provide access to an ever-larger fraction of the population, but the standard computational approaches available to identify the collective dynamics scale poorly with the size of the dataset. We describe a new, scalable approach to discovering low-dimensional dynamics that underlie simultaneously recorded spike trains from a neural population. We formulate the Recurrent Linear Model (RLM) by generalising the Kalman-ﬁlter-based likelihood calculation for latent linear dynamical systems to incorporate a generalised-linear observation process. We show that RLMs describe motor-cortical population data better than either directly-coupled generalised-linear models or latent linear dynamical system models with generalised-linear observations. We also introduce the cascaded generalised-linear model (CGLM) to capture low-dimensional instantaneous correlations in neural populations. The CGLM describes the cortical recordings better than either Ising or Gaussian models and, like the RLM, can be ﬁt exactly and quickly. The CGLM can also be seen as a generalisation of a lowrank Gaussian model, in this case factor analysis. The computational tractability of the RLM and CGLM allow both to scale to very high-dimensional neural data. 1</p><p>3 0.19647111 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: I present a new online learning algorithm that extends the exponentiated gradient framework to inﬁnite dimensional spaces. My analysis shows that the algorithm is implicitly able to estimate the L2 norm of the unknown competitor, U , achieving √ a regret bound of the order of O(U log(U T + 1)) T ), instead of the standard √ O((U 2 + 1) T ), achievable without knowing U . For this analysis, I introduce novel tools for algorithms with time-varying regularizers, through the use of local smoothness. Through a lower bound, I also show that the algorithm is optimal up to log(U T ) term for linear and Lipschitz losses. 1</p><p>4 0.18832092 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Regression-tree_Tuning_in_a_Streaming_Setting.html">269 nips-2013-Regression-tree Tuning in a Streaming Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe, Francesco Orabona</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of maintaining the data-structures of a partition-based regression procedure in a setting where the training data arrives sequentially over time. We prove that it is possible to maintain such a structure in time O (log n) at ˜ any time step n while achieving a nearly-optimal regression rate of O n−2/(2+d) in terms of the unknown metric dimension d. Finally we prove a new regression lower-bound which is independent of a given data size, and hence is more appropriate for the streaming setting. 1</p><p>5 0.18317525 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC.html">48 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Learning in Gaussian Process State-Space Models with Particle MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger Frigola, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Schon, Carl Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identiﬁcation) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a ﬂexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efﬁcient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and, instead, infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity. 1</p><p>6 0.17821912 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

<p>Author: Josh S. Merel, Roy Fox, Tony Jebara, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: In a closed-loop brain-computer interface (BCI), adaptive decoders are used to learn parameters suited to decoding the user’s neural response. Feedback to the user provides information which permits the neural tuning to also adapt. We present an approach to model this process of co-adaptation between the encoding model of the neural signal and the decoding algorithm as a multi-agent formulation of the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem. In simulation we characterize how decoding performance improves as the neural encoding and adaptive decoder optimize, qualitatively resembling experimentally demonstrated closed-loop improvement. We then propose a novel, modiﬁed decoder update rule which is aware of the fact that the encoder is also changing and show it can improve simulated co-adaptation dynamics. Our modeling approach offers promise for gaining insights into co-adaptation as well as improving user learning of BCI control in practical settings.</p><p>4 0.70082283 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_inference_in_latent_Gaussian-Markov_models_from_continuous_time_observations.html">41 nips-2013-Approximate inference in latent Gaussian-Markov models from continuous time observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Botond Cseke, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approximate inference algorithm for continuous time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous time likelihoods. We show that the continuous time limit of the expectation propagation algorithm exists and results in a hybrid ﬁxed point iteration consisting of (1) expectation propagation updates for discrete time terms and (2) variational updates for the continuous time term. We introduce postinference corrections methods that improve on the marginals of the approximation. This approach extends the classical Kalman-Bucy smoothing procedure to non-Gaussian observations, enabling continuous-time inference in a variety of models, including spiking neuronal models (state-space models with point process observations) and box likelihood models. Experimental results on real and simulated data demonstrate high distributional accuracy and signiﬁcant computational savings compared to discrete-time approaches in a neural application. 1</p><p>5 0.69084984 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Gaussian_process_inference_for_the_drift_function_in_stochastic_differential_equations.html">39 nips-2013-Approximate Gaussian process inference for the drift function in stochastic differential equations</a></p>

Using a Gaussian process prior over the drift as a function of the state vector, we develop an approximate EM algorithm to deal with the unobserved, latent dynamics between observations. The posterior over states is approximated by a piecewise linearized process of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type and the MAP estimation of the drift is facilitated by a sparse Gaussian process regression. 1</p><p>6 0.61818862 <a title="62-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Dimension-Free_Exponentiated_Gradient.html">89 nips-2013-Dimension-Free Exponentiated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Po-Ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish theoretical results concerning local optima of regularized M estimators, where both loss and penalty functions are allowed to be nonconvex. Our results show that as long as the loss satisﬁes restricted strong convexity and the penalty satisﬁes suitable regularity conditions, any local optimum of the composite objective lies within statistical precision of the true parameter vector. Our theory covers a broad class of nonconvex objective functions, including corrected versions of the Lasso for errors-in-variables linear models and regression in generalized linear models using nonconvex regularizers such as SCAD and MCP. On the optimization side, we show that a simple adaptation of composite gradient descent may be used to compute a global optimum up to the statistical precision stat in log(1/ stat ) iterations, the fastest possible rate for any ﬁrst-order method. We provide simulations to illustrate the sharpness of our theoretical predictions. 1</p><p>3 0.69658875 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Local_Privacy_and_Minimax_Bounds%3A_Sharp_Rates_for_Probability_Estimation.html">177 nips-2013-Local Privacy and Minimax Bounds: Sharp Rates for Probability Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: John Duchi, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We provide a detailed study of the estimation of probability distributions— discrete and continuous—in a stringent setting in which data is kept private even from the statistician. We give sharp minimax rates of convergence for estimation in these locally private settings, exhibiting fundamental trade-offs between privacy and convergence rate, as well as providing tools to allow movement along the privacy-statistical efﬁciency continuum. One of the consequences of our results is that Warner’s classical work on randomized response is an optimal way to perform survey sampling while maintaining privacy of the respondents. 1</p><p>4 0.69614005 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_for_distributed_statistical_estimation_with_communication_constraints.html">142 nips-2013-Information-theoretic lower bounds for distributed statistical estimation with communication constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuchen Zhang, John Duchi, Michael Jordan, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We establish lower bounds on minimax risks for distributed statistical estimation under a communication budget. Such lower bounds reveal the minimum amount of communication required by any procedure to achieve the centralized minimax-optimal rates for statistical estimation. We study two classes of protocols: one in which machines send messages independently, and a second allowing for interactive communication. We establish lower bounds for several problems, including various types of location models, as well as for parameter estimation in regression models. 1</p><p>5 0.69594449 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Minimax_Theory_for_High-dimensional_Gaussian_Mixtures_with_Sparse_Mean_Separation.html">192 nips-2013-Minimax Theory for High-dimensional Gaussian Mixtures with Sparse Mean Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Azizyan, Aarti Singh, Larry Wasserman</p><p>Abstract: While several papers have investigated computationally and statistically efﬁcient methods for learning Gaussian mixtures, precise minimax bounds for their statistical performance as well as fundamental limits in high-dimensional settings are not well-understood. In this paper, we provide precise information theoretic bounds on the clustering accuracy and sample complexity of learning a mixture of two isotropic Gaussians in high dimensions under small mean separation. If there is a sparse subset of relevant dimensions that determine the mean separation, then the sample complexity only depends on the number of relevant dimensions and mean separation, and can be achieved by a simple computationally efﬁcient procedure. Our results provide the ﬁrst step of a theoretical basis for recent methods that combine feature selection and clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.69529158 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Dynamic_Parameters_in_Social_Networks.html">228 nips-2013-Online Learning of Dynamic Parameters in Social Networks</a></p>

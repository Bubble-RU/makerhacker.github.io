<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>3 0.24380626 <a title="347-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Robust_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">273 nips-2013-Reinforcement Learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Shiau Hong Lim, Huan Xu, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge in Markov decision processes is to ensure robustness with respect to unexpected or adversarial system behavior while taking advantage of well-behaving parts of the system. We consider a problem setting where some unknown parts of the state space can have arbitrary transitions while other parts are purely stochastic. We devise an algorithm that is adaptive to potentially adversarial behavior and show that it achieves similar regret bounds as the purely stochastic case. 1</p><p>4 0.2397498 <a title="347-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Symbolic_Opportunistic_Policy_Iteration_for_Factored-Action_MDPs.html">322 nips-2013-Symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration for Factored-Action MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Aswin Raghavan, Roni Khardon, Alan Fern, Prasad Tadepalli</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the scalability of symbolic planning under uncertainty with factored states and actions. Our ﬁrst contribution is a symbolic implementation of Modiﬁed Policy Iteration (MPI) for factored actions that views policy evaluation as policy-constrained value iteration (VI). Unfortunately, a na¨ve approach ı to enforce policy constraints can lead to large memory requirements, sometimes making symbolic MPI worse than VI. We address this through our second and main contribution, symbolic Opportunistic Policy Iteration (OPI), which is a novel convergent algorithm lying between VI and MPI, that applies policy constraints if it does not increase the size of the value function representation, and otherwise performs VI backups. We also give a memory bounded version of this algorithm allowing a space-time tradeoff. Empirical results show signiﬁcantly improved scalability over state-of-the-art symbolic planners. 1</p><p>5 0.23668136 <a title="347-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_policy_iteration_and_natural_actor-critic%3A_A_unifying_view_and_a_non-optimality_result.html">239 nips-2013-Optimistic policy iteration and natural actor-critic: A unifying view and a non-optimality result</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: Approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem are often categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. As our ﬁrst main result, we show that an important subset of the latter methodology is, in fact, a limiting special case of a general formulation of the former methodology; optimistic policy iteration encompasses not only most of the greedy value function methods but also natural actor-critic methods, and permits one to directly interpolate between them. The resulting continuum adjusts the strength of the Markov assumption in policy improvement and, as such, can be seen as dual in spirit to the continuum in TD(λ)-style algorithms in policy evaluation. As our second main result, we show for a substantial subset of softgreedy value function approaches that, while having the potential to avoid policy oscillation and policy chattering, this subset can never converge toward an optimal policy, except in a certain pathological case. Consequently, in the context of approximations (either in state estimation or in value function representation), the majority of greedy value function methods seem to be deemed to suffer either from the risk of oscillation/chattering or from the presence of systematic sub-optimality. 1</p><p>6 0.22463438 <a title="347-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Actor-Critic_Algorithms_for_Risk-Sensitive_MDPs.html">24 nips-2013-Actor-Critic Algorithms for Risk-Sensitive MDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Aijun Bai, Feng Wu, Xiaoping Chen</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo tree search (MCTS) has been drawing great interest in recent years for planning and learning under uncertainty. One of the key challenges is the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. To address this, we present a novel approach for MCTS using Bayesian mixture modeling and inference based Thompson sampling and apply it to the problem of online planning in MDPs. Our algorithm, named Dirichlet-NormalGamma MCTS (DNG-MCTS), models the uncertainty of the accumulated reward for actions in the search tree as a mixture of Normal distributions. We perform inferences on the mixture in Bayesian settings by choosing conjugate priors in the form of combinations of Dirichlet and NormalGamma distributions and select the best action at each decision node using Thompson sampling. Experimental results conﬁrm that our algorithm advances the state-of-the-art UCT approach with better values on several benchmark problems. 1</p><p>4 0.78400493 <a title="347-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Aggregating_Optimistic_Planning_Trees_for_Solving_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">32 nips-2013-Aggregating Optimistic Planning Trees for Solving Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunnar Kedenburg, Raphael Fonteneau, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of online planning in Markov decision processes using a randomized simulator, under a budget constraint. We propose a new algorithm which is based on the construction of a forest of planning trees, where each tree corresponds to a random realization of the stochastic environment. The trees are constructed using a “safe” optimistic planning strategy combining the optimistic principle (in order to explore the most promising part of the search space ﬁrst) with a safety principle (which guarantees a certain amount of uniform exploration). In the decision-making step of the algorithm, the individual trees are aggregated and an immediate action is recommended. We provide a ﬁnite-sample analysis and discuss the trade-off between the principles of optimism and safety. We also report numerical results on a benchmark problem. Our algorithm performs as well as state-of-the-art optimistic planning algorithms, and better than a related algorithm which additionally assumes the knowledge of all transition distributions. 1</p><p>5 0.75214386 <a title="347-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-DESPOT%3A_Online_POMDP_Planning_with_Regularization.html">79 nips-2013-DESPOT: Online POMDP Planning with Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Adhiraj Somani, Nan Ye, David Hsu, Wee Sun Lee</p><p>Abstract: POMDPs provide a principled framework for planning under uncertainty, but are computationally intractable, due to the “curse of dimensionality” and the “curse of history”. This paper presents an online POMDP algorithm that alleviates these difﬁculties by focusing the search on a set of randomly sampled scenarios. A Determinized Sparse Partially Observable Tree (DESPOT) compactly captures the execution of all policies on these scenarios. Our Regularized DESPOT (R-DESPOT) algorithm searches the DESPOT for a policy, while optimally balancing the size of the policy and its estimated value obtained under the sampled scenarios. We give an output-sensitive performance bound for all policies derived from a DESPOT, and show that R-DESPOT works well if a small optimal policy exists. We also give an anytime algorithm that approximates R-DESPOT. Experiments show strong results, compared with two of the fastest online POMDP algorithms.

<p>Author: David J. Weiss, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative methods for learning structured models have enabled wide-spread use of very rich feature representations. However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to ﬁnetune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control ﬁne-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting nonhomogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efﬁcient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input. We demonstrate signiﬁcant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is also faster, with similar results on an OCR task. 1</p><p>3 0.92683649 <a title="347-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Projecting_Ising_Model_Parameters_for_Fast_Mixing.html">258 nips-2013-Projecting Ising Model Parameters for Fast Mixing</a></p>
<p>Author: Justin Domke, Xianghang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Inference in general Ising models is difﬁcult, due to high treewidth making treebased algorithms intractable. Moreover, when interactions are strong, Gibbs sampling may take exponential time to converge to the stationary distribution. We present an algorithm to project Ising model parameters onto a parameter set that is guaranteed to be fast mixing, under several divergences. We ﬁnd that Gibbs sampling using the projected parameters is more accurate than with the original parameters when interaction strengths are strong and when limited time is available for sampling.</p><p>4 0.91067833 <a title="347-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Action_is_in_the_Eye_of_the_Beholder%3A_Eye-gaze_Driven_Model_for_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization.html">22 nips-2013-Action is in the Eye of the Beholder: Eye-gaze Driven Model for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nataliya Shapovalova, Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a weakly-supervised structured learning approach for recognition and spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. As part of the proposed approach, we develop a generalization of the Max-Path search algorithm which allows us to efﬁciently search over a structured space of multiple spatio-temporal paths while also incorporating context information into the model. Instead of using spatial annotations in the form of bounding boxes to guide the latent model during training, we utilize human gaze data in the form of a weak supervisory signal. This is achieved by incorporating eye gaze, along with the classiﬁcation, into the structured loss within the latent SVM learning framework. Experiments on a challenging benchmark dataset, UCF-Sports, show that our model is more accurate, in terms of classiﬁcation, and achieves state-of-the-art results in localization. In addition, our model can produce top-down saliency maps conditioned on the classiﬁcation label and localized latent paths. 1</p><p>5 0.88905686 <a title="347-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_entropy_estimation_for_binary_spike_train_data_using_parametric_prior_knowledge.html">51 nips-2013-Bayesian entropy estimation for binary spike train data using parametric prior knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan W. Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Shannon’s entropy is a basic quantity in information theory, and a fundamental building block for the analysis of neural codes. Estimating the entropy of a discrete distribution from samples is an important and difﬁcult problem that has received considerable attention in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. However, neural responses have characteristic statistical structure that generic entropy estimators fail to exploit. For example, existing Bayesian entropy estimators make the naive assumption that all spike words are equally likely a priori, which makes for an inefﬁcient allocation of prior probability mass in cases where spikes are sparse. Here we develop Bayesian estimators for the entropy of binary spike trains using priors designed to ﬂexibly exploit the statistical structure of simultaneouslyrecorded spike responses. We deﬁne two prior distributions over spike words using mixtures of Dirichlet distributions centered on simple parametric models. The parametric model captures high-level statistical features of the data, such as the average spike count in a spike word, which allows the posterior over entropy to concentrate more rapidly than with standard estimators (e.g., in cases where the probability of spiking differs strongly from 0.5). Conversely, the Dirichlet distributions assign prior mass to distributions far from the parametric model, ensuring consistent estimates for arbitrary distributions. We devise a compact representation of the data and prior that allow for computationally efﬁcient implementations of Bayesian least squares and empirical Bayes entropy estimators with large numbers of neurons. We apply these estimators to simulated and real neural data and show that they substantially outperform traditional methods.</p><p>6 0.88631237 <a title="347-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>

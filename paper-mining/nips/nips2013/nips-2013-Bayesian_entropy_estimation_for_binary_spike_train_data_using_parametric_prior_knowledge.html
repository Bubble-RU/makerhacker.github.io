<p>Author: David Carlson, Vinayak Rao, Joshua T. Vogelstein, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: With simultaneous measurements from ever increasing populations of neurons, there is a growing need for sophisticated tools to recover signals from individual neurons. In electrophysiology experiments, this classically proceeds in a two-step process: (i) threshold the waveforms to detect putative spikes and (ii) cluster the waveforms into single units (neurons). We extend previous Bayesian nonparametric models of neural spiking to jointly detect and cluster neurons using a Gamma process model. Importantly, we develop an online approximate inference scheme enabling real-time analysis, with performance exceeding the previous state-of-theart. Via exploratory data analysis—using data with partial ground truth as well as two novel data sets—we ﬁnd several features of our model collectively contribute to our improved performance including: (i) accounting for colored noise, (ii) detecting overlapping spikes, (iii) tracking waveform dynamics, and (iv) using multiple channels. We hope to enable novel experiments simultaneously measuring many thousands of neurons and possibly adapting stimuli dynamically to probe ever deeper into the mysteries of the brain. 1</p><p>3 0.30828956 <a title="51-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>4 0.26700598 <a title="51-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Spike_train_entropy-rate_estimation_using_hierarchical_Dirichlet_process_priors.html">308 nips-2013-Spike train entropy-rate estimation using hierarchical Dirichlet process priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Karin C. Knudson, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Entropy rate quantiﬁes the amount of disorder in a stochastic process. For spiking neurons, the entropy rate places an upper bound on the rate at which the spike train can convey stimulus information, and a large literature has focused on the problem of estimating entropy rate from spike train data. Here we present Bayes least squares and empirical Bayesian entropy rate estimators for binary spike trains using hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) priors. Our estimator leverages the fact that the entropy rate of an ergodic Markov Chain with known transition probabilities can be calculated analytically, and many stochastic processes that are non-Markovian can still be well approximated by Markov processes of sufﬁcient depth. Choosing an appropriate depth of Markov model presents challenges due to possibly long time dependencies and short data sequences: a deeper model can better account for long time dependencies, but is more difﬁcult to infer from limited data. Our approach mitigates this difﬁculty by using a hierarchical prior to share statistical power across Markov chains of different depths. We present both a fully Bayesian and empirical Bayes entropy rate estimator based on this model, and demonstrate their performance on simulated and real neural spike train data. 1</p><p>5 0.26660648 <a title="51-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Universal_models_for_binary_spike_patterns_using_centered_Dirichlet_processes.html">341 nips-2013-Universal models for binary spike patterns using centered Dirichlet processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Il M. Park, Evan W. Archer, Kenneth Latimer, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models for binary spike patterns provide a powerful tool for understanding the statistical dependencies in large-scale neural recordings. Maximum entropy (or “maxent”) models, which seek to explain dependencies in terms of low-order interactions between neurons, have enjoyed remarkable success in modeling such patterns, particularly for small groups of neurons. However, these models are computationally intractable for large populations, and low-order maxent models have been shown to be inadequate for some datasets. To overcome these limitations, we propose a family of “universal” models for binary spike patterns, where universality refers to the ability to model arbitrary distributions over all 2m binary patterns. We construct universal models using a Dirichlet process centered on a well-behaved parametric base measure, which naturally combines the ﬂexibility of a histogram and the parsimony of a parametric model. We derive computationally efﬁcient inference methods using Bernoulli and cascaded logistic base measures, which scale tractably to large populations. We also establish a condition for equivalence between the cascaded logistic and the 2nd-order maxent or “Ising” model, making cascaded logistic a reasonable choice for base measure in a universal model. We illustrate the performance of these models using neural data. 1</p><p>6 0.23800966 <a title="51-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_nonnegative_deconvolution_for_compressive_calcium_imaging%3A_algorithms_and_phase_transitions.html">304 nips-2013-Sparse nonnegative deconvolution for compressive calcium imaging: algorithms and phase transitions</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Albers, Maren Westkott, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: Recent extensions of the Perceptron as the Tempotron and the Chronotron suggest that this theoretical concept is highly relevant for understanding networks of spiking neurons in the brain. It is not known, however, how the computational power of the Perceptron might be accomplished by the plasticity mechanisms of real synapses. Here we prove that spike-timing-dependent plasticity having an anti-Hebbian form for excitatory synapses as well as a spike-timing-dependent plasticity of Hebbian shape for inhibitory synapses are sufﬁcient for realizing the original Perceptron Learning Rule if these respective plasticity mechanisms act in concert with the hyperpolarisation of the post-synaptic neurons. We also show that with these simple yet biologically realistic dynamics Tempotrons and Chronotrons are learned. The proposed mechanism enables incremental associative learning from a continuous stream of patterns and might therefore underly the acquisition of long term memories in cortex. Our results underline that learning processes in realistic networks of spiking neurons depend crucially on the interactions of synaptic plasticity mechanisms with the dynamics of participating neurons.</p><p>6 0.67189777 <a title="51-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Justin Domke, Xianghang Liu</p><p>Abstract: Inference in general Ising models is difﬁcult, due to high treewidth making treebased algorithms intractable. Moreover, when interactions are strong, Gibbs sampling may take exponential time to converge to the stationary distribution. We present an algorithm to project Ising model parameters onto a parameter set that is guaranteed to be fast mixing, under several divergences. We ﬁnd that Gibbs sampling using the projected parameters is more accurate than with the original parameters when interaction strengths are strong and when limited time is available for sampling.</p><p>2 0.96314842 <a title="51-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Variational_Planning_for_Graph-based_MDPs.html">347 nips-2013-Variational Planning for Graph-based MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Cheng, Qiang Liu, Feng Chen, Alex Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) are extremely useful for modeling and solving sequential decision making problems. Graph-based MDPs provide a compact representation for MDPs with large numbers of random variables. However, the complexity of exactly solving a graph-based MDP usually grows exponentially in the number of variables, which limits their application. We present a new variational framework to describe and solve the planning problem of MDPs, and derive both exact and approximate planning algorithms. In particular, by exploiting the graph structure of graph-based MDPs, we propose a factored variational value iteration algorithm in which the value function is ﬁrst approximated by the multiplication of local-scope value functions, then solved by minimizing a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The KL divergence is optimized using the belief propagation algorithm, with complexity exponential in only the cluster size of the graph. Experimental comparison on different models shows that our algorithm outperforms existing approximation algorithms at ﬁnding good policies. 1</p><p>3 0.95856458 <a title="51-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Adaptive_Value_of_Information_for_Structured_Prediction.html">150 nips-2013-Learning Adaptive Value of Information for Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: David J. Weiss, Ben Taskar</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative methods for learning structured models have enabled wide-spread use of very rich feature representations. However, the computational cost of feature extraction is prohibitive for large-scale or time-sensitive applications, often dominating the cost of inference in the models. Signiﬁcant efforts have been devoted to sparsity-based model selection to decrease this cost. Such feature selection methods control computation statically and miss the opportunity to ﬁnetune feature extraction to each input at run-time. We address the key challenge of learning to control ﬁne-grained feature extraction adaptively, exploiting nonhomogeneity of the data. We propose an architecture that uses a rich feedback loop between extraction and prediction. The run-time control policy is learned using efﬁcient value-function approximation, which adaptively determines the value of information of features at the level of individual variables for each input. We demonstrate signiﬁcant speedups over state-of-the-art methods on two challenging datasets. For articulated pose estimation in video, we achieve a more accurate state-of-the-art model that is also faster, with similar results on an OCR task. 1</p><p>4 0.93840414 <a title="51-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Action_is_in_the_Eye_of_the_Beholder%3A_Eye-gaze_Driven_Model_for_Spatio-Temporal_Action_Localization.html">22 nips-2013-Action is in the Eye of the Beholder: Eye-gaze Driven Model for Spatio-Temporal Action Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nataliya Shapovalova, Michalis Raptis, Leonid Sigal, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a weakly-supervised structured learning approach for recognition and spatio-temporal localization of actions in video. As part of the proposed approach, we develop a generalization of the Max-Path search algorithm which allows us to efﬁciently search over a structured space of multiple spatio-temporal paths while also incorporating context information into the model. Instead of using spatial annotations in the form of bounding boxes to guide the latent model during training, we utilize human gaze data in the form of a weak supervisory signal. This is achieved by incorporating eye gaze, along with the classiﬁcation, into the structured loss within the latent SVM learning framework. Experiments on a challenging benchmark dataset, UCF-Sports, show that our model is more accurate, in terms of classiﬁcation, and achieves state-of-the-art results in localization. In addition, our model can produce top-down saliency maps conditioned on the classiﬁcation label and localized latent paths. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.93816209 <a title="51-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_entropy_estimation_for_binary_spike_train_data_using_parametric_prior_knowledge.html">51 nips-2013-Bayesian entropy estimation for binary spike train data using parametric prior knowledge</a></p>
<p>Author: Evan W. Archer, Il M. Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Shannon’s entropy is a basic quantity in information theory, and a fundamental building block for the analysis of neural codes. Estimating the entropy of a discrete distribution from samples is an important and difﬁcult problem that has received considerable attention in statistics and theoretical neuroscience. However, neural responses have characteristic statistical structure that generic entropy estimators fail to exploit. For example, existing Bayesian entropy estimators make the naive assumption that all spike words are equally likely a priori, which makes for an inefﬁcient allocation of prior probability mass in cases where spikes are sparse. Here we develop Bayesian estimators for the entropy of binary spike trains using priors designed to ﬂexibly exploit the statistical structure of simultaneouslyrecorded spike responses. We deﬁne two prior distributions over spike words using mixtures of Dirichlet distributions centered on simple parametric models. The parametric model captures high-level statistical features of the data, such as the average spike count in a spike word, which allows the posterior over entropy to concentrate more rapidly than with standard estimators (e.g., in cases where the probability of spiking differs strongly from 0.5). Conversely, the Dirichlet distributions assign prior mass to distributions far from the parametric model, ensuring consistent estimates for arbitrary distributions. We devise a compact representation of the data and prior that allow for computationally efﬁcient implementations of Bayesian least squares and empirical Bayes entropy estimators with large numbers of neurons. We apply these estimators to simulated and real neural data and show that they substantially outperform traditional methods.</p><p>6 0.91691554 <a title="51-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>

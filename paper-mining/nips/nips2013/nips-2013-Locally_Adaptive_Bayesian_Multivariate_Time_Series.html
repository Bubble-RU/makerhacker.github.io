<p>Author: Christina E. Lee, Asuman Ozdaglar, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Computing the stationary distribution of a large ﬁnite or countably inﬁnite state space Markov Chain (MC) has become central in many problems such as statistical inference and network analysis. Standard methods involve large matrix multiplications as in power iteration, or simulations of long random walks, as in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Power iteration is costly, as it involves computation at every state. For MCMC, it is difﬁcult to determine whether the random walks are long enough to guarantee convergence. In this paper, we provide a novel algorithm that answers whether a chosen state in a MC has stationary probability larger than some ∆ ∈ (0, 1), and outputs an estimate of the stationary probability. Our algorithm is constant time, using information from a local neighborhood of the state on the graph induced by the MC, which has constant size relative to the state space. The multiplicative error of the estimate is upper bounded by a function of the mixing properties of the MC. Simulation results show MCs for which this method gives tight estimates. 1</p><p>3 0.12639114 <a title="178-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Scalable_Influence_Estimation_in_Continuous-Time_Diffusion_Networks.html">288 nips-2013-Scalable Influence Estimation in Continuous-Time Diffusion Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Du, Le Song, Manuel Gomez-Rodriguez, Hongyuan Zha</p><p>Abstract: If a piece of information is released from a media site, can we predict whether it may spread to one million web pages, in a month ? This inﬂuence estimation problem is very challenging since both the time-sensitive nature of the task and the requirement of scalability need to be addressed simultaneously. In this paper, we propose a randomized algorithm for inﬂuence estimation in continuous-time diffusion networks. Our algorithm can estimate the inﬂuence of every node in a network with |V| nodes and |E| edges to an accuracy of using n = O(1/ 2 ) randomizations and up to logarithmic factors O(n|E|+n|V|) computations. When used as a subroutine in a greedy inﬂuence maximization approach, our proposed algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd a set of C nodes with the inﬂuence of at least (1 − 1/e) OPT −2C , where OPT is the optimal value. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data show that the proposed algorithm can easily scale up to networks of millions of nodes while signiﬁcantly improves over previous state-of-the-arts in terms of the accuracy of the estimated inﬂuence and the quality of the selected nodes in maximizing the inﬂuence. 1</p><p>4 0.11728706 <a title="178-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Hidden_Markov_Models_from_Non-sequence_Data_via_Tensor_Decomposition.html">155 nips-2013-Learning Hidden Markov Models from Non-sequence Data via Tensor Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Tzu-Kuo Huang, Jeff Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Learning dynamic models from observed data has been a central issue in many scientiﬁc studies or engineering tasks. The usual setting is that data are collected sequentially from trajectories of some dynamical system operation. In quite a few modern scientiﬁc modeling tasks, however, it turns out that reliable sequential data are rather difﬁcult to gather, whereas out-of-order snapshots are much easier to obtain. Examples include the modeling of galaxies, chronic diseases such Alzheimer’s, or certain biological processes. Existing methods for learning dynamic model from non-sequence data are mostly based on Expectation-Maximization, which involves non-convex optimization and is thus hard to analyze. Inspired by recent advances in spectral learning methods, we propose to study this problem from a different perspective: moment matching and spectral decomposition. Under that framework, we identify reasonable assumptions on the generative process of non-sequence data, and propose learning algorithms based on the tensor decomposition method [2] to provably recover ﬁrstorder Markov models and hidden Markov models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst formal guarantee on learning from non-sequence data. Preliminary simulation results conﬁrm our theoretical ﬁndings. 1</p><p>5 0.1117253 <a title="178-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC.html">48 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Learning in Gaussian Process State-Space Models with Particle MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger Frigola, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Schon, Carl Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identiﬁcation) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a ﬂexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efﬁcient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and, instead, infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity. 1</p><p>6 0.099386998 <a title="178-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_of_Nonparametric_Mixture_Models_via_Sequential_Variational_Approximation.html">229 nips-2013-Online Learning of Nonparametric Mixture Models via Sequential Variational Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tetsuro Morimura, Takayuki Osogami, Tsuyoshi Ide</p><p>Abstract: The Markov chain is a convenient tool to represent the dynamics of complex systems such as trafﬁc and social systems, where probabilistic transition takes place between internal states. A Markov chain is characterized by initial-state probabilities and a state-transition probability matrix. In the traditional setting, a major goal is to study properties of a Markov chain when those probabilities are known. This paper tackles an inverse version of the problem: we ﬁnd those probabilities from partial observations at a limited number of states. The observations include the frequency of visiting a state and the rate of reaching a state from another. Practical examples of this task include trafﬁc monitoring systems in cities, where we need to infer the trafﬁc volume on single link on a road network from a limited number of observation points. We formulate this task as a regularized optimization problem, which is efﬁciently solved using the notion of natural gradient. Using synthetic and real-world data sets including city trafﬁc monitoring data, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>5 0.52593505 <a title="178-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Variational_Inference_for_Mahalanobis_Distance_Metrics_in_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">346 nips-2013-Variational Inference for Mahalanobis Distance Metrics in Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Michalis Titsias, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel variational method that allows to approximately integrate out kernel hyperparameters, such as length-scales, in Gaussian process regression. This approach consists of a novel variant of the variational framework that has been recently developed for the Gaussian process latent variable model which additionally makes use of a standardised representation of the Gaussian process. We consider this technique for learning Mahalanobis distance metrics in a Gaussian process regression setting and provide experimental evaluations and comparisons with existing methods by considering datasets with high-dimensional inputs. 1</p><p>6 0.50435424 <a title="178-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Inverses.html">161 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Inverses</a></p>

I.e. by approximating the similarity between x and x as the hamming distance between f (x) and g(x ), for two distinct binary codes f, g, rather than as the hamming distance between f (x) and f (x ). 1</p><p>3 0.71874797 <a title="178-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_nonnegative_deconvolution_for_compressive_calcium_imaging%3A_algorithms_and_phase_transitions.html">304 nips-2013-Sparse nonnegative deconvolution for compressive calcium imaging: algorithms and phase transitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Eftychios A. Pnevmatikakis, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We propose a compressed sensing (CS) calcium imaging framework for monitoring large neuronal populations, where we image randomized projections of the spatial calcium concentration at each timestep, instead of measuring the concentration at individual locations. We develop scalable nonnegative deconvolution methods for extracting the neuronal spike time series from such observations. We also address the problem of demixing the spatial locations of the neurons using rank-penalized matrix factorization methods. By exploiting the sparsity of neural spiking we demonstrate that the number of measurements needed per timestep is signiﬁcantly smaller than the total number of neurons, a result that can potentially enable imaging of larger populations at considerably faster rates compared to traditional raster-scanning techniques. Unlike traditional CS setups, our problem involves a block-diagonal sensing matrix and a non-orthogonal sparse basis that spans multiple timesteps. We provide tight approximations to the number of measurements needed for perfect deconvolution for certain classes of spiking processes, and show that this number undergoes a “phase transition,” which we characterize using modern tools relating conic geometry to compressed sensing. 1</p><p>4 0.70592457 <a title="178-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Eluder_Dimension_and_the_Sample_Complexity_of_Optimistic_Exploration.html">106 nips-2013-Eluder Dimension and the Sample Complexity of Optimistic Exploration</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Russo, Benjamin Van Roy</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the sample complexity of the multi-armed bandit with dependencies among the arms. Some of the most successful algorithms for this problem use the principle of optimism in the face of uncertainty to guide exploration. The clearest example of this is the class of upper conﬁdence bound (UCB) algorithms, but recent work has shown that a simple posterior sampling algorithm, sometimes called Thompson sampling, can be analyzed in the same manner as optimistic approaches. In this paper, we develop a regret bound that holds for both classes of algorithms. This bound applies broadly and can be specialized to many model classes. It depends on a new notion we refer to as the eluder dimension, which measures the degree of dependence among action rewards. Compared to UCB algorithm regret bounds for speciﬁc model classes, our general bound matches the best available for linear models and is stronger than the best available for generalized linear models. 1</p><p>5 0.68909621 <a title="178-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Stochastic_Feedforward_Neural_Networks.html">160 nips-2013-Learning Stochastic Feedforward Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Tang, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) or neural networks are popular models used for nonlinear regression and classiﬁcation tasks. As regressors, MLPs model the conditional distribution of the predictor variables Y given the input variables X. However, this predictive distribution is assumed to be unimodal (e.g. Gaussian). For tasks involving structured prediction, the conditional distribution should be multi-modal, resulting in one-to-many mappings. By using stochastic hidden variables rather than deterministic ones, Sigmoid Belief Nets (SBNs) can induce a rich multimodal distribution in the output space. However, previously proposed learning algorithms for SBNs are not efﬁcient and unsuitable for modeling real-valued data. In this paper, we propose a stochastic feedforward network with hidden layers composed of both deterministic and stochastic variables. A new Generalized EM training procedure using importance sampling allows us to efﬁciently learn complicated conditional distributions. Our model achieves superior performance on synthetic and facial expressions datasets compared to conditional Restricted Boltzmann Machines and Mixture Density Networks. In addition, the latent features of our model improves classiﬁcation and can learn to generate colorful textures of objects. 1</p><p>6 0.68206203 <a title="178-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Compete_to_Compute.html">64 nips-2013-Compete to Compute</a></p>

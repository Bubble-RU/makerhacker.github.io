<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi, Peter Bartlett, Varun Kanade, Yevgeny Seldin, Csaba Szepesvari</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) when both the transition distributions and loss functions are chosen by an adversary. We present an algorithm that, under a mixing assumption, achieves p O( T log |⇧| + log |⇧|) regret with respect to a comparison set of policies ⇧. The regret is independent of the size of the state and action spaces. When expectations over sample paths can be computed efﬁciently and the comparison set ⇧ has polynomial size, this algorithm is efﬁcient. We also consider the episodic adversarial online shortest path problem. Here, in each episode an adversary may choose a weighted directed acyclic graph with an identiﬁed start and ﬁnish node. The goal of the learning algorithm is to choose a path that minimizes the loss while traversing from the start to ﬁnish node. At the end of each episode the loss function (given by weights on the edges) is revealed to the learning algorithm. The goal is to minimize regret with respect to a ﬁxed policy for selecting paths. This problem is a special case of the online MDP problem. It was shown that for randomly chosen graphs and adversarial losses, the problem can be efﬁciently solved. We show that it also can be efﬁciently solved for adversarial graphs and randomly chosen losses. When both graphs and losses are adversarially chosen, we show that designing efﬁcient algorithms for the adversarial online shortest path problem (and hence for the adversarial MDP problem) is as hard as learning parity with noise, a notoriously difﬁcult problem that has been used to design efﬁcient cryptographic schemes. Finally, we present an efﬁcient algorithm whose regret scales linearly with the number of distinct graphs. 1</p><p>3 0.33976883 <a title="273-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_with_Switching_Costs_and_Other_Adaptive_Adversaries.html">231 nips-2013-Online Learning with Switching Costs and Other Adaptive Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Ofer Dekel, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We study the power of different types of adaptive (nonoblivious) adversaries in the setting of prediction with expert advice, under both full-information and bandit feedback. We measure the player’s performance using a new notion of regret, also known as policy regret, which better captures the adversary’s adaptiveness to the player’s behavior. In a setting where losses are allowed to drift, we characterize —in a nearly complete manner— the power of adaptive adversaries with bounded memories and switching costs. In particular, we show that with switch� ing costs, the attainable rate with bandit feedback is Θ(T 2/3 ). Interestingly, this √ rate is signiﬁcantly worse than the Θ( T ) rate attainable with switching costs in the full-information case. Via a novel reduction from experts to bandits, we also � show that a bounded memory adversary can force Θ(T 2/3 ) regret even in the full information case, proving that switching costs are easier to control than bounded memory adversaries. Our lower bounds rely on a new stochastic adversary strategy that generates loss processes with strong dependencies. 1</p><p>4 0.29746255 <a title="273-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Adaptive_Step-Size_for_Policy_Gradient_Methods.html">28 nips-2013-Adaptive Step-Size for Policy Gradient Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Matteo Pirotta, Marcello Restelli, Luca Bascetta</p><p>Abstract: In the last decade, policy gradient methods have signiﬁcantly grown in popularity in the reinforcement–learning ﬁeld. In particular, they have been largely employed in motor control and robotic applications, thanks to their ability to cope with continuous state and action domains and partial observable problems. Policy gradient researches have been mainly focused on the identiﬁcation of effective gradient directions and the proposal of efﬁcient estimation algorithms. Nonetheless, the performance of policy gradient methods is determined not only by the gradient direction, since convergence properties are strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of the step size: small values imply slow convergence rate, while large values may lead to oscillations or even divergence of the policy parameters. Step–size value is usually chosen by hand tuning and still little attention has been paid to its automatic selection. In this paper, we propose to determine the learning rate by maximizing a lower bound to the expected performance gain. Focusing on Gaussian policies, we derive a lower bound that is second–order polynomial of the step size, and we show how a simpliﬁed version of such lower bound can be maximized when the gradient is estimated from trajectory samples. The properties of the proposed approach are empirically evaluated in a linear–quadratic regulator problem. 1</p><p>5 0.29323846 <a title="273-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_learning_in_episodic_Markovian_decision_processes_by_relative_entropy_policy_search.html">235 nips-2013-Online learning in episodic Markovian decision processes by relative entropy policy search</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Zimin, Gergely Neu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online learning in ﬁnite episodic Markov decision processes (MDPs) where the loss function is allowed to change between episodes. The natural performance measure in this learning problem is the regret deﬁned as the difference between the total loss of the best stationary policy and the total loss suffered by the learner. We assume that the learner is given access to a ﬁnite action space A and the state space X has a layered structure with L layers, so that state transitions are only possible between consecutive layers. We describe a variant of the recently proposed Relative Entropy Policy Search algorithm and show that its regret after T episodes is 2 L|X ||A|T log(|X ||A|/L) in the bandit setting and 2L T log(|X ||A|/L) in the full information setting, given that the learner has perfect knowledge of the transition probabilities of the underlying MDP. These guarantees largely improve previously known results under much milder assumptions and cannot be signiﬁcantly improved under general assumptions. 1</p><p>6 0.27918762 <a title="273-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_policy_iteration_and_natural_actor-critic%3A_A_unifying_view_and_a_non-optimality_result.html">239 nips-2013-Optimistic policy iteration and natural actor-critic: A unifying view and a non-optimality result</a></p>

<p>Author: Asrar Ahmed, Pradeep Varakantham, Yossiri Adulyasak, Patrick Jaillet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we seek robust policies for uncertain Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Most robust optimization approaches for these problems have focussed on the computation of maximin policies which maximize the value corresponding to the worst realization of the uncertainty. Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.</p><p>4 0.82086474 <a title="273-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-%28More%29_Efficient_Reinforcement_Learning_via_Posterior_Sampling.html">1 nips-2013-(More) Efficient Reinforcement Learning via Posterior Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Osband, Dan Russo, Benjamin Van Roy</p><p>Abstract: Most provably-eﬃcient reinforcement learning algorithms introduce optimism about poorly-understood states and actions to encourage exploration. We study an alternative approach for eﬃcient exploration: posterior sampling for reinforcement learning (PSRL). This algorithm proceeds in repeated episodes of known duration. At the start of each episode, PSRL updates a prior distribution over Markov decision processes and takes one sample from this posterior. PSRL then follows the policy that is optimal for this sample during the episode. The algorithm is conceptually simple, computationally eﬃcient and allows an √ agent to encode prior knowledge ˜ in a natural way. We establish an O(τ S AT ) bound on expected regret, where T is time, τ is the episode length and S and A are the cardinalities of the state and action spaces. This bound is one of the ﬁrst for an algorithm not based on optimism, and close to the state of the art for any reinforcement learning algorithm. We show through simulation that PSRL signiﬁcantly outperforms existing algorithms with similar regret bounds. 1</p><p>5 0.81742924 <a title="273-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Online_Learning_in_Markov_Decision_Processes_with_Adversarially_Chosen_Transition_Probability_Distributions.html">227 nips-2013-Online Learning in Markov Decision Processes with Adversarially Chosen Transition Probability Distributions</a></p>

For active learning on GRFs, the commonly used V-optimality criterion queries nodes that reduce the L2 (regression) loss. V-optimality satisﬁes a submodularity property showing that greedy reduction produces a (1 − 1/e) globally optimal solution. However, L2 loss may not characterise the true nature of 0/1 loss in classiﬁcation problems and thus may not be the best choice for active learning. We consider a new criterion we call Σ-optimality, which queries the node that minimizes the sum of the elements in the predictive covariance. Σ-optimality directly optimizes the risk of the surveying problem, which is to determine the proportion of nodes belonging to one class. In this paper we extend submodularity guarantees from V-optimality to Σ-optimality using properties speciﬁc to GRFs. We further show that GRFs satisfy the suppressor-free condition in addition to the conditional independence inherited from Markov random ﬁelds. We test Σoptimality on real-world graphs with both synthetic and real data and show that it outperforms V-optimality and other related methods on classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.80893523 <a title="273-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Better_Approximation_and_Faster_Algorithm_Using_the_Proximal_Average.html">56 nips-2013-Better Approximation and Faster Algorithm Using the Proximal Average</a></p>
<p>Author: Yao-Liang Yu</p><p>Abstract: It is a common practice to approximate “complicated” functions with more friendly ones. In large-scale machine learning applications, nonsmooth losses/regularizers that entail great computational challenges are usually approximated by smooth functions. We re-examine this powerful methodology and point out a nonsmooth approximation which simply pretends the linearity of the proximal map. The new approximation is justiﬁed using a recent convex analysis tool— proximal average, and yields a novel proximal gradient algorithm that is strictly better than the one based on smoothing, without incurring any extra overhead. Numerical experiments conducted on two important applications, overlapping group lasso and graph-guided fused lasso, corroborate the theoretical claims. 1</p><p>4 0.79627573 <a title="273-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_A_Tale_of_Domination_and_Independence.html">125 nips-2013-From Bandits to Experts: A Tale of Domination and Independence</a></p>
<p>Author: Noga Alon, Nicolò Cesa-Bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Yishay Mansour</p><p>Abstract: We consider the partial observability model for multi-armed bandits, introduced by Mannor and Shamir [14]. Our main result is a characterization of regret in the directed observability model in terms of the dominating and independence numbers of the observability graph (which must be accessible before selecting an action). In the undirected case, we show that the learner can achieve optimal regret without even accessing the observability graph before selecting an action. Both results are shown using variants of the Exp3 algorithm operating on the observability graph in a time-efﬁcient manner. 1</p><p>5 0.79358464 <a title="273-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Demixing_odors_-_fast_inference_in_olfaction.html">86 nips-2013-Demixing odors - fast inference in olfaction</a></p>
<p>Author: Agnieszka Grabska-Barwinska, Jeff Beck, Alexandre Pouget, Peter Latham</p><p>Abstract: The olfactory system faces a difﬁcult inference problem: it has to determine what odors are present based on the distributed activation of its receptor neurons. Here we derive neural implementations of two approximate inference algorithms that could be used by the brain. One is a variational algorithm (which builds on the work of Beck. et al., 2012), the other is based on sampling. Importantly, we use a more realistic prior distribution over odors than has been used in the past: we use a “spike and slab” prior, for which most odors have zero concentration. After mapping the two algorithms onto neural dynamics, we ﬁnd that both can infer correct odors in less than 100 ms. Thus, at the behavioral level, the two algorithms make very similar predictions. However, they make different assumptions about connectivity and neural computations, and make different predictions about neural activity. Thus, they should be distinguishable experimentally. If so, that would provide insight into the mechanisms employed by the olfactory system, and, because the two algorithms use very different coding strategies, that would also provide insight into how networks represent probabilities. 1</p><p>6 0.79205215 <a title="273-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Two-Target_Algorithms__for_Infinite-Armed___Bandits_with_Bernoulli_Rewards.html">338 nips-2013-Two-Target Algorithms  for Infinite-Armed   Bandits with Bernoulli Rewards</a></p>

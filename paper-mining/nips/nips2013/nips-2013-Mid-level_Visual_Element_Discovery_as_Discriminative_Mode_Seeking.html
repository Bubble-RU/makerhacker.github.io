Several approaches [5, 6, 12, 23] have been proposed to discover mid-level visual elements, that are both 1) representative, i.e., frequently occurring within a visual dataset, and 2) visually discriminative. However, the current approaches are rather ad hoc and difﬁcult to analyze and evaluate. In this work, we pose visual element discovery as discriminative mode seeking, drawing connections to the the well-known and well-studied mean-shift algorithm [2, 1, 4, 8]. Given a weakly-labeled image collection, our method discovers visually-coherent patch clusters that are maximally discriminative with respect to the labels. One advantage of our formulation is that it requires only a single pass through the data.

<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>3 0.21108358 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Learning_the_Local_Statistics_of_Optical_Flow.html">167 nips-2013-Learning the Local Statistics of Optical Flow</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Rosenbaum, Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in natural image statistics, we use newly available datasets with ground truth optical ﬂow to learn the local statistics of optical ﬂow and compare the learned models to prior models assumed by computer vision researchers. We ﬁnd that a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) with 64 components provides a signiﬁcantly better model for local ﬂow statistics when compared to commonly used models. We investigate the source of the GMM’s success and show it is related to an explicit representation of ﬂow boundaries. We also learn a model that jointly models the local intensity pattern and the local optical ﬂow. In accordance with the assumptions often made in computer vision, the model learns that ﬂow boundaries are more likely at intensity boundaries. However, when evaluated on a large dataset, this dependency is very weak and the beneﬁt of conditioning ﬂow estimation on the local intensity pattern is marginal. 1</p><p>4 0.18058246 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-What_Are_the_Invariant_Occlusive_Components_of_Image_Patches%3F_A_Probabilistic_Generative_Approach.html">351 nips-2013-What Are the Invariant Occlusive Components of Image Patches? A Probabilistic Generative Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenwen Dai, Georgios Exarchakis, Jörg Lücke</p><p>Abstract: We study optimal image encoding based on a generative approach with non-linear feature combinations and explicit position encoding. By far most approaches to unsupervised learning of visual features, such as sparse coding or ICA, account for translations by representing the same features at different positions. Some earlier models used a separate encoding of features and their positions to facilitate invariant data encoding and recognition. All probabilistic generative models with explicit position encoding have so far assumed a linear superposition of components to encode image patches. Here, we for the ﬁrst time apply a model with non-linear feature superposition and explicit position encoding for patches. By avoiding linear superpositions, the studied model represents a closer match to component occlusions which are ubiquitous in natural images. In order to account for occlusions, the non-linear model encodes patches qualitatively very different from linear models by using component representations separated into mask and feature parameters. We ﬁrst investigated encodings learned by the model using artiﬁcial data with mutually occluding components. We ﬁnd that the model extracts the components, and that it can correctly identify the occlusive components with the hidden variables of the model. On natural image patches, the model learns component masks and features for typical image components. By using reverse correlation, we estimate the receptive ﬁelds associated with the model’s hidden units. We ﬁnd many Gabor-like or globular receptive ﬁelds as well as ﬁelds sensitive to more complex structures. Our results show that probabilistic models that capture occlusions and invariances can be trained efﬁciently on image patches, and that the resulting encoding represents an alternative model for the neural encoding of images in the primary visual cortex. 1</p><p>5 0.17955573 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Fast_Template_Evaluation_with_Vector_Quantization.html">119 nips-2013-Fast Template Evaluation with Vector Quantization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Amin Sadeghi, David Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: Applying linear templates is an integral part of many object detection systems and accounts for a signiﬁcant portion of computation time. We describe a method that achieves a substantial end-to-end speedup over the best current methods, without loss of accuracy. Our method is a combination of approximating scores by vector quantizing feature windows and a number of speedup techniques including cascade. Our procedure allows speed and accuracy to be traded off in two ways: by choosing the number of Vector Quantization levels, and by choosing to rescore windows or not. Our method can be directly plugged into any recognition system that relies on linear templates. We demonstrate our method to speed up the original Exemplar SVM detector [1] by an order of magnitude and Deformable Part models [2] by two orders of magnitude with no loss of accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.13837625 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_Bayesian_Image_Interpretation_using_Generative_Probabilistic_Graphics_Programs.html">37 nips-2013-Approximate Bayesian Image Interpretation using Generative Probabilistic Graphics Programs</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen-Ping Yu, Wen-Yu Hua, Dimitris Samaras, Greg Zelinsky</p><p>Abstract: Visual clutter, the perception of an image as being crowded and disordered, affects aspects of our lives ranging from object detection to aesthetics, yet relatively little effort has been made to model this important and ubiquitous percept. Our approach models clutter as the number of proto-objects segmented from an image, with proto-objects deﬁned as groupings of superpixels that are similar in intensity, color, and gradient orientation features. We introduce a novel parametric method of clustering superpixels by modeling mixture of Weibulls on Earth Mover’s Distance statistics, then taking the normalized number of proto-objects following partitioning as our estimate of clutter perception. We validated this model using a new 90-image dataset of real world scenes rank ordered by human raters for clutter, and showed that our method not only predicted clutter extremely well (Spearman’s ρ = 0.8038, p < 0.001), but also outperformed all existing clutter perception models and even a behavioral object segmentation ground truth. We conclude that the number of proto-objects in an image affects clutter perception more than the number of objects or features. 1</p><p>6 0.59322512 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Extracting_regions_of_interest_from_biological_images_with_convolutional_sparse_block_coding.html">114 nips-2013-Extracting regions of interest from biological images with convolutional sparse block coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) is an effective technique for solving regularized loss minimization problems in machine learning. This paper considers an extension of SDCA under the mini-batch setting that is often used in practice. Our main contribution is to introduce an accelerated mini-batch version of SDCA and prove a fast convergence rate for this method. We discuss an implementation of our method over a parallel computing system, and compare the results to both the vanilla stochastic dual coordinate ascent and to the accelerated deterministic gradient descent method of Nesterov [2007]. 1</p><p>2 0.99557811 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Solving_the_multi-way_matching_problem_by_permutation_synchronization.html">300 nips-2013-Solving the multi-way matching problem by permutation synchronization</a></p>
<p>Author: Deepti Pachauri, Risi Kondor, Vikas Singh</p><p>Abstract: The problem of matching not just two, but m different sets of objects to each other arises in many contexts, including ﬁnding the correspondence between feature points across multiple images in computer vision. At present it is usually solved by matching the sets pairwise, in series. In contrast, we propose a new method, Permutation Synchronization, which ﬁnds all the matchings jointly, in one shot, via a relaxation to eigenvector decomposition. The resulting algorithm is both computationally efﬁcient, and, as we demonstrate with theoretical arguments as well as experimental results, much more stable to noise than previous methods. 1</p><p>3 0.99173266 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Mapping_paradigm_ontologies_to_and_from_the_brain.html">183 nips-2013-Mapping paradigm ontologies to and from the brain</a></p>
<p>Author: Yannick Schwartz, Bertrand Thirion, Gael Varoquaux</p><p>Abstract: Imaging neuroscience links brain activation maps to behavior and cognition via correlational studies. Due to the nature of the individual experiments, based on eliciting neural response from a small number of stimuli, this link is incomplete, and unidirectional from the causal point of view. To come to conclusions on the function implied by the activation of brain regions, it is necessary to combine a wide exploration of the various brain functions and some inversion of the statistical inference. Here we introduce a methodology for accumulating knowledge towards a bidirectional link between observed brain activity and the corresponding function. We rely on a large corpus of imaging studies and a predictive engine. Technically, the challenges are to ﬁnd commonality between the studies without denaturing the richness of the corpus. The key elements that we contribute are labeling the tasks performed with a cognitive ontology, and modeling the long tail of rare paradigms in the corpus. To our knowledge, our approach is the ﬁrst demonstration of predicting the cognitive content of completely new brain images. To that end, we propose a method that predicts the experimental paradigms across different studies. 1</p><p>4 0.99041218 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Matrix_factorization_with_binary_components.html">186 nips-2013-Matrix factorization with binary components</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein, Pavlo Lutsik</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by an application in computational biology, we consider low-rank matrix factorization with {0, 1}-constraints on one of the factors and optionally convex constraints on the second one. In addition to the non-convexity shared with other matrix factorization schemes, our problem is further complicated by a combinatorial constraint set of size 2m·r , where m is the dimension of the data points and r the rank of the factorization. Despite apparent intractability, we provide − in the line of recent work on non-negative matrix factorization by Arora et al. (2012)− an algorithm that provably recovers the underlying factorization in the exact case with O(mr2r + mnr + r2 n) operations for n datapoints. To obtain this result, we use theory around the Littlewood-Offord lemma from combinatorics.</p><p>5 0.98825735 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Multisensory_Encoding%2C_Decoding%2C_and_Identification.html">205 nips-2013-Multisensory Encoding, Decoding, and Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Aurel A. Lazar, Yevgeniy Slutskiy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive ﬁelds in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identiﬁcation of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identiﬁed. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identiﬁcation algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.9864108 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Learning_Kernels_Using_Local_Rademacher_Complexity.html">156 nips-2013-Learning Kernels Using Local Rademacher Complexity</a></p>

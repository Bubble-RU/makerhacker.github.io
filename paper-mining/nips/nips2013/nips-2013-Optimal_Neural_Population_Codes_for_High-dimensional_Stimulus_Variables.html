<p>Author: Ben Shababo, Brooks Paige, Ari Pakman, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of modern stimulation techniques in neuroscience, the opportunity arises to map neuron to neuron connectivity. In this work, we develop a method for efﬁciently inferring posterior distributions over synaptic strengths in neural microcircuits. The input to our algorithm is data from experiments in which action potentials from putative presynaptic neurons can be evoked while a subthreshold recording is made from a single postsynaptic neuron. We present a realistic statistical model which accounts for the main sources of variability in this experiment and allows for signiﬁcant prior information about the connectivity and neuronal cell types to be incorporated if available. Due to the technical challenges and sparsity of these systems, it is important to focus experimental time stimulating the neurons whose synaptic strength is most ambiguous, therefore we also develop an online optimal design algorithm for choosing which neurons to stimulate at each trial. 1</p><p>3 0.26397279 <a title="236-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>4 0.25556752 <a title="236-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>5 0.24751428 <a title="236-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Optimal_integration_of_visual_speed_across_different_spatiotemporal_frequency_channels.html">237 nips-2013-Optimal integration of visual speed across different spatiotemporal frequency channels</a></p>
<p>Author: Matjaz Jogan, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: How do humans perceive the speed of a coherent motion stimulus that contains motion energy in multiple spatiotemporal frequency bands? Here we tested the idea that perceived speed is the result of an integration process that optimally combines speed information across independent spatiotemporal frequency channels. We formalized this hypothesis with a Bayesian observer model that combines the likelihood functions provided by the individual channel responses (cues). We experimentally validated the model with a 2AFC speed discrimination experiment that measured subjects’ perceived speed of drifting sinusoidal gratings with different contrasts and spatial frequencies, and of various combinations of these single gratings. We found that the perceived speeds of the combined stimuli are independent of the relative phase of the underlying grating components. The results also show that the discrimination thresholds are smaller for the combined stimuli than for the individual grating components, supporting the cue combination hypothesis. The proposed Bayesian model ﬁts the data well, accounting for the full psychometric functions of both simple and combined stimuli. Fits are improved if we assume that the channel responses are subject to divisive normalization. Our results provide an important step toward a more complete model of visual motion perception that can predict perceived speeds for coherent motion stimuli of arbitrary spatial structure. 1</p><p>6 0.21879573 <a title="236-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Aurel A. Lazar, Yevgeniy Slutskiy</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a spiking neuron model of multisensory integration. Multiple stimuli from different sensory modalities are encoded by a single neural circuit comprised of a multisensory bank of receptive ﬁelds in cascade with a population of biophysical spike generators. We demonstrate that stimuli of different dimensions can be faithfully multiplexed and encoded in the spike domain and derive tractable algorithms for decoding each stimulus from the common pool of spikes. We also show that the identiﬁcation of multisensory processing in a single neuron is dual to the recovery of stimuli encoded with a population of multisensory neurons, and prove that only a projection of the circuit onto input stimuli can be identiﬁed. We provide an example of multisensory integration using natural audio and video and discuss the performance of the proposed decoding and identiﬁcation algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.74034822 <a title="236-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Spectral_methods_for_neural_characterization_using_generalized_quadratic_models.html">305 nips-2013-Spectral methods for neural characterization using generalized quadratic models</a></p>
<p>Author: Il M. Park, Evan W. Archer, Nicholas Priebe, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: We describe a set of fast, tractable methods for characterizing neural responses to high-dimensional sensory stimuli using a model we refer to as the generalized quadratic model (GQM). The GQM consists of a low-rank quadratic function followed by a point nonlinearity and exponential-family noise. The quadratic function characterizes the neuron’s stimulus selectivity in terms of a set linear receptive ﬁelds followed by a quadratic combination rule, and the invertible nonlinearity maps this output to the desired response range. Special cases of the GQM include the 2nd-order Volterra model [1, 2] and the elliptical Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson model [3]. Here we show that for “canonical form” GQMs, spectral decomposition of the ﬁrst two response-weighted moments yields approximate maximumlikelihood estimators via a quantity called the expected log-likelihood. The resulting theory generalizes moment-based estimators such as the spike-triggered covariance, and, in the Gaussian noise case, provides closed-form estimators under a large class of non-Gaussian stimulus distributions. We show that these estimators are fast and provide highly accurate estimates with far lower computational cost than full maximum likelihood. Moreover, the GQM provides a natural framework for combining multi-dimensional stimulus sensitivity and spike-history dependencies within a single model. We show applications to both analog and spiking data using intracellular recordings of V1 membrane potential and extracellular recordings of retinal spike trains. 1</p><p>5 0.71011561 <a title="236-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Neural_representation_of_action_sequences%3A_how_far_can_a_simple_snippet-matching_model_take_us%3F.html">208 nips-2013-Neural representation of action sequences: how far can a simple snippet-matching model take us?</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheston Tan, Jedediah M. Singer, Thomas Serre, David Sheinberg, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: The macaque Superior Temporal Sulcus (STS) is a brain area that receives and integrates inputs from both the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams (thought to specialize in form and motion processing respectively). For the processing of articulated actions, prior work has shown that even a small population of STS neurons contains sufﬁcient information for the decoding of actor invariant to action, action invariant to actor, as well as the speciﬁc conjunction of actor and action. This paper addresses two questions. First, what are the invariance properties of individual neural representations (rather than the population representation) in STS? Second, what are the neural encoding mechanisms that can produce such individual neural representations from streams of pixel images? We ﬁnd that a simple model, one that simply computes a linear weighted sum of ventral and dorsal responses to short action “snippets”, produces surprisingly good ﬁts to the neural data. Interestingly, even using inputs from a single stream, both actor-invariance and action-invariance can be accounted for, by having different linear weights. 1</p><p>6 0.68023419 <a title="236-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Online_Experimental_Design_for_Mapping_Neural_Microcircuits.html">49 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Online Experimental Design for Mapping Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Vibhav Vineet, Carsten Rother, Philip Torr</p><p>Abstract: Many methods have been proposed to solve the problems of recovering intrinsic scene properties such as shape, reﬂectance and illumination from a single image, and object class segmentation separately. While these two problems are mutually informative, in the past not many papers have addressed this topic. In this work we explore such joint estimation of intrinsic scene properties recovered from an image, together with the estimation of the objects and attributes present in the scene. In this way, our uniﬁed framework is able to capture the correlations between intrinsic properties (reﬂectance, shape, illumination), objects (table, tv-monitor), and materials (wooden, plastic) in a given scene. For example, our model is able to enforce the condition that if a set of pixels take same object label, e.g. table, most likely those pixels would receive similar reﬂectance values. We cast the problem in an energy minimization framework and demonstrate the qualitative and quantitative improvement in the overall accuracy on the NYU and Pascal datasets. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91994178 <a title="236-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Optimal_Neural_Population_Codes_for_High-dimensional_Stimulus_Variables.html">236 nips-2013-Optimal Neural Population Codes for High-dimensional Stimulus Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhuo Wang, Alan Stocker, Daniel Lee</p><p>Abstract: In many neural systems, information about stimulus variables is often represented in a distributed manner by means of a population code. It is generally assumed that the responses of the neural population are tuned to the stimulus statistics, and most prior work has investigated the optimal tuning characteristics of one or a small number of stimulus variables. In this work, we investigate the optimal tuning for diffeomorphic representations of high-dimensional stimuli. We analytically derive the solution that minimizes the L2 reconstruction loss. We compared our solution with other well-known criteria such as maximal mutual information. Our solution suggests that the optimal weights do not necessarily decorrelate the inputs, and the optimal nonlinearity differs from the conventional equalization solution. Results illustrating these optimal representations are shown for some input distributions that may be relevant for understanding the coding of perceptual pathways. 1</p><p>3 0.91490757 <a title="236-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Density_estimation_from_unweighted_k-nearest_neighbor_graphs%3A_a_roadmap.html">87 nips-2013-Density estimation from unweighted k-nearest neighbor graphs: a roadmap</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulrike Von Luxburg, Morteza Alamgir</p><p>Abstract: Consider an unweighted k-nearest neighbor graph on n points that have been sampled i.i.d. from some unknown density p on Rd . We prove how one can estimate the density p just from the unweighted adjacency matrix of the graph, without knowing the points themselves or any distance or similarity scores. The key insights are that local differences in link numbers can be used to estimate a local function of the gradient of p, and that integrating this function along shortest paths leads to an estimate of the underlying density. 1</p><p>4 0.88147724 <a title="236-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-On_the_Linear_Convergence_of_the_Proximal_Gradient_Method_for_Trace_Norm_Regularization.html">222 nips-2013-On the Linear Convergence of the Proximal Gradient Method for Trace Norm Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Hou, Zirui Zhou, Anthony Man-Cho So, Zhi-Quan Luo</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by various applications in machine learning, the problem of minimizing a convex smooth loss function with trace norm regularization has received much attention lately. Currently, a popular method for solving such problem is the proximal gradient method (PGM), which is known to have a sublinear rate of convergence. In this paper, we show that for a large class of loss functions, the convergence rate of the PGM is in fact linear. Our result is established without any strong convexity assumption on the loss function. A key ingredient in our proof is a new Lipschitzian error bound for the aforementioned trace norm–regularized problem, which may be of independent interest.</p><p>5 0.88025415 <a title="236-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-B-test%3A_A_Non-parametric%2C_Low_Variance_Kernel_Two-sample_Test.html">44 nips-2013-B-test: A Non-parametric, Low Variance Kernel Two-sample Test</a></p>
<p>Author: Wojciech Zaremba, Arthur Gretton, Matthew Blaschko</p><p>Abstract: A family of maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) kernel two-sample tests is introduced. Members of the test family are called Block-tests or B-tests, since the test statistic is an average over MMDs computed on subsets of the samples. The choice of block size allows control over the tradeoff between test power and computation time. In this respect, the B-test family combines favorable properties of previously proposed MMD two-sample tests: B-tests are more powerful than a linear time test where blocks are just pairs of samples, yet they are more computationally efﬁcient than a quadratic time test where a single large block incorporating all the samples is used to compute a U-statistic. A further important advantage of the B-tests is their asymptotically Normal null distribution: this is by contrast with the U-statistic, which is degenerate under the null hypothesis, and for which estimates of the null distribution are computationally demanding. Recent results on kernel selection for hypothesis testing transfer seamlessly to the B-tests, yielding a means to optimize test power via kernel choice. 1</p><p>6 0.87951392 <a title="236-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Phase_Retrieval_using_Alternating_Minimization.html">247 nips-2013-Phase Retrieval using Alternating Minimization</a></p>

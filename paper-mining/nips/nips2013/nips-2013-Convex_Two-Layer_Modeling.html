<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>3 0.26331306 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Predicting_Parameters_in_Deep_Learning.html">251 nips-2013-Predicting Parameters in Deep Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Misha Denil, Babak Shakibi, Laurent Dinh, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there is signiﬁcant redundancy in the parameterization of several deep learning models. Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.252574 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>5 0.17108969 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>6 0.15409698 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-DeViSE%3A_A_Deep_Visual-Semantic_Embedding_Model.html">81 nips-2013-DeViSE: A Deep Visual-Semantic Embedding Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Yann Dauphin, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Sparse high-dimensional data vectors are common in many application domains where a very large number of rarely non-zero features can be devised. Unfortunately, this creates a computational bottleneck for unsupervised feature learning algorithms such as those based on auto-encoders and RBMs, because they involve a reconstruction step where the whole input vector is predicted from the current feature values. An algorithm was recently developed to successfully handle the case of auto-encoders, based on an importance sampling scheme stochastically selecting which input elements to actually reconstruct during training for each particular example. To generalize this idea to RBMs, we propose a stochastic ratio-matching algorithm that inherits all the computational advantages and unbiasedness of the importance sampling scheme. We show that stochastic ratio matching is a good estimator, allowing the approach to beat the state-of-the-art on two bag-of-word text classiﬁcation benchmarks (20 Newsgroups and RCV1), while keeping computational cost linear in the number of non-zeros. 1</p><p>6 0.72082031 <a title="75-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Multi-Prediction_Deep_Boltzmann_Machines.html">200 nips-2013-Multi-Prediction Deep Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Jamie Shotton, Toby Sharp, Pushmeet Kohli, Sebastian Nowozin, John Winn, Antonio Criminisi</p><p>Abstract: Randomized decision trees and forests have a rich history in machine learning and have seen considerable success in application, perhaps particularly so for computer vision. However, they face a fundamental limitation: given enough data, the number of nodes in decision trees will grow exponentially with depth. For certain applications, for example on mobile or embedded processors, memory is a limited resource, and so the exponential growth of trees limits their depth, and thus their potential accuracy. This paper proposes decision jungles, revisiting the idea of ensembles of rooted decision directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), and shows these to be compact and powerful discriminative models for classiﬁcation. Unlike conventional decision trees that only allow one path to every node, a DAG in a decision jungle allows multiple paths from the root to each leaf. We present and compare two new node merging algorithms that jointly optimize both the features and the structure of the DAGs efﬁciently. During training, node splitting and node merging are driven by the minimization of exactly the same objective function, here the weighted sum of entropies at the leaves. Results on varied datasets show that, compared to decision forests and several other baselines, decision jungles require dramatically less memory while considerably improving generalization. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.94853187 <a title="75-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Convex_Two-Layer_Modeling.html">75 nips-2013-Convex Two-Layer Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Jimmy Ba, Brendan Frey</p><p>Abstract: Recently, it was shown that deep neural networks can perform very well if the activities of hidden units are regularized during learning, e.g, by randomly dropping out 50% of their activities. We describe a method called ‘standout’ in which a binary belief network is overlaid on a neural network and is used to regularize of its hidden units by selectively setting activities to zero. This ‘adaptive dropout network’ can be trained jointly with the neural network by approximately computing local expectations of binary dropout variables, computing derivatives using back-propagation, and using stochastic gradient descent. Interestingly, experiments show that the learnt dropout network parameters recapitulate the neural network parameters, suggesting that a good dropout network regularizes activities according to magnitude. When evaluated on the MNIST and NORB datasets, we found that our method achieves lower classiﬁcation error rates than other feature learning methods, including standard dropout, denoising auto-encoders, and restricted Boltzmann machines. For example, our method achieves 0.80% and 5.8% errors on the MNIST and NORB test sets, which is better than state-of-the-art results obtained using feature learning methods, including those that use convolutional architectures. 1</p><p>4 0.92910236 <a title="75-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Scoring_Workers_in_Crowdsourcing%3A_How_Many_Control_Questions_are_Enough%3F.html">290 nips-2013-Scoring Workers in Crowdsourcing: How Many Control Questions are Enough?</a></p>
<p>Author: Qiang Liu, Alex Ihler, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of estimating continuous quantities, such as prices, probabilities, and point spreads, using a crowdsourcing approach. A challenging aspect of combining the crowd’s answers is that workers’ reliabilities and biases are usually unknown and highly diverse. Control items with known answers can be used to evaluate workers’ performance, and hence improve the combined results on the target items with unknown answers. This raises the problem of how many control items to use when the total number of items each workers can answer is limited: more control items evaluates the workers better, but leaves fewer resources for the target items that are of direct interest, and vice versa. We give theoretical results for this problem under different scenarios, and provide a simple rule of thumb for crowdsourcing practitioners. As a byproduct, we also provide theoretical analysis of the accuracy of different consensus methods. 1</p><p>5 0.92756122 <a title="75-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>
<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>6 0.91545808 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>

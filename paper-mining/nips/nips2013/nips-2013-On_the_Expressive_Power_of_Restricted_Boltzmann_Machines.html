<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>3 0.15698549 <a title="221-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Ratio_Matching_of_RBMs_for_Sparse_High-Dimensional_Inputs.html">315 nips-2013-Stochastic Ratio Matching of RBMs for Sparse High-Dimensional Inputs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yann Dauphin, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: Sparse high-dimensional data vectors are common in many application domains where a very large number of rarely non-zero features can be devised. Unfortunately, this creates a computational bottleneck for unsupervised feature learning algorithms such as those based on auto-encoders and RBMs, because they involve a reconstruction step where the whole input vector is predicted from the current feature values. An algorithm was recently developed to successfully handle the case of auto-encoders, based on an importance sampling scheme stochastically selecting which input elements to actually reconstruct during training for each particular example. To generalize this idea to RBMs, we propose a stochastic ratio-matching algorithm that inherits all the computational advantages and unbiasedness of the importance sampling scheme. We show that stochastic ratio matching is a good estimator, allowing the approach to beat the state-of-the-art on two bag-of-word text classiﬁcation benchmarks (20 Newsgroups and RCV1), while keeping computational cost linear in the number of non-zeros. 1</p><p>4 0.14044806 <a title="221-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Inferring_neural_population_dynamics_from_multiple_partial_recordings_of_the_same_neural_circuit.html">141 nips-2013-Inferring neural population dynamics from multiple partial recordings of the same neural circuit</a></p>
<p>Author: Srini Turaga, Lars Buesing, Adam M. Packer, Henry Dalgleish, Noah Pettit, Michael Hausser, Jakob Macke</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of the activity of large neural populations are extremely valuable as they can be used to infer the dynamics and interactions of neurons in a local circuit, shedding light on the computations performed. It is now possible to measure the activity of hundreds of neurons using 2-photon calcium imaging. However, many computations are thought to involve circuits consisting of thousands of neurons, such as cortical barrels in rodent somatosensory cortex. Here we contribute a statistical method for “stitching” together sequentially imaged sets of neurons into one model by phrasing the problem as ﬁtting a latent dynamical system with missing observations. This method allows us to substantially expand the population-sizes for which population dynamics can be characterized—beyond the number of simultaneously imaged neurons. In particular, we demonstrate using recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex that this method makes it possible to predict noise correlations between non-simultaneously recorded neuron pairs. 1</p><p>5 0.139002 <a title="221-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Determinantal_Point_Process_Latent_Variable_Model_for_Inhibition_in_Neural_Spiking_Data.html">6 nips-2013-A Determinantal Point Process Latent Variable Model for Inhibition in Neural Spiking Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jasper Snoek, Richard Zemel, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: Point processes are popular models of neural spiking behavior as they provide a statistical distribution over temporal sequences of spikes and help to reveal the complexities underlying a series of recorded action potentials. However, the most common neural point process models, the Poisson process and the gamma renewal process, do not capture interactions and correlations that are critical to modeling populations of neurons. We develop a novel model based on a determinantal point process over latent embeddings of neurons that effectively captures and helps visualize complex inhibitory and competitive interaction. We show that this model is a natural extension of the popular generalized linear model to sets of interacting neurons. The model is extended to incorporate gain control or divisive normalization, and the modulation of neural spiking based on periodic phenomena. Applied to neural spike recordings from the rat hippocampus, we see that the model captures inhibitory relationships, a dichotomy of classes of neurons, and a periodic modulation by the theta rhythm known to be present in the data. 1</p><p>6 0.13425626 <a title="221-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced_Associative_Memories.html">210 nips-2013-Noise-Enhanced Associative Memories</a></p>

<p>Author: Hesham Mostafa, Lorenz. K. Mueller, Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: We present a recurrent neuronal network, modeled as a continuous-time dynamical system, that can solve constraint satisfaction problems. Discrete variables are represented by coupled Winner-Take-All (WTA) networks, and their values are encoded in localized patterns of oscillations that are learned by the recurrent weights in these networks. Constraints over the variables are encoded in the network connectivity. Although there are no sources of noise, the network can escape from local optima in its search for solutions that satisfy all constraints by modifying the effective network connectivity through oscillations. If there is no solution that satisﬁes all constraints, the network state changes in a seemingly random manner and its trajectory approximates a sampling procedure that selects a variable assignment with a probability that increases with the fraction of constraints satisﬁed by this assignment. External evidence, or input to the network, can force variables to speciﬁc values. When new inputs are applied, the network re-evaluates the entire set of variables in its search for states that satisfy the maximum number of constraints, while being consistent with the external input. Our results demonstrate that the proposed network architecture can perform a deterministic search for the optimal solution to problems with non-convex cost functions. The network is inspired by canonical microcircuit models of the cortex and suggests possible dynamical mechanisms to solve constraint satisfaction problems that can be present in biological networks, or implemented in neuromorphic electronic circuits. 1</p><p>5 0.60550457 <a title="221-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Training_and_Analysing_Deep_Recurrent_Neural_Networks.html">334 nips-2013-Training and Analysing Deep Recurrent Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Michiel Hermans, Benjamin Schrauwen</p><p>Abstract: Time series often have a temporal hierarchy, with information that is spread out over multiple time scales. Common recurrent neural networks, however, do not explicitly accommodate such a hierarchy, and most research on them has been focusing on training algorithms rather than on their basic architecture. In this paper we study the effect of a hierarchy of recurrent neural networks on processing time series. Here, each layer is a recurrent network which receives the hidden state of the previous layer as input. This architecture allows us to perform hierarchical processing on difﬁcult temporal tasks, and more naturally capture the structure of time series. We show that they reach state-of-the-art performance for recurrent networks in character-level language modeling when trained with simple stochastic gradient descent. We also offer an analysis of the different emergent time scales. 1</p><p>6 0.57328445 <a title="221-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Ratio_Matching_of_RBMs_for_Sparse_High-Dimensional_Inputs.html">315 nips-2013-Stochastic Ratio Matching of RBMs for Sparse High-Dimensional Inputs</a></p>

<p>Author: Xinghao Pan, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Stefanie Jegelka, Tamara Broderick, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Research on distributed machine learning algorithms has focused primarily on one of two extremes—algorithms that obey strict concurrency constraints or algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conﬂicts are unlikely and if conﬂicts do arise a conﬂict-resolution protocol is invoked. We view this “optimistic concurrency control” paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment. 1</p><p>3 0.80107832 <a title="221-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Regret_based_Robust_Solutions_for_Uncertain_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">270 nips-2013-Regret based Robust Solutions for Uncertain Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Asrar Ahmed, Pradeep Varakantham, Yossiri Adulyasak, Patrick Jaillet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we seek robust policies for uncertain Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Most robust optimization approaches for these problems have focussed on the computation of maximin policies which maximize the value corresponding to the worst realization of the uncertainty. Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.</p><p>4 0.79398412 <a title="221-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-BIG_%26_QUIC%3A_Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Estimation_for_a_Million_Variables.html">45 nips-2013-BIG & QUIC: Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation for a Million Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Cho-Jui Hsieh, Matyas A. Sustik, Inderjit Dhillon, Pradeep Ravikumar, Russell Poldrack</p><p>Abstract: The 1 -regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) has been shown to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance matrix even under high-dimensional settings. However, it requires solving a difﬁcult non-smooth log-determinant program with number of parameters scaling quadratically with the number of Gaussian variables. State-of-the-art methods thus do not scale to problems with more than 20, 000 variables. In this paper, we develop an algorithm B IG QUIC, which can solve 1 million dimensional 1 regularized Gaussian MLE problems (which would thus have 1000 billion parameters) using a single machine, with bounded memory. In order to do so, we carefully exploit the underlying structure of the problem. Our innovations include a novel block-coordinate descent method with the blocks chosen via a clustering scheme to minimize repeated computations; and allowing for inexact computation of speciﬁc components. In spite of these modiﬁcations, we are able to theoretically analyze our procedure and show that B IG QUIC can achieve super-linear or even quadratic convergence rates. 1</p><p>5 0.79050529 <a title="221-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Near-optimal_Anomaly_Detection_in_Graphs_using_Lovasz_Extended_Scan_Statistic.html">207 nips-2013-Near-optimal Anomaly Detection in Graphs using Lovasz Extended Scan Statistic</a></p>
<p>Author: James L. Sharpnack, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: The detection of anomalous activity in graphs is a statistical problem that arises in many applications, such as network surveillance, disease outbreak detection, and activity monitoring in social networks. Beyond its wide applicability, graph structured anomaly detection serves as a case study in the difﬁculty of balancing computational complexity with statistical power. In this work, we develop from ﬁrst principles the generalized likelihood ratio test for determining if there is a well connected region of activation over the vertices in the graph in Gaussian noise. Because this test is computationally infeasible, we provide a relaxation, called the Lov´ sz extended scan statistic (LESS) that uses submodularity to approximate the a intractable generalized likelihood ratio. We demonstrate a connection between LESS and maximum a-posteriori inference in Markov random ﬁelds, which provides us with a poly-time algorithm for LESS. Using electrical network theory, we are able to control type 1 error for LESS and prove conditions under which LESS is risk consistent. Finally, we consider speciﬁc graph models, the torus, knearest neighbor graphs, and ǫ-random graphs. We show that on these graphs our results provide near-optimal performance by matching our results to known lower bounds. 1</p><p>6 0.78413159 <a title="221-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>

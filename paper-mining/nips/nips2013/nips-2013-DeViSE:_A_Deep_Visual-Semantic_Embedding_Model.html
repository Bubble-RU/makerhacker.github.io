<p>Author: Richard Socher, Milind Ganjoo, Christopher D. Manning, Andrew Ng</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces a model that can recognize objects in images even if no training data is available for the object class. The only necessary knowledge about unseen visual categories comes from unsupervised text corpora. Unlike previous zero-shot learning models, which can only differentiate between unseen classes, our model can operate on a mixture of seen and unseen classes, simultaneously obtaining state of the art performance on classes with thousands of training images and reasonable performance on unseen classes. This is achieved by seeing the distributions of words in texts as a semantic space for understanding what objects look like. Our deep learning model does not require any manually deﬁned semantic or visual features for either words or images. Images are mapped to be close to semantic word vectors corresponding to their classes, and the resulting image embeddings can be used to distinguish whether an image is of a seen or unseen class. We then use novelty detection methods to differentiate unseen classes from seen classes. We demonstrate two novelty detection strategies; the ﬁrst gives high accuracy on unseen classes, while the second is conservative in its prediction of novelty and keeps the seen classes’ accuracy high. 1</p><p>3 0.25916582 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Distributed_Representations_of_Words_and_Phrases_and_their_Compositionality.html">96 nips-2013-Distributed Representations of Words and Phrases and their Compositionality</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomas Mikolov, Ilya Sutskever, Kai Chen, Greg S. Corrado, Jeff Dean</p><p>Abstract: The recently introduced continuous Skip-gram model is an efﬁcient method for learning high-quality distributed vector representations that capture a large number of precise syntactic and semantic word relationships. In this paper we present several extensions that improve both the quality of the vectors and the training speed. By subsampling of the frequent words we obtain signiﬁcant speedup and also learn more regular word representations. We also describe a simple alternative to the hierarchical softmax called negative sampling. An inherent limitation of word representations is their indifference to word order and their inability to represent idiomatic phrases. For example, the meanings of “Canada” and “Air” cannot be easily combined to obtain “Air Canada”. Motivated by this example, we present a simple method for ﬁnding phrases in text, and show that learning good vector representations for millions of phrases is possible.</p><p>4 0.22777513 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Transfer_Learning_in_a_Transductive_Setting.html">335 nips-2013-Transfer Learning in a Transductive Setting</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcus Rohrbach, Sandra Ebert, Bernt Schiele</p><p>Abstract: Category models for objects or activities typically rely on supervised learning requiring sufﬁciently large training sets. Transferring knowledge from known categories to novel classes with no or only a few labels is far less researched even though it is a common scenario. In this work, we extend transfer learning with semi-supervised learning to exploit unlabeled instances of (novel) categories with no or only a few labeled instances. Our proposed approach Propagated Semantic Transfer combines three techniques. First, we transfer information from known to novel categories by incorporating external knowledge, such as linguistic or expertspeciﬁed information, e.g., by a mid-level layer of semantic attributes. Second, we exploit the manifold structure of novel classes. More speciﬁcally we adapt a graph-based learning algorithm – so far only used for semi-supervised learning – to zero-shot and few-shot learning. Third, we improve the local neighborhood in such graph structures by replacing the raw feature-based representation with a mid-level object- or attribute-based representation. We evaluate our approach on three challenging datasets in two different applications, namely on Animals with Attributes and ImageNet for image classiﬁcation and on MPII Composites for activity recognition. Our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art transfer and semi-supervised approaches on all datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.21054767 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Visual_Concept_Learning%3A_Combining_Machine_Vision_and_Bayesian_Generalization_on_Concept_Hierarchies.html">349 nips-2013-Visual Concept Learning: Combining Machine Vision and Bayesian Generalization on Concept Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Joshua T. Abbott, Joseph Austerweil, Thomas Griffiths, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Learning a visual concept from a small number of positive examples is a significant challenge for machine learning algorithms. Current methods typically fail to ﬁnd the appropriate level of generalization in a concept hierarchy for a given set of visual examples. Recent work in cognitive science on Bayesian models of generalization addresses this challenge, but prior results assumed that objects were perfectly recognized. We present an algorithm for learning visual concepts directly from images, using probabilistic predictions generated by visual classiﬁers as the input to a Bayesian generalization model. As no existing challenge data tests this paradigm, we collect and make available a new, large-scale dataset for visual concept learning using the ImageNet hierarchy as the source of possible concepts, with human annotators to provide ground truth labels as to whether a new image is an instance of each concept using a paradigm similar to that used in experiments studying word learning in children. We compare the performance of our system to several baseline algorithms, and show a signiﬁcant advantage results from combining visual classiﬁers with the ability to identify an appropriate level of abstraction using Bayesian generalization. 1</p><p>6 0.20577189 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>

<p>Author: Andriy Mnih, Koray Kavukcuoglu</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-valued word embeddings learned by neural language models have recently been shown to capture semantic and syntactic information about words very well, setting performance records on several word similarity tasks. The best results are obtained by learning high-dimensional embeddings from very large quantities of data, which makes scalability of the training method a critical factor. We propose a simple and scalable new approach to learning word embeddings based on training log-bilinear models with noise-contrastive estimation. Our approach is simpler, faster, and produces better results than the current state-of-theart method. We achieve results comparable to the best ones reported, which were obtained on a cluster, using four times less data and more than an order of magnitude less computing time. We also investigate several model types and ﬁnd that the embeddings learned by the simpler models perform at least as well as those learned by the more complex ones. 1</p><p>6 0.73671281 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Discriminative_Transfer_Learning_with_Tree-based_Priors.html">93 nips-2013-Discriminative Transfer Learning with Tree-based Priors</a></p>

Semantic knowledge improves such zero-shot predictions achieving hit rates of up to 18% across thousands of novel labels never seen by the visual model. 1</p><p>2 0.69638169 <a title="81-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>3 0.69468719 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Compressive_Feature_Learning.html">65 nips-2013-Compressive Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hristo S. Paskov, Robert West, John C. Mitchell, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised feature learning for text data. Our method is grounded in the principle of minimum description length and uses a dictionary-based compression scheme to extract a succinct feature set. Specifically, our method ﬁnds a set of word k-grams that minimizes the cost of reconstructing the text losslessly. We formulate document compression as a binary optimization task and show how to solve it approximately via a sequence of reweighted linear programs that are efﬁcient to solve and parallelizable. As our method is unsupervised, features may be extracted once and subsequently used in a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the performance of these features over a range of scenarios including unsupervised exploratory analysis and supervised text categorization. Our compressed feature space is two orders of magnitude smaller than the full k-gram space and matches the text categorization accuracy achieved in the full feature space. This dimensionality reduction not only results in faster training times, but it can also help elucidate structure in unsupervised learning tasks and reduce the amount of training data necessary for supervised learning. 1</p><p>4 0.69229543 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Point_Based_Value_Iteration_with_Optimal_Belief_Compression_for_Dec-POMDPs.html">248 nips-2013-Point Based Value Iteration with Optimal Belief Compression for Dec-POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam C. MacDermed, Charles Isbell</p><p>Abstract: We present four major results towards solving decentralized partially observable Markov decision problems (DecPOMDPs) culminating in an algorithm that outperforms all existing algorithms on all but one standard inﬁnite-horizon benchmark problems. (1) We give an integer program that solves collaborative Bayesian games (CBGs). The program is notable because its linear relaxation is very often integral. (2) We show that a DecPOMDP with bounded belief can be converted to a POMDP (albeit with actions exponential in the number of beliefs). These actions correspond to strategies of a CBG. (3) We present a method to transform any DecPOMDP into a DecPOMDP with bounded beliefs (the number of beliefs is a free parameter) using optimal (not lossless) belief compression. (4) We show that the combination of these results opens the door for new classes of DecPOMDP algorithms based on previous POMDP algorithms. We choose one such algorithm, point-based valued iteration, and modify it to produce the ﬁrst tractable value iteration method for DecPOMDPs that outperforms existing algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.69221365 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hanlin Goh, Nicolas Thome, Matthieu Cord, Joo-Hwee Lim</p><p>Abstract: Designing a principled and effective algorithm for learning deep architectures is a challenging problem. The current approach involves two training phases: a fully unsupervised learning followed by a strongly discriminative optimization. We suggest a deep learning strategy that bridges the gap between the two phases, resulting in a three-phase learning procedure. We propose to implement the scheme using a method to regularize deep belief networks with top-down information. The network is constructed from building blocks of restricted Boltzmann machines learned by combining bottom-up and top-down sampled signals. A global optimization procedure that merges samples from a forward bottom-up pass and a top-down pass is used. Experiments on the MNIST dataset show improvements over the existing algorithms for deep belief networks. Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>6 0.69216102 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Regret_based_Robust_Solutions_for_Uncertain_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">270 nips-2013-Regret based Robust Solutions for Uncertain Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Misha Denil, Babak Shakibi, Laurent Dinh, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Nando de Freitas</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that there is signiﬁcant redundancy in the parameterization of several deep learning models. Given only a few weight values for each feature it is possible to accurately predict the remaining values. Moreover, we show that not only can the parameter values be predicted, but many of them need not be learned at all. We train several different architectures by learning only a small number of weights and predicting the rest. In the best case we are able to predict more than 95% of the weights of a network without any drop in accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.2634415 <a title="334-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Özlem Aslan, Hao Cheng, Xinhua Zhang, Dale Schuurmans</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable prediction models, such as multi-layer networks, impose auxiliary latent variables between inputs and outputs to allow automatic inference of implicit features useful for prediction. Unfortunately, such models are difﬁcult to train because inference over latent variables must be performed concurrently with parameter optimization—creating a highly non-convex problem. Instead of proposing another local training method, we develop a convex relaxation of hidden-layer conditional models that admits global training. Our approach extends current convex modeling approaches to handle two nested nonlinearities separated by a non-trivial adaptive latent layer. The resulting methods are able to acquire two-layer models that cannot be represented by any single-layer model over the same features, while improving training quality over local heuristics. 1</p><p>5 0.2472164 <a title="334-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning problems can be interpreted as learning for matching two types of objects (e.g., images and captions, users and products, queries and documents, etc.). The matching level of two objects is usually measured as the inner product in a certain feature space, while the modeling effort focuses on mapping of objects from the original space to the feature space. This schema, although proven successful on a range of matching tasks, is insufﬁcient for capturing the rich structure in the matching process of more complicated objects. In this paper, we propose a new deep architecture to more effectively model the complicated matching relations between two objects from heterogeneous domains. More speciﬁcally, we apply this model to matching tasks in natural language, e.g., ﬁnding sensible responses for a tweet, or relevant answers to a given question. This new architecture naturally combines the localness and hierarchy intrinsic to the natural language problems, and therefore greatly improves upon the state-of-the-art models. 1</p><p>6 0.20813657 <a title="334-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Deep_Fisher_Networks_for_Large-Scale_Image_Classification.html">83 nips-2013-Deep Fisher Networks for Large-Scale Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Karen Simonyan, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: As massively parallel computations have become broadly available with modern GPUs, deep architectures trained on very large datasets have risen in popularity. Discriminatively trained convolutional neural networks, in particular, were recently shown to yield state-of-the-art performance in challenging image classiﬁcation benchmarks such as ImageNet. However, elements of these architectures are similar to standard hand-crafted representations used in computer vision. In this paper, we explore the extent of this analogy, proposing a version of the stateof-the-art Fisher vector image encoding that can be stacked in multiple layers. This architecture signiﬁcantly improves on standard Fisher vectors, and obtains competitive results with deep convolutional networks at a smaller computational learning cost. Our hybrid architecture allows us to assess how the performance of a conventional hand-crafted image classiﬁcation pipeline changes with increased depth. We also show that convolutional networks and Fisher vector encodings are complementary in the sense that their combination further improves the accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.6915651 <a title="334-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-Compete_to_Compute.html">64 nips-2013-Compete to Compute</a></p>

<p>Author: Forest Agostinelli, Michael R. Anderson, Honglak Lee</p><p>Abstract: Stacked sparse denoising autoencoders (SSDAs) have recently been shown to be successful at removing noise from corrupted images. However, like most denoising techniques, the SSDA is not robust to variation in noise types beyond what it has seen during training. To address this limitation, we present the adaptive multi-column stacked sparse denoising autoencoder (AMC-SSDA), a novel technique of combining multiple SSDAs by (1) computing optimal column weights via solving a nonlinear optimization program and (2) training a separate network to predict the optimal weights. We eliminate the need to determine the type of noise, let alone its statistics, at test time and even show that the system can be robust to noise not seen in the training set. We show that state-of-the-art denoising performance can be achieved with a single system on a variety of different noise types. Additionally, we demonstrate the efﬁcacy of AMC-SSDA as a preprocessing (denoising) algorithm by achieving strong classiﬁcation performance on corrupted MNIST digits. 1</p><p>3 0.74549162 <a title="334-lda-3" href="./nips-2013-Regret_based_Robust_Solutions_for_Uncertain_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">270 nips-2013-Regret based Robust Solutions for Uncertain Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Asrar Ahmed, Pradeep Varakantham, Yossiri Adulyasak, Patrick Jaillet</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we seek robust policies for uncertain Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Most robust optimization approaches for these problems have focussed on the computation of maximin policies which maximize the value corresponding to the worst realization of the uncertainty. Recent work has proposed minimax regret as a suitable alternative to the maximin objective for robust optimization. However, existing algorithms for handling minimax regret are restricted to models with uncertainty over rewards only. We provide algorithms that employ sampling to improve across multiple dimensions: (a) Handle uncertainties over both transition and reward models; (b) Dependence of model uncertainties across state, action pairs and decision epochs; (c) Scalability and quality bounds. Finally, to demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our sampling approaches, we provide comparisons against benchmark algorithms on two domains from literature. We also provide a Sample Average Approximation (SAA) analysis to compute a posteriori error bounds.</p><p>4 0.74063253 <a title="334-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Top-Down_Regularization_of_Deep_Belief_Networks.html">331 nips-2013-Top-Down Regularization of Deep Belief Networks</a></p>

Object recognition results on the Caltech-101 dataset also yield competitive results. 1</p><p>5 0.73848855 <a title="334-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Compressive_Feature_Learning.html">65 nips-2013-Compressive Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hristo S. Paskov, Robert West, John C. Mitchell, Trevor Hastie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised feature learning for text data. Our method is grounded in the principle of minimum description length and uses a dictionary-based compression scheme to extract a succinct feature set. Specifically, our method ﬁnds a set of word k-grams that minimizes the cost of reconstructing the text losslessly. We formulate document compression as a binary optimization task and show how to solve it approximately via a sequence of reweighted linear programs that are efﬁcient to solve and parallelizable. As our method is unsupervised, features may be extracted once and subsequently used in a variety of tasks. We demonstrate the performance of these features over a range of scenarios including unsupervised exploratory analysis and supervised text categorization. Our compressed feature space is two orders of magnitude smaller than the full k-gram space and matches the text categorization accuracy achieved in the full feature space. This dimensionality reduction not only results in faster training times, but it can also help elucidate structure in unsupervised learning tasks and reduce the amount of training data necessary for supervised learning. 1</p><p>6 0.73808295 <a title="334-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-A_Deep_Architecture_for_Matching_Short_Texts.html">5 nips-2013-A Deep Architecture for Matching Short Texts</a></p>

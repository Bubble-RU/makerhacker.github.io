<p>Author: Botond Cseke, Manfred Opper, Guido Sanguinetti</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approximate inference algorithm for continuous time Gaussian Markov process models with both discrete and continuous time likelihoods. We show that the continuous time limit of the expectation propagation algorithm exists and results in a hybrid ﬁxed point iteration consisting of (1) expectation propagation updates for discrete time terms and (2) variational updates for the continuous time term. We introduce postinference corrections methods that improve on the marginals of the approximation. This approach extends the classical Kalman-Bucy smoothing procedure to non-Gaussian observations, enabling continuous-time inference in a variety of models, including spiking neuronal models (state-space models with point process observations) and box likelihood models. Experimental results on real and simulated data demonstrate high distributional accuracy and signiﬁcant computational savings compared to discrete-time approaches in a neural application. 1</p><p>3 0.19643416 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Parallel_Sampling_of_DP_Mixture_Models_using_Sub-Cluster_Splits.html">243 nips-2013-Parallel Sampling of DP Mixture Models using Sub-Cluster Splits</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason Chang, John W. Fisher III</p><p>Abstract: We present an MCMC sampler for Dirichlet process mixture models that can be parallelized to achieve signiﬁcant computational gains. We combine a nonergodic, restricted Gibbs iteration with split/merge proposals in a manner that produces an ergodic Markov chain. Each cluster is augmented with two subclusters to construct likely split moves. Unlike some previous parallel samplers, the proposed sampler enforces the correct stationary distribution of the Markov chain without the need for ﬁnite approximations. Empirical results illustrate that the new sampler exhibits better convergence properties than current methods. 1</p><p>4 0.19020724 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_inference_for_low_rank_spatiotemporal_neural_receptive_fields.html">53 nips-2013-Bayesian inference for low rank spatiotemporal neural receptive fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Mijung Park, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: The receptive ﬁeld (RF) of a sensory neuron describes how the neuron integrates sensory stimuli over time and space. In typical experiments with naturalistic or ﬂickering spatiotemporal stimuli, RFs are very high-dimensional, due to the large number of coefﬁcients needed to specify an integration proﬁle across time and space. Estimating these coefﬁcients from small amounts of data poses a variety of challenging statistical and computational problems. Here we address these challenges by developing Bayesian reduced rank regression methods for RF estimation. This corresponds to modeling the RF as a sum of space-time separable (i.e., rank-1) ﬁlters. This approach substantially reduces the number of parameters needed to specify the RF, from 1K-10K down to mere 100s in the examples we consider, and confers substantial beneﬁts in statistical power and computational efﬁciency. We introduce a novel prior over low-rank RFs using the restriction of a matrix normal prior to the manifold of low-rank matrices, and use “localized” row and column covariances to obtain sparse, smooth, localized estimates of the spatial and temporal RF components. We develop two methods for inference in the resulting hierarchical model: (1) a fully Bayesian method using blocked-Gibbs sampling; and (2) a fast, approximate method that employs alternating ascent of conditional marginal likelihoods. We develop these methods for Gaussian and Poisson noise models, and show that low-rank estimates substantially outperform full rank estimates using neural data from retina and V1. 1</p><p>5 0.1769944 <a title="100-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Bayesian_Inference_and_Learning_in_Gaussian_Process_State-Space_Models_with_Particle_MCMC.html">48 nips-2013-Bayesian Inference and Learning in Gaussian Process State-Space Models with Particle MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger Frigola, Fredrik Lindsten, Thomas B. Schon, Carl Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: State-space models are successfully used in many areas of science, engineering and economics to model time series and dynamical systems. We present a fully Bayesian approach to inference and learning (i.e. state estimation and system identiﬁcation) in nonlinear nonparametric state-space models. We place a Gaussian process prior over the state transition dynamics, resulting in a ﬂexible model able to capture complex dynamical phenomena. To enable efﬁcient inference, we marginalize over the transition dynamics function and, instead, infer directly the joint smoothing distribution using specially tailored Particle Markov Chain Monte Carlo samplers. Once a sample from the smoothing distribution is computed, the state transition predictive distribution can be formulated analytically. Our approach preserves the full nonparametric expressivity of the model and can make use of sparse Gaussian processes to greatly reduce computational complexity. 1</p><p>6 0.16638552 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Latent_Maximum_Margin_Clustering.html">148 nips-2013-Latent Maximum Margin Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Guang-Tong Zhou, Tian Lan, Arash Vahdat, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We present a maximum margin framework that clusters data using latent variables. Using latent representations enables our framework to model unobserved information embedded in the data. We implement our idea by large margin learning, and develop an alternating descent algorithm to effectively solve the resultant non-convex optimization problem. We instantiate our latent maximum margin clustering framework with tag-based video clustering tasks, where each video is represented by a latent tag model describing the presence or absence of video tags. Experimental results obtained on three standard datasets show that the proposed method outperforms non-latent maximum margin clustering as well as conventional clustering approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.61077911 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./nips-2013-Optimistic_Concurrency_Control_for_Distributed_Unsupervised_Learning.html">238 nips-2013-Optimistic Concurrency Control for Distributed Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinghao Pan, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Stefanie Jegelka, Tamara Broderick, Michael Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Research on distributed machine learning algorithms has focused primarily on one of two extremes—algorithms that obey strict concurrency constraints or algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conﬂicts are unlikely and if conﬂicts do arise a conﬂict-resolution protocol is invoked. We view this “optimistic concurrency control” paradigm as particularly appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas: clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment. 1</p><p>5 0.58437413 <a title="100-lsi-5" href="./nips-2013-A_simple_example_of_Dirichlet_process_mixture_inconsistency_for_the_number_of_components.html">18 nips-2013-A simple example of Dirichlet process mixture inconsistency for the number of components</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeffrey W. Miller, Matthew T. Harrison</p><p>Abstract: For data assumed to come from a ﬁnite mixture with an unknown number of components, it has become common to use Dirichlet process mixtures (DPMs) not only for density estimation, but also for inferences about the number of components. The typical approach is to use the posterior distribution on the number of clusters — that is, the posterior on the number of components represented in the observed data. However, it turns out that this posterior is not consistent — it does not concentrate at the true number of components. In this note, we give an elementary proof of this inconsistency in what is perhaps the simplest possible setting: a DPM with normal components of unit variance, applied to data from a “mixture” with one standard normal component. Further, we show that this example exhibits severe inconsistency: instead of going to 1, the posterior probability that there is one cluster converges (in probability) to 0. 1</p><p>6 0.57652897 <a title="100-lsi-6" href="./nips-2013-Approximate_inference_in_latent_Gaussian-Markov_models_from_continuous_time_observations.html">41 nips-2013-Approximate inference in latent Gaussian-Markov models from continuous time observations</a></p>

<p>Author: Marco Cuturi</p><p>Abstract: Optimal transport distances are a fundamental family of distances for probability measures and histograms of features. Despite their appealing theoretical properties, excellent performance in retrieval tasks and intuitive formulation, their computation involves the resolution of a linear program whose cost can quickly become prohibitive whenever the size of the support of these measures or the histograms’ dimension exceeds a few hundred. We propose in this work a new family of optimal transport distances that look at transport problems from a maximumentropy perspective. We smooth the classic optimal transport problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn’s matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transport solvers. We also show that this regularized distance improves upon classic optimal transport distances on the MNIST classiﬁcation problem.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72744578 <a title="100-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Dynamic_Clustering_via_Asymptotics_of_the_Dependent_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture.html">100 nips-2013-Dynamic Clustering via Asymptotics of the Dependent Dirichlet Process Mixture</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Branislav Kveton, Zheng Wen, Brian Eriksson, S. Muthukrishnan</p><p>Abstract: Maximization of submodular functions has wide applications in machine learning and artiﬁcial intelligence. Adaptive submodular maximization has been traditionally studied under the assumption that the model of the world, the expected gain of choosing an item given previously selected items and their states, is known. In this paper, we study the setting where the expected gain is initially unknown, and it is learned by interacting repeatedly with the optimized function. We propose an efﬁcient algorithm for solving our problem and prove that its expected cumulative regret increases logarithmically with time. Our regret bound captures the inherent property of submodular maximization, earlier mistakes are more costly than later ones. We refer to our approach as Optimistic Adaptive Submodular Maximization (OASM) because it trades off exploration and exploitation based on the optimism in the face of uncertainty principle. We evaluate our method on a preference elicitation problem and show that non-trivial K-step policies can be learned from just a few hundred interactions with the problem. 1</p><p>5 0.60907602 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-Thompson_Sampling_for_1-Dimensional_Exponential_Family_Bandits.html">330 nips-2013-Thompson Sampling for 1-Dimensional Exponential Family Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathaniel Korda, Emilie Kaufmann, Remi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Thompson Sampling has been demonstrated in many complex bandit models, however the theoretical guarantees available for the parametric multi-armed bandit are still limited to the Bernoulli case. Here we extend them by proving asymptotic optimality of the algorithm using the Jeffreys prior for 1-dimensional exponential family bandits. Our proof builds on previous work, but also makes extensive use of closed forms for Kullback-Leibler divergence and Fisher information (through the Jeffreys prior) available in an exponential family. This allow us to give a ﬁnite time exponential concentration inequality for posterior distributions on exponential families that may be of interest in its own right. Moreover our analysis covers some distributions for which no optimistic algorithm has yet been proposed, including heavy-tailed exponential families. 1</p><p>6 0.6087324 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Reinforcement_Learning_in_Robust_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">273 nips-2013-Reinforcement Learning in Robust Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

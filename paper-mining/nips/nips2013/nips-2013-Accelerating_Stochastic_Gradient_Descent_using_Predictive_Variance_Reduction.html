<p>Author: Shai Shalev-Shwartz, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic dual coordinate ascent (SDCA) is an effective technique for solving regularized loss minimization problems in machine learning. This paper considers an extension of SDCA under the mini-batch setting that is often used in practice. Our main contribution is to introduce an accelerated mini-batch version of SDCA and prove a fast convergence rate for this method. We discuss an implementation of our method over a parallel computing system, and compare the results to both the vanilla stochastic dual coordinate ascent and to the accelerated deterministic gradient descent method of Nesterov [2007]. 1</p><p>3 0.23820183 <a title="20-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2013-Linear_Convergence_with_Condition_Number_Independent_Access_of_Full_Gradients.html">175 nips-2013-Linear Convergence with Condition Number Independent Access of Full Gradients</a></p>
<p>Author: Lijun Zhang, Mehrdad Mahdavi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: For smooth and strongly convex optimizations, the optimal iteration complexity of √ the gradient-based algorithm is O( κ log 1/ǫ), where κ is the condition number. In the case that the optimization problem is ill-conditioned, we need to evaluate a large number of full gradients, which could be computationally expensive. In this paper, we propose to remove the dependence on the condition number by allowing the algorithm to access stochastic gradients of the objective function. To this end, we present a novel algorithm named Epoch Mixed Gradient Descent (EMGD) that is able to utilize two kinds of gradients. A distinctive step in EMGD is the mixed gradient descent, where we use a combination of the full and stochastic gradients to update the intermediate solution. Theoretical analysis shows that EMGD is able to ﬁnd an ǫ-optimal solution by computing O(log 1/ǫ) full gradients and O(κ2 log 1/ǫ) stochastic gradients. 1</p><p>4 0.18228208 <a title="20-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2013-Mixed_Optimization_for_Smooth_Functions.html">193 nips-2013-Mixed Optimization for Smooth Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Lijun Zhang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: It is well known that the optimal convergence rate for stochastic optimization of √ smooth functions is O(1/ T ), which is same as stochastic optimization of Lipschitz continuous convex functions. This is in contrast to optimizing smooth functions using full gradients, which yields a convergence rate of O(1/T 2 ). In this work, we consider a new setup for optimizing smooth functions, termed as Mixed Optimization, which allows to access both a stochastic oracle and a full gradient oracle. Our goal is to signiﬁcantly improve the convergence rate of stochastic optimization of smooth functions by having an additional small number of accesses to the full gradient oracle. We show that, with an O(ln T ) calls to the full gradient oracle and an O(T ) calls to the stochastic oracle, the proposed mixed optimization algorithm is able to achieve an optimization error of O(1/T ). 1</p><p>5 0.16560325 <a title="20-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2013-Stochastic_Convex_Optimization_with_Multiple__Objectives.html">311 nips-2013-Stochastic Convex Optimization with Multiple  Objectives</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehrdad Mahdavi, Tianbao Yang, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we are interested in the development of efﬁcient algorithms for convex optimization problems in the simultaneous presence of multiple objectives and stochasticity in the ﬁrst-order information. We cast the stochastic multiple objective optimization problem into a constrained optimization problem by choosing one function as the objective and try to bound other objectives by appropriate thresholds. We ﬁrst examine a two stages exploration-exploitation based algorithm which ﬁrst approximates the stochastic objectives by sampling and then solves a constrained stochastic optimization problem by projected gradient method. This method attains a suboptimal convergence rate even under strong assumption on the objectives. Our second approach is an efﬁcient primal-dual stochastic algorithm. It leverages on the theory of Lagrangian method √ conin strained optimization and attains the optimal convergence rate of O(1/ T ) in high probability for general Lipschitz continuous objectives.</p><p>6 0.12730199 <a title="20-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2013-Regularized_M-estimators_with_nonconvexity%3A_Statistical_and_algorithmic_theory_for_local_optima.html">271 nips-2013-Regularized M-estimators with nonconvexity: Statistical and algorithmic theory for local optima</a></p>

<p>Author: Assaf Glazer, Michael Lindenbaum, Shaul Markovitch</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a novel method that can efﬁciently estimate a family of hierarchical dense sets in high-dimensional distributions. Our method can be regarded as a natural extension of the one-class SVM (OCSVM) algorithm that ﬁnds multiple parallel separating hyperplanes in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We call our method q-OCSVM, as it can be used to estimate q quantiles of a highdimensional distribution. For this purpose, we introduce a new global convex optimization program that ﬁnds all estimated sets at once and show that it can be solved efﬁciently. We prove the correctness of our method and present empirical results that demonstrate its superiority over existing methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.92221975 <a title="20-lda-2" href="./nips-2013-Accelerating_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_using_Predictive_Variance_Reduction.html">20 nips-2013-Accelerating Stochastic Gradient Descent using Predictive Variance Reduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Fajwel Fogel, Rodolphe Jenatton, Francis Bach, Alexandre D'Aspremont</p><p>Abstract: Seriation seeks to reconstruct a linear order between variables using unsorted similarity information. It has direct applications in archeology and shotgun gene sequencing for example. We prove the equivalence between the seriation and the combinatorial 2-SUM problem (a quadratic minimization problem over permutations) over a class of similarity matrices. The seriation problem can be solved exactly by a spectral algorithm in the noiseless case and we produce a convex relaxation for the 2-SUM problem to improve the robustness of solutions in a noisy setting. This relaxation also allows us to impose additional structural constraints on the solution, to solve semi-supervised seriation problems. We present numerical experiments on archeological data, Markov chains and gene sequences. 1</p><p>4 0.88453054 <a title="20-lda-4" href="./nips-2013-Trading_Computation_for_Communication%3A_Distributed_Stochastic_Dual_Coordinate_Ascent.html">333 nips-2013-Trading Computation for Communication: Distributed Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent</a></p>
<p>Author: Tianbao Yang</p><p>Abstract: We present and study a distributed optimization algorithm by employing a stochastic dual coordinate ascent method. Stochastic dual coordinate ascent methods enjoy strong theoretical guarantees and often have better performances than stochastic gradient descent methods in optimizing regularized loss minimization problems. It still lacks of efforts in studying them in a distributed framework. We make a progress along the line by presenting a distributed stochastic dual coordinate ascent algorithm in a star network, with an analysis of the tradeoff between computation and communication. We verify our analysis by experiments on real data sets. Moreover, we compare the proposed algorithm with distributed stochastic gradient descent methods and distributed alternating direction methods of multipliers for optimizing SVMs in the same distributed framework, and observe competitive performances. 1</p><p>5 0.88358617 <a title="20-lda-5" href="./nips-2013-An_Approximate%2C_Efficient_LP_Solver_for_LP_Rounding.html">33 nips-2013-An Approximate, Efficient LP Solver for LP Rounding</a></p>

This paper shows that we can recover solutions of comparable quality by rounding an approximate LP solution instead of the exact one. These approximate LP solutions can be computed efﬁciently by applying a parallel stochastic-coordinate-descent method to a quadratic-penalty formulation of the LP. We derive worst-case runtime and solution quality guarantees of this scheme using novel perturbation and convergence analysis. Our experiments demonstrate that on such combinatorial problems as vertex cover, independent set and multiway-cut, our approximate rounding scheme is up to an order of magnitude faster than Cplex (a commercial LP solver) while producing solutions of similar quality. 1</p><p>6 0.88206381 <a title="20-lda-6" href="./nips-2013-Sparse_Overlapping_Sets_Lasso_for_Multitask_Learning_and_its_Application_to_fMRI_Analysis.html">303 nips-2013-Sparse Overlapping Sets Lasso for Multitask Learning and its Application to fMRI Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>3 0.074035846 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>4 0.069943242 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Sparse_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Application_to_Text_Data.html">142 nips-2011-Large-Scale Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Text Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Youwei Zhang, Laurent E. Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA provides a linear combination of small number of features that maximizes variance across data. Although Sparse PCA has apparent advantages compared to PCA, such as better interpretability, it is generally thought to be computationally much more expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising fact that sparse PCA can be easier than PCA in practice, and that it can be reliably applied to very large data sets. This comes from a rigorous feature elimination pre-processing result, coupled with the favorable fact that features in real-life data typically have exponentially decreasing variances, which allows for many features to be eliminated. We introduce a fast block coordinate ascent algorithm with much better computational complexity than the existing ﬁrst-order ones. We provide experimental results obtained on text corpora involving millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. These results illustrate how Sparse PCA can help organize a large corpus of text data in a user-interpretable way, providing an attractive alternative approach to topic models. 1</p><p>5 0.061883137 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Co-regularized_Multi-view_Spectral_Clustering.html">54 nips-2011-Co-regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhishek Kumar, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: In many clustering problems, we have access to multiple views of the data each of which could be individually used for clustering. Exploiting information from multiple views, one can hope to ﬁnd a clustering that is more accurate than the ones obtained using the individual views. Often these different views admit same underlying clustering of the data, so we can approach this problem by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a spectral clustering framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering hypotheses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on two synthetic and three real-world datasets establish the efﬁcacy of our proposed approaches.</p><p>6 0.058048263 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Features_for_PCA-Like_Linear_Regression.html">260 nips-2011-Sparse Features for PCA-Like Linear Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey, Michael I. Jordan, Ameet Talwalkar</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces Divide-Factor-Combine (DFC), a parallel divide-andconquer framework for noisy matrix factorization. DFC divides a large-scale matrix factorization task into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem in parallel using an arbitrary base matrix factorization algorithm, and combines the subproblem solutions using techniques from randomized matrix approximation. Our experiments with collaborative ﬁltering, video background modeling, and simulated data demonstrate the near-linear to super-linear speed-ups attainable with this approach. Moreover, our analysis shows that DFC enjoys high-probability recovery guarantees comparable to those of its base algorithm.</p><p>4 0.63201451 <a title="172-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-SpaRCS%3A_Recovering_low-rank_and_sparse_matrices_from_compressive_measurements.html">257 nips-2011-SpaRCS: Recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from compressive measurements</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew E. Waters, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a matrix M that is the sum of a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S from a small set of linear measurements of the form y = A(M) = A(L + S). This model subsumes three important classes of signal recovery problems: compressive sensing, afﬁne rank minimization, and robust principal component analysis. We propose a natural optimization problem for signal recovery under this model and develop a new greedy algorithm called SpaRCS to solve it. Empirically, SpaRCS inherits a number of desirable properties from the state-of-the-art CoSaMP and ADMiRA algorithms, including exponential convergence and efﬁcient implementation. Simulation results with video compressive sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and robust matrix completion data sets demonstrate both the accuracy and efﬁcacy of the algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.61952412 <a title="172-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_with_Replacement.html">209 nips-2011-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Ambuj Tewari, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of compressed sensing where the goal is to recover all sparse vectors using a small number offixed linear measurements. For this problem, we propose a novel partial hard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding algorithms like ITI and HTP[17, 10], the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm that we call Orthogonal Matching Pursnit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residnal. However, unlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple change allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse recovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance guarantees under RIP. Given its simple structore, we are able to extend OMPR using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hasb, the first provably sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursnit. We provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for vectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrste that for large-scale problems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than existing methods.</p><p>6 0.59106302 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew A. Kayala, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not highthroughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufﬁcient data to be effective. We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2,989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we ﬁrst train atom level reactivity ﬁlters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a 0.1% false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanistic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the time, rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four nonproductive reactions are considered. The ﬁnal system allows multi-step reaction prediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle.</p><p>2 0.82469463 <a title="172-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_coding_of_natural_images_with_a_population_of_noisy_Linear-Nonlinear_neurons.html">82 nips-2011-Efficient coding of natural images with a population of noisy Linear-Nonlinear neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>3 0.82320154 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Category_Structure_Aware_Image_Categorization.html">141 nips-2011-Large-Scale Category Structure Aware Image Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Zhao, Fei Li, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on image categorization has focused on medium-scale data sets, while large-scale image categorization with millions of images from thousands of categories remains a challenge. With the emergence of structured large-scale dataset such as the ImageNet, rich information about the conceptual relationships between images, such as a tree hierarchy among various image categories, become available. As human cognition of complex visual world beneﬁts from underlying semantic relationships between object classes, we believe a machine learning system can and should leverage such information as well for better performance. In this paper, we employ such semantic relatedness among image categories for large-scale image categorization. Speciﬁcally, a category hierarchy is utilized to properly deﬁne loss function and select common set of features for related categories. An efﬁcient optimization method based on proximal approximation and accelerated parallel gradient method is introduced. Experimental results on a subset of ImageNet containing 1.2 million images from 1000 categories demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.81712651 <a title="172-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Minimax_Localization_of_Structural_Information_in_Large_Noisy_Matrices.html">172 nips-2011-Minimax Localization of Structural Information in Large Noisy Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Mladen Kolar, Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Alessandro Rinaldo, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of identifying a sparse set of relevant columns and rows in a large data matrix with highly corrupted entries. This problem of identifying groups from a collection of bipartite variables such as proteins and drugs, biological species and gene sequences, malware and signatures, etc is commonly referred to as biclustering or co-clustering. Despite its great practical relevance, and although several ad-hoc methods are available for biclustering, theoretical analysis of the problem is largely non-existent. The problem we consider is also closely related to structured multiple hypothesis testing, an area of statistics that has recently witnessed a ﬂurry of activity. We make the following contributions 1. We prove lower bounds on the minimum signal strength needed for successful recovery of a bicluster as a function of the noise variance, size of the matrix and bicluster of interest. 2. We show that a combinatorial procedure based on the scan statistic achieves this optimal limit. 3. We characterize the SNR required by several computationally tractable procedures for biclustering including element-wise thresholding, column/row average thresholding and a convex relaxation approach to sparse singular vector decomposition. 1</p><p>5 0.79428256 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-From_Bandits_to_Experts%3A_On_the_Value_of_Side-Observations.html">98 nips-2011-From Bandits to Experts: On the Value of Side-Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We consider an adversarial online learning setting where a decision maker can choose an action in every stage of the game. In addition to observing the reward of the chosen action, the decision maker gets side observations on the reward he would have obtained had he chosen some of the other actions. The observation structure is encoded as a graph, where node i is linked to node j if sampling i provides information on the reward of j. This setting naturally interpolates between the well-known “experts” setting, where the decision maker can view all rewards, and the multi-armed bandits setting, where the decision maker can only view the reward of the chosen action. We develop practical algorithms with provable regret guarantees, which depend on non-trivial graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure. We also provide partially-matching lower bounds. 1</p><p>6 0.77205491 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>

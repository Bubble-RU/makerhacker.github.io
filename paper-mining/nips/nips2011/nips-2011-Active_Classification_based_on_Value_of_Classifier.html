<p>Author: Mohammad J. Saberian, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multi-class boosting is considered. A new framework, based on multi-dimensional codewords and predictors is introduced. The optimal set of codewords is derived, and a margin enforcing loss proposed. The resulting risk is minimized by gradient descent on a multidimensional functional space. Two algorithms are proposed: 1) CD-MCBoost, based on coordinate descent, updates one predictor component at a time, 2) GD-MCBoost, based on gradient descent, updates all components jointly. The algorithms differ in the weak learners that they support but are both shown to be 1) Bayes consistent, 2) margin enforcing, and 3) convergent to the global minimum of the risk. They also reduce to AdaBoost when there are only two classes. Experiments show that both methods outperform previous multiclass boosting approaches on a number of datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.060094077 <a title="19-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Target_Neighbor_Consistent_Feature_Weighting_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">279 nips-2011-Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ichiro Takeuchi, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: We consider feature selection and weighting for nearest neighbor classiﬁers. A technical challenge in this scenario is how to cope with discrete update of nearest neighbors when the feature space metric is changed during the learning process. This issue, called the target neighbor change, was not properly addressed in the existing feature weighting and metric learning literature. In this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting algorithm that can exactly and efﬁciently keep track of the correct target neighbors via sequential quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that guarantees the consistency between target neighbors and the feature space metric. We further show that the proposed algorithm can be naturally combined with regularization path tracking, allowing computationally efﬁcient selection of the regularization parameter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.056157529 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Fast_and_Balanced%3A_Efficient_Label_Tree_Learning_for_Large_Scale_Object_Recognition.html">96 nips-2011-Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for Large Scale Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Jia Deng, Sanjeev Satheesh, Alexander C. Berg, Fei Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to efﬁciently learn a label tree for large scale classiﬁcation with many classes. The key contribution of the approach is a technique to simultaneously determine the structure of the tree and learn the classiﬁers for each node in the tree. This approach also allows ﬁne grained control over the efﬁciency vs accuracy trade-off in designing a label tree, leading to more balanced trees. Experiments are performed on large scale image classiﬁcation with 10184 classes and 9 million images. We demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in test accuracy and efﬁciency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al. 1</p><p>5 0.055844534 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-A_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Predict_Chemical_Reactions.html">7 nips-2011-A Machine Learning Approach to Predict Chemical Reactions</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew A. Kayala, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not highthroughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufﬁcient data to be effective. We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2,989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we ﬁrst train atom level reactivity ﬁlters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a 0.1% false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanistic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the time, rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four nonproductive reactions are considered. The ﬁnal system allows multi-step reaction prediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle.</p><p>6 0.051492766 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-An_Exact_Algorithm_for_F-Measure_Maximization.html">33 nips-2011-An Exact Algorithm for F-Measure Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yonatan Wexler, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: Multiclass prediction is the problem of classifying an object into a relevant target class. We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sublinearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that ShareBoost efﬁciently ﬁnds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the beneﬁts of ShareBoost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.59327292 <a title="19-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Target_Neighbor_Consistent_Feature_Weighting_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">279 nips-2011-Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel boosting algorithm called VadaBoost which is motivated by recent empirical Bernstein bounds. VadaBoost iteratively minimizes a cost function that balances the sample mean and the sample variance of the exponential loss. Each step of the proposed algorithm minimizes the cost efﬁciently by providing weighted data to a weak learner rather than requiring a brute force evaluation of all possible weak learners. Thus, the proposed algorithm solves a key limitation of previous empirical Bernstein boosting methods which required brute force enumeration of all possible weak learners. Experimental results conﬁrm that the new algorithm achieves the performance improvements of EBBoost yet goes beyond decision stumps to handle any weak learner. Signiﬁcant performance gains are obtained over AdaBoost for arbitrary weak learners including decision trees (CART). 1</p><p>6 0.51108009 <a title="19-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">53 nips-2011-Co-Training for Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75567591 <a title="19-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Active_Classification_based_on_Value_of_Classifier.html">19 nips-2011-Active Classification based on Value of Classifier</a></p>

Bach</p><p>Abstract: Using the 1 -norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected covariates, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net. 1</p><p>4 0.69884443 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.6981566 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Blake Shaw, Bert Huang, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world networks are described by both connectivity information and features for every node. To better model and understand these networks, we present structure preserving metric learning (SPML), an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric from a network such that the learned distances are tied to the inherent connectivity structure of the network. Like the graph embedding algorithm structure preserving embedding, SPML learns a metric which is structure preserving, meaning a connectivity algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors will yield the correct connectivity when applied using the distances from the learned metric. We show a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments where SPML predicts link patterns from node features more accurately than standard techniques. We further demonstrate a method for optimizing SPML based on stochastic gradient descent which removes the running-time dependency on the size of the network and allows the method to easily scale to networks of thousands of nodes and millions of edges. 1</p><p>6 0.69485366 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Uniqueness_of_Belief_Propagation_on_Signed_Graphs.html">296 nips-2011-Uniqueness of Belief Propagation on Signed Graphs</a></p>

However, this expressivity is detrimental to the tractability of inference, when done at the propositional level. To solve this problem, various lifted inference algorithms have been proposed that reason at the ﬁrst-order level, about groups of objects as a whole. Despite the existence of various lifted inference approaches, there are currently no completeness results about these algorithms. The key contribution of this paper is that we introduce a formal deﬁnition of lifted inference that allows us to reason about the completeness of lifted inference algorithms relative to a particular class of probabilistic models. We then show how to obtain a completeness result using a ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation approach for theories of formulae containing up to two logical variables. 1 Introduction and related work Probabilistic logic models build on ﬁrst-order logic to capture relational structure and on graphical models to represent and reason about uncertainty [1, 2]. Due to their expressivity, these models can concisely represent large problems with many interacting random variables. While the semantics of these logics is often deﬁned through grounding the models [3], performing inference at the propositional level is – as for ﬁrst-order logic – inefﬁcient. This has motivated the quest for lifted inference methods that exploit the structure of probabilistic logic models for efﬁcient inference, by reasoning about groups of objects as a whole and avoiding repeated computations. The ﬁrst approaches to exact lifted inference have upgraded the variable elimination algorithm to the ﬁrst-order level [4, 5, 6]. More recent work is based on methods from logical inference [7, 8, 9, 10], such as knowledge compilation. While these approaches often yield dramatic improvements in runtime over propositional inference methods on speciﬁc problems, it is still largely unclear for which classes of models these lifted inference operators will be useful and for which ones they will eventually have to resort to propositional inference. One notable exception in this regard is lifted belief propagation [11], which performs exact lifted inference on any model whose factor graph representation is a tree. A ﬁrst contribution of this paper is that we introduce a notion of domain lifted inference, which formally deﬁnes what lifting means, and which can be used to characterize the classes of probabilistic models to which lifted inference applies. Domain lifted inference essentially requires that probabilistic inference runs in polynomial time in the domain size of the logical variables appearing in the model. As a second contribution we show that the class of models expressed as 2-WFOMC formulae (weighted ﬁrst-order model counting with up to 2 logical variables per formula) can be domain lifted using an extended ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation approach [10]. The resulting approach allows for lifted inference even in the presence of (anti-) symmetric or total relations in a theory. These are extremely common and useful concepts that cannot be lifted by any of the existing ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation inference rules. 1 2 Background We will use standard concepts of function-free ﬁrst-order logic (FOL). An atom p(t1 , . . . , tn ) consists of a predicate p/n of arity n followed by n arguments, which are either constants or logical variables. An atom is ground if it does not contain any variables. A literal is an atom a or its negation ¬a. A clause is a disjunction l1 ∨ ... ∨ lk of literals. If k = 1, it is a unit clause. An expression is an atom, literal or clause. The pred(a) function maps an atom to its predicate and the vars(e) function maps an expression to its logical variables. A theory in conjunctive normal form (CNF) is a conjunction of clauses. We often represent theories by their set of clauses and clauses by their set of literals. Furthermore, we will assume that all logical variables are universally quantiﬁed. In addition, we associate a set of constraints with each clause or atom, either of the form X = t, where X is a logical variable and t is a constant or variable, or of the form X ∈ D, where D is a domain, or the negation of these constraints. These deﬁne a ﬁnite domain for each logical variable. Abusing notation, we will use constraints of the form X = t to denote a substitution of X by t. The function atom(e) maps an expression e to its atoms, now associating the constraints on e with each atom individually. To add the constraint c to an expression e, we use the notation e ∧ c. Two atoms unify if there is a substitution which makes them identical and if the conjunction of the constraints on both atoms with the substitution is satisﬁable. Two expressions e1 and e2 are independent, written e1 ⊥ e2 , if no atom a1 ∈ atom(e1 ) uniﬁes with an atom a2 ∈ atom(e2 ). ⊥ We adopt the Weighted First-Order Model Counting (WFOMC) [10] formalism to represent probabilistic logic models, building on the notion of a Herbrand interpretation. Herbrand interpretations are subsets of the Herbrand base HB (T ), which consists of all ground atoms that can be constructed with the available predicates and constant symbols in T . The atoms in a Herbrand interpretation are assumed to be true. All other atoms in HB (T ) are assumed to be false. An interpretation I satisﬁes a theory T , written as I |= T , if it satisﬁes all the clauses c ∈ T . The WFOMC problem is deﬁned on a weighted logic theory T , which is a logic theory augmented with a positive weight function w and a negative weight function w, which assign a weight to each predicate. The WFOMC problem involves computing wmc(T, w, w) = w(pred(a)) I|=T a∈I 3 3.1 w(pred(a)). (1) a∈HB(T )\I First-order knowledge compilation for lifted probabilistic inference Lifted probabilistic inference A ﬁrst-order probabilistic model deﬁnes a probability distribution P over the set of Herbrand interpretations H. Probabilistic inference in these models is concerned with computing the posterior probability P(q|e) of query q given evidence e, where q and e are logical expressions in general: P(q|e) = h∈H,h|=q∧e P(h) h∈H,h|=e P(h) (2) We propose one notion of lifted inference for ﬁrst-order probabilistic models, deﬁned in terms of the computational complexity of inference w.r.t. the domains of logical variables. It is clear that other notions of lifted inference are conceivable, especially in the case of approximate inference. Deﬁnition 1 (Domain Lifted Probabilistic Inference). A probabilistic inference procedure is domain lifted for a model m, query q and evidence e iff the inference procedure runs in polynomial time in |D1 |, . . . , |Dk | with Di the domain of the logical variable vi ∈ vars(m, q, e). Domain lifted inference does not prohibit the algorithm to be exponential in the size of the vocabulary, that is, the number of predicates, arguments and constants, of the probabilistic model, query and evidence. In fact, the deﬁnition allows inference to be exponential in the number of constants which occur in arguments of atoms in the theory, query or evidence, as long as it is polynomial in the cardinality of the logical variable domains. This deﬁnition of lifted inference stresses the ability to efﬁciently deal with the domains of the logical variables that arise, regardless of their size, and formalizes what seems to be generally accepted in the lifted inference literature. 2 A class of probabilistic models is a set of probabilistic models expressed in a particular formalism. As examples, consider Markov logic networks (MLN) [12] or parfactors [4], or the weighted FOL theories for WFOMC that we introduced above, when the weights are normalized. Deﬁnition 2 (Completeness). Restricting queries to atoms and evidence to a conjunction of literals, a procedure that is domain lifted for all probabilistic models m in a class of models M and for all queries q and evidence e, is called complete for M . 3.2 First-order knowledge compilation First-order knowledge compilation is an approach to lifted probabilistic inference consisting of the following three steps (see Van den Broeck et al. [10] for details): 1. Convert the probabilistic logical model to a weighted CNF. Converting MLNs or parfactors requires adding new atoms to the theory that represent the (truth) value of each factor or formula. set-disjunction 2 friends(X, Y ) ∧ smokes(X) ⇒ smokes(Y ) Smokers ⊆ People decomposable conjunction unit clause leaf (a) MLN Model ∧ smokes(X), X ∈ Smokers smokes(Y ) ∨ ¬ smokes(X) ∨¬ friends(X, Y ) ∨ ¬ f(X, Y ) friends(X, Y ) ∨ f(X, Y ) smokes(X) ∨ f(X, Y ) ¬ smokes(Y ) ∨ f(X, Y ). ∧ f(X, Y ), Y ∈ Smokers ∧ ¬ smokes(Y ), Y ∈ Smokers / ∧ f(X, Y ), X ∈ Smokers, Y ∈ Smokers / / x ∈ Smokers (b) CNF Theory deterministic disjunction Predicate friends smokes f w 1 1 e2 w 1 1 1 y ∈ Smokers / ∨ set-conjunction ∧ f(x, y) (c) Weight Functions ¬ friends(x, y) ∧ friends(x, y) ¬ f(x, y) (d) First-Order d-DNNF Circuit Figure 1: Friends-smokers example (taken from [10]) Example 1. The MLN in Figure 1a assigns a weight to a formula in FOL. Figure 1b represents the same model as a weighted CNF, introducing a new atom f(X, Y ) to encode the truth value of the MLN formula. The probabilistic information is captured by the weight functions in Figure 1c. 2. Compile the logical theory into a First-Order d-DNNF (FO d-DNNF) circuit. Figure 1d shows an example of such a circuit. Leaves represent unit clauses. Inner nodes represent the disjunction or conjunction of their children l and r, but with the constraint that disjunctions must be deterministic (l ∧ r is unsatisﬁable) and conjunctions must be decomposable (l ⊥ r). ⊥ 3. Perform WFOMC inference to compute posterior probabilities. In a FO d-DNNF circuit, WFOMC is polynomial in the size of the circuit and the cardinality of the domains. To compile the CNF theory into a FO d-DNNF circuit, Van den Broeck et al. [10] propose a set of compilation rules, which we will refer to as CR 1 . We will now brieﬂy describe these rules. Unit Propagation introduces a decomposable conjunction when the theory contains a unit clause. Independence creates a decomposable conjunction when the theory contains independent subtheories. Shannon decomposition applies when the theory contains ground atoms and introduces a deterministic disjunction between two modiﬁed theories: one where the ground atom is true, and one where it is false. Shattering splits clauses in the theory until all pairs of atoms represent either a disjoint or identical set of ground atoms. Example 2. In Figure 2a, the ﬁrst two clauses are made independent from the friends(X, X) clause and split off in a decomposable conjunction by unit propagation. The unit clause becomes a leaf of the FO d-DNNF circuit, while the other operand requires further compilation. 3 dislikes(X, Y ) ∨ friends(X, Y ) fun(X) ∨ ¬ friends(X, Y ) friends(X, Y ) ∨ dislikes(X, Y ) ¬ friends(X, Y ) ∨ likes(X, Y ) friends(X, X) fun(X) ∨ ¬ friends(X, Y ) fun(X) ∨ ¬ friends(Y, X) ∧ FunPeople ⊆ People x ∈ People friends(X, X) friends(X, Y ) ∨ dislikes(X, Y ), X = Y ¬ friends(X, Y ) ∨ likes(X, Y ), X = Y likes(X, X) dislikes(x, Y ) ∨ friends(x, Y ) fun(x) ∨ ¬ friends(x, Y ) fun(X), X ∈ FunPeople ¬ fun(X), X ∈ FunPeople / fun(X) ∨ ¬ friends(X, Y ) fun(X) ∨ ¬ friends(Y, X) (a) Unit propagation of friends(X, X) (b) Independent partial grounding (c) Atom counting of fun(X) Figure 2: Examples of compilation rules. Circles are FO d-DNNF inner nodes. White rectangles show theories before and after applying the rule. All variable domains are People. (taken from [10]) Independent Partial Grounding creates a decomposable conjunction over a set of child circuits, which are identical up to the value of a grounding constant. Since they are structurally identical, only one child circuit is actually compiled. Atom Counting applies when the theory contains an atom with a single logical variable X ∈ D. It explicitly represents the domain D ⊆ D of X for which the atom is true. It compiles the theory into a deterministic disjunction between all possible such domains. Again, these child circuits are identical up to the value of D and only one is compiled. Example 3. The theory in Figure 2b is compiled into a decomposable set-conjunction of theories that are independent and identical up to the value of the x constant. The theory in Figure 2c contains an atom with one logical variable: fun(X). Atom counting compiles it into a deterministic setdisjunction over theories that differ in FunPeople, which is the domain of X for which fun(X) is true. Subsequent steps of unit propagation remove the fun(X) atoms from the theory entirely. 3.3 Completeness We will now characterize those theories where the CR 1 compilation rules cannot be used, and where the inference procedure has to resort to grounding out the theory to propositional logic. For these, ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation using CR 1 is not yet domain lifted. When a logical theory contains symmetric, anti-symmetric or total relations, such as friends(X, Y ) ⇒ friends(Y, X), parent(X, Y ) ⇒ ¬ parent(Y, X), X = Y, ≤ (X, Y) ∨ ≤ (Y, X), or more general formulas, such as enemies(X, Y ) ⇒ ¬ friend(X, Y ) ∧ ¬ friend(Y, X), (3) (4) (5) (6) none of the CR 1 rules apply. Intuitively, the underlying problem is the presence of either: • Two unifying (not independent) atoms in the same clause which contain the same logical variable in different positions of the argument list. Examples include (the CNF of) Formulas 3, 4 and 5, where the X and Y variable are bound by unifying two atoms from the same clause. • Two logical variables that bind when unifying one pair of atoms but appear in different positions of the argument list of two other unifying atoms. Examples include Formula 6, which in CNF is ¬ friend(X, Y ) ∨ ¬ enemies(X, Y ) ¬ friend(Y, X) ∨ ¬ enemies(X, Y ) Here, unifying the enemies(X, Y ) atoms binds the X variables from both clauses, which appear in different positions of the argument lists of the unifying atoms friend(X, Y ) and friend(Y, X). Both of these properties preclude the use of CR 1 rules. Also in the context of other model classes, such as MLNs, probabilistic versions of the above formulas cannot be processed by CR 1 rules. 4 Even though ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation with CR 1 rules does not have a clear completeness result, we can show some properties of theories to which none of the compilation rules apply. First, we need to distinguish between the arity of an atom and its dimension. A predicate with arity two might have atoms with dimension one, when one of the arguments is ground or both are identical. Deﬁnition 3 (Dimension of an Expression). The dimension of an expression e is the number of logical variables it contains: dim(e) = | vars(e)|. Lemma 1 (CR 1 Postconditions). The CR 1 rules remove all atoms from the theory T which have zero or one logical variable arguments, such that afterwards ∀a ∈ atom(T ) : dim(a) > 1. When no CR 1 rule applies, the theory is shattered and contains no independent subtheories. Proof. Ground atoms are removed by the Shannon decomposition operator followed by unit propagation. Atoms with a single logical variable (including unary relations) are removed by the atom counting operator followed by unit propagation. If T contains independent subtheories, the independence operator can be applied. Shattering is always applied when T is not yet shattered. 4 Extending ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation In this section we introduce a new operator which does apply to the theories from Section 3.3. 4.1 Logical variable properties To formally deﬁne the operator we propose, and prove its correctness, we ﬁrst introduce some mathematical concepts related to the logical variables in a theory (partly after Jha et al. [8]). Deﬁnition 4 (Binding Variables). Two logical variables X, Y are directly binding b(X, Y ) if they are bound by unifying a pair of atoms in the theory. The binding relationship b+ (X, Y ) is the transitive closure of the directly binding relation b(X, Y ). Example 4. In the theory ¬ p(W, X) ∨ ¬ q(X) r(Y ) ∨ ¬ q(Y ) ¬ r(Z) ∨ s(Z) the variable pairs (X, Y ) and (Y, Z) are directly binding. The variables X, Y and Z are binding. Variable W does not bind to any other variable. Note that the binding relationship b+ (X, Y ) is an equivalence relation that deﬁnes two equivalence classes: {X, Y, Z} and {W }. Lemma 2 (Binding Domains). After shattering, binding logical variables have identical domains. Proof. During shattering (see Section 3.2), when two atoms unify, binding two variables with partially overlapping domains, the atoms’ clauses are split up into clauses where the domain of the variables is identical, and clauses where the domains are disjoint and the atoms no longer unify. Deﬁnition 5 (Root Binding Class). A root variable is a variable that appears in all the atoms in its clause. A root binding class is an equivalence class of binding variables where all variables are root. Example 5. In the theory of Example 4, {X, Y, Z} is a root binding class and {W } is not. 4.2 Domain recursion We will now introduce the new domain recursion operator, starting with its preconditions. Deﬁnition 6. A theory allows for domain recursion when (i) the theory is shattered, (ii) the theory contains no independent subtheories and (iii) there exists a root binding class. From now on, we will denote with C the set of clauses of the theory at hand and with B a root binding class guaranteed to exist if C allows for domain recursion. Lemma 2 states that all variables in B have identical domains. We will denote the domain of these variables with D. The intuition behind the domain recursion operator is that it modiﬁes D by making one element explicit: D = D ∪ {xD } with xD ∈ D . This explicit domain element is introduced by the S PLIT D / function, which splits clauses w.r.t. the new subdomain D and element xD . 5 Deﬁnition 7 (S PLIT D). For a clause c and given set of variables Vc ⊆ vars(c) with domain D, let S PLIT D(c, Vc ) = c, if Vc = ∅ S PLIT D(c1 , Vc \ {V }) ∪ S PLIT D(c2 , Vc \ {V }), if Vc = ∅ (7) where c1 = c ∧ (V = xD ) and c2 = c ∧ (V = xD ) ∧ (V ∈ D ) for some V ∈ Vc . For a set of clauses C and set of variables V with domain D: S PLIT D(C, V) = c∈C S PLIT D(c, V ∩ vars(c)). The domain recursion operator creates three sets of clauses: S PLIT D(C, B) = Cx ∪ Cv ∪ Cr , with Cx = {c ∧ (V = xD )|c ∈ C}, (8) V ∈B∩vars(c) Cv = {c ∧ (V = xD ) ∧ (V ∈ D )|c ∈ C}, (9) V ∈B∩vars(c) Cr = S PLIT D(C, B) \ Cx \ Cv . (10) Proposition 3. The conjunction of the domain recursion sets is equivalent to the original theory: c∈Cr c . c∈Cv c ∧ c∈C c ≡ c∈S PLIT D(C,B) c and therefore c∈C c ≡ c∈Cx c ∧ We will now show that these sets are independent and that their conjunction is decomposable. Theorem 4. The theories Cx , Cv and Cr are independent: Cx ⊥ Cv , Cx ⊥ Cr and Cv ⊥ Cr . ⊥ ⊥ ⊥ The proof of Theorem 4 relies on the following Lemma. Lemma 5. If the theory allows for domain recursion, all clauses and atoms contain the same number of variables from B: ∃n, ∀c ∈ C, ∀a ∈ atom(C) : | vars(c) ∩ B | = | vars(a) ∩ B | = n. c Proof. Denote with Cn the clauses in C that contain n logical variables from B and with Cn its compliment in C. If C is nonempty, there is a n > 0 for which Cn is nonempty. Then every atom in Cn contains exactly n variables from B (Deﬁnition 5). Since the theory contains no independent c c subtheories, there must be an atom a in Cn which uniﬁes with an atom ac in Cn , or Cn is empty. After shattering, all uniﬁcations bind one variable from a to a single variable from ac . Because a contains exactly n variables from B, ac must also contain exactly n (Deﬁnition 4), and because B is c a root binding class, the clause of ac also contains exactly n, which contradicts the deﬁnition of Cn . c Therefore, Cn is empty, and because the variables in B are root, they also appear in all atoms. Proof of Theorem 4. From Lemma 5, all atoms in C contain the same number of variables from B. In Cx , these variables are all constrained to be equal to xD , while in Cv and Cr at least one variable is constrained to be different from xD . An attempt to unify an atom from Cx with an atom from Cv or Cr therefore creates an unsatisﬁable set of constraints. Similarly, atoms from Cv and Cr cannot be uniﬁed. Finally, we extend the FO d-DNNF language proposed in Van den Broeck et al. [10] with a new node, the recursive decomposable conjunction ∧ r , and deﬁne the domain recursion compilation rule. Deﬁnition 8 ( ∧ r ). The FO d-DNNF node ∧ r (nx , nr , D, D , V) represents a decomposable conjunction between the d-DNNF nodes nx , nr and a d-DNNF node isomorphic to the ∧ r node itself. In particular, the isomorphic operand is identical to the node itself, except for the size of the domain of the variables in V, which becomes one smaller, going from D to D in the isomorphic operand. We have shown that the conjunction between sets Cx , Cv and Cr is decomposable (Theorem 4) and logically equivalent to the original theory (Proposition 3). Furthermore, Cv is identical to C, up to the constraints on the domain of the variables in B. This leads us to the following deﬁnition of domain recursion. Deﬁnition 9 (Domain Recursion). The domain recursion compilation rule compiles C into ∧ r (nx , nr , D, D , B), where nx , nr are the compiled circuits for Cx , Cr . The third set Cv is represented by the recursion on D, according to Deﬁnition 8. 6 nv Cr ∧r ¬ friends(x, X) ∨ friends(X, x), X = x ¬ friends(X, x) ∨ friends(x, X), X = x P erson ← P erson \ {x} nr nx ∨ Cx ¬ friends(x, x) ∨ friends(x, x) x ∈P erson x =x ¬ friends(x, x) friends(x, x) ∨ ∧ ¬ friends(x, x ) ¬ friends(x , x) ∧ friends(x, x ) friends(x , x) Figure 3: Circuit for the symmetric relation in Equation 3, rooted in a recursive conjunction. Example 6. Figure 3 shows the FO d-DNNF circuit for Equation 3. The theory is split up into three independent theories: Cr and Cx , shown in the Figure 3, and Cv = {¬ friends(X, Y ) ∨ friends(Y, X), X = x, Y = x}. The conjunction of these theories is equivalent to Equation 3. Theory Cv is identical to Equation 3, up to the inequality constraints on X and Y . Theorem 6. Given a function size, which maps domains to their size, the weighted ﬁrst-order model count of a ∧ r (nx , nr , D, D , V) node is size(D) wmc( ∧ r (nx , nr , D, D , V), size) = wmc(nx , size)size(D) wmc(nr , size ∪{D → s}), s=0 (11) where size ∪{D → s} adds to the size function that the subdomain D has cardinality s. Proof. If C allows for domain recursion, due to Theorem 4, the weighted model count is wmc(C, size) = 1, if size(D) = 0 wmc(Cx ) · wmc(Cv , size ) · wmc(Cr , size ) if size(D) > 0 (12) where size = size ∪{D → size(D) − 1}. Theorem 7. The Independent Partial Grounding compilation rule is a special case of the domain recursion rule, where ∀c ∈ C : | vars(c) ∩ B | = 1 (and therefore Cr = ∅). 4.3 Completeness In this section, we introduce a class of models for which ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation with domain recursion is complete. Deﬁnition 10 (k-WFOMC). The class of k-WFOMC consist of WFOMC theories with clauses that have up to k logical variables. A ﬁrst completeness result is for 2-WFOMC, using the set of knowledge compilation rules CR 2 , which are the rules in CR 1 extended with domain recursion. Theorem 8 (Completeness for 2-WFOMC). First-order knowledge compilation using the CR 2 compilation rules is a complete domain lifted probabilistic inference algorithm for 2-WFOMC. Proof. From Lemma 1, after applying the CR 1 rules, the theory contains only atoms with dimension larger than or equal to two. From Deﬁnition 10, each clause has dimension smaller than or equal to two. Therefore, each logical variable in the theory is a root variable and according to Deﬁnition 5, every equivalence class of binding variables is a root binding class. Because of Lemma 1, the theory allows for domain recursion, which requires further compilation of two theories: Cx and Cr into nx and nr . Both have dimension smaller than 2 and can be lifted by CR 1 compilation rules. The properties of 2-WFOMC are a sufﬁcient but not necessary condition for ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation to be domain lifted. We can obtain a similar result for MLNs or parfactors by reducing them to a WFOMC problem. If an MLN contains only formulae with up to k logical variables, then its WFOMC representation will be in k-WFOMC. 7 This result for 2-WFOMC is not trivial. Van den Broeck et al. [10] showed in their experiments that counting ﬁrst-order variable elimination (C-FOVE) [6] fails to lift the “Friends Smoker Drinker” problem, which is in 2-WFOMC. We will show in the next section that the CR 1 rules fail to lift the theory in Figure 4a, which is in 2-WFOMC. Note that there are also useful theories that are not in 2-WFOMC, such as those containing the transitive relation friends(X, Y ) ∧ friends(Y, Z) ⇒ friends(X, Z). 5 Empirical evaluation To complement the theoretical results of the previous section, we extended the WFOMC implementation1 with the domain recursion rule. We performed experiments with the theory in Figure 4a, which is a version of the friends and smokers model [11] extended with the symmetric relation of Equation 3. We evaluate the performance querying P(smokes(bob)) with increasing domain size, comparing our approach to the existing WFOMC implementation and its propositional counterpart, which ﬁrst grounds the theory and then compiles it with the c2d compiler [13] to a propositional d-DNNF circuit. We did not compare to C-FOVE [6] because it cannot perform lifted inference on this model. 2 smokes(X) ∧ friends(X, Y ) ⇒ smokes(Y ) friends(X, Y ) ⇒ friends(Y, X). Runtime [s] Propositional inference quickly becomes intractable when there are more than 20 people. The lifted inference algorithms scale much better. The CR 1 rules can exploit some regularities in the model. For example, they eliminate all the smokes(X) atoms from the theory. They do, however, resort to grounding at a later stage of the compilation process. With the domain recursion rule, there is no need for grounding. This advantage is clear in the experiments, our approach having an almost constant inference time in this range of domains sizes. Note that the runtimes for c2d include compilation and evaluation of the circuit, whereas the WFOMC runtimes only represent evaluation of the FO d-DNNF. After all, propositional compilation depends on the domain size but ﬁrst-order compilation does not. First-order compilation takes a constant two seconds for both rule sets. 10000 1000 100 10 1 0.1 0.01 c2d WFOMC - CR1 WFOMC - CR2 10 20 30 40 50 60 Number of People 70 80 (b) Evaluation Runtime (a) MLN Model Figure 4: Symmetric friends and smokers experiment, comparing propositional knowledge compilation (c2d) to WFOMC using compilation rules CR 1 and CR 2 (which includes domain recursion). 6 Conclusions We proposed a deﬁnition of complete domain lifted probabilistic inference w.r.t. classes of probabilistic logic models. This deﬁnition considers algorithms to be lifted if they are polynomial in the size of logical variable domains. Existing ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation turns out not to admit an intuitive completeness result. Therefore, we generalized the existing Independent Partial Grounding compilation rule to the domain recursion rule. With this one extra rule, we showed that ﬁrst-order knowledge compilation is complete for a signiﬁcant class of probabilistic logic models, where the WFOMC representation has up to two logical variables per clause.

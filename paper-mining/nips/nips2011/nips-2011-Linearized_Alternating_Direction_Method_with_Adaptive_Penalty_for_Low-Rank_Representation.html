We show that both the basic proximal-gradient method and the accelerated proximal-gradient method achieve the same convergence rate as in the error-free case, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates. Using these rates, we perform as well as or better than a carefully chosen ﬁxed error level on a set of structured sparsity problems. 1</p><p>3 0.14090422 <a title="161-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Methods_for_Overlapping_Group_Lasso.html">78 nips-2011-Efficient Methods for Overlapping Group Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Yuan, Jun Liu, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predeﬁned) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efﬁcient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using both synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efﬁcient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.073999107 <a title="161-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Features_for_PCA-Like_Linear_Regression.html">260 nips-2011-Sparse Features for PCA-Like Linear Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Boutsidis, Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail</p><p>Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is often used as a feature extraction procedure. Given a matrix X ∈ Rn×d , whose rows represent n data points with respect to d features, the top k right singular vectors of X (the so-called eigenfeatures), are arbitrary linear combinations of all available features. The eigenfeatures are very useful in data analysis, including the regularization of linear regression. Enforcing sparsity on the eigenfeatures, i.e., forcing them to be linear combinations of only a small number of actual features (as opposed to all available features), can promote better generalization error and improve the interpretability of the eigenfeatures. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms that construct such sparse eigenfeatures while provably achieving in-sample performance comparable to regularized linear regression. Our algorithms are relatively simple and practically efﬁcient, and we demonstrate their performance on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.058622342 <a title="161-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Performance_of_Convex_Tensor_Decomposition.html">270 nips-2011-Statistical Performance of Convex Tensor Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Kohei Hayashi, Hisashi Kashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their performance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of the convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank of the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex low-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical experiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice.</p><p>6 0.05700206 <a title="161-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Penalty_Decomposition_Methods_for_Rank_Minimization.html">211 nips-2011-Penalty Decomposition Methods for Rank Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yong Zhang, Zhaosong Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider general rank minimization problems with rank appearing in either objective function or constraint. We ﬁrst show that a class of matrix optimization problems can be solved as lower dimensional vector optimization problems. As a consequence, we establish that a class of rank minimization problems have closed form solutions. Using this result, we then propose penalty decomposition methods for general rank minimization problems. The convergence results of the PD methods have been shown in the longer version of the paper [19]. Finally, we test the performance of our methods by applying them to matrix completion and nearest low-rank correlation matrix problems. The computational results demonstrate that our methods generally outperform the existing methods in terms of solution quality and/or speed. 1</p><p>5 0.40354401 <a title="161-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Quasi-Newton_Methods_for_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo.html">228 nips-2011-Quasi-Newton Methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a></p>
<p>Author: Yichuan Zhang, Charles A. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: The performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is often sensitive to the scaling and correlations between the random variables of interest. An important source of information about the local correlation and scale is given by the Hessian matrix of the target distribution, but this is often either computationally expensive or infeasible. In this paper we propose MCMC samplers that make use of quasiNewton approximations, which approximate the Hessian of the target distribution from previous samples and gradients generated by the sampler. A key issue is that MCMC samplers that depend on the history of previous states are in general not valid. We address this problem by using limited memory quasi-Newton methods, which depend only on a ﬁxed window of previous samples. On several real world datasets, we show that the quasi-Newton sampler is more effective than standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo at a fraction of the cost of MCMC methods that require higher-order derivatives. 1</p><p>6 0.3446781 <a title="161-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Higher-Order_Graph_Structure_with_Features_by_Structure_Penalty.html">146 nips-2011-Learning Higher-Order Graph Structure with Features by Structure Penalty</a></p>

<p>Author: Duy Q. Vu, David Hunter, Padhraic Smyth, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: The development of statistical models for continuous-time longitudinal network data is of increasing interest in machine learning and social science. Leveraging ideas from survival and event history analysis, we introduce a continuous-time regression modeling framework for network event data that can incorporate both time-dependent network statistics and time-varying regression coefﬁcients. We also develop an efﬁcient inference scheme that allows our approach to scale to large networks. On synthetic and real-world data, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed inference approach can accurately estimate the coefﬁcients of the regression model, which is useful for interpreting the evolution of the network; furthermore, the learned model has systematically better predictive performance compared to standard baseline methods.</p><p>3 0.54737198 <a title="161-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Generalized_Lasso_based_Approximation_of_Sparse_Coding_for_Visual_Recognition.html">105 nips-2011-Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse Coding for Visual Recognition</a></p>

However, because of its iterative optimization, applying sparse coding onto every local feature descriptor extracted from an image database can become a major bottleneck. To overcome this computational challenge, this paper presents “Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse coding” (GLAS). By representing the distribution of sparse coefﬁcients with slice transform, we ﬁt a piece-wise linear mapping function with the generalized lasso. We also propose an efﬁcient post-reﬁnement procedure to perform mutual inhibition between bases which is essential for an overcomplete setting. The experiments show that GLAS obtains a comparable performance to 1 regularized sparse coding, yet achieves a signiﬁcant speed up demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale visual recognition problems. 1</p><p>4 0.53075695 <a title="161-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Submodular_Multi-Label_Learning.html">277 nips-2011-Submodular Multi-Label Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm to learn a multi-label classiﬁer which attempts at directly optimising the F -score. The key novelty of our formulation is that we explicitly allow for assortative (submodular) pairwise label interactions, i.e., we can leverage the co-ocurrence of pairs of labels in order to improve the quality of prediction. Prediction in this model consists of minimising a particular submodular set function, what can be accomplished exactly and eﬃciently via graph-cuts. Learning however is substantially more involved and requires the solution of an intractable combinatorial optimisation problem. We present an approximate algorithm for this problem and prove that it is sound in the sense that it never predicts incorrect labels. We also present a nontrivial test of a suﬃcient condition for our algorithm to have found an optimal solution. We present experiments on benchmark multi-label datasets, which attest the value of the proposed technique. We also make available source code that enables the reproduction of our experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.4620316 <a title="161-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Performance_of_Convex_Tensor_Decomposition.html">270 nips-2011-Statistical Performance of Convex Tensor Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Kohei Hayashi, Hisashi Kashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their performance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of the convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank of the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex low-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical experiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice.</p><p>6 0.46070674 <a title="161-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-The_Manifold_Tangent_Classifier.html">287 nips-2011-The Manifold Tangent Classifier</a></p>

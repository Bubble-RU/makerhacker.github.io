<p>Author: Alyson K. Fletcher, Sundeep Rangan, Lav R. Varshney, Aniruddha Bhargava</p><p>Abstract: Many functional descriptions of spiking neurons assume a cascade structure where inputs are passed through an initial linear ﬁltering stage that produces a lowdimensional signal that drives subsequent nonlinear stages. This paper presents a novel and systematic parameter estimation procedure for such models and applies the method to two neural estimation problems: (i) compressed-sensing based neural mapping from multi-neuron excitation, and (ii) estimation of neural receptive ﬁelds in sensory neurons. The proposed estimation algorithm models the neurons via a graphical model and then estimates the parameters in the model using a recently-developed generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) method. The GAMP method is based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation. In the neural connectivity problem, the GAMP-based method is shown to be computational efﬁcient, provides a more exact modeling of the sparsity, can incorporate nonlinearities in the output and signiﬁcantly outperforms previous compressed-sensing methods. For the receptive ﬁeld estimation, the GAMP method can also exploit inherent structured sparsity in the linear weights. The method is validated on estimation of linear nonlinear Poisson (LNP) cascade models for receptive ﬁelds of salamander retinal ganglion cells. 1</p><p>3 0.26811695 <a title="44-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Active_learning_of_neural_response_functions_with_Gaussian_processes.html">24 nips-2011-Active learning of neural response functions with Gaussian processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Mijung Park, Greg Horwitz, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: A sizeable literature has focused on the problem of estimating a low-dimensional feature space for a neuron’s stimulus sensitivity. However, comparatively little work has addressed the problem of estimating the nonlinear function from feature space to spike rate. Here, we use a Gaussian process (GP) prior over the inﬁnitedimensional space of nonlinear functions to obtain Bayesian estimates of the “nonlinearity” in the linear-nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) encoding model. This approach offers increased ﬂexibility, robustness, and computational tractability compared to traditional methods (e.g., parametric forms, histograms, cubic splines). We then develop a framework for optimal experimental design under the GP-Poisson model using uncertainty sampling. This involves adaptively selecting stimuli according to an information-theoretic criterion, with the goal of characterizing the nonlinearity with as little experimental data as possible. Our framework relies on a method for rapidly updating hyperparameters under a Gaussian approximation to the posterior. We apply these methods to neural data from a color-tuned simple cell in macaque V1, characterizing its nonlinear response function in the 3D space of cone contrasts. We ﬁnd that it combines cone inputs in a highly nonlinear manner. With simulated experiments, we show that optimal design substantially reduces the amount of data required to estimate these nonlinear combination rules. 1</p><p>4 0.21876928 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_coding_of_natural_images_with_a_population_of_noisy_Linear-Nonlinear_neurons.html">82 nips-2011-Efficient coding of natural images with a population of noisy Linear-Nonlinear neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>5 0.19716574 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>6 0.16350481 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Hilbert J. Kappen, Mohammad G. Azar, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new convergent variant of Q-learning, called speedy Q-learning (SQL), to address the problem of slow convergence in the standard form of the Q-learning algorithm. We prove a PAC bound on the performance of SQL, which shows that for an MDP with n state-action pairs and the discount factor γ only T = O log(n)/(ǫ2 (1 − γ)4 ) steps are required for the SQL algorithm to converge to an ǫ-optimal action-value function with high probability. This bound has a better dependency on 1/ǫ and 1/(1 − γ), and thus, is tighter than the best available result for Q-learning. Our bound is also superior to the existing results for both modelfree and model-based instances of batch Q-value iteration that are considered to be more efﬁcient than the incremental methods like Q-learning. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7668016 <a title="44-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Bayesian_Spike-Triggered_Covariance_Analysis.html">44 nips-2011-Bayesian Spike-Triggered Covariance Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow, Il M. Park</p><p>Abstract: Neurons typically respond to a restricted number of stimulus features within the high-dimensional space of natural stimuli. Here we describe an explicit modelbased interpretation of traditional estimators for a neuron’s multi-dimensional feature space, which allows for several important generalizations and extensions. First, we show that traditional estimators based on the spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC) can be formalized in terms of the “expected log-likelihood” of a Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) model with Gaussian stimuli. This model-based formulation allows us to deﬁne maximum-likelihood and Bayesian estimators that are statistically consistent and efﬁcient in a wider variety of settings, such as with naturalistic (non-Gaussian) stimuli. It also allows us to employ Bayesian methods for regularization, smoothing, sparsiﬁcation, and model comparison, and provides Bayesian conﬁdence intervals on model parameters. We describe an empirical Bayes method for selecting the number of features, and extend the model to accommodate an arbitrary elliptical nonlinear response function, which results in a more powerful and more ﬂexible model for feature space inference. We validate these methods using neural data recorded extracellularly from macaque primary visual cortex. 1</p><p>3 0.73174989 <a title="44-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-ShareBoost%3A_Efficient_multiclass_learning_with_feature_sharing.html">252 nips-2011-ShareBoost: Efficient multiclass learning with feature sharing</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yonatan Wexler, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: Multiclass prediction is the problem of classifying an object into a relevant target class. We consider the problem of learning a multiclass predictor that uses only few features, and in particular, the number of used features should increase sublinearly with the number of possible classes. This implies that features should be shared by several classes. We describe and analyze the ShareBoost algorithm for learning a multiclass predictor that uses few shared features. We prove that ShareBoost efﬁciently ﬁnds a predictor that uses few shared features (if such a predictor exists) and that it has a small generalization error. We also describe how to use ShareBoost for learning a non-linear predictor that has a fast evaluation time. In a series of experiments with natural data sets we demonstrate the beneﬁts of ShareBoost and evaluate its success relatively to other state-of-the-art approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.71064633 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>5 0.70898038 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Learning_for_Recurrent_Spiking_Networks.html">302 nips-2011-Variational Learning for Recurrent Spiking Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Danilo J. Rezende, Daan Wierstra, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: We derive a plausible learning rule for feedforward, feedback and lateral connections in a recurrent network of spiking neurons. Operating in the context of a generative model for distributions of spike sequences, the learning mechanism is derived from variational inference principles. The synaptic plasticity rules found are interesting in that they are strongly reminiscent of experimental Spike Time Dependent Plasticity, and in that they differ for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A simulation conﬁrms the method’s applicability to learning both stationary and temporal spike patterns. 1</p><p>6 0.70644188 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-A_Convergence_Analysis_of_Log-Linear_Training.html">4 nips-2011-A Convergence Analysis of Log-Linear Training</a></p>

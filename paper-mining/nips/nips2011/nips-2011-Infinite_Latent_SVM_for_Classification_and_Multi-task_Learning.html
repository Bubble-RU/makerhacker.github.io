<p>Author: Hai-son P. Le, Ziv Bar-joseph</p><p>Abstract: Determining interactions between entities and the overall organization and clustering of nodes in networks is a major challenge when analyzing biological and social network data. Here we extend the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), a nonparametric Bayesian model, to integrate noisy interaction scores with properties of individual entities for inferring interaction networks and clustering nodes within these networks. We present an application of this method to study how microRNAs regulate mRNAs in cells. Analysis of synthetic and real data indicates that the method improves upon prior methods, correctly recovers interactions and clusters, and provides accurate biological predictions. 1</p><p>3 0.21272452 <a title="134-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Bayesian_Multi-Task_Learning.html">258 nips-2011-Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shengbo Guo, Onno Zoeter, Cédric Archambeau</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new sparse Bayesian model for multi-task regression and classiﬁcation. The model is able to capture correlations between tasks, or more speciﬁcally a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, while being sparse in the features. We introduce a general family of group sparsity inducing priors based on matrix-variate Gaussian scale mixtures. We show the amount of sparsity can be learnt from the data by combining an approximate inference approach with type II maximum likelihood estimation of the hyperparameters. Empirical evaluations on data sets from biology and vision demonstrate the applicability of the model, where on both regression and classiﬁcation tasks it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to previously proposed methods. 1</p><p>4 0.11803205 <a title="134-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-The_Kernel_Beta_Process.html">285 nips-2011-The Kernel Beta Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Ren, Yingjian Wang, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A new L´ vy process prior is proposed for an uncountable collection of covariatee dependent feature-learning measures; the model is called the kernel beta process (KBP). Available covariates are handled efﬁciently via the kernel construction, with covariates assumed observed with each data sample (“customer”), and latent covariates learned for each feature (“dish”). Each customer selects dishes from an inﬁnite buffet, in a manner analogous to the beta process, with the added constraint that a customer ﬁrst decides probabilistically whether to “consider” a dish, based on the distance in covariate space between the customer and dish. If a customer does consider a particular dish, that dish is then selected probabilistically as in the beta process. The beta process is recovered as a limiting case of the KBP. An efﬁcient Gibbs sampler is developed for computations, and state-of-the-art results are presented for image processing and music analysis tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.11195491 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Bayesian_Bias_Mitigation_for_Crowdsourcing.html">42 nips-2011-Bayesian Bias Mitigation for Crowdsourcing</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Biased labelers are a systemic problem in crowdsourcing, and a comprehensive toolbox for handling their responses is still being developed. A typical crowdsourcing application can be divided into three steps: data collection, data curation, and learning. At present these steps are often treated separately. We present Bayesian Bias Mitigation for Crowdsourcing (BBMC), a Bayesian model to unify all three. Most data curation methods account for the effects of labeler bias by modeling all labels as coming from a single latent truth. Our model captures the sources of bias by describing labelers as inﬂuenced by shared random effects. This approach can account for more complex bias patterns that arise in ambiguous or hard labeling tasks and allows us to merge data curation and learning into a single computation. Active learning integrates data collection with learning, but is commonly considered infeasible with Gibbs sampling inference. We propose a general approximation strategy for Markov chains to efﬁciently quantify the effect of a perturbation on the stationary distribution and specialize this approach to active learning. Experiments show BBMC to outperform many common heuristics. 1</p><p>6 0.092507906 <a title="134-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Generalized_Beta_Mixtures_of_Gaussians.html">104 nips-2011-Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians</a></p>

<p>Author: Artin Armagan, Merlise Clyde, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, a rich variety of shrinkage priors have been proposed that have great promise in addressing massive regression problems. In general, these new priors can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals, but have more complex forms and better properties than traditional Cauchy and double exponential priors. We ﬁrst propose a new class of normal scale mixtures through a novel generalized beta distribution that encompasses many interesting priors as special cases. This encompassing framework should prove useful in comparing competing priors, considering properties and revealing close connections. We then develop a class of variational Bayes approximations through the new hierarchy presented that will scale more efﬁciently to the types of truly massive data sets that are now encountered routinely. 1</p><p>6 0.57714283 <a title="134-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Spike_and_Slab_Variational_Inference_for_Multi-Task_and_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">269 nips-2011-Spike and Slab Variational Inference for Multi-Task and Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Chiyuan Zhang, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning from the vector ﬁeld perspective. Many of the existing work use the graph Laplacian to ensure the smoothness of the prediction function on the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, it is suggested by recent theoretical work that we should ensure second order smoothness for achieving faster rates of convergence for semisupervised regression problems. To achieve this goal, we show that the second order smoothness measures the linearity of the function, and the gradient ﬁeld of a linear function has to be a parallel vector ﬁeld. Consequently, we propose to ﬁnd a function which minimizes the empirical error, and simultaneously requires its gradient ﬁeld to be as parallel as possible. We give a continuous objective function on the manifold and discuss how to discretize it by using random points. The discretized optimization problem turns out to be a sparse linear system which can be solved very efﬁciently. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>2 0.90910822 <a title="134-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Analytical_Results_for_the_Error_in_Filtering_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">37 nips-2011-Analytical Results for the Error in Filtering of Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex K. Susemihl, Ron Meir, Manfred Opper</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic stimuli has received a great deal of attention recently. It has been applied to describe the way in which biological systems dynamically represent and make decisions about the environment. There have been no exact results for the error in the biologically plausible setting of inference on point process, however. We present an exact analysis of the evolution of the meansquared error in a state estimation task using Gaussian-tuned point processes as sensors. This allows us to study the dynamics of the error of an optimal Bayesian decoder, providing insights into the limits obtainable in this task. This is done for Markovian and a class of non-Markovian Gaussian processes. We ﬁnd that there is an optimal tuning width for which the error is minimized. This leads to a characterization of the optimal encoding for the setting as a function of the statistics of the stimulus, providing a mathematically sound primer for an ecological theory of sensory processing. 1</p><p>3 0.86768788 <a title="134-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-On_Causal_Discovery_with_Cyclic_Additive_Noise_Models.html">194 nips-2011-On Causal Discovery with Cyclic Additive Noise Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Dominik Janzing, Tom Heskes, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We study a particular class of cyclic causal models, where each variable is a (possibly nonlinear) function of its parents and additive noise. We prove that the causal graph of such models is generically identiﬁable in the bivariate, Gaussian-noise case. We also propose a method to learn such models from observational data. In the acyclic case, the method reduces to ordinary regression, but in the more challenging cyclic case, an additional term arises in the loss function, which makes it a special case of nonlinear independent component analysis. We illustrate the proposed method on synthetic data. 1</p><p>4 0.8546623 <a title="134-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Covariance_Unfolding_%3A_Manifold_Learning_for_Bimodal_Data.html">167 nips-2011-Maximum Covariance Unfolding : Manifold Learning for Bimodal Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Vijay Mahadevan, Chi W. Wong, Jose C. Pereira, Tom Liu, Nuno Vasconcelos, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We propose maximum covariance unfolding (MCU), a manifold learning algorithm for simultaneous dimensionality reduction of data from different input modalities. Given high dimensional inputs from two different but naturally aligned sources, MCU computes a common low dimensional embedding that maximizes the cross-modal (inter-source) correlations while preserving the local (intra-source) distances. In this paper, we explore two applications of MCU. First we use MCU to analyze EEG-fMRI data, where an important goal is to visualize the fMRI voxels that are most strongly correlated with changes in EEG traces. To perform this visualization, we augment MCU with an additional step for metric learning in the high dimensional voxel space. Second, we use MCU to perform cross-modal retrieval of matched image and text samples from Wikipedia. To manage large applications of MCU, we develop a fast implementation based on ideas from spectral graph theory. These ideas transform the original problem for MCU, one of semideﬁnite programming, into a simpler problem in semideﬁnite quadratic linear programming. 1</p><p>5 0.85197997 <a title="134-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Blending_Autonomous_Exploration_and_Apprenticeship_Learning.html">48 nips-2011-Blending Autonomous Exploration and Apprenticeship Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas J. Walsh, Daniel K. Hewlett, Clayton T. Morrison</p><p>Abstract: We present theoretical and empirical results for a framework that combines the beneﬁts of apprenticeship and autonomous reinforcement learning. Our approach modiﬁes an existing apprenticeship learning framework that relies on teacher demonstrations and does not necessarily explore the environment. The ﬁrst change is replacing previously used Mistake Bound model learners with a recently proposed framework that melds the KWIK and Mistake Bound supervised learning protocols. The second change is introducing a communication of expected utility from the student to the teacher. The resulting system only uses teacher traces when the agent needs to learn concepts it cannot efﬁciently learn on its own. 1</p><p>6 0.84073961 <a title="134-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Clustering_via_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_for_Portable_Skill_Discovery.html">52 nips-2011-Clustering via Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Portable Skill Discovery</a></p>

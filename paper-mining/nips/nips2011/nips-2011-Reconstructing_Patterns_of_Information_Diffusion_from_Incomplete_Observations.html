<p>Author: Jia Deng, Sanjeev Satheesh, Alexander C. Berg, Fei Li</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to efﬁciently learn a label tree for large scale classiﬁcation with many classes. The key contribution of the approach is a technique to simultaneously determine the structure of the tree and learn the classiﬁers for each node in the tree. This approach also allows ﬁne grained control over the efﬁciency vs accuracy trade-off in designing a label tree, leading to more balanced trees. Experiments are performed on large scale image classiﬁcation with 10184 classes and 9 million images. We demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in test accuracy and efﬁciency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al. 1</p><p>3 0.15034559 <a title="234-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Message-Passing_for_Approximate_MAP_Inference_with_Latent_Variables.html">170 nips-2011-Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Fabio Vitale, Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating theoretical problem with applications in several domains. Since graph sparsiﬁcation via spanning trees retains enough information while making the task much easier, trees are an important special case of this problem. Although it is known how to predict the nodes of an unweighted tree in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a fully satisfactory algorithm is not available yet. We ﬁll this hole and introduce an efﬁcient node predictor, S HAZOO, which is nearly optimal on any weighted tree. Moreover, we show that S HAZOO can be viewed as a common nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for unweighted trees and weighted lines. Experiments on real-world datasets conﬁrm that S HAZOO performs well in that it fully exploits the structure of the input tree, and gets very close to (and sometimes better than) less scalable energy minimization methods. 1</p><p>5 0.12263291 <a title="234-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchical_Topic_Modeling_for_Analysis_of_Time-Evolving_Personal_Choices.html">115 nips-2011-Hierarchical Topic Modeling for Analysis of Time-Evolving Personal Choices</a></p>

Each tree path corresponds to a type of person, and each node (topic) has a corresponding probability vector over items that may be selected. The observed data are assumed to have associated temporal covariates (corresponding to the time at which choices are made), and we wish to impose that with increasing time it is more probable that topics deeper in the tree are utilized.

<p>Author: Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider a global optimization problem of a deterministic function f in a semimetric space, given a ﬁnite budget of n evaluations. The function f is assumed to be locally smooth (around one of its global maxima) with respect to a semi-metric ℓ. We describe two algorithms based on optimistic exploration that use a hierarchical partitioning of the space at all scales. A ﬁrst contribution is an algorithm, DOO, that requires the knowledge of ℓ. We report a ﬁnite-sample performance bound in terms of a measure of the quantity of near-optimal states. We then deﬁne a second algorithm, SOO, which does not require the knowledge of the semimetric ℓ under which f is smooth, and whose performance is almost as good as DOO optimally-ﬁtted.</p><p>4 0.72564417 <a title="234-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Message-Passing_for_Approximate_MAP_Inference_with_Latent_Variables.html">170 nips-2011-Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Liu, Liang Sun, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean projection of a vector of length p onto a non-negative max-heap—an ordered tree where the values of the nodes are all nonnegative and the value of any parent node is no less than the value(s) of its child node(s). This Euclidean projection plays a building block role in the optimization problem with a non-negative maxheap constraint. Such a constraint is desirable when the features follow an ordered tree structure, that is, a given feature is selected for the given regression/classiﬁcation task only if its parent node is selected. In this paper, we show that such Euclidean projection problem admits an analytical solution and we develop a top-down algorithm where the key operation is to ﬁnd the so-called maximal root-tree of the subtree rooted at each node. A naive approach for ﬁnding the maximal root-tree is to enumerate all the possible root-trees, which, however, does not scale well. We reveal several important properties of the maximal root-tree, based on which we design a bottom-up algorithm with merge for eﬃciently ﬁnding the maximal roottree. The proposed algorithm has a (worst-case) linear time complexity for a sequential list, and O(p2 ) for a general tree. We report simulation results showing the eﬀectiveness of the max-heap for regression with an ordered tree structure. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm has an expected linear time complexity for many special cases including a sequential list, a full binary tree, and a tree with depth 1. 1</p><p>6 0.6906504 <a title="234-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Multi-armed_bandits_on_implicit_metric_spaces.html">177 nips-2011-Multi-armed bandits on implicit metric spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Taiji Suzuki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we give a new generalization error bound of Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) for a general class of regularizations. Our main target in this paper is dense type regularizations including ℓp -MKL that imposes ℓp -mixed-norm regularization instead of ℓ1 -mixed-norm regularization. According to the recent numerical experiments, the sparse regularization does not necessarily show a good performance compared with dense type regularizations. Motivated by this fact, this paper gives a general theoretical tool to derive fast learning rates that is applicable to arbitrary mixed-norm-type regularizations in a unifying manner. As a by-product of our general result, we show a fast learning rate of ℓp -MKL that is tightest among existing bounds. We also show that our general learning rate achieves the minimax lower bound. Finally, we show that, when the complexities of candidate reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces are inhomogeneous, dense type regularization shows better learning rate compared with sparse ℓ1 regularization. 1</p><p>3 0.73892176 <a title="234-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>4 0.7177884 <a title="234-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Randomized_Algorithms_for_Comparison-based_Search.html">231 nips-2011-Randomized Algorithms for Comparison-based Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Dominique Tschopp, Suhas Diggavi, Payam Delgosha, Soheil Mohajer</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ﬁnding the nearest neighbor (or one of the R-nearest neighbors) of a query object q in a database of n objects, when we can only use a comparison oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query object. The main problem we study is how to search the database for the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the questions. The difﬁculty of this problem depends on properties of the underlying database. We show the importance of a characterization: combinatorial disorder D which deﬁnes approximate triangle n inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound of Ω(D log D + D2 ) average number of questions in the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates the fundamental role of D for worst case behavior. We develop 3 a randomized scheme for NN retrieval in O(D3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) 3 questions. The learning requires asking O(nD3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) questions and O(n log2 n/ log(2D)) bits to store.</p><p>5 0.71445787 <a title="234-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-High-Dimensional_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Tractable_Graph_Families_and_Necessary_Conditions.html">117 nips-2011-High-Dimensional Graphical Model Selection: Tractable Graph Families and Necessary Conditions</a></p>
<p>Author: Animashree Anandkumar, Vincent Tan, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Ising and Gaussian graphical model selection given n i.i.d. samples from the model. We propose an efﬁcient threshold-based algorithm for structure estimation based on conditional mutual information thresholding. This simple local algorithm requires only loworder statistics of the data and decides whether two nodes are neighbors in the unknown graph. We identify graph families for which the proposed algorithm has low sample and computational complexities. Under some transparent assumptions, we establish that the proposed algorithm is −4 structurally consistent (or sparsistent) when the number of samples scales as n = Ω(Jmin log p), where p is the number of nodes and Jmin is the minimum edge potential. We also develop novel non-asymptotic techniques for obtaining necessary conditions for graphical model selection. Keywords: Graphical model selection, high-dimensional learning, local-separation property, necessary conditions, typical sets, Fano’s inequality.</p><p>6 0.71285528 <a title="234-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent deep learning and unsupervised feature learning systems that learn from unlabeled data have achieved high performance in benchmarks by using extremely large architectures with many features (hidden units) at each layer. Unfortunately, for such large architectures the number of parameters can grow quadratically in the width of the network, thus necessitating hand-coded “local receptive ﬁelds” that limit the number of connections from lower level features to higher ones (e.g., based on spatial locality). In this paper we propose a fast method to choose these connections that may be incorporated into a wide variety of unsupervised training methods. Speciﬁcally, we choose local receptive ﬁelds that group together those low-level features that are most similar to each other according to a pairwise similarity metric. This approach allows us to harness the advantages of local receptive ﬁelds (such as improved scalability, and reduced data requirements) when we do not know how to specify such receptive ﬁelds by hand or where our unsupervised training algorithm has no obvious generalization to a topographic setting. We produce results showing how this method allows us to use even simple unsupervised training algorithms to train successful multi-layered networks that achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR and STL datasets: 82.0% and 60.1% accuracy, respectively. 1</p><p>3 0.21553157 <a title="298-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_coding_of_natural_images_with_a_population_of_noisy_Linear-Nonlinear_neurons.html">82 nips-2011-Efficient coding of natural images with a population of noisy Linear-Nonlinear neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>4 0.14277686 <a title="298-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Filtering.html">261 nips-2011-Sparse Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiquan Ngiam, Zhenghao Chen, Sonia A. Bhaskar, Pang W. Koh, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised feature learning has been shown to be effective at learning representations that perform well on image, video and audio classiﬁcation. However, many existing feature learning algorithms are hard to use and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we present sparse ﬁltering, a simple new algorithm which is efﬁcient and only has one hyperparameter, the number of features to learn. In contrast to most other feature learning methods, sparse ﬁltering does not explicitly attempt to construct a model of the data distribution. Instead, it optimizes a simple cost function – the sparsity of 2 -normalized features – which can easily be implemented in a few lines of MATLAB code. Sparse ﬁltering scales gracefully to handle high-dimensional inputs, and can also be used to learn meaningful features in additional layers with greedy layer-wise stacking. We evaluate sparse ﬁltering on natural images, object classiﬁcation (STL-10), and phone classiﬁcation (TIMIT), and show that our method works well on a range of different modalities. 1</p><p>5 0.14244319 <a title="298-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Chen, Vidhya Navalpakkam, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A model of human visual search is proposed. It predicts both response time (RT) and error rates (RT) as a function of image parameters such as target contrast and clutter. The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of target present vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the ﬁring pattern of V1/V2 neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integrating information over time is shown to be a ‘soft max’ of diffusions, computed over the visual ﬁeld by ‘hypercolumns’ of neurons that share the same receptive ﬁeld and have different response properties to image features. An approximation of the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather than diffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar predictions to the optimal observer in common psychophysics conditions. A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate between which mechanism is used in the human brain. A B C Figure 1: Visual search. (A) Clutter and camouﬂage make visual search difﬁcult.

<p>Author: Alyson K. Fletcher, Sundeep Rangan, Lav R. Varshney, Aniruddha Bhargava</p><p>Abstract: Many functional descriptions of spiking neurons assume a cascade structure where inputs are passed through an initial linear ﬁltering stage that produces a lowdimensional signal that drives subsequent nonlinear stages. This paper presents a novel and systematic parameter estimation procedure for such models and applies the method to two neural estimation problems: (i) compressed-sensing based neural mapping from multi-neuron excitation, and (ii) estimation of neural receptive ﬁelds in sensory neurons. The proposed estimation algorithm models the neurons via a graphical model and then estimates the parameters in the model using a recently-developed generalized approximate message passing (GAMP) method. The GAMP method is based on Gaussian approximations of loopy belief propagation. In the neural connectivity problem, the GAMP-based method is shown to be computational efﬁcient, provides a more exact modeling of the sparsity, can incorporate nonlinearities in the output and signiﬁcantly outperforms previous compressed-sensing methods. For the receptive ﬁeld estimation, the GAMP method can also exploit inherent structured sparsity in the linear weights. The method is validated on estimation of linear nonlinear Poisson (LNP) cascade models for receptive ﬁelds of salamander retinal ganglion cells. 1</p><p>4 0.65295953 <a title="298-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-ICA_with_Reconstruction_Cost_for_Efficient_Overcomplete_Feature_Learning.html">124 nips-2011-ICA with Reconstruction Cost for Efficient Overcomplete Feature Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Quoc V. Le, Alexandre Karpenko, Jiquan Ngiam, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Independent Components Analysis (ICA) and its variants have been successfully used for unsupervised feature learning. However, standard ICA requires an orthonoramlity constraint to be enforced, which makes it difﬁcult to learn overcomplete features. In addition, ICA is sensitive to whitening. These properties make it challenging to scale ICA to high dimensional data. In this paper, we propose a robust soft reconstruction cost for ICA that allows us to learn highly overcomplete sparse features even on unwhitened data. Our formulation reveals formal connections between ICA and sparse autoencoders, which have previously been observed only empirically. Our algorithm can be used in conjunction with off-the-shelf fast unconstrained optimizers. We show that the soft reconstruction cost can also be used to prevent replicated features in tiled convolutional neural networks. Using our method to learn highly overcomplete sparse features and tiled convolutional neural networks, we obtain competitive performances on a wide variety of object recognition tasks. We achieve state-of-the-art test accuracies on the STL-10 and Hollywood2 datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.62924051 <a title="298-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Structural_equations_and_divisive_normalization_for_energy-dependent_component_analysis.html">273 nips-2011-Structural equations and divisive normalization for energy-dependent component analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun-ichiro Hirayama, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: Components estimated by independent component analysis and related methods are typically not independent in real data. A very common form of nonlinear dependency between the components is correlations in their variances or energies. Here, we propose a principled probabilistic model to model the energycorrelations between the latent variables. Our two-stage model includes a linear mixing of latent signals into the observed ones like in ICA. The main new feature is a model of the energy-correlations based on the structural equation model (SEM), in particular, a Linear Non-Gaussian SEM. The SEM is closely related to divisive normalization which effectively reduces energy correlation. Our new twostage model enables estimation of both the linear mixing and the interactions related to energy-correlations, without resorting to approximations of the likelihood function or other non-principled approaches. We demonstrate the applicability of our method with synthetic dataset, natural images and brain signals. 1</p><p>6 0.58604634 <a title="298-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_Receptive_Fields_in_Deep_Networks.html">244 nips-2011-Selecting Receptive Fields in Deep Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Maneesh Bhand, Ritvik Mudur, Bipin Suresh, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: The efﬁcient coding hypothesis holds that neural receptive ﬁelds are adapted to the statistics of the environment, but is agnostic to the timescale of this adaptation, which occurs on both evolutionary and developmental timescales. In this work we focus on that component of adaptation which occurs during an organism’s lifetime, and show that a number of unsupervised feature learning algorithms can account for features of normal receptive ﬁeld properties across multiple primary sensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the same algorithms account for altered receptive ﬁeld properties in response to experimentally altered environmental statistics. Based on these modeling results we propose these models as phenomenological models of receptive ﬁeld plasticity during an organism’s lifetime. Finally, due to the success of the same models in multiple sensory areas, we suggest that these algorithms may provide a constructive realization of the theory, ﬁrst proposed by Mountcastle [1], that a qualitatively similar learning algorithm acts throughout primary sensory cortices. 1</p><p>2 0.68643886 <a title="298-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Collective_Graphical_Models.html">55 nips-2011-Collective Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel R. Sheldon, Thomas G. Dietterich</p><p>Abstract: There are many settings in which we wish to ﬁt a model of the behavior of individuals but where our data consist only of aggregate information (counts or low-dimensional contingency tables). This paper introduces Collective Graphical Models—a framework for modeling and probabilistic inference that operates directly on the sufﬁcient statistics of the individual model. We derive a highlyefﬁcient Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of the sufﬁcient statistics conditioned on noisy aggregate observations, prove its correctness, and demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally. 1</p><p>3 0.62559354 <a title="298-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Neuronal_Adaptation_for_Sampling-Based_Probabilistic_Inference_in_Perceptual_Bistability.html">184 nips-2011-Neuronal Adaptation for Sampling-Based Probabilistic Inference in Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: David P. Reichert, Peggy Series, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: It has been argued that perceptual multistability reﬂects probabilistic inference performed by the brain when sensory input is ambiguous. Alternatively, more traditional explanations of multistability refer to low-level mechanisms such as neuronal adaptation. We employ a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) model of cortical processing to demonstrate that these two different approaches can be combined in the same framework. Based on recent developments in machine learning, we show how neuronal adaptation can be understood as a mechanism that improves probabilistic, sampling-based inference. Using the ambiguous Necker cube image, we analyze the perceptual switching exhibited by the model. We also examine the inﬂuence of spatial attention, and explore how binocular rivalry can be modeled with the same approach. Our work joins earlier studies in demonstrating how the principles underlying DBMs relate to cortical processing, and offers novel perspectives on the neural implementation of approximate probabilistic inference in the brain. 1</p><p>4 0.62238228 <a title="298-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Signal_Estimation_Under_Random_Time-Warpings_and_Nonlinear_Signal_Alignment.html">253 nips-2011-Signal Estimation Under Random Time-Warpings and Nonlinear Signal Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian A. Kurtek, Anuj Srivastava, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: While signal estimation under random amplitudes, phase shifts, and additive noise is studied frequently, the problem of estimating a deterministic signal under random time-warpings has been relatively unexplored. We present a novel framework for estimating the unknown signal that utilizes the action of the warping group to form an equivalence relation between signals. First, we derive an estimator for the equivalence class of the unknown signal using the notion of Karcher mean on the quotient space of equivalence classes. This step requires the use of Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric and a square-root representation of signals to enable computations of distances and means under this metric. Then, we deﬁne a notion of the center of a class and show that the center of the estimated class is a consistent estimator of the underlying unknown signal. This estimation algorithm has many applications: (1) registration/alignment of functional data, (2) separation of phase/amplitude components of functional data, (3) joint demodulation and carrier estimation, and (4) sparse modeling of functional data. Here we demonstrate only (1) and (2): Given signals are temporally aligned using nonlinear warpings and, thus, separated into their phase and amplitude components. The proposed method for signal alignment is shown to have state of the art performance using Berkeley growth, handwritten signatures, and neuroscience spike train data. 1</p><p>5 0.61629921 <a title="298-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Estimating_time-varying_input_signals_and_ion_channel_states_from_a_single_voltage_trace_of_a_neuron.html">89 nips-2011-Estimating time-varying input signals and ion channel states from a single voltage trace of a neuron</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Tsubo, Petr Lansky, Shigeru Shinomoto</p><p>Abstract: State-of-the-art statistical methods in neuroscience have enabled us to ﬁt mathematical models to experimental data and subsequently to infer the dynamics of hidden parameters underlying the observable phenomena. Here, we develop a Bayesian method for inferring the time-varying mean and variance of the synaptic input, along with the dynamics of each ion channel from a single voltage trace of a neuron. An estimation problem may be formulated on the basis of the state-space model with prior distributions that penalize large ﬂuctuations in these parameters. After optimizing the hyperparameters by maximizing the marginal likelihood, the state-space model provides the time-varying parameters of the input signals and the ion channel states. The proposed method is tested not only on the simulated data from the Hodgkin−Huxley type models but also on experimental data obtained from a cortical slice in vitro. 1</p><p>6 0.61345977 <a title="298-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Structural_equations_and_divisive_normalization_for_energy-dependent_component_analysis.html">273 nips-2011-Structural equations and divisive normalization for energy-dependent component analysis</a></p>

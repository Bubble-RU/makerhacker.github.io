<p>Author: Qian Sun, Rita Chattopadhyay, Sethuraman Panchanathan, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative learning when training and test data belong to different distributions is a challenging and complex task. Often times we have very few or no labeled data from the test or target distribution but may have plenty of labeled data from multiple related sources with different distributions. The difference in distributions may be both in marginal and conditional probabilities. Most of the existing domain adaptation work focuses on the marginal probability distribution difference between the domains, assuming that the conditional probabilities are similar. However in many real world applications, conditional probability distribution differences are as commonplace as marginal probability differences. In this paper we propose a two-stage domain adaptation methodology which combines weighted data from multiple sources based on marginal probability differences (ﬁrst stage) as well as conditional probability differences (second stage), with the target domain data. The weights for minimizing the marginal probability differences are estimated independently, while the weights for minimizing conditional probability differences are computed simultaneously by exploiting the potential interaction among multiple sources. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of the proposed multi-source domain adaptation formulation using the weighted Rademacher complexity measure. Empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods using three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>3 0.081602693 <a title="284-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>4 0.078697167 <a title="284-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>5 0.070886314 <a title="284-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Online_Learning%3A_Stochastic%2C_Constrained%2C_and_Smoothed_Adversaries.html">204 nips-2011-Online Learning: Stochastic, Constrained, and Smoothed Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Learning theory has largely focused on two main learning scenarios: the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a ﬁxed distribution, and the adversarial scenario wherein, at every time step, an adversarially chosen instance is revealed to the player. It can be argued that in the real world neither of these assumptions is reasonable. We deﬁne the minimax value of a game where the adversary is restricted in his moves, capturing stochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential symmetrization approach, we deﬁne a notion of distribution-dependent Rademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to worst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We study a smoothed online learning scenario and show that exponentially small amount of noise can make function classes with inﬁnite Littlestone dimension learnable. 1</p><p>6 0.055825479 <a title="284-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-The_Local_Rademacher_Complexity_of_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">286 nips-2011-The Local Rademacher Complexity of Lp-Norm Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Minmin Chen, Kilian Q. Weinberger, John Blitzer</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain. In many practical cases, the source and target distributions can differ substantially, and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding to the training set both the target features and instances in which the current algorithm is the most conﬁdent. Our algorithm is a variant of co-training [7], and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation). Unlike the original co-training work, we do not assume a particular feature split. Instead, for each iteration of cotraining, we formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor, a split of the feature space into views, and a subset of source and target features to include in the predictor. CODA signiﬁcantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al. [4]. Indeed, over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision CODA achieves the best performance. 1</p><p>4 0.47725266 <a title="284-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>
<p>Author: Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using similarity/distance functions over data. Speciﬁcally, we propose a framework for deﬁning the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework uniﬁes and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [1] and [2]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a ﬁxed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classiﬁer from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a signiﬁcant margin. 1</p><p>5 0.47013488 <a title="284-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Relative_Density-Ratio_Estimation_for_Robust_Distribution_Comparison.html">238 nips-2011-Relative Density-Ratio Estimation for Robust Distribution Comparison</a></p>
<p>Author: Makoto Yamada, Taiji Suzuki, Takafumi Kanamori, Hirotaka Hachiya, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Divergence estimators based on direct approximation of density-ratios without going through separate approximation of numerator and denominator densities have been successfully applied to machine learning tasks that involve distribution comparison such as outlier detection, transfer learning, and two-sample homogeneity test. However, since density-ratio functions often possess high ﬂuctuation, divergence estimation is still a challenging task in practice. In this paper, we propose to use relative divergences for distribution comparison, which involves approximation of relative density-ratios. Since relative density-ratios are always smoother than corresponding ordinary density-ratios, our proposed method is favorable in terms of the non-parametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator hardly overﬁts even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.46296936 <a title="284-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-An_Exact_Algorithm_for_F-Measure_Maximization.html">33 nips-2011-An Exact Algorithm for F-Measure Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yisong Yue, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed retrieval and online learning are two core research areas in the design of modern information retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose the linear submodular bandits problem, which is an online learning setting for optimizing a general class of feature-rich submodular utility models for diversiﬁed retrieval. We present an algorithm, called LSBG REEDY, and prove that it efﬁciently converges to a near-optimal model. As a case study, we applied our approach to the setting of personalized news recommendation, where the system must recommend small sets of news articles selected from tens of thousands of available articles each day. In a live user study, we found that LSBG REEDY signiﬁcantly outperforms existing online learning approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66429013 <a title="284-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-The_Impact_of_Unlabeled_Patterns_in_Rademacher_Complexity_Theory_for_Kernel_Classifiers.html">284 nips-2011-The Impact of Unlabeled Patterns in Rademacher Complexity Theory for Kernel Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Youwei Zhang, Laurent E. Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA provides a linear combination of small number of features that maximizes variance across data. Although Sparse PCA has apparent advantages compared to PCA, such as better interpretability, it is generally thought to be computationally much more expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising fact that sparse PCA can be easier than PCA in practice, and that it can be reliably applied to very large data sets. This comes from a rigorous feature elimination pre-processing result, coupled with the favorable fact that features in real-life data typically have exponentially decreasing variances, which allows for many features to be eliminated. We introduce a fast block coordinate ascent algorithm with much better computational complexity than the existing ﬁrst-order ones. We provide experimental results obtained on text corpora involving millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. These results illustrate how Sparse PCA can help organize a large corpus of text data in a user-interpretable way, providing an attractive alternative approach to topic models. 1</p><p>4 0.54293835 <a title="284-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons.html">22 nips-2011-Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects). In general, the ranking of n objects can be identiﬁed by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reﬂect their relative distances from a common reference point in Rd . We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.53989172 <a title="284-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>6 0.53985316 <a title="284-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Understanding_the_Intrinsic_Memorability_of_Images.html">293 nips-2011-Understanding the Intrinsic Memorability of Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: A majority of approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem can be categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. The former approach, although fast, is well known to be susceptible to the policy oscillation phenomenon. We take a fresh view to this phenomenon by casting a considerable subset of the former approach as a limiting special case of the latter. We explain the phenomenon in terms of this view and illustrate the underlying mechanism with artiﬁcial examples. We also use it to derive the constrained natural actor-critic algorithm that can interpolate between the aforementioned approaches. In addition, it has been suggested in the literature that the oscillation phenomenon might be subtly connected to the grossly suboptimal performance in the Tetris benchmark problem of all attempted approximate dynamic programming methods. We report empirical evidence against such a connection and in favor of an alternative explanation. Finally, we report scores in the Tetris problem that improve on existing dynamic programming based results. 1</p><p>3 0.25200549 <a title="215-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-The_Fixed_Points_of_Off-Policy_TD.html">283 nips-2011-The Fixed Points of Off-Policy TD</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Z. Kolter</p><p>Abstract: Off-policy learning, the ability for an agent to learn about a policy other than the one it is following, is a key element of Reinforcement Learning, and in recent years there has been much work on developing Temporal Different (TD) algorithms that are guaranteed to converge under off-policy sampling. It has remained an open question, however, whether anything can be said a priori about the quality of the TD solution when off-policy sampling is employed with function approximation. In general the answer is no: for arbitrary off-policy sampling the error of the TD solution can be unboundedly large, even when the approximator can represent the true value function well. In this paper we propose a novel approach to address this problem: we show that by considering a certain convex subset of off-policy distributions we can indeed provide guarantees as to the solution quality similar to the on-policy case. Furthermore, we show that we can efﬁciently project on to this convex set using only samples generated from the system. The end result is a novel TD algorithm that has approximation guarantees even in the case of off-policy sampling and which empirically outperforms existing TD methods. 1</p><p>4 0.25173911 <a title="215-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-MAP_Inference_for_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.html">163 nips-2011-MAP Inference for Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: The difﬁculty in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) arises in choosing the best reward function since there are typically an inﬁnite number of reward functions that yield the given behaviour data as optimal. Using a Bayesian framework, we address this challenge by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the reward function, and show that most of the previous IRL algorithms can be modeled into our framework. We also present a gradient method for the MAP estimation based on the (sub)differentiability of the posterior distribution. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the proposed method to those of the previous algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.22961318 <a title="215-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Environmental_statistics_and_the_trade-off_between_model-based_and_TD_learning_in_humans.html">88 nips-2011-Environmental statistics and the trade-off between model-based and TD learning in humans</a></p>
<p>Author: Dylan A. Simon, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: There is much evidence that humans and other animals utilize a combination of model-based and model-free RL methods. Although it has been proposed that these systems may dominate according to their relative statistical efﬁciency in different circumstances, there is little speciﬁc evidence — especially in humans — as to the details of this trade-off. Accordingly, we examine the relative performance of different RL approaches under situations in which the statistics of reward are differentially noisy and volatile. Using theory and simulation, we show that model-free TD learning is relatively most disadvantaged in cases of high volatility and low noise. We present data from a decision-making experiment manipulating these parameters, showing that humans shift learning strategies in accord with these predictions. The statistical circumstances favoring model-based RL are also those that promote a high learning rate, which helps explain why, in psychology, the distinction between these strategies is traditionally conceived in terms of rulebased vs. incremental learning. 1</p><p>6 0.21104252 <a title="215-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Action-Gap_Phenomenon_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">18 nips-2011-Action-Gap Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingting Zhao, Hirotaka Hachiya, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Policy gradient is a useful model-free reinforcement learning approach, but it tends to suffer from instability of gradient estimates. In this paper, we analyze and improve the stability of policy gradient methods. We ﬁrst prove that the variance of gradient estimates in the PGPE (policy gradients with parameter-based exploration) method is smaller than that of the classical REINFORCE method under a mild assumption. We then derive the optimal baseline for PGPE, which contributes to further reducing the variance. We also theoretically show that PGPE with the optimal baseline is more preferable than REINFORCE with the optimal baseline in terms of the variance of gradient estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the improved PGPE method through experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.8192066 <a title="215-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Budgeted_Optimization_with_Concurrent_Stochastic-Duration_Experiments.html">50 nips-2011-Budgeted Optimization with Concurrent Stochastic-Duration Experiments</a></p>
<p>Author: Javad Azimi, Alan Fern, Xiaoli Z. Fern</p><p>Abstract: Budgeted optimization involves optimizing an unknown function that is costly to evaluate by requesting a limited number of function evaluations at intelligently selected inputs. Typical problem formulations assume that experiments are selected one at a time with a limited total number of experiments, which fail to capture important aspects of many real-world problems. This paper deﬁnes a novel problem formulation with the following important extensions: 1) allowing for concurrent experiments; 2) allowing for stochastic experiment durations; and 3) placing constraints on both the total number of experiments and the total experimental time. We develop both ofﬂine and online algorithms for selecting concurrent experiments in this new setting and provide experimental results on a number of optimization benchmarks. The results show that our algorithms produce highly effective schedules compared to natural baselines. 1</p><p>5 0.78706753 <a title="215-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Periodic_Finite_State_Controllers_for_Efficient_POMDP_and_DEC-POMDP_Planning.html">212 nips-2011-Periodic Finite State Controllers for Efficient POMDP and DEC-POMDP Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joni K. Pajarinen, Jaakko Peltonen</p><p>Abstract: Applications such as robot control and wireless communication require planning under uncertainty. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) plan policies for single agents under uncertainty and their decentralized versions (DEC-POMDPs) ﬁnd a policy for multiple agents. The policy in inﬁnite-horizon POMDP and DEC-POMDP problems has been represented as ﬁnite state controllers (FSCs). We introduce a novel class of periodic FSCs, composed of layers connected only to the previous and next layer. Our periodic FSC method ﬁnds a deterministic ﬁnite-horizon policy and converts it to an initial periodic inﬁnitehorizon policy. This policy is optimized by a new inﬁnite-horizon algorithm to yield deterministic periodic policies, and by a new expectation maximization algorithm to yield stochastic periodic policies. Our method yields better results than earlier planning methods and can compute larger solutions than with regular FSCs.</p><p>6 0.75812602 <a title="215-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Monte_Carlo_Value_Iteration_with_Macro-Actions.html">174 nips-2011-Monte Carlo Value Iteration with Macro-Actions</a></p>

In many of these problems the amount of data in practice is so large that there is a constant need for faster algorithms. In this work we present the ﬁrst sublinear time approximation algorithm for semideﬁnite programs which we believe may be useful for such problems in which the size of data may cause even linear time algorithms to have prohibitive running times in practice. We present the algorithm and its analysis alongside with some theoretical lower bounds and an improved algorithm for the special problem of supervised learning of a distance metric. 1</p><p>2 0.97979343 <a title="215-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Variance_Reduction_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search.html">300 nips-2011-Variance Reduction in Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Veness, Marc Lanctot, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven to be a powerful, generic planning technique for decision-making in single-agent and adversarial environments. The stochastic nature of the Monte-Carlo simulations introduces errors in the value estimates, both in terms of bias and variance. Whilst reducing bias (typically through the addition of domain knowledge) has been studied in the MCTS literature, comparatively little effort has focused on reducing variance. This is somewhat surprising, since variance reduction techniques are a well-studied area in classical statistics. In this paper, we examine the application of some standard techniques for variance reduction in MCTS, including common random numbers, antithetic variates and control variates. We demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to MCTS and explore their efﬁcacy on three different stochastic, single-agent settings: Pig, Can’t Stop and Dominion. 1</p><p>3 0.9732638 <a title="215-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_Dynamic_Difficulty.html">218 nips-2011-Predicting Dynamic Difficulty</a></p>

The task here is to repeatedly ﬁnd a game difﬁculty setting that is neither ‘too easy’ and bores the player, nor ‘too difﬁcult’ and overburdens the player. The contributions of this paper are (i) the formulation of difﬁculty adjustment as an online learning problem on partially ordered sets, (ii) an exponential update algorithm for dynamic difﬁculty adjustment, (iii) a bound on the number of wrong difﬁculty settings relative to the best static setting chosen in hindsight, and (iv) an empirical investigation of the algorithm when playing against adversaries. 1</p><p>4 0.96846038 <a title="215-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Complexity_of_Inference_in_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">58 nips-2011-Complexity of Inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Dan Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). First, we study the problem of ﬁnding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of topics to words, where the document’s topic distribution is integrated out. We show that, when the e↵ective number of topics per document is small, exact inference takes polynomial time. In contrast, we show that, when a document has a large number of topics, ﬁnding the MAP assignment of topics to words in LDA is NP-hard. Next, we consider the problem of ﬁnding the MAP topic distribution for a document, where the topic-word assignments are integrated out. We show that this problem is also NP-hard. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the problem of sampling from the posterior, showing that this is NP-hard in one restricted setting, but leaving open the general question. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.96197617 <a title="215-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Policy_Gradient_Coagent_Networks.html">215 nips-2011-Policy Gradient Coagent Networks</a></p>

Such updates are necessary when computation of compatible features becomes prohibitively difﬁcult and are also desirable to increase the biological plausibility of reinforcement learning methods. 1</p><p>6 0.94879329 <a title="215-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-An_Application_of_Tree-Structured_Expectation_Propagation_for_Channel_Decoding.html">31 nips-2011-An Application of Tree-Structured Expectation Propagation for Channel Decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe</p><p>Abstract: Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius. Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure. 1</p><p>3 0.11467639 <a title="107-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian_Analysis_of_Contextual_Bandits.html">210 nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Peter Auer, John S. Shawe-taylor, Ronald Ortner, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We derive an instantaneous (per-round) data-dependent regret bound for stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (also known as contextual bandits). The p scaling of our regret bound with the number of states (contexts) N goes as N I⇢t (S; A), where I⇢t (S; A) is the mutual information between states and actions (the side information) used by the algorithm at round t. If the algorithm p uses all the side information, the regret bound scales as N ln K, where K is the number of actions (arms). However, if the side information I⇢t (S; A) is not fully used, the regret bound is signiﬁcantly tighter. In the extreme case, when I⇢t (S; A) = 0, the dependence on the number of states reduces from linear to logarithmic. Our analysis allows to provide the algorithm large amount of side information, let the algorithm to decide which side information is relevant for the task, and penalize the algorithm only for the side information that it is using de facto. We also present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits with side information with O(K) computational complexity per game round. 1</p><p>4 0.075445026 <a title="107-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Nonnegative_dictionary_learning_in_the_exponential_noise_model_for_adaptive_music_signal_representation.html">191 nips-2011-Nonnegative dictionary learning in the exponential noise model for adaptive music signal representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Onur Dikmen, Cédric Févotte</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a maximum likelihood approach for dictionary learning in the multiplicative exponential noise model. This model is prevalent in audio signal processing where it underlies a generative composite model of the power spectrogram. Maximum joint likelihood estimation of the dictionary and expansion coefﬁcients leads to a nonnegative matrix factorization problem where the Itakura-Saito divergence is used. The optimality of this approach is in question because the number of parameters (which include the expansion coefﬁcients) grows with the number of observations. In this paper we describe a variational procedure for optimization of the marginal likelihood, i.e., the likelihood of the dictionary where the activation coefﬁcients have been integrated out (given a speciﬁc prior). We compare the output of both maximum joint likelihood estimation (i.e., standard Itakura-Saito NMF) and maximum marginal likelihood estimation (MMLE) on real and synthetical datasets. The MMLE approach is shown to embed automatic model order selection, akin to automatic relevance determination.</p><p>5 0.068593919 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Generalised_Coupled_Tensor_Factorisation.html">102 nips-2011-Generalised Coupled Tensor Factorisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenan Y. Yılmaz, Ali T. Cemgil, Umut Simsekli</p><p>Abstract: We derive algorithms for generalised tensor factorisation (GTF) by building upon the well-established theory of Generalised Linear Models. Our algorithms are general in the sense that we can compute arbitrary factorisations in a message passing framework, derived for a broad class of exponential family distributions including special cases such as Tweedie’s distributions corresponding to βdivergences. By bounding the step size of the Fisher Scoring iteration of the GLM, we obtain general updates for real data and multiplicative updates for non-negative data. The GTF framework is, then extended easily to address the problems when multiple observed tensors are factorised simultaneously. We illustrate our coupled factorisation approach on synthetic data as well as on a musical audio restoration problem. 1</p><p>6 0.061512686 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-High-dimensional_regression_with_noisy_and_missing_data%3A_Provable_guarantees_with_non-convexity.html">118 nips-2011-High-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data: Provable guarantees with non-convexity</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong Dai, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of combining multiple models to achieve a prediction accuracy not much worse than that of the best single model for least squares regression. It is known that if the models are mis-speciﬁed, model averaging is superior to model selection. Speciﬁcally, let n be the sample size, then the worst case regret of the former decays at the rate of O(1/n) while the worst √ case regret of the latter decays at the rate of O(1/ n). In the literature, the most important and widely studied model averaging method that achieves the optimal O(1/n) average regret is the exponential weighted model averaging (EWMA) algorithm. However this method suffers from several limitations. The purpose of this paper is to present a new greedy model averaging procedure that improves EWMA. We prove strong theoretical guarantees for the new procedure and illustrate our theoretical results with empirical examples. 1</p><p>5 0.46114135 <a title="107-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Comparative_Analysis_of_Viterbi_Training_and_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_for_HMMs.html">57 nips-2011-Comparative Analysis of Viterbi Training and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for HMMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Armen Allahverdyan, Aram Galstyan</p><p>Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of Viterbi Training (VT) and contrast it with a more conventional Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach to parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models. While ML estimator works by (locally) maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, VT seeks to maximize the probability of the most likely hidden state sequence. We develop an analytical framework based on a generating function formalism and illustrate it on an exactly solvable model of HMM with one unambiguous symbol. For this particular model the ML objective function is continuously degenerate. VT objective, in contrast, is shown to have only ﬁnite degeneracy. Furthermore, VT converges faster and results in sparser (simpler) models, thus realizing an automatic Occam’s razor for HMM learning. For more general scenario VT can be worse compared to ML but still capable of correctly recovering most of the parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.44225842 <a title="107-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Non-conjugate_Variational_Message_Passing_for_Multinomial_and_Binary_Regression.html">188 nips-2011-Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing for Multinomial and Binary Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Michael James</p><p>Abstract: Rational models of causal induction have been successful in accounting for people’s judgments about causal relationships. However, these models have focused on explaining inferences from discrete data of the kind that can be summarized in a 2× 2 contingency table. This severely limits the scope of these models, since the world often provides non-binary data. We develop a new rational model of causal induction using continuous dimensions, which aims to diminish the gap between empirical and theoretical approaches and real-world causal induction. This model successfully predicts human judgments from previous studies better than models of discrete causal inference, and outperforms several other plausible models of causal induction with continuous causes in accounting for people’s inferences in a new experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.58733124 <a title="107-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-See_the_Tree_Through_the_Lines%3A_The_Shazoo_Algorithm.html">242 nips-2011-See the Tree Through the Lines: The Shazoo Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabio Vitale, Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating theoretical problem with applications in several domains. Since graph sparsiﬁcation via spanning trees retains enough information while making the task much easier, trees are an important special case of this problem. Although it is known how to predict the nodes of an unweighted tree in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a fully satisfactory algorithm is not available yet. We ﬁll this hole and introduce an efﬁcient node predictor, S HAZOO, which is nearly optimal on any weighted tree. Moreover, we show that S HAZOO can be viewed as a common nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for unweighted trees and weighted lines. Experiments on real-world datasets conﬁrm that S HAZOO performs well in that it fully exploits the structure of the input tree, and gets very close to (and sometimes better than) less scalable energy minimization methods. 1</p><p>4 0.54738235 <a title="107-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Features_for_PCA-Like_Linear_Regression.html">260 nips-2011-Sparse Features for PCA-Like Linear Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Boutsidis, Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail</p><p>Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is often used as a feature extraction procedure. Given a matrix X ∈ Rn×d , whose rows represent n data points with respect to d features, the top k right singular vectors of X (the so-called eigenfeatures), are arbitrary linear combinations of all available features. The eigenfeatures are very useful in data analysis, including the regularization of linear regression. Enforcing sparsity on the eigenfeatures, i.e., forcing them to be linear combinations of only a small number of actual features (as opposed to all available features), can promote better generalization error and improve the interpretability of the eigenfeatures. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms that construct such sparse eigenfeatures while provably achieving in-sample performance comparable to regularized linear regression. Our algorithms are relatively simple and practically efﬁcient, and we demonstrate their performance on several data sets.</p><p>5 0.51089686 <a title="107-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur D. Szlam, Karol Gregor, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: This work describes a conceptually simple method for structured sparse coding and dictionary design. Supposing a dictionary with K atoms, we introduce a structure as a set of penalties or interactions between every pair of atoms. We describe modiﬁcations of standard sparse coding algorithms for inference in this setting, and describe experiments showing that these algorithms are efﬁcient. We show that interesting dictionaries can be learned for interactions that encode tree structures or locally connected structures. Finally, we show that our framework allows us to learn the values of the interactions from the data, rather than having them pre-speciﬁed. 1</p><p>6 0.50979233 <a title="107-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: David Wingate, Noah Goodman, Andreas Stuhlmueller, Jeffrey M. Siskind</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic programming languages allow modelers to specify a stochastic process using syntax that resembles modern programming languages. Because the program is in machine-readable format, a variety of techniques from compiler design and program analysis can be used to examine the structure of the distribution represented by the probabilistic program. We show how nonstandard interpretations of probabilistic programs can be used to craft efﬁcient inference algorithms: information about the structure of a distribution (such as gradients or dependencies) is generated as a monad-like side computation while executing the program. These interpretations can be easily coded using special-purpose objects and operator overloading. We implement two examples of nonstandard interpretations in two different languages, and use them as building blocks to construct inference algorithms: automatic differentiation, which enables gradient based methods, and provenance tracking, which enables efﬁcient construction of global proposals. 1</p><p>3 0.096409298 <a title="228-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Universal_low-rank_matrix_recovery_from_Pauli_measurements.html">297 nips-2011-Universal low-rank matrix recovery from Pauli measurements</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-kai Liu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing an unknown matrix M of rank r and dimension d using O(rd poly log d) Pauli measurements. This has applications in quantum state tomography, and is a non-commutative analogue of a well-known problem in compressed sensing: recovering a sparse vector from a few of its Fourier coefﬁcients. We show that almost all sets of O(rd log6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rankr restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a ﬁxed (“universal”) set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley’s inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality. 1</p><p>4 0.083341531 <a title="228-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Query-Aware_MCMC.html">229 nips-2011-Query-Aware MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael L. Wick, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to probabilistic inference such as loopy belief propagation and Gibbs sampling typically compute marginals for all the unobserved variables in a graphical model. However, in many real-world applications the user’s interests are focused on a subset of the variables, speciﬁed by a query. In this case it would be wasteful to uniformly sample, say, one million variables when the query concerns only ten. In this paper we propose a query-speciﬁc approach to MCMC that accounts for the query variables and their generalized mutual information with neighboring variables in order to achieve higher computational efﬁciency. Surprisingly there has been almost no previous work on query-aware MCMC. We demonstrate the success of our approach with positive experimental results on a wide range of graphical models. 1</p><p>5 0.08053185 <a title="228-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Comparative_Analysis_of_Viterbi_Training_and_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_for_HMMs.html">57 nips-2011-Comparative Analysis of Viterbi Training and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for HMMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Armen Allahverdyan, Aram Galstyan</p><p>Abstract: We present an asymptotic analysis of Viterbi Training (VT) and contrast it with a more conventional Maximum Likelihood (ML) approach to parameter estimation in Hidden Markov Models. While ML estimator works by (locally) maximizing the likelihood of the observed data, VT seeks to maximize the probability of the most likely hidden state sequence. We develop an analytical framework based on a generating function formalism and illustrate it on an exactly solvable model of HMM with one unambiguous symbol. For this particular model the ML objective function is continuously degenerate. VT objective, in contrast, is shown to have only ﬁnite degeneracy. Furthermore, VT converges faster and results in sparser (simpler) models, thus realizing an automatic Occam’s razor for HMM learning. For more general scenario VT can be worse compared to ML but still capable of correctly recovering most of the parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.069791354 <a title="228-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Semi-supervised_Regression_via_Parallel_Field_Regularization.html">248 nips-2011-Semi-supervised Regression via Parallel Field Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhouchen Lin, Risheng Liu, Zhixun Su</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning and signal processing problems can be formulated as linearly constrained convex programs, which could be efﬁciently solved by the alternating direction method (ADM). However, usually the subproblems in ADM are easily solvable only when the linear mappings in the constraints are identities. To address this issue, we propose a linearized ADM (LADM) method by linearizing the quadratic penalty term and adding a proximal term when solving the subproblems. For fast convergence, we also allow the penalty to change adaptively according a novel update rule. We prove the global convergence of LADM with adaptive penalty (LADMAP). As an example, we apply LADMAP to solve lowrank representation (LRR), which is an important subspace clustering technique yet suffers from high computation cost. By combining LADMAP with a skinny SVD representation technique, we are able to reduce the complexity O(n3 ) of the original ADM based method to O(rn2 ), where r and n are the rank and size of the representation matrix, respectively, hence making LRR possible for large scale applications. Numerical experiments verify that for LRR our LADMAP based methods are much faster than state-of-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.52536559 <a title="228-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Accelerated_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_for_Partition_Function_Computation.html">17 nips-2011-Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefano Ermon, Carla P. Gomes, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the partition function. In particular, we show how to accelerate a ﬂat histogram sampling technique by signiﬁcantly reducing the number of “null moves” in the chain, while maintaining asymptotic convergence properties. Our experiments show that our method converges quickly to highly accurate solutions on a range of benchmark instances, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as IJGP, TRW, and Gibbs sampling both in run-time and accuracy. We also show how obtaining a so-called density of states distribution allows for efﬁcient weight learning in Markov Logic theories. 1</p><p>5 0.52513897 <a title="228-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Collective_Graphical_Models.html">55 nips-2011-Collective Graphical Models</a></p>

This paper introduces Collective Graphical Models—a framework for modeling and probabilistic inference that operates directly on the sufﬁcient statistics of the individual model. We derive a highlyefﬁcient Gibbs sampling algorithm for sampling from the posterior distribution of the sufﬁcient statistics conditioned on noisy aggregate observations, prove its correctness, and demonstrate its effectiveness experimentally. 1</p><p>6 0.51401055 <a title="228-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Comparative_Analysis_of_Viterbi_Training_and_Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_for_HMMs.html">57 nips-2011-Comparative Analysis of Viterbi Training and Maximum Likelihood Estimation for HMMs</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Benjamin Link, Harold Pashler</p><p>Abstract: Psychologists have long been struck by individuals’ limitations in expressing their internal sensations, impressions, and evaluations via rating scales. Instead of using an absolute scale, individuals rely on reference points from recent experience. This relativity of judgment limits the informativeness of responses on surveys, questionnaires, and evaluation forms. Fortunately, the cognitive processes that map stimuli to responses are not simply noisy, but rather are inﬂuenced by recent experience in a lawful manner. We explore techniques to remove sequential dependencies, and thereby decontaminate a series of ratings to obtain more meaningful human judgments. In our formulation, the problem is to infer latent (subjective) impressions from a sequence of stimulus labels (e.g., movie names) and responses. We describe an unsupervised approach that simultaneously recovers the impressions and parameters of a contamination model that predicts how recent judgments affect the current response. We test our iterated impression inference, or I3 , algorithm in three domains: rating the gap between dots, the desirability of a movie based on an advertisement, and the morality of an action. We demonstrate signiﬁcant objective improvements in the quality of the recovered impressions. 1</p><p>3 0.63595498 <a title="228-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Projection_onto_A_Nonnegative_Max-Heap.html">226 nips-2011-Projection onto A Nonnegative Max-Heap</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Liu, Liang Sun, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean projection of a vector of length p onto a non-negative max-heap—an ordered tree where the values of the nodes are all nonnegative and the value of any parent node is no less than the value(s) of its child node(s). This Euclidean projection plays a building block role in the optimization problem with a non-negative maxheap constraint. Such a constraint is desirable when the features follow an ordered tree structure, that is, a given feature is selected for the given regression/classiﬁcation task only if its parent node is selected. In this paper, we show that such Euclidean projection problem admits an analytical solution and we develop a top-down algorithm where the key operation is to ﬁnd the so-called maximal root-tree of the subtree rooted at each node. A naive approach for ﬁnding the maximal root-tree is to enumerate all the possible root-trees, which, however, does not scale well. We reveal several important properties of the maximal root-tree, based on which we design a bottom-up algorithm with merge for eﬃciently ﬁnding the maximal roottree. The proposed algorithm has a (worst-case) linear time complexity for a sequential list, and O(p2 ) for a general tree. We report simulation results showing the eﬀectiveness of the max-heap for regression with an ordered tree structure. Empirical results show that the proposed algorithm has an expected linear time complexity for many special cases including a sequential list, a full binary tree, and a tree with depth 1. 1</p><p>4 0.62130135 <a title="228-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Inferring_spike-timing-dependent_plasticity_from_spike_train_data.html">133 nips-2011-Inferring spike-timing-dependent plasticity from spike train data</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad Koerding, Ian Stevenson</p><p>Abstract: Synaptic plasticity underlies learning and is thus central for development, memory, and recovery from injury. However, it is often difﬁcult to detect changes in synaptic strength in vivo, since intracellular recordings are experimentally challenging. Here we present two methods aimed at inferring changes in the coupling between pairs of neurons from extracellularly recorded spike trains. First, using a generalized bilinear model with Poisson output we estimate time-varying coupling assuming that all changes are spike-timing-dependent. This approach allows model-based estimation of STDP modiﬁcation functions from pairs of spike trains. Then, using recursive point-process adaptive ﬁltering methods we estimate more general variation in coupling strength over time. Using simulations of neurons undergoing spike-timing dependent modiﬁcation, we show that the true modiﬁcation function can be recovered. Using multi-electrode data from motor cortex we then illustrate the use of this technique on in vivo data. 1</p><p>5 0.61028957 <a title="228-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-MAP_Inference_for_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.html">163 nips-2011-MAP Inference for Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: The difﬁculty in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) arises in choosing the best reward function since there are typically an inﬁnite number of reward functions that yield the given behaviour data as optimal. Using a Bayesian framework, we address this challenge by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the reward function, and show that most of the previous IRL algorithms can be modeled into our framework. We also present a gradient method for the MAP estimation based on the (sub)differentiability of the posterior distribution. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the proposed method to those of the previous algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.53421158 <a title="228-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Nonstandard_Interpretations_of_Probabilistic_Programs_for_Efficient_Inference.html">192 nips-2011-Nonstandard Interpretations of Probabilistic Programs for Efficient Inference</a></p>

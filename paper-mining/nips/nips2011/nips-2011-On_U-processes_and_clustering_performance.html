<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>3 0.22349946 <a title="198-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Co-regularized_Multi-view_Spectral_Clustering.html">54 nips-2011-Co-regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhishek Kumar, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: In many clustering problems, we have access to multiple views of the data each of which could be individually used for clustering. Exploiting information from multiple views, one can hope to ﬁnd a clustering that is more accurate than the ones obtained using the individual views. Often these different views admit same underlying clustering of the data, so we can approach this problem by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a spectral clustering framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering hypotheses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on two synthetic and three real-world datasets establish the efﬁcacy of our proposed approaches.</p><p>4 0.1667334 <a title="198-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>5 0.1193404 <a title="198-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Bayesian_Partitioning_of_Large-Scale_Distance_Data.html">43 nips-2011-Bayesian Partitioning of Large-Scale Distance Data</a></p>
<p>Author: David Adametz, Volker Roth</p><p>Abstract: A Bayesian approach to partitioning distance matrices is presented. It is inspired by the Translation-invariant Wishart-Dirichlet process (TIWD) in [1] and shares a number of advantageous properties like the fully probabilistic nature of the inference model, automatic selection of the number of clusters and applicability in semi-supervised settings. In addition, our method (which we call fastTIWD) overcomes the main shortcoming of the original TIWD, namely its high computational costs. The fastTIWD reduces the workload in each iteration of a Gibbs sampler from O(n3 ) in the TIWD to O(n2 ). Our experiments show that the cost reduction does not compromise the quality of the inferred partitions. With this new method it is now possible to ‘mine’ large relational datasets with a probabilistic model, thereby automatically detecting new and potentially interesting clusters. 1</p><p>6 0.11153405 <a title="198-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-A_blind_sparse_deconvolution_method_for_neural_spike_identification.html">13 nips-2011-A blind sparse deconvolution method for neural spike identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Jasmina Bogojeska</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an approach that predicts the effectiveness of HIV combination therapies by simultaneously addressing several problems affecting the available HIV clinical data sets: the different treatment backgrounds of the samples, the uneven representation of the levels of therapy experience, the missing treatment history information, the uneven therapy representation and the unbalanced therapy outcome representation. The computational validation on clinical data shows that, compared to the most commonly used approach that does not account for the issues mentioned above, our model has signiﬁcantly higher predictive power. This is especially true for samples stemming from patients with longer treatment history and samples associated with rare therapies. Furthermore, our approach is at least as powerful for the remaining samples. 1</p><p>6 0.6503185 <a title="198-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Bayesian_Partitioning_of_Large-Scale_Distance_Data.html">43 nips-2011-Bayesian Partitioning of Large-Scale Distance Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Hema S. Koppula, Abhishek Anand, Thorsten Joachims, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data have become widely available. In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an ofﬁce and address the task of semantic labeling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the model’s parsimony becomes important and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efﬁcient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and ofﬁces (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for ofﬁces, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of ﬁnding objects in large cluttered rooms.1 1</p><p>2 0.8514232 <a title="198-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Higher-Order_Graph_Structure_with_Features_by_Structure_Penalty.html">146 nips-2011-Learning Higher-Order Graph Structure with Features by Structure Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Shilin Ding, Grace Wahba, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In discrete undirected graphical models, the conditional independence of node labels Y is speciﬁed by the graph structure. We study the case where there is another input random vector X (e.g. observed features) such that the distribution P (Y | X) is determined by functions of X that characterize the (higher-order) interactions among the Y ’s. The main contribution of this paper is to learn the graph structure and the functions conditioned on X at the same time. We prove that discrete undirected graphical models with feature X are equivalent to multivariate discrete models. The reparameterization of the potential functions in graphical models by conditional log odds ratios of the latter offers advantages in representation of the conditional independence structure. The functional spaces can be ﬂexibly determined by kernels. Additionally, we impose a Structure Lasso (SLasso) penalty on groups of functions to learn the graph structure. These groups with overlaps are designed to enforce hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. 1</p><p>3 0.83861655 <a title="198-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Tree_of_Metrics_with_Disjoint_Visual_Features.html">151 nips-2011-Learning a Tree of Metrics with Disjoint Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha, Sung J. Hwang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to learn discriminative visual representations while exploiting external semantic knowledge about object category relationships. Given a hierarchical taxonomy that captures semantic similarity between the objects, we learn a corresponding tree of metrics (ToM). In this tree, we have one metric for each non-leaf node of the object hierarchy, and each metric is responsible for discriminating among its immediate subcategory children. Speciﬁcally, a Mahalanobis metric learned for a given node must satisfy the appropriate (dis)similarity constraints generated only among its subtree members’ training instances. To further exploit the semantics, we introduce a novel regularizer coupling the metrics that prefers a sparse disjoint set of features to be selected for each metric relative to its ancestor (supercategory) nodes’ metrics. Intuitively, this reﬂects that visual cues most useful to distinguish the generic classes (e.g., feline vs. canine) should be different than those cues most useful to distinguish their component ﬁne-grained classes (e.g., Persian cat vs. Siamese cat). We validate our approach with multiple image datasets using the WordNet taxonomy, show its advantages over alternative metric learning approaches, and analyze the meaning of attribute features selected by our algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.82230508 <a title="198-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Probabilistic_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Labeling.html">223 nips-2011-Probabilistic Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling</a></p>

The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as ﬁrst sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect conﬁgurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.79951262 <a title="198-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>6 0.7177549 <a title="198-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>

<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Viviana Petrescu, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a computationally efﬁcient technique to compute the distance of highdimensional appearance descriptor vectors between image windows. The method exploits the relation between appearance distance and spatial overlap. We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efﬁciently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as ﬁnding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or ﬁnding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18] and on hashing [21]. For example, our algorithm ﬁnds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average. 1</p><p>3 0.17831044 <a title="165-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Sparse_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Application_to_Text_Data.html">142 nips-2011-Large-Scale Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Text Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Youwei Zhang, Laurent E. Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA provides a linear combination of small number of features that maximizes variance across data. Although Sparse PCA has apparent advantages compared to PCA, such as better interpretability, it is generally thought to be computationally much more expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising fact that sparse PCA can be easier than PCA in practice, and that it can be reliably applied to very large data sets. This comes from a rigorous feature elimination pre-processing result, coupled with the favorable fact that features in real-life data typically have exponentially decreasing variances, which allows for many features to be eliminated. We introduce a fast block coordinate ascent algorithm with much better computational complexity than the existing ﬁrst-order ones. We provide experimental results obtained on text corpora involving millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. These results illustrate how Sparse PCA can help organize a large corpus of text data in a user-interpretable way, providing an attractive alternative approach to topic models. 1</p><p>4 0.17675173 <a title="165-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Semantic_Labeling_of_3D_Point_Clouds_for_Indoor_Scenes.html">247 nips-2011-Semantic Labeling of 3D Point Clouds for Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Hema S. Koppula, Abhishek Anand, Thorsten Joachims, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data have become widely available. In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an ofﬁce and address the task of semantic labeling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the model’s parsimony becomes important and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efﬁcient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and ofﬁces (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for ofﬁces, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of ﬁnding objects in large cluttered rooms.1 1</p><p>5 0.16739337 <a title="165-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_with_the_weighted_trace-norm_under_arbitrary_sampling_distributions.html">159 nips-2011-Learning with the weighted trace-norm under arbitrary sampling distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Rina Foygel, Ohad Shamir, Nati Srebro, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We provide rigorous guarantees on learning with the weighted trace-norm under arbitrary sampling distributions. We show that the standard weighted-trace norm might fail when the sampling distribution is not a product distribution (i.e. when row and column indexes are not selected independently), present a corrected variant for which we establish strong learning guarantees, and demonstrate that it works better in practice. We provide guarantees when weighting by either the true or empirical sampling distribution, and suggest that even if the true distribution is known (or is uniform), weighting by the empirical distribution may be beneﬁcial. 1</p><p>6 0.13833994 <a title="165-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Tests_for_Optimization_Efficiency.html">271 nips-2011-Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency</a></p>

<p>Author: Yong Zhang, Zhaosong Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider general rank minimization problems with rank appearing in either objective function or constraint. We ﬁrst show that a class of matrix optimization problems can be solved as lower dimensional vector optimization problems. As a consequence, we establish that a class of rank minimization problems have closed form solutions. Using this result, we then propose penalty decomposition methods for general rank minimization problems. The convergence results of the PD methods have been shown in the longer version of the paper [19]. Finally, we test the performance of our methods by applying them to matrix completion and nearest low-rank correlation matrix problems. The computational results demonstrate that our methods generally outperform the existing methods in terms of solution quality and/or speed. 1</p><p>4 0.64983016 <a title="165-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Portmanteau_Vocabularies_for_Multi-Cue_Image_Representation.html">216 nips-2011-Portmanteau Vocabularies for Multi-Cue Image Representation</a></p>
<p>Author: Fahad S. Khan, Joost Weijer, Andrew D. Bagdanov, Maria Vanrell</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel technique for feature combination in the bag-of-words model of image classiﬁcation. Our approach builds discriminative compound words from primitive cues learned independently from training images. Our main observation is that modeling joint-cue distributions independently is more statistically robust for typical classiﬁcation problems than attempting to empirically estimate the dependent, joint-cue distribution directly. We use Information theoretic vocabulary compression to ﬁnd discriminative combinations of cues and the resulting vocabulary of portmanteau1 words is compact, has the cue binding property, and supports individual weighting of cues in the ﬁnal image representation. State-of-theart results on both the Oxford Flower-102 and Caltech-UCSD Bird-200 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique compared to other, signiﬁcantly more complex approaches to multi-cue image representation. 1</p><p>5 0.61351669 <a title="165-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Sparse_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Application_to_Text_Data.html">142 nips-2011-Large-Scale Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Text Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Edouard Grave, Guillaume R. Obozinski, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Using the 1 -norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected covariates, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net. 1</p><p>3 0.82035851 <a title="165-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Recovery_with_Brownian_Sensing.html">264 nips-2011-Sparse Recovery with Brownian Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the parameter α ∈ RK of a sparse function f (i.e. the number of non-zero entries of α is small compared to the number K of features) given noisy evaluations of f at a set of well-chosen sampling points. We introduce an additional randomization process, called Brownian sensing, based on the computation of stochastic integrals, which produces a Gaussian sensing matrix, for which good recovery properties are proven, independently on the number of sampling points N , even when the features are arbitrarily non-orthogonal. Under the assumption that f is H¨ lder continuous with exponent at least √ we proo 1/2, vide an estimate α of the parameter such that �α − α�2 = O(�η�2 / N ), where � � η is the observation noise. The method uses a set of sampling points uniformly distributed along a one-dimensional curve selected according to the features. We report numerical experiments illustrating our method. 1</p><p>4 0.8140555 <a title="165-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Convergence_Rates_of_Inexact_Proximal-Gradient_Methods_for_Convex_Optimization.html">63 nips-2011-Convergence Rates of Inexact Proximal-Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Schmidt, Nicolas L. Roux, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a non-smooth convex function using proximal-gradient methods, where an error is present in the calculation of the gradient of the smooth term or in the proximity operator with respect to the non-smooth term. We show that both the basic proximal-gradient method and the accelerated proximal-gradient method achieve the same convergence rate as in the error-free case, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates. Using these rates, we perform as well as or better than a carefully chosen ﬁxed error level on a set of structured sparsity problems. 1</p><p>5 0.81300312 <a title="165-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-The_Manifold_Tangent_Classifier.html">287 nips-2011-The Manifold Tangent Classifier</a></p>
<p>Author: Salah Rifai, Yann N. Dauphin, Pascal Vincent, Yoshua Bengio, Xavier Muller</p><p>Abstract: We combine three important ideas present in previous work for building classiﬁers: the semi-supervised hypothesis (the input distribution contains information about the classiﬁer), the unsupervised manifold hypothesis (data density concentrates near low-dimensional manifolds), and the manifold hypothesis for classiﬁcation (different classes correspond to disjoint manifolds separated by low density). We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classiﬁer to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classiﬁcation results are obtained. 1</p><p>6 0.8128283 <a title="165-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-ICA_with_Reconstruction_Cost_for_Efficient_Overcomplete_Feature_Learning.html">124 nips-2011-ICA with Reconstruction Cost for Efficient Overcomplete Feature Learning</a></p>

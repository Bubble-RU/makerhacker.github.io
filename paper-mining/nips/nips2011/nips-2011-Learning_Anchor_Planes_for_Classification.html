<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Extracting good representations from images is essential for many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP), which builds a feature hierarchy layer-by-layer using an efﬁcient matching pursuit encoder. It includes three modules: batch (tree) orthogonal matching pursuit, spatial pyramid max pooling, and contrast normalization. We investigate the architecture of HMP, and show that all three components are critical for good performance. To speed up the orthogonal matching pursuit, we propose a batch tree orthogonal matching pursuit that is particularly suitable to encode a large number of observations that share the same large dictionary. HMP is scalable and can efﬁciently handle full-size images. In addition, HMP enables linear support vector machines (SVM) to match the performance of nonlinear SVM while being scalable to large datasets. We compare HMP with many state-of-the-art algorithms including convolutional deep belief networks, SIFT based single layer sparse coding, and kernel based feature learning. HMP consistently yields superior accuracy on three types of image classiﬁcation problems: object recognition (Caltech-101), scene recognition (MIT-Scene), and static event recognition (UIUC-Sports). 1</p><p>3 0.067257069 <a title="143-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Nearest_Neighbor_based_Greedy_Coordinate_Descent.html">182 nips-2011-Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Inderjit S. Dhillon, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Increasingly, optimization problems in machine learning, especially those arising from bigh-dimensional statistical estimation, bave a large number of variables. Modem statistical estimators developed over the past decade have statistical or sample complexity that depends only weakly on the number of parameters when there is some structore to the problem, such as sparsity. A central question is whether similar advances can be made in their computational complexity as well. In this paper, we propose strategies that indicate that such advances can indeed be made. In particular, we investigate the greedy coordinate descent algorithm, and note that performing the greedy step efficiently weakens the costly dependence on the problem size provided the solution is sparse. We then propose a snite of methods that perform these greedy steps efficiently by a reduction to nearest neighbor search. We also devise a more amenable form of greedy descent for composite non-smooth objectives; as well as several approximate variants of such greedy descent. We develop a practical implementation of our algorithm that combines greedy coordinate descent with locality sensitive hashing. Without tuning the latter data structore, we are not only able to significantly speed up the vanilla greedy method, hot also outperform cyclic descent when the problem size becomes large. Our resnlts indicate the effectiveness of our nearest neighbor strategies, and also point to many open questions regarding the development of computational geometric techniques tailored towards first-order optimization methods.</p><p>4 0.065094486 <a title="143-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur D. Szlam, Karol Gregor, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: This work describes a conceptually simple method for structured sparse coding and dictionary design. Supposing a dictionary with K atoms, we introduce a structure as a set of penalties or interactions between every pair of atoms. We describe modiﬁcations of standard sparse coding algorithms for inference in this setting, and describe experiments showing that these algorithms are efﬁcient. We show that interesting dictionaries can be learned for interactions that encode tree structures or locally connected structures. Finally, we show that our framework allows us to learn the values of the interactions from the data, rather than having them pre-speciﬁed. 1</p><p>5 0.062488865 <a title="143-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Filtering.html">261 nips-2011-Sparse Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiquan Ngiam, Zhenghao Chen, Sonia A. Bhaskar, Pang W. Koh, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Unsupervised feature learning has been shown to be effective at learning representations that perform well on image, video and audio classiﬁcation. However, many existing feature learning algorithms are hard to use and require extensive hyperparameter tuning. In this work, we present sparse ﬁltering, a simple new algorithm which is efﬁcient and only has one hyperparameter, the number of features to learn. In contrast to most other feature learning methods, sparse ﬁltering does not explicitly attempt to construct a model of the data distribution. Instead, it optimizes a simple cost function – the sparsity of 2 -normalized features – which can easily be implemented in a few lines of MATLAB code. Sparse ﬁltering scales gracefully to handle high-dimensional inputs, and can also be used to learn meaningful features in additional layers with greedy layer-wise stacking. We evaluate sparse ﬁltering on natural images, object classiﬁcation (STL-10), and phone classiﬁcation (TIMIT), and show that our method works well on a range of different modalities. 1</p><p>6 0.059551094 <a title="143-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Nobuyuki Morioka, Shin'ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding, a method of explaining sensory data with as few dictionary bases as possible, has attracted much attention in computer vision. For visual object category recognition, 1 regularized sparse coding is combined with the spatial pyramid representation to obtain state-of-the-art performance. However, because of its iterative optimization, applying sparse coding onto every local feature descriptor extracted from an image database can become a major bottleneck. To overcome this computational challenge, this paper presents “Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse coding” (GLAS). By representing the distribution of sparse coefﬁcients with slice transform, we ﬁt a piece-wise linear mapping function with the generalized lasso. We also propose an efﬁcient post-reﬁnement procedure to perform mutual inhibition between bases which is essential for an overcomplete setting. The experiments show that GLAS obtains a comparable performance to 1 regularized sparse coding, yet achieves a signiﬁcant speed up demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale visual recognition problems. 1</p><p>3 0.56450999 <a title="143-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchical_Matching_Pursuit_for_Image_Classification%3A_Architecture_and_Fast_Algorithms.html">113 nips-2011-Hierarchical Matching Pursuit for Image Classification: Architecture and Fast Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Salah Rifai, Yann N. Dauphin, Pascal Vincent, Yoshua Bengio, Xavier Muller</p><p>Abstract: We combine three important ideas present in previous work for building classiﬁers: the semi-supervised hypothesis (the input distribution contains information about the classiﬁer), the unsupervised manifold hypothesis (data density concentrates near low-dimensional manifolds), and the manifold hypothesis for classiﬁcation (different classes correspond to disjoint manifolds separated by low density). We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classiﬁer to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classiﬁcation results are obtained. 1</p><p>5 0.550421 <a title="143-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>

<p>Author: Angela Yao, Juergen Gall, Luc V. Gool, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: A common approach for handling the complexity and inherent ambiguities of 3D human pose estimation is to use pose priors learned from training data. Existing approaches however, are either too simplistic (linear), too complex to learn, or can only learn latent spaces from “simple data”, i.e., single activities such as walking or running. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is able to learn probabilistic non-linear latent spaces composed of multiple activities. Furthermore, we derive an incremental algorithm for the online setting which can update the latent space without extensive relearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of monocular and multi-view tracking and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>3 0.70207852 <a title="143-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Performance_of_Convex_Tensor_Decomposition.html">270 nips-2011-Statistical Performance of Convex Tensor Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Kohei Hayashi, Hisashi Kashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their performance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of the convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank of the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex low-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical experiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice.</p><p>4 0.70097744 <a title="143-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Trace_Lasso%3A_a_trace_norm_regularization_for_correlated_designs.html">289 nips-2011-Trace Lasso: a trace norm regularization for correlated designs</a></p>
<p>Author: Edouard Grave, Guillaume R. Obozinski, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Using the 1 -norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected covariates, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net. 1</p><p>5 0.69580209 <a title="143-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-The_Manifold_Tangent_Classifier.html">287 nips-2011-The Manifold Tangent Classifier</a></p>
<p>Author: Salah Rifai, Yann N. Dauphin, Pascal Vincent, Yoshua Bengio, Xavier Muller</p><p>Abstract: We combine three important ideas present in previous work for building classiﬁers: the semi-supervised hypothesis (the input distribution contains information about the classiﬁer), the unsupervised manifold hypothesis (data density concentrates near low-dimensional manifolds), and the manifold hypothesis for classiﬁcation (different classes correspond to disjoint manifolds separated by low density). We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classiﬁer to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classiﬁcation results are obtained. 1</p><p>6 0.69152176 <a title="143-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Inference_in_continuous-time_change-point_models.html">131 nips-2011-Inference in continuous-time change-point models</a></p>

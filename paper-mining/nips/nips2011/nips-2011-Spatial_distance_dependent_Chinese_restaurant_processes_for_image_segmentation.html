<p>Author: Sungwoong Kim, Sebastian Nowozin, Pushmeet Kohli, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For many of the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, image segmentation is an important preprocessing step. As such, several image segmentation algorithms have been proposed, however, with certain reservation due to high computational load and many hand-tuning parameters. Correlation clustering, a graphpartitioning algorithm often used in natural language processing and document clustering, has the potential to perform better than previously proposed image segmentation algorithms. We improve the basic correlation clustering formulation by taking into account higher-order cluster relationships. This improves clustering in the presence of local boundary ambiguities. We ﬁrst apply the pairwise correlation clustering to image segmentation over a pairwise superpixel graph and then develop higher-order correlation clustering over a hypergraph that considers higher-order relations among superpixels. Fast inference is possible by linear programming relaxation, and also effective parameter learning framework by structured support vector machine is possible. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed higher-order correlation clustering outperforms other state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms.</p><p>3 0.21424624 <a title="266-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Probabilistic_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Labeling.html">223 nips-2011-Probabilistic Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Ion, Joao Carreira, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint image segmentation and labeling model (JSL) which, given a bag of ﬁgure-ground segment hypotheses extracted at multiple image locations and scales, constructs a joint probability distribution over both the compatible image interpretations (tilings or image segmentations) composed from those segments, and over their labeling into categories. The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as ﬁrst sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect conﬁgurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.</p><p>4 0.20382756 <a title="266-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Modelling_Genetic_Variations_using_Fragmentation-Coagulation_Processes.html">173 nips-2011-Modelling Genetic Variations using Fragmentation-Coagulation Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Charles Blundell, Lloyd Elliott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel class of Bayesian nonparametric models for sequential data called fragmentation-coagulation processes (FCPs). FCPs model a set of sequences using a partition-valued Markov process which evolves by splitting and merging clusters. An FCP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible, and its equilibrium distributions are given by the Chinese restaurant process. As opposed to hidden Markov models, FCPs allow for ﬂexible modelling of the number of clusters, and they avoid label switching non-identiﬁability problems. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for FCPs which uses uniformization and the forward-backward algorithm. Our development of FCPs is motivated by applications in population genetics, and we demonstrate the utility of FCPs on problems of genotype imputation with phased and unphased SNP data. 1</p><p>5 0.1943896 <a title="266-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image segmentation since for binary random ﬁeld representations of the image, it gives globally optimal results and there are efﬁcient polynomial time implementations. Often, the random ﬁeld is applied over a ﬂat partitioning of the image into non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show that if, instead of a ﬂat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding beneﬁts of global optimality and efﬁciency). As a result of such inference, the image gets partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the tree. We apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference on a segmentation tree (over a ﬂat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization in the pylon model is able to ﬂexibly choose the level of segmentation across the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.14412272 <a title="266-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Semantic_Labeling_of_3D_Point_Clouds_for_Indoor_Scenes.html">247 nips-2011-Semantic Labeling of 3D Point Clouds for Indoor Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Viren Jain, Srinivas C. Turaga, K Briggman, Moritz N. Helmstaedter, Winfried Denk, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: An agglomerative clustering algorithm merges the most similar pair of clusters at every iteration. The function that evaluates similarity is traditionally handdesigned, but there has been recent interest in supervised or semisupervised settings in which ground-truth clustered data is available for training. Here we show how to train a similarity function by regarding it as the action-value function of a reinforcement learning problem. We apply this general method to segment images by clustering superpixels, an application that we call Learning to Agglomerate Superpixel Hierarchies (LASH). When applied to a challenging dataset of brain images from serial electron microscopy, LASH dramatically improved segmentation accuracy when clustering supervoxels generated by state of the boundary detection algorithms. The naive strategy of directly training only supervoxel similarities and applying single linkage clustering produced less improvement. 1</p><p>6 0.64485908 <a title="266-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Inference_in_Fully_Connected_CRFs_with_Gaussian_Edge_Potentials.html">76 nips-2011-Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials</a></p>

<p>Author: Miguel Lázaro-gredilla, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a variational Bayesian inference algorithm which can be widely applied to sparse linear models. The algorithm is based on the spike and slab prior which, from a Bayesian perspective, is the golden standard for sparse inference. We apply the method to a general multi-task and multiple kernel learning model in which a common set of Gaussian process functions is linearly combined with task-speciﬁc sparse weights, thus inducing relation between tasks. This model uniﬁes several sparse linear models, such as generalized linear models, sparse factor analysis and matrix factorization with missing values, so that the variational algorithm can be applied to all these cases. We demonstrate our approach in multioutput Gaussian process regression, multi-class classiﬁcation, image processing applications and collaborative ﬁltering. 1</p><p>3 0.83383185 <a title="266-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-How_biased_are_maximum_entropy_models%3F.html">123 nips-2011-How biased are maximum entropy models?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob H. Macke, Iain Murray, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy models have become popular statistical models in neuroscience and other areas in biology, and can be useful tools for obtaining estimates of mutual information in biological systems. However, maximum entropy models ﬁt to small data sets can be subject to sampling bias; i.e. the true entropy of the data can be severely underestimated. Here we study the sampling properties of estimates of the entropy obtained from maximum entropy models. We show that if the data is generated by a distribution that lies in the model class, the bias is equal to the number of parameters divided by twice the number of observations. However, in practice, the true distribution is usually outside the model class, and we show here that this misspeciﬁcation can lead to much larger bias. We provide a perturbative approximation of the maximally expected bias when the true model is out of model class, and we illustrate our results using numerical simulations of an Ising model; i.e. the second-order maximum entropy distribution on binary data. 1</p><p>4 0.82981515 <a title="266-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Modelling_Genetic_Variations_using_Fragmentation-Coagulation_Processes.html">173 nips-2011-Modelling Genetic Variations using Fragmentation-Coagulation Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Charles Blundell, Lloyd Elliott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel class of Bayesian nonparametric models for sequential data called fragmentation-coagulation processes (FCPs). FCPs model a set of sequences using a partition-valued Markov process which evolves by splitting and merging clusters. An FCP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible, and its equilibrium distributions are given by the Chinese restaurant process. As opposed to hidden Markov models, FCPs allow for ﬂexible modelling of the number of clusters, and they avoid label switching non-identiﬁability problems. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for FCPs which uses uniformization and the forward-backward algorithm. Our development of FCPs is motivated by applications in population genetics, and we demonstrate the utility of FCPs on problems of genotype imputation with phased and unphased SNP data. 1</p><p>5 0.82502192 <a title="266-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Active_dendrites%3A_adaptation_to_spike-based_communication.html">23 nips-2011-Active dendrites: adaptation to spike-based communication</a></p>
<p>Author: Balazs B. Ujfalussy, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Computational analyses of dendritic computations often assume stationary inputs to neurons, ignoring the pulsatile nature of spike-based communication between neurons and the moment-to-moment ﬂuctuations caused by such spiking inputs. Conversely, circuit computations with spiking neurons are usually formalized without regard to the rich nonlinear nature of dendritic processing. Here we address the computational challenge faced by neurons that compute and represent analogue quantities but communicate with digital spikes, and show that reliable computation of even purely linear functions of inputs can require the interplay of strongly nonlinear subunits within the postsynaptic dendritic tree. Our theory predicts a matching of dendritic nonlinearities and synaptic weight distributions to the joint statistics of presynaptic inputs. This approach suggests normative roles for some puzzling forms of nonlinear dendritic dynamics and plasticity. 1</p><p>6 0.81225348 <a title="266-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Higher-Order_Correlation_Clustering_for_Image_Segmentation.html">119 nips-2011-Higher-Order Correlation Clustering for Image Segmentation</a></p>

</p><p>10 1  Introduction  In Machine Learning, model quality is most often limited by the lack of sufﬁcient training data. [sent-28, score-0.043]
</p><p>11 When data from different, but related tasks, is available, it is possible to exploit it to boost the performance of each task by transferring relevant information. [sent-29, score-0.176]
</p><p>12 Multitask learning (MTL) considers the problem of inferring models for several tasks simultaneously, while imposing regularity criteria or shared representations in order to allow learning across tasks. [sent-30, score-0.197]
</p><p>13 , [5, 8]) have been explored, providing empirical ﬁndings [16] and theoretical foundations [3, 4]. [sent-33, score-0.035]
</p><p>14 Recently, also the relationships between tasks have been studied (e. [sent-34, score-0.164]
</p><p>15 , [1]) assuming a cluster relationship [11] or a hierarchy [6, 23, 13] between tasks. [sent-36, score-0.049]
</p><p>16 Our proposed method follows this line of research in that it exploits externally provided hierarchical task relations. [sent-37, score-0.232]
</p><p>17 The generality of regularization-based MTL approaches makes it possible to extend them beyond the simple cases of classiﬁcation or regression to Structured Output (SO) learning problems 1 2  These authors contributed equally. [sent-38, score-0.07]
</p><p>18 Here, the output is not in the form of a discrete class label or a real valued number, but a structured entity such as a label sequence, a tree, or a graph. [sent-40, score-0.476]
</p><p>19 One of the main contributions of this paper is to explicitly extend a regularization-based MTL formulation to the SVM-struct formulation for SO prediction [2, 21]. [sent-41, score-0.121]
</p><p>20 SO learning methods can be computationally demanding, and combining information from several tasks leads to even larger problems, which renders many interesting applications infeasible. [sent-42, score-0.198]
</p><p>21 Hence, our second main contribution is to provide an efﬁcient solver for SO problems which is based on bundle methods [18, 19, 7]. [sent-43, score-0.262]
</p><p>22 It achieves much faster convergence and is therefore an essential tool to cope with the demands of the MTL setting. [sent-44, score-0.039]
</p><p>23 The latter is of particular interest in computational biology for the analysis of DNA, RNA or protein sequences. [sent-46, score-0.127]
</p><p>24 In computational biology, one often uses supervised learning methods to model biological processes in order to predict their outcomes and ultimately understand them better. [sent-48, score-0.15]
</p><p>25 Due to the complexity of many biological mechanisms, rich computational models have to be developed, which in turn require a reasonable amount of training data. [sent-49, score-0.117]
</p><p>26 However, especially in the biomedical domain, obtaining labeled training examples through experiments can be costly. [sent-50, score-0.043]
</p><p>27 Thus, combining information from several related tasks can be a cost-effective approach to best exploit the available label data. [sent-51, score-0.277]
</p><p>28 When transferring label information across tasks, it often makes sense to assume hierarchical task relations. [sent-52, score-0.337]
</p><p>29 In particular, in computational biology, where evolutionary processes often impose a task hierarchy [22]. [sent-53, score-0.21]
</p><p>30 For instance, we might be interested in modeling a common biological mechanism in several organisms such that each task corresponds to one organism. [sent-54, score-0.281]
</p><p>31 In this setting, we expect that the longer the common evolutionary history between two organisms, the more beneﬁcial it is to share information between the corresponding tasks. [sent-55, score-0.065]
</p><p>32 In this work, we chose a challenging problem from genome biology to demonstrate that our approach is practically feasible in terms of speed and accuracy. [sent-56, score-0.17]
</p><p>33 In ab initio gene ﬁnding [17], the task is to build an accurate model of a gene and subsequently use it to predict the gene content of newly sequenced genomes or to reﬁne existing annotations. [sent-57, score-0.604]
</p><p>34 Despite many commonalities between sequence features of genes across organisms, sequence differences have made it very difﬁcult to build universal gene ﬁnders that achieve high accuracy in cross-organism prediction. [sent-58, score-0.206]
</p><p>35 In its most general form, such a method consists of a loss function L that captures the error with respect to the training data S = {(x1 , y1 ), . [sent-61, score-0.125]
</p><p>36 , (xn , yn )} and a regularizer R that penalizes model complexity n  J(w) =  L(w, xi , yi ) + R(w). [sent-64, score-0.245]
</p><p>37 To couple individual tasks, an additional regularization term RM T L is introduced that penalizes the disagreement between the individual models (e. [sent-75, score-0.102]
</p><p>38 , wT ) =  L(w, xi , yi ) + R(wt )  + RM T L (w1 , . [sent-80, score-0.083]
</p><p>39 , [8, 16]), where γ is a hyper-parameter controlling the strength of coupling of the solutions for both tasks. [sent-86, score-0.114]
</p><p>40 For more than two tasks, the number of coupling terms and hyper-parameters can rise quadratically leading to a difﬁcult model-selection problem. [sent-87, score-0.111]
</p><p>41 1 Hierarchical Multitask Learning (HMTL) We consider the case where tasks correspond to leaves of a tree and are related by its inner nodes. [sent-89, score-0.164]
</p><p>42 In [22], the case of taxonomically organized two-class classiﬁcation tasks was investigated, where each task corresponds to a species (taxon). [sent-90, score-0.335]
</p><p>43 The idea was to mimic biological evolution that is assumed to 2  generate more specialized molecular processes with each speciation event from root to leaf. [sent-91, score-0.262]
</p><p>44 This is implemented by training on examples available for nodes in the current subtree (i. [sent-92, score-0.043]
</p><p>45 , the tasks below the current node), while similarity to the parent classiﬁer is induced through regularization. [sent-94, score-0.261]
</p><p>46 , the strength of coupling between the node and its parent). [sent-101, score-0.231]
</p><p>47 The above problem can be equivalently rewritten as:   1  2 (w∗ , b∗ ) = argmin ||w|| − γ w, w∗ + C ( x, w + b, y) . [sent-102, score-0.064]
</p><p>48 (2) n n p 2  w,b (x,y)∈S  For γ = 0, the tasks completely decouple and can be learnt independently. [sent-103, score-0.203]
</p><p>49 The parameters for the root node correspond to the globally best model. [sent-104, score-0.166]
</p><p>50 2 Structured Output Learning and Extensions for HMTL In contrast to binary classiﬁcation, elements from the output space Υ (e. [sent-107, score-0.129]
</p><p>51 , sequences, trees, or graphs) of structured output problems have an inherent structure which makes more sophisticated, problem-speciﬁc loss functions desirable. [sent-109, score-0.381]
</p><p>52 The loss between the true label y ∈ Υ and the predicted ˆ label y ∈ Υ is measured by a loss function ∆ : Υ × Υ → + . [sent-110, score-0.308]
</p><p>53 A widely used approach to predict ˆ y ∈ Υ is the use of a linearly parametrized model given an input vector x ∈ X and a joint feature map Ψ : X × Υ → H that captures the dependencies between input and output (e. [sent-111, score-0.165]
</p><p>54 ¯ y ∈Υ  The most common approaches to estimate the model parameters w are based on structured output SVMs (e. [sent-114, score-0.299]
</p><p>55 Here we follow the approach taken in [21, 15], where estimating the parameter vector w amounts to solving the following optimization problem n  min  w∈H  ¯ ¯ (max w, Ψ(xi , y ) + ∆(y i , y ) − w, Ψ(xi , y i ) ) ,  R(w) + C i=1  ¯ y ∈Υ  (3)  where R(w) is a regularizer and is a loss function. [sent-119, score-0.275]
</p><p>56 For (a) = max(0, a) and R(w) = w 2 we 2 obtain the structured output support vector machine [21, 2] with margin rescaling and hinge-loss. [sent-120, score-0.299]
</p><p>57 It turns out that we can combine the structured output formulation with hierarchical multitask learning in a straight-forward way. [sent-121, score-0.779]
</p><p>58 We extend the regularizer R(w) in (3) with a γ-parametrized convex 2 1 combination of a multitask regularizer 2 ||w − wp ||2 with the original term. [sent-122, score-0.651]
</p><p>59 When R(w) = 1 w 2 2 2 1 and omitting constant terms, we arrive at Rp,γ (w) = 2 w 2 − γ w, wp . [sent-123, score-0.157]
</p><p>60 Here one considers growing subsets of all possible structures and solves restricted optimization problems. [sent-127, score-0.191]
</p><p>61 An algorithm implementing a variant of this strategy based on primal optimization is given in the appendix (similar in [21]). [sent-128, score-0.142]
</p><p>62 Moreover, the size of the restricted optimization problems grows steadily and solving them becomes more expensive in each iteration. [sent-130, score-0.057]
</p><p>63 Our approach is instead based on bundle methods for regularized risk minimization as proposed in [18, 19] and [7]. [sent-132, score-0.272]
</p><p>64 In order to achieve fast convergence, we use a variant of these methods adapted to structured output learning that is suitable for hierarchical multitask learning. [sent-134, score-0.735]
</p><p>65 Direct optimization of J is very expensive as computing L involves computing the maximum over the output space. [sent-137, score-0.186]
</p><p>66 Hence, we propose to optimize an estimate ˆ of the empirical loss L (w), which can be computed efﬁciently. [sent-138, score-0.117]
</p><p>67 We deﬁne the estimated empirical ˆ loss L (w) as N  ˆ L(w) := C  max (Ψ,∆)∈Γi  i=1  { w, Ψ + ∆} − w, Ψ(xi , y i )  . [sent-139, score-0.2]
</p><p>68 Γi is a set of pairs (Ψ(xi , y), ∆(y i , y)) deﬁned by a suitably chosen, ˆ growing subset of Υ, such that L(w) → L(w) (cf. [sent-142, score-0.093]
</p><p>69 In general, bundle methods are extensions of cutting plane methods that use a prox-function to stabilize the solution of the approximated function. [sent-144, score-0.624]
</p><p>70 In the framework of regularized risk minimization, ˆ a natural prox-function is given by the regularizer. [sent-145, score-0.053]
</p><p>71 We apply this approach to the objective J(w) and solve min Rp,γ (w) + max{ ai , w + bi } (5) w  i∈I  ˆ where the set of cutting planes ai , bi lower bound L. [sent-146, score-0.623]
</p><p>72 Moreover, we calculate an aggregation cutting plane a, ¯ that lower bounds the ¯ b ˆ To be able to solve the primal optimization problem in (5) in the dual estimated empirical loss L. [sent-148, score-0.682]
</p><p>73 space as proposed by [7, 19], we adopt an elegant strategy described in [7] to obtain the aggregated cutting plane (¯ , ¯ ) using the dual solution α of (5): a b a = ¯  αj ai  and  ¯ = b  i∈I  α i bi . [sent-149, score-0.604]
</p><p>74 ¯ b  Rp (w) + max ai , w + bi i∈I  w∈H  This new aggregated plane can be used as an additional cutting plane in the next iteration step. [sent-151, score-0.756]
</p><p>75 We therefore have a monotonically increasing lower bound on the estimated empirical loss and can remove previously generated cutting planes without compromising convergence (see [7] for details). [sent-152, score-0.44]
</p><p>76 The algorithm is able to handle any (non-)smooth convex loss function , since only the subgradient needs to be computed. [sent-153, score-0.082]
</p><p>77 The resulting optimization algorithm is outlined in Algorithm 1. [sent-155, score-0.057]
</p><p>78 There are several improvements possible: For instance, one can bypass updating the empirical risk estimates in line 6, when ˆ L(w(k) ) − L(w(k) ) ≤ . [sent-156, score-0.134]
</p><p>79 Finally, while Algorithm 1 was formulated in primal space, it is easy to reformulate in dual variables making it independent of the dimensionality of w ∈ H. [sent-157, score-0.178]
</p><p>80 4 Taxonomically Constrained Model Selection Model selection for multitask learning is particularly difﬁcult, as it requires hyper-parameter selection for several different, but related tasks in a dependent manner. [sent-159, score-0.47]

<p>Author: Dan Zhang, Yan Liu, Luo Si, Jian Zhang, Richard D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms assume data instances and/or data bags are independently and identically distributed. But there often exists rich additional dependency/structure information between instances/bags within many applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the performance of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the research problem as multiple instance learning on structured data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that considers additional structure information. In particular, an effective and efﬁcient optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem by using a combination of ConcaveConvex Constraint Programming (CCCP) method and an adapted Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints caused by learning on instances within individual bags and learning on structured data. Our method has the nice convergence property, with speciﬁed precision on each set of constraints. Experimental results on three different applications, i.e., webpage classiﬁcation, market targeting, and protein fold identiﬁcation, clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.14482781 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Bayesian_Multi-Task_Learning.html">258 nips-2011-Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning</a></p>

The model is able to capture correlations between tasks, or more speciﬁcally a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, while being sparse in the features. We introduce a general family of group sparsity inducing priors based on matrix-variate Gaussian scale mixtures. We show the amount of sparsity can be learnt from the data by combining an approximate inference approach with type II maximum likelihood estimation of the hyperparameters. Empirical evaluations on data sets from biology and vision demonstrate the applicability of the model, where on both regression and classiﬁcation tasks it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to previously proposed methods. 1</p><p>4 0.13452199 <a title="114-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Margin_Multi-Label_Structured_Prediction.html">169 nips-2011-Maximum Margin Multi-Label Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: We study multi-label prediction for structured output sets, a problem that occurs, for example, in object detection in images, secondary structure prediction in computational biology, and graph matching with symmetries. Conventional multilabel classiﬁcation techniques are typically not applicable in this situation, because they require explicit enumeration of the label set, which is infeasible in case of structured outputs. Relying on techniques originally designed for single-label structured prediction, in particular structured support vector machines, results in reduced prediction accuracy, or leads to infeasible optimization problems. In this work we derive a maximum-margin training formulation for multi-label structured prediction that remains computationally tractable while achieving high prediction accuracy. It also shares most beneﬁcial properties with single-label maximum-margin approaches, in particular formulation as a convex optimization problem, efﬁcient working set training, and PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. 1</p><p>5 0.12506786 <a title="114-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Clustered_Multi-Task_Learning_Via_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">51 nips-2011-Clustered Multi-Task Learning Via Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiayu Zhou, Jianhui Chen, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) learns multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization performance. Alternating structure optimization (ASO) is a popular MTL method that learns a shared low-dimensional predictive structure on hypothesis spaces from multiple related tasks. It has been applied successfully in many real world applications. As an alternative MTL approach, clustered multi-task learning (CMTL) assumes that multiple tasks follow a clustered structure, i.e., tasks are partitioned into a set of groups where tasks in the same group are similar to each other, and that such a clustered structure is unknown a priori. The objectives in ASO and CMTL differ in how multiple tasks are related. Interestingly, we show in this paper the equivalence relationship between ASO and CMTL, providing signiﬁcant new insights into ASO and CMTL as well as their inherent relationship. The CMTL formulation is non-convex, and we adopt a convex relaxation to the CMTL formulation. We further establish the equivalence relationship between the proposed convex relaxation of CMTL and an existing convex relaxation of ASO, and show that the proposed convex CMTL formulation is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient especially for high-dimensional data. In addition, we present three algorithms for solving the convex CMTL formulation.

<p>Author: Nico Goernitz, Christian Widmer, Georg Zeller, Andre Kahles, Gunnar Rätsch, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel regularization-based Multitask Learning (MTL) formulation for Structured Output (SO) prediction for the case of hierarchical task relations. Structured output prediction often leads to difﬁcult inference problems and hence requires large amounts of training data to obtain accurate models. We propose to use MTL to exploit additional information from related learning tasks by means of hierarchical regularization. Training SO models on the combined set of examples from multiple tasks can easily become infeasible for real world applications. To be able to solve the optimization problems underlying multitask structured output learning, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm based on bundle-methods. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in applications from the domain of computational biology addressing the key problem of gene ﬁnding. We show that 1) our proposed solver achieves much faster convergence than previous methods and 2) that the Hierarchical SO-MTL approach outperforms considered non-MTL methods. 1</p><p>2 0.78890055 <a title="114-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Learning_on_Structured_Data.html">181 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Learning on Structured Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Zhang, Yan Liu, Luo Si, Jian Zhang, Richard D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms assume data instances and/or data bags are independently and identically distributed. But there often exists rich additional dependency/structure information between instances/bags within many applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the performance of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the research problem as multiple instance learning on structured data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that considers additional structure information. In particular, an effective and efﬁcient optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem by using a combination of ConcaveConvex Constraint Programming (CCCP) method and an adapted Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints caused by learning on instances within individual bags and learning on structured data. Our method has the nice convergence property, with speciﬁed precision on each set of constraints. Experimental results on three different applications, i.e., webpage classiﬁcation, market targeting, and protein fold identiﬁcation, clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.71426302 <a title="114-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Margin_Multi-Label_Structured_Prediction.html">169 nips-2011-Maximum Margin Multi-Label Structured Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph H. Lampert</p><p>Abstract: We study multi-label prediction for structured output sets, a problem that occurs, for example, in object detection in images, secondary structure prediction in computational biology, and graph matching with symmetries. Conventional multilabel classiﬁcation techniques are typically not applicable in this situation, because they require explicit enumeration of the label set, which is infeasible in case of structured outputs. Relying on techniques originally designed for single-label structured prediction, in particular structured support vector machines, results in reduced prediction accuracy, or leads to infeasible optimization problems. In this work we derive a maximum-margin training formulation for multi-label structured prediction that remains computationally tractable while achieving high prediction accuracy. It also shares most beneﬁcial properties with single-label maximum-margin approaches, in particular formulation as a convex optimization problem, efﬁcient working set training, and PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds. 1</p><p>4 0.6612981 <a title="114-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Clustered_Multi-Task_Learning_Via_Alternating_Structure_Optimization.html">51 nips-2011-Clustered Multi-Task Learning Via Alternating Structure Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiayu Zhou, Jianhui Chen, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) learns multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization performance. Alternating structure optimization (ASO) is a popular MTL method that learns a shared low-dimensional predictive structure on hypothesis spaces from multiple related tasks. It has been applied successfully in many real world applications. As an alternative MTL approach, clustered multi-task learning (CMTL) assumes that multiple tasks follow a clustered structure, i.e., tasks are partitioned into a set of groups where tasks in the same group are similar to each other, and that such a clustered structure is unknown a priori. The objectives in ASO and CMTL differ in how multiple tasks are related. Interestingly, we show in this paper the equivalence relationship between ASO and CMTL, providing signiﬁcant new insights into ASO and CMTL as well as their inherent relationship. The CMTL formulation is non-convex, and we adopt a convex relaxation to the CMTL formulation. We further establish the equivalence relationship between the proposed convex relaxation of CMTL and an existing convex relaxation of ASO, and show that the proposed convex CMTL formulation is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient especially for high-dimensional data. In addition, we present three algorithms for solving the convex CMTL formulation. We report experimental results on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.61535418 <a title="114-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Submodular_Multi-Label_Learning.html">277 nips-2011-Submodular Multi-Label Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: James Petterson, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm to learn a multi-label classiﬁer which attempts at directly optimising the F -score. The key novelty of our formulation is that we explicitly allow for assortative (submodular) pairwise label interactions, i.e., we can leverage the co-ocurrence of pairs of labels in order to improve the quality of prediction. Prediction in this model consists of minimising a particular submodular set function, what can be accomplished exactly and eﬃciently via graph-cuts. Learning however is substantially more involved and requires the solution of an intractable combinatorial optimisation problem. We present an approximate algorithm for this problem and prove that it is sound in the sense that it never predicts incorrect labels. We also present a nontrivial test of a suﬃcient condition for our algorithm to have found an optimal solution. We present experiments on benchmark multi-label datasets, which attest the value of the proposed technique. We also make available source code that enables the reproduction of our experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.48809379 <a title="114-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Fast_and_Balanced%3A_Efficient_Label_Tree_Learning_for_Large_Scale_Object_Recognition.html">96 nips-2011-Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for Large Scale Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Vikas C. Raykar, Shipeng Yu</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of crowdsourcing services it has become quite cheap and reasonably effective to get a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short amount of time. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the consensus labels by correcting for the bias of annotators with different kinds of expertise. Often we have low quality annotators or spammers–annotators who assign labels randomly (e.g., without actually looking at the instance). Spammers can make the cost of acquiring labels very expensive and can potentially degrade the quality of the consensus labels. In this paper we formalize the notion of a spammer and deﬁne a score which can be used to rank the annotators—with the spammers having a score close to zero and the good annotators having a high score close to one. 1 Spammers in crowdsourced labeling tasks Annotating an unlabeled dataset is one of the bottlenecks in using supervised learning to build good predictive models. Getting a dataset labeled by experts can be expensive and time consuming. With the advent of crowdsourcing services (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk being a prime example) it has become quite easy and inexpensive to acquire labels from a large number of annotators in a short amount of time (see [8], [10], and [11] for some computer vision and natural language processing case studies). One drawback of most crowdsourcing services is that we do not have tight control over the quality of the annotators. The annotators can come from a diverse pool including genuine experts, novices, biased annotators, malicious annotators, and spammers. Hence in order to get good quality labels requestors typically get each instance labeled by multiple annotators and these multiple annotations are then consolidated either using a simple majority voting or more sophisticated methods that model and correct for the annotator biases [3, 9, 6, 7, 14] and/or task complexity [2, 13, 12]. In this paper we are interested in ranking annotators based on how spammer like each annotator is. In our context a spammer is a low quality annotator who assigns random labels (maybe because the annotator does not understand the labeling criteria, does not look at the instances when labeling, or maybe a bot pretending to be a human annotator). Spammers can signiﬁcantly increase the cost of acquiring annotations (since they need to be paid) and at the same time decrease the accuracy of the ﬁnal consensus labels. A mechanism to detect and eliminate spammers is a desirable feature for any crowdsourcing market place. For example one can give monetary bonuses to good annotators and deny payments to spammers. The main contribution of this paper is to formalize the notion of a spammer for binary, categorical, and ordinal labeling tasks. More speciﬁcally we deﬁne a scalar metric which can be used to rank the annotators—with the spammers having a score close to zero and the good annotators having a score close to one (see Figure 4). We summarize the multiple parameters corresponding to each annotator into a single score indicative of how spammer like the annotator is. While this spammer score was implicit for binary labels in earlier works [3, 9, 2, 6] the extension to categorical and ordinal labels is novel and is quite different from the accuracy computed from the confusion rate matrix. An attempt to quantify the quality of the workers based on the confusion matrix was recently made by [4] where they transformed the observed labels into posterior soft labels based on the estimated confusion 1 matrix. While we obtain somewhat similar annotator rankings, we differ from this work in that our score is directly deﬁned in terms of the annotator parameters (see § 5 for more details). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. For ease of exposition we start with binary labels (§ 2) and later extend it to categorical (§ 3) and ordinal labels (§ 4). We ﬁrst specify the annotator model used, formalize the notion of a spammer, and propose an appropriate score in terms of the annotator model parameters. We do not dwell too much on the estimation of the annotator model parameters. These parameters can either be estimated directly using known gold standard 1 or the iterative algorithms that estimate the annotator model parameters without actually knowing the gold standard [3, 9, 2, 6, 7]. In the experimental section (§ 6) we obtain rankings for the annotators using the proposed spammer scores on some publicly available data from different domains. 2 Spammer score for crowdsourced binary labels j Annotator model Let yi ∈ {0, 1} be the label assigned to the ith instance by the j th annotator, and let yi ∈ {0, 1} be the actual (unobserved) binary label. We model the accuracy of the annotator separately on the positive and the negative examples. If the true label is one, the sensitivity (true positive rate) αj for the j th annotator is deﬁned as the probability that the annotator labels it as one. j αj := Pr[yi = 1|yi = 1]. On the other hand, if the true label is zero, the speciﬁcity (1−false positive rate) β j is deﬁned as the probability that annotator labels it as zero. j β j := Pr[yi = 0|yi = 0]. Extensions of this basic model have been proposed to include item level difﬁculty [2, 13] and also to model the annotator performance based on the feature vector [14]. For simplicity we use the basic model proposed in [7] in our formulation. Based on many instances labeled by multiple annotators the maximum likelihood estimator for the annotator parameters (αj , β j ) and also the consensus ground truth (yi ) can be estimated iteratively [3, 7] via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm iteratively establishes a particular gold standard (initialized via majority voting), measures the performance of the annotators given that gold standard (M-step), and reﬁnes the gold standard based on the performance measures (E-step). Who is a spammer? Intuitively, a spammer assigns labels randomly—maybe because the annotator does not understand the labeling criteria, does not look at the instances when labeling, or maybe a bot pretending to be a human annotator. More precisely an annotator is a spammer if the probability j of observed label yi being one given the true label yi is independent of the true label, i.e., j j Pr[yi = 1|yi ] = Pr[yi = 1]. This means that the annotator is assigning labels randomly by ﬂipping a coin with bias without actually looking at the data. Equivalently (1) can be written as j j Pr[yi = 1|yi = 1] = Pr[yi = 1|yi = 0] which implies αj = 1 − β j . (1) j Pr[yi = 1] (2) Hence in the context of the annotator model deﬁned earlier a perfect spammer is an annotator for whom αj + β j − 1 = 0. This corresponds to the diagonal line on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot (see Figure 1(a)) 2 . If αj + β j − 1 < 0 then the annotators lies below the diagonal line and is a malicious annotator who ﬂips the labels. Note that a malicious annotator has discriminatory power if we can detect them and ﬂip their labels. In fact the methods proposed in [3, 7] can automatically ﬂip the labels for the malicious annotators. Hence we deﬁne the spammer score for an annotator as S j = (αj + β j − 1)2 (3) An annotator is a spammer if S j is close to zero. Good annotators have S j > 0 while a perfect annotator has S j = 1. 1 One of the commonly used strategy to ﬁlter out spammers is to inject some items into the annotations with known labels. This is the strategy used by CrowdFlower (http://crowdflower.com/docs/gold). 2 Also note that (αj + β j )/2 is equal to the area shown in the plot and can be considered as a non-parametric approximation to the area under the ROC curve (AUC) based on one observed point. It is also equal to the Balanced Classiﬁcation Rate (BCR). So a spammer can also be deﬁned as having BCR or AUC equal to 0.5. 2 Equal accuracy contours (prevalence=0.5) 0.9 1 Good Annotators Biased Annotators 0.8 0.9 Sensitivity Sensitivity ( αj ) Spammers 0.5 0.4 j 0.3 j 0.6 0.5 0.4 4 0. 5 0. 3 0. 7 0. 6 0. 4 0. 5 0. 2 0. 3 0.

A perfect spammer lies on the diagonal line on the ROC plot. (b) Contours of equal accuracy (4) and (c) equal spammer score (3). Accuracy This notion of a spammer is quite different for that of the accuracy of an annotator. An annotator with high accuracy is a good annotator but one with low accuracy is not necessarily a spammer. The accuracy is computed as 1 j Accuracyj = Pr[yi = yi ] = j Pr[yi = 1|yi = k]Pr[yi = k] = αj p + β j (1 − p), (4) k=0 where p := Pr[yi = 1] is the prevalence of the positive class. Note that accuracy depends on prevalence. Our proposed spammer score does not depend on prevalence and essentially quantiﬁes the annotator’s inherent discriminatory power. Figure 1(b) shows the contours of equal accuracy on the ROC plot. Note that annotators below the diagonal line (malicious annotators) have low accuracy. The malicious annotators are good annotators but they ﬂip their labels and as such are not spammers if we can detect them and then correct for the ﬂipping. In fact the EM algorithms [3, 7] can correctly ﬂip the labels for the malicious annotators and hence they should not be treated as spammers. Figure 1(c) also shows the contours of equal score for our proposed score and it can be seen that the malicious annotators have a high score and only annotators along the diagonal have a low score (spammers). Log-odds Another interpretation of a spammer can be seen from the log odds. Using Bayes’ rule the posterior log-odds can be written as log j Pr[yi = 1|yi ] Pr[yi = j 0|yi ] = log j Pr[yi |yi = 1] j Pr[yi |yi = 0] + log p . 1−p Pr[y =1|y j ] p If an annotator is a spammer (i.e., (2) holds) then log Pr[yi =0|yi ] = log 1−p . Essentially the annotator j i i provides no information in updating the posterior log-odds and hence does not contribute to the estimation of the actual true label. 3 Spammer score for categorical labels Annotator model Suppose there are K ≥ 2 categories. We introduce a multinomial parameter αj = (αj , . . . , αj ) for each annotator, where c c1 cK K j αj := Pr[yi = k|yi = c] ck αj = 1. ck and k=1 αj ck The term denotes the probability that annotator j assigns class k to an instance given that the true class is c. When K = 2, αj and αj are sensitivity and speciﬁcity, respectively. 11 00 Who is a spammer? As earlier a spammer assigns labels randomly, i.e., j j Pr[yi = k|yi ] = Pr[yi = k], ∀k. 3 j j This is equivalent to Pr[yi = k|yi = c] = Pr[yi = k|yi = c ], ∀c, c , k = 1, . . . , K— which means knowing the true class label being c or c does not change the probability of the annotator’s assigned label. This indicates that the annotator j is a spammer if αj = αj k , ∀c, c , k = 1, . . . , K. ck c (5) Let Aj be the K × K confusion rate matrix with entries [Aj ]ck = αck —a spammer would have 0.50 0.50 0.50 all the rows of Aj equal, for example, Aj = 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 , for a three class categorical annotation problem. Essentially Aj is a rank one matrix of the form Aj = evj , for some column vector vj ∈ RK that satisﬁes vj e = 1, where e is column vector of ones. In the binary case we had this natural notion of spammer as an annotator for whom αj + β j − 1 was close to zero. One natural way to summarize (5) would be in terms of the distance (Frobenius norm) of the confusion matrix to the closest rank one approximation, i.e, S j := Aj − eˆj v 2 F, (6) where ˆj solves v ˆj = arg min Aj − evj v vj 2 F s.t. vj e = 1. (7) Solving (7) yields ˆj = (1/K)Aj e, which is the mean of the rows of Aj . Then from (6) we have v Sj = I− 1 ee K 2 Aj = F 1 K (αj − αj k )2 . ck c c < . . . < K. Annotator model It is conceptually easier to think of the true label to be binary, that is, yi ∈ {0, 1}. For example in mammography a lesion is either malignant (1) or benign (0) (which can be conﬁrmed by biopsy) and the BIRADS ordinal scale is a means for the radiologist to quantify the uncertainty based on the digital mammogram. The radiologist assigns a higher value of the label if he/she thinks the true label is closer to one. As earlier we characterize each annotator by the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity, but the main difference is that we now deﬁne the sensitivity and speciﬁcity for j each ordinal label (or threshold) k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Let αj and βk be the sensitivity and speciﬁcity k th respectively of the j annotator corresponding to the threshold k, that is, j j j αj = Pr[yi ≥ k | yi = 1] and βk = Pr[yi < k | yi = 0]. k j j Note that αj = 1, β1 = 0 and αj 1 K+1 = 0, βK+1 = 1 from this deﬁnition. Hence each annotator j j is parameterized by a set of 2(K − 1) parameters [αj , β2 , . . . , αj , βK ]. This corresponds to an 2 K empirical ROC curve for the annotator (Figure 2). 4 Who is a spammer? As earlier we deﬁne an an1 j k=1 notator j to be a spammer if Pr[yi = k|yi = 1] = 0.9 j k=2 0.8 Pr[yi = k|yi = 0] ∀k = 1, . . . , K. Note that from j 0.7 k=3 [ 1−β , α ] the annotation model we have 3 Pr[yi = k | yi = 0.6 j j j 1] = αk − αk+1 and Pr[yi = k | yi = 0] = 0.5 k=4 j j 0.4 βk+1 − βk . This implies that annotator j is a spam0.3 j j mer if αj − αj k k+1 = βk+1 − βk , ∀k = 1, . . . , K, 0.2 j j 0.1 which leads to αj + βk = αj + β1 = 1, ∀k. This 1 k j 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 means that for every k, the point (1 − βk , αj ) lies on k 1−Specificity ( β ) the diagonal line in the ROC plot shown in Figure 2. The area under the empirical ROC curve can be comFigure 2: Ordinal labels: An annotator is modK 1 puted as (see Figure 2) AUCj = 2 k=1 (αj + eled by sensitivity/speciﬁcity for each threshold. k+1 j j αj )(βk+1 − βk ), and can be used to deﬁne the folk lowing spammer score as (2AUCj − 1)2 to rank the different annotators. 3 Sensitivity ( αj ) 3 j 2 K (αj k+1 k=1 j S = + j αj )(βk+1 k − j βk ) −1 (9) With two levels this expression defaults to the binary case. An annotator is a spammer if S j is close to zero. Good annotators have S j > 0 while a perfect annotator has S j = 1. 5 Previous work Recently Ipeirotis et.al. [4] proposed a score for categorical labels based on the expected cost of the posterior label. In this section we brieﬂy describe their approach and compare it with our proposed score. For each instance labeled by the annotator they ﬁrst compute the posterior (soft) label j j Pr[yi = c|yi ] for c = 1, . . . , K, where yi is the label assigned to the ith instance by the j th annotator and yi is the true unknown label. The posterior label is computed via Bayes’ rule as j j j Pr[yi = c|yi ] ∝ Pr[yi |yi = c]Pr[yi = c] = (αj )δ(yi ,k) pc , where pc = Pr[yi = c] is the prevack lence of class c. The score for a spammer is based on the intuition that the posterior label vector j j (Pr[yi = 1|yi ], . . . , Pr[yi = K|yi ]) for a good annotator will have all the probability mass concentrated on single class. For example for a three class problem (with equal prevalence), a posterior label vector of (1, 0, 0) (certain that the class is one) comes from a good annotator while a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) (complete uncertainty about the class label) comes from spammer. Based on this they deﬁne the following score for each annotator 1 Score = N N K K j j costck Pr[yi = k|yi ]Pr[yi = c|yi ] j i=1 . (10) c=1 k=1 where costck is the misclassiﬁcation cost when an instance of class c is classiﬁed as k. Essentially this is capturing some sort of uncertainty of the posterior label averaged over all the instances. Perfect workers have a score Scorej = 0 while spammers will have high score. An entropic version of this score based on similar ideas has also been recently proposed in [5]. Our proposed spammer score differs from this approach in the following aspects: (1) Implicit in the score deﬁned above (10) j is the assumption that an annotator is a spammer when Pr[yi = c|yi ] = Pr[yi = c], i.e., the estimated posterior labels are simply based on the prevalence and do not depend on the observed labels. By j j Bayes’ rule this is equivalent to Pr[yi |yi = c] = Pr[yi ] which is what we have used to deﬁne our spammer score. (2) While both notions of a spammer are equivalent, the approach of [4] ﬁrst computes the posterior labels based on the observed data, the class prevalence and the annotator j j j j This can be seen as follows: Pr[yi = k | yi = 1] = Pr[(yi ≥ k) AND (yi < k + 1) | yi = 1] = Pr[yi ≥ j j j j k | yi = 1] + Pr[yi < k + 1 | yi = 1] − Pr[(yi ≥ k) OR (yi < k + 1) | yi = 1] = Pr[yi ≥ k | yi = j j j 1] − Pr[yi ≥ k + 1 | yi = 1] = αj − αj . Here we used the fact that Pr[(yi ≥ k) OR (yi < k + 1)] = 1. k k+1 3 5 simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators 1 12 0.8 Spammer Score 18 0.6 0.5 22 24 23 25 0.3 29 20 0.2 0.4 0.2 30 16 14 0.1 26 21 27 28 19 0 0 13 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1−Specificity 0.8 1 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 0.4 0.6 500 500 500 1 0.7 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 3 1 500 500 500 2 8 510 7 17 4 9 27 8 30 6 3 28 7 10 2 23 22 26 24 5 1 21 29 25 14 12 17 11 18 20 19 15 16 13 4 0.8 Sensitivity 6 9 0.9 15 11 Annotator (a) Simulation setup (b) Annotator ranking Annotator rank (median) via accuracy simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators Annotator rank (median) via Ipeirotis et.al.[4] simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators 27 30 30 28 23 22 26 25 24 21 29 25 20 14 17 18 15 20 16 15 11 13 12 19 1 10 5 10 2 7 6 3 5 8 9 4 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 30 (c) Comparison with accuracy 30 18 20 16 15 19 13 12 25 11 14 17 25 20 29 21 51 15 26 22 23 24 10 2 7 10 28 6 3 8 30 5 27 9 4 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 30 (d) Comparison with Ipeirotis et. al.

[4]. parameters and then computes the expected cost. Our proposed spammer score does not depend on the prevalence of the class. Our score is also directly deﬁned only in terms of the annotator confusion matrix and does not need the observed labels. (3) For the score deﬁned in (10) while perfect annotators have a score of 0 it is not clear what should be a good baseline for a spammer. The authors suggest to compute the baseline by assuming that a worker assigns as label the class with maximum prevalence. Our proposed score has a natural scale with a perfect annotator having a score of 1 and a spammer having a score of 0. (4) However one advantage of the approach in [4] is that they can directly incorporate varied misclassiﬁcation costs. 6 Experiments Ranking annotators based on the conﬁdence interval As mentioned earlier the annotator model parameters can be estimated using the iterative EM algorithms [3, 7] and these estimated annotator parameters can then be used to compute the spammer score. The spammer score can then be used to rank the annotators. However one commonly observed phenomenon when working with crowdsourced data is that we have a lot of annotators who label only a very few instances. As a result the annotator parameters cannot be reliably estimated for these annotators. In order to factor this uncertainty in the estimation of the model parameters we compute the spammer score for 100 bootstrap replications. Based on this we compute the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) for the spammer score for each annotator. We rank the annotators based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. The CIs are wider 6 Table 1: Datasets N is the number of instances. M is the number of annotators. M ∗ is the mean/median number of annotators per instance.

The spammer score ranges from 0 to 1, the lower the score, the more spammy the annotator. The mean spammer score and the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) are shown—obtained from 100 bootstrap replications. The annotators are ranked based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. The number at the top of the CI bar shows the number of instances annotated by that annotator. Note that the CIs are wider when the annotator labels only a few instances. when the annotator labels only a few instances. For a crowdsourced labeling task the annotator has to be good and also label a reasonable number of instances in order to be reliably identiﬁed. Simulated data We ﬁrst illustrate our proposed spammer score on simulated binary data (with equal prevalence for both classes) consisting of 500 instances labeled by 30 annotators of varying sensitivity and speciﬁcity (see Figure 3(a) for the simulation setup). Of the 30 annotators we have 10 good annotators (annotators 1 to 10 who lie above the diagonal in Figure 3(a)), 10 spammers (annotators 11 to 20 who lie around the diagonal), and 10 malicious annotators (annotators 21 to 30 who lie below the diagonal). Figure 3(b) plots the ranking of annotators obtained using the proposed spammer score with the annotator model parameters estimated via the EM algorithm [3, 7]. The spammer score ranges from 0 to 1, the lower the score, the more spammy the annotator. The mean spammer score and the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) obtained via bootstrapping are shown. The annotators are ranked based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. As can be seen all the spammers (annotators 11 to 20) have a low spammer score and appear at the bottom of the list. The malicious annotators have higher score than the spammers since we can correct for their ﬂipping. The malicious annotators are good annotators but they ﬂip their labels and as such are not spammers if we detect that they are malicious. Figure 3(c) compares the (median) rank obtained via the spammer score with the (median) rank obtained using accuracy as the score to rank the annotators. While the good annotators are ranked high by both methods the accuracy score gives a low rank to the malicious annotators. Accuracy does not capture the notion of a spammer. Figure 3(d) compares the ranking with the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] which gives almost similar rankings as our proposed score. 7 21 23 10 6 35 4 34 1126 18 147 30 3 31 13 2436 33 25 5 2 20 15 39 19 15 20 28 22 299 12 37 16 38 10 32 1 5 27 25 35 30 8 17 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 40 bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators 40 1 6 34 112618 4 31 1013 7 30 2 28 21 5 20 15 39 19 20 15 22 37 16 299 12 38 10 5 8 17 0 0 27 25 35 30 0.6 0.5 35 32 2 0.4 36 11 13 31 24 10 33 28 21 26 18 0 0 40 34 15 19 39 0.1 (a) 22 37 20 38 29 9 0.2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 6 4 16 0.3 32 1 7 30 25 1 3 14 3 27 5 0.7 24 33 14 36 23 25 12 8 0.9 17 0.8 35 Sensitivity Annotator rank (median) via accuracy bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators Annotator rank (median) via Ipeirotis et.al.[4] bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators 40 23 0.2 0.4 0.6 1−Specificity (b) 0.8 1 (c) Figure 5: Comparison of the rank obtained via the spammer score with the rank obtained using (a) accuracy and (b) the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al.

[4] for the two categorial datasets in Table 1. Mechanical Turk data We report results on some publicly available linguistic and image annotation data collected using the Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) and other sources. Table 1 summarizes the datasets. Figure 4 plots the spammer scores and rankings obtained. The mean and the 95% CI obtained via bootstrapping are also shown. The number at the top of the CI bar shows the number of instances annotated by that annotator. The rankings are based on the lower limit of the 95% CI which factors the number of instances labeled by the annotator into the ranking. An annotator who labels only a few instances will have very wide CI. Some annotators who label only a few instances may have a high mean spammer score but the CI will be wide and hence ranked lower. Ideally we would like to have annotators with a high score and at the same time label a lot of instances so that we can reliablly identify them. The authors [1] for the sentiment dataset shared with us some of the qualitative observations regarding the annotators and they somewhat agree with our rankings. For example the authors made the following comments about Annotator 7 ”Quirky annotator - had a lot of debate about what was the meaning of the annotation question. I’d say he changed his labeling strategy at least once during the process”. Our proposed score gave a low rank to this annotator. Comparison with other approaches Figure 5 and 6 compares the proposed ranking with the rank obtained using accuracy and the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] for some binary and categorical datasets in Table 1. Our proposed ranking is somewhat similar to that obtained by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] but accuracy does not quite capture the notion of spammer. For example for the bluebird dataset for annotator 21 (see Figure 5(a)) accuracy ranks it at the bottom of the list while the proposed score puts is in the middle of the list. From the estimated model parameters it can be seen that annotator 21 actually ﬂips the labels (below the diagonal in Figure 5(c)) but is a good annotator. 7 Conclusions We proposed a score to rank annotators for crowdsourced binary, categorical, and ordinal labeling tasks. The obtained rankings and the scores can be used to allocate monetary bonuses to be paid to different annotators and also to eliminate spammers from further labeling tasks. A mechanism to rank annotators should be desirable feature of any crowdsourcing service. The proposed score should also be useful to specify the prior for Bayesian approaches to consolidate annotations. 8 References [1] A. Brew, D. Greene, and P. Cunningham.

<p>Author: Patrick O. Perry, Michael W. Mahoney</p><p>Abstract: Recently, Mahoney and Orecchia demonstrated that popular diffusion-based procedures to compute a quick approximation to the ﬁrst nontrivial eigenvector of a data graph Laplacian exactly solve certain regularized Semi-Deﬁnite Programs (SDPs). In this paper, we extend that result by providing a statistical interpretation of their approximation procedure. Our interpretation will be analogous to the manner in which 2 -regularized or 1 -regularized 2 -regression (often called Ridge regression and Lasso regression, respectively) can be interpreted in terms of a Gaussian prior or a Laplace prior, respectively, on the coefﬁcient vector of the regression problem. Our framework will imply that the solutions to the MahoneyOrecchia regularized SDP can be interpreted as regularized estimates of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian. Conversely, it will imply that the solution to this regularized estimation problem can be computed very quickly by running, e.g., the fast diffusion-based PageRank procedure for computing an approximation to the ﬁrst nontrivial eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. Empirical results are also provided to illustrate the manner in which approximate eigenvector computation implicitly performs statistical regularization, relative to running the corresponding exact algorithm. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.79439431 <a title="114-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchical_Multitask_Structured_Output_Learning_for_Large-scale_Sequence_Segmentation.html">114 nips-2011-Hierarchical Multitask Structured Output Learning for Large-scale Sequence Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nico Goernitz, Christian Widmer, Georg Zeller, Andre Kahles, Gunnar Rätsch, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel regularization-based Multitask Learning (MTL) formulation for Structured Output (SO) prediction for the case of hierarchical task relations. Structured output prediction often leads to difﬁcult inference problems and hence requires large amounts of training data to obtain accurate models. We propose to use MTL to exploit additional information from related learning tasks by means of hierarchical regularization. Training SO models on the combined set of examples from multiple tasks can easily become infeasible for real world applications. To be able to solve the optimization problems underlying multitask structured output learning, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm based on bundle-methods. We demonstrate the performance of our approach in applications from the domain of computational biology addressing the key problem of gene ﬁnding. We show that 1) our proposed solver achieves much faster convergence than previous methods and 2) that the Hierarchical SO-MTL approach outperforms considered non-MTL methods. 1</p><p>4 0.77154863 <a title="114-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>5 0.77082288 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Online_Learning%3A_Stochastic%2C_Constrained%2C_and_Smoothed_Adversaries.html">204 nips-2011-Online Learning: Stochastic, Constrained, and Smoothed Adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Learning theory has largely focused on two main learning scenarios: the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a ﬁxed distribution, and the adversarial scenario wherein, at every time step, an adversarially chosen instance is revealed to the player. It can be argued that in the real world neither of these assumptions is reasonable. We deﬁne the minimax value of a game where the adversary is restricted in his moves, capturing stochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential symmetrization approach, we deﬁne a notion of distribution-dependent Rademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to worst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We study a smoothed online learning scenario and show that exponentially small amount of noise can make function classes with inﬁnite Littlestone dimension learnable. 1</p><p>6 0.64911252 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Generalizing_from_Several_Related_Classification_Tasks_to_a_New_Unlabeled_Sample.html">106 nips-2011-Generalizing from Several Related Classification Tasks to a New Unlabeled Sample</a></p>

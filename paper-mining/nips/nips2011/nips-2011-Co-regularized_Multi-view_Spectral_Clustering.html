<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>3 0.24740165 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>4 0.22349946 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>5 0.17528319 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Multi-View_Learning_of_Word_Embeddings_via_CCA.html">176 nips-2011-Multi-View Learning of Word Embeddings via CCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Paramveer Dhillon, Dean P. Foster, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there has been substantial interest in using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn word representations which can then be used as features in supervised classiﬁers for NLP tasks. However, most current approaches are slow to train, do not model the context of the word, and lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we present a new learning method, Low Rank Multi-View Learning (LR-MVL) which uses a fast spectral method to estimate low dimensional context-speciﬁc word representations from unlabeled data. These representation features can then be used with any supervised learner. LR-MVL is extremely fast, gives guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, is theoretically elegant, and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on named entity recognition (NER) and chunking problems. 1 Introduction and Related Work Over the past decade there has been increased interest in using unlabeled data to supplement the labeled data in semi-supervised learning settings to overcome the inherent data sparsity and get improved generalization accuracies in high dimensional domains like NLP. Approaches like [1, 2] have been empirically very successful and have achieved excellent accuracies on a variety of NLP tasks. However, it is often difﬁcult to adapt these approaches to use in conjunction with an existing supervised NLP system as these approaches enforce a particular choice of model. An increasingly popular alternative is to learn representational embeddings for words from a large collection of unlabeled data (typically using a generative model), and to use these embeddings to augment the feature set of a supervised learner. Embedding methods produce features in low dimensional spaces or over a small vocabulary size, unlike the traditional approach of working in the original high dimensional vocabulary space with only one dimension “on” at a given time. Broadly, these embedding methods fall into two categories: 1. Clustering based word representations: Clustering methods, often hierarchical, are used to group distributionally similar words based on their contexts. The two dominant approaches are Brown Clustering [3] and [4]. As recently shown, HMMs can also be used to induce a multinomial distribution over possible clusters [5]. 2. Dense representations: These representations are dense, low dimensional and real-valued. Each dimension of these representations captures latent information about a combination of syntactic and semantic word properties. They can either be induced using neural networks like C&W; embeddings [6] and Hierarchical log-linear (HLBL) embeddings [7] or by eigen-decomposition of the word co-occurrence matrix, e.g. Latent Semantic Analysis/Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA/LSI) [8]. Unfortunately, most of these representations are 1). slow to train, 2). sensitive to the scaling of the embeddings (especially 2 based approaches like LSA/PCA), 3). can get stuck in local optima (like EM trained HMM) and 4). learn a single embedding for a given word type; i.e. all the occurrences 1 of the word “bank” will have the same embedding, irrespective of whether the context of the word suggests it means “a ﬁnancial institution” or “a river bank”. In this paper, we propose a novel context-speciﬁc word embedding method called Low Rank MultiView Learning, LR-MVL, which is fast to train and is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. As presented here, our LR-MVL embeddings are context-speciﬁc, but context oblivious embeddings (like the ones used by [6, 7]) can be trivially gotten from our model. Furthermore, building on recent advances in spectral learning for sequence models like HMMs [9, 10, 11] we show that LR-MVL has strong theoretical grounding. Particularly, we show that LR-MVL estimates low dimensional context-speciﬁc word embeddings which preserve all the information in the data if the data were generated by an HMM. Moreover, LR-MVL being linear does not face the danger of getting stuck in local optima as is the case for an EM trained HMM. LR-MVL falls into category (2) mentioned above; it learns real-valued context-speciﬁc word embeddings by performing Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [12] between the past and future views of low rank approximations of the data. However, LR-MVL is more general than those methods, which work on bigram or trigram co-occurrence matrices, in that it uses longer word sequence information to estimate context-speciﬁc embeddings and also for the reasons mentioned in the last paragraph. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we give a brief overview of CCA, which forms the core of our method. Section 3 describes our proposed LR-MVL algorithm in detail and gives theory supporting its performance. Section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of LR-MVL on the NLP tasks of Named Entity Recognition and Chunking. We conclude with a brief summary in Section 5. 2 Brief Review: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) CCA [12] is the analog to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for pairs of matrices. PCA computes the directions of maximum covariance between elements in a single matrix, whereas CCA computes the directions of maximal correlation between a pair of matrices. Unlike PCA, CCA does not depend on how the observations are scaled. This invariance of CCA to linear data transformations allows proofs that keeping the dominant singular vectors (those with largest singular values) will faithfully capture any state information. More speciﬁcally, given a set of n paired observation vectors {(l1 , r1 ), ..., (ln , rn )}–in our case the two matrices are the left (L) and right (R) context matrices of a word–we would like to simultaneously ﬁnd the directions Φl and Φr that maximize the correlation of the projections of L onto Φl with the projections of R onto Φr . This is expressed as max Φl ,Φr E[ L, Φl R, Φr ] E[ L, Φl 2 ]E[ R, Φr 2 ] (1) where E denotes the empirical expectation. We use the notation Clr (Cll ) to denote the cross (auto) covariance matrices between L and R (i.e. L’R and L’L respectively.). The left and right canonical correlates are the solutions Φl , Φr of the following equations: Cll −1 Clr Crr −1 Crl Φl = λΦl Crr −1 Crl Cll −1 Clr Φr = λΦr 3 (2) Low Rank Multi-View Learning (LR-MVL) In LR-MVL, we compute the CCA between the past and future views of the data on a large unlabeled corpus to ﬁnd the common latent structure, i.e., the hidden state associated with each token. These induced representations of the tokens can then be used as features in a supervised classiﬁer (typically discriminative). The context around a word, consisting of the h words to the right and left of it, sits in a high dimensional space, since for a vocabulary of size v, each of the h words in the context requires an indicator function of dimension v. The key move in LR-MVL is to project the v-dimensional word 2 space down to a k dimensional state space. Thus, all eigenvector computations are done in a space that is v/k times smaller than the original space. Since a typical vocabulary contains at least 50, 000 words, and we use state spaces of order k ≈ 50 dimensions, this gives a 1,000-fold reduction in the size of calculations that are needed. The core of our LR-MVL algorithm is a fast spectral method for learning a v × k matrix A which maps each of the v words in the vocabulary to a k-dimensional state vector. We call this matrix the “eigenfeature dictionary”. We now describe the LR-MVL method, give a theorem that provides intuition into how it works, and formally present the LR-MVL algorithm. The Experiments section then shows that this low rank approximation allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on NLP tasks. 3.1 The LR-MVL method Given an unlabeled token sequence w={w0 , w1 , . . ., wn } we want to learn a low (k)- dimensional state vector {z0 , z1 , . . . , zn } for each observed token. The key is to ﬁnd a v ×k matrix A (Algorithm 1) that maps each of the v words in the vocabulary to a reduced rank k-dimensional state vector, which is later used to induce context speciﬁc embeddings for the tokens (Algorithm 2). For supervised learning, these context speciﬁc embeddings are supplemented with other information about each token wt , such as its identity, orthographic features such as preﬁxes and sufﬁxes or membership in domain-speciﬁc lexicons, and used as features in a classiﬁer. Section 3.4 gives the algorithm more formally, but the key steps in the algorithm are, in general terms: • Take the h words to the left and to the right of each target word wt (the “Left” and “Right” contexts), and project them each down to k dimensions using A. • Take the CCA between the reduced rank left and right contexts, and use the resulting model to estimate a k dimensional state vector (the “hidden state”) for each token. • Take the CCA between the hidden states and the tokens wt . The singular vectors associated with wt form a new estimate of the eigenfeature dictionary. LR-MVL can be viewed as a type of co-training [13]: The state of each token wt is similar to that of the tokens both before and after it, and it is also similar to the states of the other occurrences of the same word elsewhere in the document (used in the outer iteration). LR-MVL takes advantage of these two different types of similarity by alternately estimating word state using CCA on the smooths of the states of the words before and after each target token and using the average over the states associated with all other occurrences of that word. 3.2 Theoretical Properties of LR-MVL We now present the theory behind the LR-MVL algorithm; particularly we show that the reduced rank matrix A allows a signiﬁcant data reduction while preserving the information in our data and the estimated state does the best possible job of capturing any label information that can be inferred by a linear model. Let L be an n × hv matrix giving the words in the left context of each of the n tokens, where the context is of length h, R be the corresponding n × hv matrix for the right context, and W be an n × v matrix of indicator functions for the words themselves. We will use the following assumptions at various points in our proof: Assumption 1. L, W, and R come from a rank k HMM i.e. it has a rank k observation matrix and rank k transition matrix both of which have the same domain. For example, if the dimension of the hidden state is k and the vocabulary size is v then the observation matrix, which is k × v, has rank k. This rank condition is similar to the one used by [10]. Assumption 1A. For the three views, L, W and R assume that there exists a “hidden state H” of dimension n × k, where each row Hi has the same non-singular variance-covariance matrix and 3 such that E(Li |Hi ) = Hi β T and E(Ri |Hi ) = Hi β T and E(Wi |Hi ) = Hi β T where all β’s are of L R W rank k, where Li , Ri and Wi are the rows of L, R and W respectively. Assumption 1A follows from Assumption 1. Assumption 2. ρ(L, W), ρ(L, R) and ρ(W, R) all have rank k, where ρ(X1 , X2 ) is the expected correlation between X1 and X2 . Assumption 2 is a rank condition similar to that in [9]. Assumption 3. ρ([L, R], W) has k distinct singular values. Assumption 3 just makes the proof a little cleaner, since if there are repeated singular values, then the singular vectors are not unique. Without it, we would have to phrase results in terms of subspaces with identical singular values. We also need to deﬁne the CCA function that computes the left and right singular vectors for a pair of matrices: Deﬁnition 1 (CCA). Compute the CCA between two matrices X1 and X2 . Let ΦX1 be a matrix containing the d largest singular vectors for X1 (sorted from the largest on down). Likewise for ΦX2 . Deﬁne the function CCAd (X1 , X2 ) = [ΦX1 , ΦX2 ]. When we want just one of these Φ’s, we will use CCAd (X1 , X2 )left = ΦX1 for the left singular vectors and CCAd (X1 , X2 )right = ΦX2 for the right singular vectors. Note that the resulting singular vectors, [ΦX1 , ΦX2 ] can be used to give two redundant estimates, X1 ΦX1 and X2 ΦX2 of the “hidden” state relating X1 and X2 , if such a hidden state exists. Deﬁnition 2. Deﬁne the symbol “≈” to mean X1 ≈ X2 ⇐⇒ lim X1 = lim X2 n→∞ n→∞ where n is the sample size. Lemma 1. Deﬁne A by the following limit of the right singular vectors: CCAk ([L, R], W)right ≈ A. Under assumptions 2, 3 and 1A, such that if CCAk (L, R) ≡ [ΦL , ΦR ] then CCAk ([LΦL , RΦR ], W)right ≈ A. Lemma 1 shows that instead of ﬁnding the CCA between the full context and the words, we can take the CCA between the Left and Right contexts, estimate a k dimensional state from them, and take the CCA of that state with the words and get the same result. See the supplementary material for the Proof. ˜ Let Ah denote a matrix formed by stacking h copies of A on top of each other. Right multiplying ˜ L or R by Ah projects each of the words in that context into the k-dimensional reduced rank space. The following theorem addresses the core of the LR-MVL algorithm, showing that there is an A which gives the desired dimensionality reduction. Speciﬁcally, it shows that the previous lemma also holds in the reduced rank space. Theorem 1. Under assumptions 1, 2 and 3 there exists a unique matrix A such that if ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ CCAk (LAh , RAh ) ≡ [ΦL , ΦR ] then ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ CCAk ([LAh ΦL , RAh ΦR ], W)right ≈ A ˜ where Ah is the stacked form of A. See the supplementary material for the Proof 1 . ˆ It is worth noting that our matrix A corresponds to the matrix U used by [9, 10]. They showed that U is sufﬁcient to compute the probability of a sequence of words generated by an HMM; although we do not show ˆ it here (due to limited space), our A provides a more statistically efﬁcient estimate of U than their U , and hence can also be used to estimate the sequence probabilities. 1 4 Under the above assumptions, there is asymptotically (in the limit of inﬁnite data) no beneﬁt to ﬁrst estimating state by ﬁnding the CCA between the left and right contexts and then ﬁnding the CCA between the estimated state and the words. One could instead just directly ﬁnd the CCA between the combined left and rights contexts and the words. However, because of the Zipﬁan distribution of words, many words are rare or even unique, and hence one is not in the asymptotic limit. In this case, CCA between the rare words and context will not be informative, whereas ﬁnding the CCA between the left and right contexts gives a good state vector estimate even for unique words. One can then fruitfully ﬁnd the CCA between the contexts and the estimated state vector for their associated words. 3.3 Using Exponential Smooths In practice, we replace the projected left and right contexts with exponential smooths (weighted average of the previous (or next) token’s state i.e. Zt−1 (or Zt+1 ) and previous (or next) token’s smoothed state i.e. St−1 (or St+1 ).), of them at a few different time scales, thus giving a further dimension reduction by a factor of context length h (say 100 words) divided by the number of smooths (often 5-7). We use a mixture of both very short and very long contexts which capture short and long range dependencies as required by NLP problems as NER, Chunking, WSD etc. Since exponential smooths are linear, we preserve the linearity of our method. 3.4 The LR-MVL Algorithm The LR-MVL algorithm (using exponential smooths) is given in Algorithm 1; it computes the pair of CCAs described above in Theorem 1. Algorithm 1 LR-MVL Algorithm - Learning from Large amounts of Unlabeled Data 1: Input: Token sequence Wn×v , state space size k, smoothing rates αj 2: Initialize the eigenfeature dictionary A to random values N (0, 1). 3: repeat 4: Set the state Zt (1 < t ≤ n) of each token wt to the eigenfeature vector of the corresponding word. Zt = (Aw : w = wt ) 5: Smooth the state estimates before and after each token to get a pair of views for each smoothing rate αj . (l,j) (l,j) = (1 − αj )St−1 + αj Zt−1 // left view L St (r,j) (r,j) j St = (1 − α )St+1 + αj Zt+1 // right view R. (l,j) (r,j) th where the t rows of L and R are, respectively, concatenations of the smooths St and St for (j) each of the α s. 6: Find the left and right canonical correlates, which are the eigenvectors Φl and Φr of (L L)−1 L R(R R)−1 R LΦl = λΦl . (R R)−1 R L(L L)−1 L RΦr = λΦr . 7: Project the left and right views on to the space spanned by the top k/2 left and right CCAs respectively (k/2) (k/2) Xl = LΦl and Xr = RΦr (k/2) (k/2) where Φl , Φr are matrices composed of the singular vectors of Φl , Φr with the k/2 largest magnitude singular values. Estimate the state for each word wt as the union of the left and right estimates: Z = [Xl , Xr ] 8: Estimate the eigenfeatures of each word type, w, as the average of the states estimated for that word. Aw = avg(Zt : wt = w) 9: Compute the change in A from the previous iteration 10: until |∆A| < 11: Output: Φk , Φk , A . r l A few iterations (∼ 5) of the above algorithm are sufﬁcient to converge to the solution. (Since the problem is convex, there is a single solution, so there is no issue of local minima.) As [14] show for PCA, one can start with a random matrix that is only slightly larger than the true rank k of the correlation matrix, and with extremely high likelihood converge in a few iterations to within a small distance of the true principal components. In our case, if the assumptions detailed above (1, 1A, 2 and 3) are satisﬁed, our method converges equally rapidly to the true canonical variates. As mentioned earlier, we get further dimensionality reduction in Step 5, by replacing the Left and Right context matrices with a set of exponentially smoothed values of the reduced rank projections of the context words. Step 6 ﬁnds the CCA between the Left and Right contexts. Step 7 estimates 5 the state by combining the estimates from the left and right contexts, since we don’t know which will best estimate the state. Step 8 takes the CCA between the estimated state Z and the matrix of words W. Because W is a vector of indicator functions, this CCA takes the trivial form of a set of averages. Once we have estimated the CCA model, it is used to generate context speciﬁc embeddings for the tokens from training, development and test sets (as described in Algorithm 2). These embeddings are further supplemented with other baseline features and used in a supervised learner to predict the label of the token. Algorithm 2 LR-MVL Algorithm -Inducing Context Speciﬁc Embeddings for Train/Dev/Test Data 1: Input: Model (Φk , Φk , A) output from above algorithm and Token sequences Wtrain , (Wdev , Wtest ) r l 2: Project the left and right views L and R after smoothing onto the space spanned by the top k left and right CCAs respectively Xl = LΦk and Xr = RΦk r l and the words onto the eigenfeature dictionary Xw = W train A 3: Form the ﬁnal embedding matrix Xtrain:embed by concatenating these three estimates of state Xtrain:embed = [Xl , Xw , Xr ] 4: Output: The embedding matrices Xtrain:embed , (Xdev:embed , Xtest:embed ) with context-speciﬁc representations for the tokens. These embeddings are augmented with baseline set of features mentioned in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 before learning the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Note that we can get context “oblivious” embeddings i.e. one embedding per word type, just by using the eigenfeature dictionary (Av×k ) output by Algorithm 1. 4 Experimental Results In this section we present the experimental results of LR-MVL on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Syntactic Chunking tasks. We compare LR-MVL to state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches like [1] (Alternating Structures Optimization (ASO)) and [2] (Semi-supervised extension of CRFs) as well as embeddings like C&W;, HLBL and Brown Clustering. 4.1 Datasets and Experimental Setup For the NER experiments we used the data from CoNLL 2003 shared task and for Chunking experiments we used the CoNLL 2000 shared task data2 with standard training, development and testing set splits. The CoNLL ’03 and the CoNLL ’00 datasets had ∼ 204K/51K/46K and ∼ 212K/ − /47K tokens respectively for Train/Dev./Test sets. 4.1.1 Named Entity Recognition (NER) We use the same set of baseline features as used by [15, 16] in their experiments. The detailed list of features is as below: • Current Word wi ; Its type information: all-capitalized, is-capitalized, all-digits and so on; Preﬁxes and sufﬁxes of wi • Word tokens in window of 2 around the current word i.e. (wi−2 , wi−1 , wi , wi+1 , wi+2 ); and capitalization pattern in the window. d = • Previous two predictions yi−1 and yi−2 and conjunction of d and yi−1 • Embedding features (LR-MVL, C&W;, HLBL, Brown etc.) in a window of 2 around the current word (if applicable). Following [17] we use regularized averaged perceptron model with above set of baseline features for the NER task. We also used their BILOU text chunk representation and fast greedy inference as it was shown to give superior performance. 2 More details about the data and competition are available at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/ conll2003/ner/ and http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/ 6 We also augment the above set of baseline features with gazetteers, as is standard practice in NER experiments. We tuned our free parameter namely the size of LR-MVL embedding on the development and scaled our embedding features to have a 2 norm of 1 for each token and further multiplied them by a normalization constant (also chosen by cross validation), so that when they are used in conjunction with other categorical features in a linear classiﬁer, they do not exert extra inﬂuence. The size of LR-MVL embeddings (state-space) that gave the best performance on the development set was k = 50 (50 each for Xl , Xw , Xr in Algorithm 2) i.e. the total size of embeddings was 50×3, and the best normalization constant was 0.5. We omit validation plots due to paucity of space. 4.1.2 Chunking For our chunking experiments we use a similar base set of features as above: • Current Word wi and word tokens in window of 2 around the current word i.e. d = (wi−2 , wi−1 , wi , wi+1 , wi+2 ); • POS tags ti in a window of 2 around the current word. • Word conjunction features wi ∩ wi+1 , i ∈ {−1, 0} and Tag conjunction features ti ∩ ti+1 , i ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1} and ti ∩ ti+1 ∩ ti+2 , i ∈ {−2, −1, 0}. • Embedding features in a window of 2 around the current word (when applicable). Since CoNLL 00 chunking data does not have a development set, we randomly sampled 1000 sentences from the training data (8936 sentences) for development. So, we trained our chunking models on 7936 training sentences and evaluated their F1 score on the 1000 development sentences and used a CRF 3 as the supervised classiﬁer. We tuned the size of embedding and the magnitude of 2 regularization penalty in CRF on the development set and took log (or -log of the magnitude) of the value of the features4 . The regularization penalty that gave best performance on development set was 2 and here again the best size of LR-MVL embeddings (state-space) was k = 50. Finally, we trained the CRF on the entire (“original”) training data i.e. 8936 sentences. 4.1.3 Unlabeled Data and Induction of embeddings For inducing the embeddings we used the RCV1 corpus containing Reuters newswire from Aug ’96 to Aug ’97 and containing about 63 million tokens in 3.3 million sentences5 . Case was left intact and we did not do the “cleaning” as done by [18, 16] i.e. remove all sentences which are less than 90% lowercase a-z, as our multi-view learning approach is robust to such noisy data, like news byline text (mostly all caps) which does not correlate strongly with the text of the article. We induced our LR-MVL embeddings over a period of 3 days (70 core hours on 3.0 GHz CPU) on the entire RCV1 data by performing 4 iterations, a vocabulary size of 300k and using a variety of smoothing rates (α in Algorithm 1) to capture correlations between shorter and longer contexts α = [0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9]; theoretically we could tune the smoothing parameters on the development set but we found this mixture of long and short term dependencies to work well in practice. As far as the other embeddings are concerned i.e. C&W;, HLBL and Brown Clusters, we downloaded them from http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs. The details about their induction and parameter tuning can be found in [16]; we report their best numbers here. It is also worth noting that the unsupervised training of LR-MVL was (> 1.5 times)6 faster than other embeddings. 4.2 Results The results for NER and Chunking are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, which show that LR-MVL performs signiﬁcantly better than state-of-the-art competing methods on both NER and Chunking tasks. 3 http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/ Our embeddings are learnt using a linear model whereas CRF is a log-linear model, so to keep things on same scale we did this normalization. 5 We chose this particular dataset to make a fair comparison with [1, 16], who report results using RCV1 as unlabeled data. 6 As some of these embeddings were trained on GPGPU which makes our method even faster comparatively. 4 7 Embedding/Model Baseline C&W;, 200-dim HLBL, 100-dim Brown 1000 clusters Ando & Zhang ’05 Suzuki & Isozaki ’08 LR-MVL (CO) 50 × 3-dim LR-MVL 50 × 3-dim HLBL, 100-dim C&W;, 200-dim Brown, 1000 clusters LR-MVL (CO) 50 × 3-dim LR-MVL 50 × 3-dim No Gazetteers With Gazetteers F1-Score Dev.

It is important to note that in problems like NER, the ﬁnal accuracy depends on performance on rare-words and since LR-MVL is robustly able to correlate past with future views, it is able to learn better representations for rare words resulting in overall better accuracy. On rare-words (occurring < 10 times in corpus), we got 11.7%, 10.7% and 9.6% relative reduction in error over C&W;, HLBL and Brown respectively for NER; on chunking the corresponding numbers were 6.7%, 7.1% and 8.7%. Also, it is worth mentioning that modeling the context in embeddings gives decent improvements in accuracies on both NER and Chunking problems. For the case of NER, the polysemous words were mostly like Chicago, Wales, Oakland etc., which could either be a location or organization (Sports teams, Banks etc.), so when we don’t use the gazetteer features, (which are known lists of cities, persons, organizations etc.) we got higher increase in F-score by modeling context, compared to the case when we already had gazetteer features which captured most of the information about polysemous words for NER dataset and modeling the context didn’t help as much. The polysemous words for Chunking dataset were like spot (VP/NP), never (VP/ADVP), more (NP/VP/ADVP/ADJP) etc. and in this case embeddings with context helped signiﬁcantly, giving 3.1 − 6.5% relative improvement in accuracy over context oblivious embeddings. 5 Summary and Conclusion In this paper, we presented a novel CCA-based multi-view learning method, LR-MVL, for large scale sequence learning problems such as arise in NLP. LR-MVL is a spectral method that works in low dimensional state-space so it is computationally efﬁcient, and can be used to train using large amounts of unlabeled data; moreover it does not get stuck in local optima like an EM trained HMM. The embeddings learnt using LR-MVL can be used as features with any supervised learner. LR-MVL has strong theoretical grounding; is much simpler and faster than competing methods and achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on NER and Chunking problems.

<p>Author: Abhishek Kumar, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: In many clustering problems, we have access to multiple views of the data each of which could be individually used for clustering. Exploiting information from multiple views, one can hope to ﬁnd a clustering that is more accurate than the ones obtained using the individual views. Often these different views admit same underlying clustering of the data, so we can approach this problem by looking for clusterings that are consistent across the views, i.e., corresponding data points in each view should have same cluster membership. We propose a spectral clustering framework that achieves this goal by co-regularizing the clustering hypotheses, and propose two co-regularization schemes to accomplish this. Experimental comparisons with a number of baselines on two synthetic and three real-world datasets establish the efﬁcacy of our proposed approaches.</p><p>2 0.91144705 <a title="54-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-Noise_Thresholds_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">186 nips-2011-Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>3 0.7554754 <a title="54-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>4 0.74823767 <a title="54-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Clustering_via_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_for_Portable_Skill_Discovery.html">52 nips-2011-Clustering via Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Portable Skill Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Scott Niekum, Andrew G. Barto</p><p>Abstract: Skill discovery algorithms in reinforcement learning typically identify single states or regions in state space that correspond to task-speciﬁc subgoals. However, such methods do not directly address the question of how many distinct skills are appropriate for solving the tasks that the agent faces. This can be highly inefﬁcient when many identiﬁed subgoals correspond to the same underlying skill, but are all used individually as skill goals. Furthermore, skills created in this manner are often only transferable to tasks that share identical state spaces, since corresponding subgoals across tasks are not merged into a single skill goal. We show that these problems can be overcome by clustering subgoal data deﬁned in an agent-space and using the resulting clusters as templates for skill termination conditions. Clustering via a Dirichlet process mixture model is used to discover a minimal, sufﬁcient collection of portable skills. 1</p><p>5 0.7347585 <a title="54-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>6 0.73219746 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-History_distribution_matching_method_for_predicting_effectiveness_of_HIV_combination_therapies.html">120 nips-2011-History distribution matching method for predicting effectiveness of HIV combination therapies</a></p>

<p>Author: Shengbo Guo, Onno Zoeter, Cédric Archambeau</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new sparse Bayesian model for multi-task regression and classiﬁcation. The model is able to capture correlations between tasks, or more speciﬁcally a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, while being sparse in the features. We introduce a general family of group sparsity inducing priors based on matrix-variate Gaussian scale mixtures. We show the amount of sparsity can be learnt from the data by combining an approximate inference approach with type II maximum likelihood estimation of the hyperparameters. Empirical evaluations on data sets from biology and vision demonstrate the applicability of the model, where on both regression and classiﬁcation tasks it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to previously proposed methods. 1</p><p>3 0.88047743 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Blake Shaw, Bert Huang, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world networks are described by both connectivity information and features for every node. To better model and understand these networks, we present structure preserving metric learning (SPML), an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric from a network such that the learned distances are tied to the inherent connectivity structure of the network. Like the graph embedding algorithm structure preserving embedding, SPML learns a metric which is structure preserving, meaning a connectivity algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors will yield the correct connectivity when applied using the distances from the learned metric. We show a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments where SPML predicts link patterns from node features more accurately than standard techniques. We further demonstrate a method for optimizing SPML based on stochastic gradient descent which removes the running-time dependency on the size of the network and allows the method to easily scale to networks of thousands of nodes and millions of edges. 1</p><p>4 0.87699193 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.87618268 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-A_rational_model_of_causal_inference_with_continuous_causes.html">15 nips-2011-A rational model of causal inference with continuous causes</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Michael James</p><p>Abstract: Rational models of causal induction have been successful in accounting for people’s judgments about causal relationships. However, these models have focused on explaining inferences from discrete data of the kind that can be summarized in a 2× 2 contingency table. This severely limits the scope of these models, since the world often provides non-binary data. We develop a new rational model of causal induction using continuous dimensions, which aims to diminish the gap between empirical and theoretical approaches and real-world causal induction. This model successfully predicts human judgments from previous studies better than models of discrete causal inference, and outperforms several other plausible models of causal induction with continuous causes in accounting for people’s inferences in a new experiment. 1</p><p>6 0.87529814 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>

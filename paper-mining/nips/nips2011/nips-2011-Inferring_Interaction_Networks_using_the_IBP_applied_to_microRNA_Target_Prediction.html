</p><p>5 1  Introduction  Determining interactions between entities based on observations is a major challenge when analyzing biological and social network data [1, 12, 15]. [sent-9, score-0.872]
</p><p>6 The goal is then to integrate these datasets to recover the interaction network between the entities being studied. [sent-11, score-0.698]
</p><p>7 To simplify the analysis of the data it is also beneﬁcial to identify groups, or clusters, within these interaction networks. [sent-12, score-0.092]
</p><p>8 Such groups can then be mapped to speciﬁc demographics or interests in the case of social networks or to modules and pathways in biological networks [2]. [sent-13, score-0.467]
</p><p>9 A large number of generative models were developed to represent entities as members of a number of classes. [sent-14, score-0.575]
</p><p>10 Many of these models are based on the stochastic blockmodel introduced in [19]. [sent-15, score-0.057]
</p><p>11 While the number of classes in such models could be ﬁxed, or provided by the user, nonparametric Bayesian methods have been applied to allow this number to be inferred based on the observed data [9]. [sent-16, score-0.111]
</p><p>12 The stochastic blockmodel was also further extended in [1] to allow mixed membership of entities within these classes. [sent-17, score-0.686]
</p><p>13 An alternate approach is to use latent features to describe entities. [sent-18, score-0.047]
</p><p>14 [10] proposed a nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization method to learn the latent factors in relational data whereas [12] presented a nonparametric model to study binary link data. [sent-19, score-0.343]
</p><p>15 All of these methods rely on the pairwise link and interaction data and in most cases do not utilize properties of the individual entities when determining interactions. [sent-20, score-0.804]
</p><p>16 Here we present a model that extends the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) [7], a nonparametric Bayesian prior over inﬁnite binary matrices, to learn the interactions between entities with an unbounded number of groups. [sent-21, score-0.897]
</p><p>17 Speciﬁcally, we represent each group as a latent feature and deﬁne interactions between entities within each group. [sent-22, score-0.802]
</p><p>18 Such latent feature representation has been used in the past to describe entities [7, 10, 12] and IBP is an appropriate nonparametric prior to infer the number of latent features. [sent-23, score-0.861]
</p><p>19 However, unlike IBP our model utilizes interaction scores as priors and so the 1  model is not exchangeable anymore. [sent-24, score-0.188]
</p><p>20 We thus extend IBP by integrating it with Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) constraints, speciﬁcally pairwise potentials as in Ising model. [sent-25, score-0.124]
</p><p>21 MRF priors has been combined with Dirichlet Process mixture models for image segmentation in a related work of Orbanz and Buhmann [13]. [sent-26, score-0.033]
</p><p>22 Pairwise information is also used in the distance dependent Chinese restaurant process [4] to encourage similar objects to be clustered. [sent-27, score-0.073]
</p><p>23 Our model is well suited for cases in which we are provided with information on both link structure and the outcome of the underlying interactions. [sent-28, score-0.071]
</p><p>24 In social networks such data can come from observations of conversation between individuals followed by actions of the speciﬁc individuals (for example, travel), whereas in biology it is suited for regulatory networks as discussed below. [sent-29, score-0.5]
</p><p>25 We apply our model to study the microRNA (miRNA) target prediction problem. [sent-30, score-0.029]
</p><p>26 miRNAs were recently discovered as a class of regulatory RNA molecules that regulate the levels of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) (which are later translated to proteins) by binding and inhibiting their speciﬁc targets [15]. [sent-31, score-0.314]
</p><p>27 They were shown to play an important role in a number of diseases including cancer, and determining the set of genes that are targeted by each miRNA is an important question when studying these diseases. [sent-32, score-0.179]
</p><p>28 Several methods were proposed to predict targets of miRNAs based on their sequence1 . [sent-33, score-0.102]
</p><p>29 While these predictions are useful, due to the short length of miRNAs, they lead to many false positives and some false negatives [8]. [sent-34, score-0.078]
</p><p>30 In addition to sequence information, it is now possible to obtain the expression levels of miRNAs and their predicted mRNA targets using microarrays. [sent-35, score-0.127]
</p><p>31 Since miRNAs inhibit their direct targets, integrating sequence and expression data can improve predictions regarding the interactions between miRNAs and their targets. [sent-36, score-0.236]
</p><p>32 While methods utilizing expression data improved upon methods that only used sequence data, they often treated each target mRNA in isolation. [sent-38, score-0.054]
</p><p>33 In contrast, it has now been shown that each miRNA often targets hundreds of genes, and that miRNAs often work in groups to achieve a larger impact [14]. [sent-39, score-0.186]
</p><p>34 Thus, rather than trying to infer a separate regression model for each mRNA we use our IBP extended model to infer a joint regression model for a cluster of mRNAs and the set of miRNAs that regulate them. [sent-40, score-0.158]
</p><p>35 In addition to inferring the interactions in the dataset such a model would also provide a grouping for genes and miRNAs which can be used to improve function prediction. [sent-42, score-0.253]
</p><p>36 2  Computational model  Firstly, we derive a distribution on inﬁnite binary matrices starting with a ﬁnite model and taking the limit as the number of features goes to inﬁnity. [sent-43, score-0.067]
</p><p>37 Secondly, we describe the application of our model to the miRNA target prediction problem using a Gaussian additive model. [sent-44, score-0.029]
</p><p>38 1  Interaction model  Let zik denote the (i, k) entry of a matrix Z and let zk denote the kth column of Z. [sent-46, score-0.359]
</p><p>39 The group membership of N entities is deﬁned by a (latent) binary matrix Z where zik = 1 if entity i belongs to group k. [sent-47, score-1.094]
</p><p>40 Given Z, we say that entity i interacts with entity j if zik zjk = 1 for some k. [sent-48, score-0.438]
</p><p>41 Note that two entities can interact through many groups where each group represents one type of interaction. [sent-49, score-0.767]
</p><p>42 In many cases, a prior on such interactions can be obtained. [sent-50, score-0.176]
</p><p>43 Assume we have a N × N symmetric matrix W, where wij indicates the degree that we believe that entity i and j interact: wij > 0 if entities i and j are more likely to interact and wij < 0 if they are less likely to do so. [sent-51, score-0.873]
</p><p>44 Nonparametric prior for Z: Grifﬁths and Ghahramani [7] proposed the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) as a nonparametric prior distribution on sparse binary matrices Z. [sent-52, score-0.268]
</p><p>45 The IBP can be derived from a simple stochastic process, described by a culinary metaphor. [sent-53, score-0.031]
</p><p>46 In this metaphor, there are N customers (entities) entering a restaurant and choosing from an inﬁnite array of dishes (groups). [sent-54, score-0.247]
</p><p>47 The ﬁrst customer tries Poisson(α) dishes, where α is a parameter. [sent-55, score-0.079]
</p><p>48 The ith customer tries a previously sampled dish k with probability mk , where mk is the i number of previous customers who have sampled this dish. [sent-57, score-0.319]
</p><p>49 This process deﬁnes an exchangeable distribution on the equivalence classes of Z, which are the set of binary matrices that map to the same left-ordered binary matrices. [sent-59, score-0.173]
</p><p>50 Exchangeability 1  Genes that are targets of miRNAs contain the reverse complement of part of the miRNA sequence. [sent-61, score-0.102]
</p><p>51 2  means that the order of the customers does not affect the distribution and that permutation of the data does not change the resulting likelihood. [sent-62, score-0.15]
</p><p>52 The prior knowledge on interactions discussed above (encoded by W) violates the exchangeability of the IBP since the group membership probability depends on the identities of the entities whereas exchangeability means that permutation of entities does not change the probability. [sent-63, score-1.645]
</p><p>53 In their model, the relationships among customers are encoded as a tree allowing them to exploit the sum-product algorithm in deﬁning the updates for an MCMC sampler, without signiﬁcantly increasing the computational burden when performing inference. [sent-66, score-0.195]
</p><p>54 We combine the IBP with pairwise potentials using W, constraining the dish selection of customers. [sent-67, score-0.154]
</p><p>55 Similar to the pIBP, the entries in zk are not chosen independently given πk but rather depend on the particular assignment of the remaining entries. [sent-68, score-0.11]
</p><p>56 In the following sections, we start with a model with a ﬁnite number of groups and consider the limit as the number of groups grows to derive the nonparametric prior. [sent-69, score-0.279]
</p><p>57 We can thus deﬁne a prior on interactions between entities (since their number is known in advance) while still allowing for an inﬁnite number of groups. [sent-71, score-0.751]
</p><p>58 This ﬂexibility allows the group parameters to be drawn from an inﬁnite mixtures of priors which may lead to identical groups of entities each with a different set of parameters. [sent-72, score-0.741]
</p><p>59 1  Prior on ﬁnite matrices Z  We have an N × K binary matrix Z where N is the number of entities and K is a ﬁxed, ﬁnite number of groups. [sent-75, score-0.642]
</p><p>60 For our model, we add the new pairwise potentials on memberships of entities. [sent-77, score-0.126]

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Ning Chen, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Unlike existing nonparametric Bayesian models, which rely solely on specially conceived priors to incorporate domain knowledge for discovering improved latent representations, we study nonparametric Bayesian inference with regularization on the desired posterior distributions. While priors can indirectly affect posterior distributions through Bayes’ theorem, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases can be much easier. We particularly focus on developing inﬁnite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task inﬁnite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the largemargin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classiﬁcation and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efﬁcient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets. Our results appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics.</p><p>3 0.17719904 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Image_Parsing_with_Stochastic_Scene_Grammar.html">127 nips-2011-Image Parsing with Stochastic Scene Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a parsing algorithm for scene understanding which includes four aspects: computing 3D scene layout, detecting 3D objects (e.g. furniture), detecting 2D faces (windows, doors etc.), and segmenting background. In contrast to previous scene labeling work that applied discriminative classiﬁers to pixels (or super-pixels), we use a generative Stochastic Scene Grammar (SSG). This grammar represents the compositional structures of visual entities from scene categories, 3D foreground/background, 2D faces, to 1D lines. The grammar includes three types of production rules and two types of contextual relations. Production rules: (i) AND rules represent the decomposition of an entity into sub-parts; (ii) OR rules represent the switching among sub-types of an entity; (iii) SET rules represent an ensemble of visual entities. Contextual relations: (i) Cooperative “+” relations represent positive links between binding entities, such as hinged faces of a object or aligned boxes; (ii) Competitive “-” relations represents negative links between competing entities, such as mutually exclusive boxes. We design an efﬁcient MCMC inference algorithm, namely Hierarchical cluster sampling, to search in the large solution space of scene conﬁgurations. The algorithm has two stages: (i) Clustering: It forms all possible higher-level structures (clusters) from lower-level entities by production rules and contextual relations. (ii) Sampling: It jumps between alternative structures (clusters) in each layer of the hierarchy to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration (represented by a parse tree). In our experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing methods on public dataset. In addition, our approach achieves richer structures in the parse tree. 1</p><p>4 0.09867724 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-The_Kernel_Beta_Process.html">285 nips-2011-The Kernel Beta Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Ren, Yingjian Wang, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A new L´ vy process prior is proposed for an uncountable collection of covariatee dependent feature-learning measures; the model is called the kernel beta process (KBP). Available covariates are handled efﬁciently via the kernel construction, with covariates assumed observed with each data sample (“customer”), and latent covariates learned for each feature (“dish”). Each customer selects dishes from an inﬁnite buffet, in a manner analogous to the beta process, with the added constraint that a customer ﬁrst decides probabilistically whether to “consider” a dish, based on the distance in covariate space between the customer and dish. If a customer does consider a particular dish, that dish is then selected probabilistically as in the beta process. The beta process is recovered as a limiting case of the KBP. An efﬁcient Gibbs sampler is developed for computations, and state-of-the-art results are presented for image processing and music analysis tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.070477709 <a title="132-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Modelling_Genetic_Variations_using_Fragmentation-Coagulation_Processes.html">173 nips-2011-Modelling Genetic Variations using Fragmentation-Coagulation Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Charles Blundell, Lloyd Elliott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel class of Bayesian nonparametric models for sequential data called fragmentation-coagulation processes (FCPs). FCPs model a set of sequences using a partition-valued Markov process which evolves by splitting and merging clusters. An FCP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible, and its equilibrium distributions are given by the Chinese restaurant process. As opposed to hidden Markov models, FCPs allow for ﬂexible modelling of the number of clusters, and they avoid label switching non-identiﬁability problems. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for FCPs which uses uniformization and the forward-backward algorithm. Our development of FCPs is motivated by applications in population genetics, and we demonstrate the utility of FCPs on problems of genotype imputation with phased and unphased SNP data. 1</p><p>6 0.07029216 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_person-object_interactions_for_action_recognition_in_still_images.html">154 nips-2011-Learning person-object interactions for action recognition in still images</a></p>

<p>Author: Hai-son P. Le, Ziv Bar-joseph</p><p>Abstract: Determining interactions between entities and the overall organization and clustering of nodes in networks is a major challenge when analyzing biological and social network data. Here we extend the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), a nonparametric Bayesian model, to integrate noisy interaction scores with properties of individual entities for inferring interaction networks and clustering nodes within these networks. We present an application of this method to study how microRNAs regulate mRNAs in cells. Analysis of synthetic and real data indicates that the method improves upon prior methods, correctly recovers interactions and clusters, and provides accurate biological predictions. 1</p><p>2 0.59718931 <a title="132-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-The_Kernel_Beta_Process.html">285 nips-2011-The Kernel Beta Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Lu Ren, Yingjian Wang, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A new L´ vy process prior is proposed for an uncountable collection of covariatee dependent feature-learning measures; the model is called the kernel beta process (KBP). Available covariates are handled efﬁciently via the kernel construction, with covariates assumed observed with each data sample (“customer”), and latent covariates learned for each feature (“dish”). Each customer selects dishes from an inﬁnite buffet, in a manner analogous to the beta process, with the added constraint that a customer ﬁrst decides probabilistically whether to “consider” a dish, based on the distance in covariate space between the customer and dish. If a customer does consider a particular dish, that dish is then selected probabilistically as in the beta process. The beta process is recovered as a limiting case of the KBP. An efﬁcient Gibbs sampler is developed for computations, and state-of-the-art results are presented for image processing and music analysis tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.57472104 <a title="132-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Modelling_Genetic_Variations_using_Fragmentation-Coagulation_Processes.html">173 nips-2011-Modelling Genetic Variations using Fragmentation-Coagulation Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Charles Blundell, Lloyd Elliott</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel class of Bayesian nonparametric models for sequential data called fragmentation-coagulation processes (FCPs). FCPs model a set of sequences using a partition-valued Markov process which evolves by splitting and merging clusters. An FCP is exchangeable, projective, stationary and reversible, and its equilibrium distributions are given by the Chinese restaurant process. As opposed to hidden Markov models, FCPs allow for ﬂexible modelling of the number of clusters, and they avoid label switching non-identiﬁability problems. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for FCPs which uses uniformization and the forward-backward algorithm. Our development of FCPs is motivated by applications in population genetics, and we demonstrate the utility of FCPs on problems of genotype imputation with phased and unphased SNP data. 1</p><p>4 0.56839693 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Image_Parsing_with_Stochastic_Scene_Grammar.html">127 nips-2011-Image Parsing with Stochastic Scene Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a parsing algorithm for scene understanding which includes four aspects: computing 3D scene layout, detecting 3D objects (e.g. furniture), detecting 2D faces (windows, doors etc.), and segmenting background. In contrast to previous scene labeling work that applied discriminative classiﬁers to pixels (or super-pixels), we use a generative Stochastic Scene Grammar (SSG). This grammar represents the compositional structures of visual entities from scene categories, 3D foreground/background, 2D faces, to 1D lines. The grammar includes three types of production rules and two types of contextual relations. Production rules: (i) AND rules represent the decomposition of an entity into sub-parts; (ii) OR rules represent the switching among sub-types of an entity; (iii) SET rules represent an ensemble of visual entities. Contextual relations: (i) Cooperative “+” relations represent positive links between binding entities, such as hinged faces of a object or aligned boxes; (ii) Competitive “-” relations represents negative links between competing entities, such as mutually exclusive boxes. We design an efﬁcient MCMC inference algorithm, namely Hierarchical cluster sampling, to search in the large solution space of scene conﬁgurations. The algorithm has two stages: (i) Clustering: It forms all possible higher-level structures (clusters) from lower-level entities by production rules and contextual relations. (ii) Sampling: It jumps between alternative structures (clusters) in each layer of the hierarchy to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration (represented by a parse tree). In our experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing methods on public dataset. In addition, our approach achieves richer structures in the parse tree. 1</p><p>5 0.56382692 <a title="132-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Infinite_Latent_SVM_for_Classification_and_Multi-task_Learning.html">134 nips-2011-Infinite Latent SVM for Classification and Multi-task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Ning Chen, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Unlike existing nonparametric Bayesian models, which rely solely on specially conceived priors to incorporate domain knowledge for discovering improved latent representations, we study nonparametric Bayesian inference with regularization on the desired posterior distributions. While priors can indirectly affect posterior distributions through Bayes’ theorem, imposing posterior regularization is arguably more direct and in some cases can be much easier. We particularly focus on developing inﬁnite latent support vector machines (iLSVM) and multi-task inﬁnite latent support vector machines (MT-iLSVM), which explore the largemargin idea in combination with a nonparametric Bayesian model for discovering predictive latent features for classiﬁcation and multi-task learning, respectively. We present efﬁcient inference methods and report empirical studies on several benchmark datasets. Our results appear to demonstrate the merits inherited from both large-margin learning and Bayesian nonparametrics.</p><p>6 0.50506711 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Confidence_Sets_for_Network_Structure.html">60 nips-2011-Confidence Sets for Network Structure</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Zhang, Yan Liu, Luo Si, Jian Zhang, Richard D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Most existing Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL) algorithms assume data instances and/or data bags are independently and identically distributed. But there often exists rich additional dependency/structure information between instances/bags within many applications of MIL. Ignoring this structure information limits the performance of existing MIL algorithms. This paper explores the research problem as multiple instance learning on structured data (MILSD) and formulates a novel framework that considers additional structure information. In particular, an effective and efﬁcient optimization algorithm has been proposed to solve the original non-convex optimization problem by using a combination of ConcaveConvex Constraint Programming (CCCP) method and an adapted Cutting Plane method, which deals with two sets of constraints caused by learning on instances within individual bags and learning on structured data. Our method has the nice convergence property, with speciﬁed precision on each set of constraints. Experimental results on three different applications, i.e., webpage classiﬁcation, market targeting, and protein fold identiﬁcation, clearly demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. 1</p><p>4 0.44142419 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Spatial_distance_dependent_Chinese_restaurant_processes_for_image_segmentation.html">266 nips-2011-Spatial distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes for image segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Soumya Ghosh, Andrei B. Ungureanu, Erik B. Sudderth, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: The distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) was recently introduced to accommodate random partitions of non-exchangeable data [1]. The ddCRP clusters data in a biased way: each data point is more likely to be clustered with other data that are near it in an external sense. This paper examines the ddCRP in a spatial setting with the goal of natural image segmentation. We explore the biases of the spatial ddCRP model and propose a novel hierarchical extension better suited for producing “human-like” segmentations. We then study the sensitivity of the models to various distance and appearance hyperparameters, and provide the ﬁrst rigorous comparison of nonparametric Bayesian models in the image segmentation domain. On unsupervised image segmentation, we demonstrate that similar performance to existing nonparametric Bayesian models is possible with substantially simpler models and algorithms.</p><p>5 0.431117 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-From_Stochastic_Nonlinear_Integrate-and-Fire_to_Generalized_Linear_Models.html">99 nips-2011-From Stochastic Nonlinear Integrate-and-Fire to Generalized Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Skander Mensi, Richard Naud, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Variability in single neuron models is typically implemented either by a stochastic Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model or by a model of the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) family. We use analytical and numerical methods to relate state-of-theart models from both schools of thought. First we ﬁnd the analytical expressions relating the subthreshold voltage from the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-andFire model (AdEx) to the Spike-Response Model with escape noise (SRM as an example of a GLM). Then we calculate numerically the link-function that provides the ﬁring probability given a deterministic membrane potential. We ﬁnd a mathematical expression for this link-function and test the ability of the GLM to predict the ﬁring probability of a neuron receiving complex stimulation. Comparing the prediction performance of various link-functions, we ﬁnd that a GLM with an exponential link-function provides an excellent approximation to the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire with colored-noise input. These results help to understand the relationship between the different approaches to stochastic neuron models. 1 Motivation When it comes to modeling the intrinsic variability in simple neuron models, we can distinguish two traditional approaches. One approach is inspired by the stochastic Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) hypothesis of Stein (1967) [1], where a noise term is added to the system of differential equations implementing the leaky integration to a threshold. There are multiple versions of such a stochastic LIF [2]. How the noise affects the ﬁring probability is also a function of the parameters of the neuron model. Therefore, it is important to take into account the reﬁnements of simple neuron models in terms of subthreshold resonance [3, 4], spike-triggered adaptation [5, 6] and non-linear spike 1 initiation [7, 5]. All these improvements are encompassed by the Adaptive Exponential Integrateand-Fire model (AdEx [8, 9]). The other approach is to start with some deterministic dynamics for the the state of the neuron (for instance the instantaneous distance from the membrane potential to the threshold) and link the probability intensity of emitting a spike with a non-linear function of the state variable. Under some conditions, this type of model is part of a greater class of statistical models called Generalized Linear Models (GLM [10]). As a single neuron model, the Spike Response Model (SRM) with escape noise is a GLM in which the state variable is explicitly the distance between a deterministic voltage and the threshold. The original SRM could account for subthreshold resonance, refractory effects and spike-frequency adaptation [11]. Mathematically similar models were developed independently in the study of the visual system [12] where spike-frequency adaptation has also been modeled [13]. Recently, this approach has retained increased attention since the probabilistic framework can be linked with the Bayesian theory of neural systems [14] and because Bayesian inference can be applied to the population of neurons [15]. In this paper, we investigate the similarity and differences between the state-of-the-art GLM and the stochastic AdEx. The motivation behind this work is to relate the traditional threshold neuron models to Bayesian theory. Our results extend the work of Plesser and Gerstner (2000) [16] since we include the non-linearity for spike initiation and spike-frequency adaptation. We also provide relationships between the parameters of the AdEx and the equivalent GLM. These precise relationships can be used to relate analog implementations of threshold models [17] to the probabilistic models used in the Bayesian approach. The paper is organized as follows: We ﬁrst describe the expressions relating the SRM state-variable to the parameters of the AdEx (Sect. 3.1) in the subthreshold regime. Then, we use numerical methods to ﬁnd the non-linear link-function that models the ﬁring probability (Sect. 3.2). We ﬁnd a functional form for the SRM link-function that best describes the ﬁring probability of a stochastic AdEx. We then compare the performance of this link-function with the often used exponential or linear-rectiﬁer link-functions (also called half-wave linear rectiﬁer) in terms of predicting the ﬁring probability of an AdEx under complex stimulus (Sect. 3.3). We ﬁnd that the exponential linkfunction yields almost perfect prediction. Finally, we explore the relations between the statistic of the noise and the sharpness of the non-linearity for spike initiation with the parameters of the SRM. 2 Presentation of the Models In this section we present the general formula for the stochastic AdEx model (Sect. 2.1) and the SRM (Sect 2.2). 2.1 The Stochastic Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire Model The voltage dynamics of the stochastic AdEx is given by: V −Θ ˙ τm V = El − V + ∆T exp − Rw + RI + R (1) ∆T τw w = a(V − El ) − w ˙ (2) where τm is the membrane time constant, El the reverse potential, R the membrane resistance, Θ is the threshold, ∆T is the shape factor and I(t) the input current which is chosen to be an Ornstein−Θ Uhlenbeck process with correlation time-constant of 5 ms. The exponential term ∆T exp( V∆T ) is a non-linear function responsible for the emission of spikes and is a diffusive white noise with standard deviation σ (i.e. ∼ N (0, σ)). Note that the diffusive white-noise does not imply white noise ﬂuctuations of the voltage V (t), the probability distribution of V (t) will depend on ∆T and Θ. The second variable, w, describes the subthreshold as well as the spike-triggered adaptation both ˆ parametrized by the coupling strength a and the time constant τw . Each time tj the voltage goes to inﬁnity, we assumed that a spike is emitted. Then the voltage is reset to a ﬁxed value Vr and w is increased by a constant value b. 2.2 The Generalized Linear Model In the SRM, The voltage V (t) is given by the convolution of the injected current I(t) with the membrane ﬁlter κ(t) plus the additional kernel η(t) that acts after each spikes (here we split the 2 spike-triggered kernel in two η(t) = ηv (t) + ηw (t) for reasons that will become clear later): V (t) = ˆ ˆ ηv (t − tj ) + ηw (t − tj ) El + [κ ∗ I](t) + (3) ˆ {tj } ˆ Then at each time tj a spike is emitted which results in a change of voltage described by η(t) = ηv (t) + ηw (t). Given the deterministic voltage, (Eq. 3) a spike is emitted according to the ﬁring intensity λ(V ): λ(t) = f (V (t)) (4) where f (·) is an arbitrary function called the link-function. Then the ﬁring behavior of the SRM depends on the choice of the link-function and its parameters. The most common link-function used to model single neuron activities are the linear-rectiﬁer and the exponential function. 3 Mapping In order to map the stochastic AdEx to the SRM we follow a two-step procedure. First we derive the ﬁlter κ(t) and the kernels ηv (t) and ηw (t) analytically as a function of AdEx parameters. Second, we derive the link-function of the SRM from the stochastic spike emission of the AdEx. Figure 1: Mapping of the subthreshold dynamics of an AdEx to an equivalent SRM. A. Membrane ﬁlter κ(t) for three different sets of parameters of the AdEx leading to over-damped, critically damped and under-damped cases (upper, middle and lower panel, respectively). B. Spike-Triggered η(t) (black), ηv (t) (light gray) and ηw (gray) for the three cases. C. Example of voltage trace produced when an AdEx is stimulated with a step of colored noise (black).

Error in the subthreshold voltage (VAdEx − VGLM ) as a function of the mean voltage of the AdEx, for the three different cases: over-, critically and under-damped (light gray, gray and black, respectively) with ∆T = 1 mV. Red line represents the voltage threshold Θ. E. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) ratio for the three cases with ∆T = 1 mV. The RMSE ratio is the RMSE between the deterministic VSRM and the stochastic VAdEx divided by the RMSE between repetitions of the stochastic AdEx voltage. The error bar shows a single standard deviation as the RMSE ratio is averaged accross multiple value of σ. 3.1 Subthreshold voltage dynamics We start by assuming that the non-linearity for spike initiation does not affect the mean subthreshold voltage of the stochastic AdEx (see Figure 1 D). This assumption is motivated by the small ∆T 3 observed in in-vitro recordings (from 0.5 to 2 mV [8, 9]) which suggest that the subthreshold dynamics are mainly linear except very close to Θ. Also, we expect that the non-linear link-function will capture some of the dynamics due to the non-linearity for spike initiation. Thus it is possible to rewrite the deterministic subthreshold part of the AdEx (Eq. 1-2 without and without ∆T exp((V − Θ)/∆T )) using matrices: ˙ x = Ax (5) with x = V w and A = − τ1 m a τw − gl1m τ − τ1 w (6) In this form, the dynamics of the deterministic AdEx voltage is a damped oscillator with a driving force. Depending on the eigenvalues of A the system could be over-damped, critically damped or under-damped. The ﬁlter κ(t) of the GLM is given by the impulse response of the system of coupled differential equations of the AdEx, described by Eq. 5 and 6. In other words, one has to derive the response of the system when stimulating with a Dirac-delta function. The type of damping gives three different qualitative shapes of the kernel κ(t), which are summarized in Table 3.1 and Figure 1 A. Since the three different ﬁlters also affect the nature of the stochastic voltage ﬂuctuations, we will keep the distinction between over-damped, critically damped and under-damped scenarios throughout the paper. This means that our approach is valid for at least 3 types of diffusive voltage-noise (i.e. the white noise in Eq. 1 ﬁltered by 3 different membrane ﬁlters κ(t)). To complete the description of the deterministic voltage, we need an expression for the spiketriggered kernels. The voltage reset at each spike brings a spike-triggered jump in voltage of magˆ nitude ∆ = Vr − V (t). This perturbation is superposed to the current ﬂuctuations due to I(t) and can be mediated by a Delta-diract pulse of current. Thus we can write the voltage reset kernel by: ηv (t) = ∆ ∆ [δ ∗ κ] (t) = κ(t) κ(0) κ(0) (7) where δ(t) is the Dirac-delta function. The shape of this kernel depends on κ(t) and can be computed from Table 3.1 (see Figure 1 B). Finally, the AdEx mediates spike-frequency adaptation by the jump of the second variables w. From Eq. 2 we can see that this produces a current wspike (t) = b exp (−t/τw ) that can cumulate over subsequent spikes. The effect of this current on voltage is then given by the convolution of wspike (t) with the membrane ﬁlter κ(t). Thus in the SRM framework the spike-frequency adaptation is taken into account by: ηw (t) = [wspike ∗ κ](t) (8) Again the precise form of ηw (t) depends on κ(t) and can be computed from Table 3.1 (see Figure 1 B). At this point, we would like to verify our assumption that the non-linearity for spike emission can be neglected. Fig. 1 C and D shows that the error between the voltage from Eq. 3 and the voltage from the stochastic AdEx is generally small. Moreover, we see that the main contribution to the voltage prediction error is due to the mismatch close to the spikes. However the non-linearity for spike initiation may change the probability distribution of the voltage ﬂuctuations, which in turn inﬂuences the probability of spiking. This will inﬂuence the choice of the link-function, as we will see in the next section. 3.2 Spike Generation Using κ(t), ηv (t) and ηw (t), we must relate the spiking probability of the stochastic AdEx as a function of its deterministic voltage. According to [2] the probability of spiking in time bin dt given the deterministic voltage V (t) is given by: p(V ) = prob{spike in [t, t + dt]} = 1 − exp (−f (V (t))dt) (9) where f (·) gives the ﬁring intensity as a function of the deterministic V (t) (Eq. 3). Thus to extract the link-function f we have to compute the probability of spiking given V (t) for our SRM. To do so we apply the method proposed by Jolivet et al. (2004) [18], where the probability of spiking is simply given by the distribution of the deterministic voltage estimated at the spike times divided by the distribution of the SRM voltage when there is no spike (see ﬁgure 2 A). One can numerically compute these two quantities for our models using N repetitions of the same stimulus. 4 Table 1: Analytical expressions for the membrane ﬁlter κ(t) in terms of the parameters of the AdEx for over-, critically-, and under-damped cases.

We thus extract p(V ) for different σ and ∆T (Fig. 2 B). Then using visual heuristics and previous knowledge about the potential analytical expression of the link-funtion, we try to ﬁnd a simple analytical function that captures p(V ) for a large range of combinations of σ and ∆T . We observed that the log(− log(p)) is close to linear in most studied conditions Fig. 2 B suggesting the following two distributions of p(V ): V − VT (10) p(V ) = 1 − exp − exp ∆V V − VT p(V ) = exp − exp − (11) ∆V Once we have p(V ), we can use Eq. 4 to obtain the equivalent SRM link-function, which leads to: −1 f (V ) = log (1 − p(V )) (12) dt Then the two potential link-functions of the SRM can be derived from Eq. 10 and Eq. 11 (respectively): V − VT f (V ) = λ0 exp (13) ∆V V − VT (14) f (V ) = −λ0 log 1 − exp − exp − ∆V 1 with λ0 = dt , VT the threshold of the SRM and ∆V the sharpness of the link-function (i.e. the parameters that governs the degree of the stochasticity). Note that the exact value of λ0 has no importance since it is redundant with VT . Eq. 13 is the standard exponential link-function, but we call Eq. 14 the log-exp-exp link-function. 3.3 Prediction The next point is to evaluate the ﬁt quality of each link-function. To do this, we ﬁrst estimate the parameters VT and ∆V of the GLM link-function that maximize the likelihood of observing a spike 5 Figure 2: SRM link-function. A. Histogram of the SRM voltage at the AdEx ﬁring times (red) and at non-ﬁring times (gray). The ratio of the two distributions gives p(V ) (Eq. 9, dashed lines).

Same data and labeling scheme as B, but plotting f (V ) according to Eq. 12. The lines are produced with Eq. 14 with parameters ﬁtted as described in B. and the dashed lines are produced with Eq. 13. Inset, same plot but on a semi-log(y) axis. train generated with an AdEx. Second we look at the predictive power of the resulting SRM in terms of Peri-Stimulus Time Histogram (PSTH). In other words we ask how close the spike trains generated with a GLM are from the spike train generated with a stochastic AdEx when both models are stimulated with the same input current. For any GLM with link-function f (V ) ≡ f (t|I, θ) and parameters θ regulating the shape of κ(t), ˆ ηv (t) and ηw (t), the Negative Log-Likelihood (NLL) of observing a spike-train {t} is given by:   NLL = − log(f (t|I, θ)) − f (t|I, θ) (15) t ˆ t It has been shown that the negative log-likelihood is convex in the parameters if f is convex and logconcave [19]. It is easy to show that a linear-rectiﬁer link-function, the exponential link-function and the log-exp-exp link-function all satisfy these conditions. This allows efﬁcient estimation of ˆ ˆ the optimal parameters VT and ∆V using a simple gradient descent. One can thus estimate from a single AdEx spike train the optimal parameters of a given link-function, which is more efﬁcient than the method used in Sect. 3.2. The minimal NLL resulting from the gradient descent gives an estimation of the ﬁt quality. A better estimate of the ﬁt quality is given by the distance between the PSTHs in response to stimuli not used for parameter ﬁtting . Let ν1 (t) be the PSTH of the AdEx, and ν2 (t) be the PSTH of the ﬁtted SRM, 6 Figure 3: PSTH prediction. A. Injected current. B.

Optimal log-likelihood for the three cases of the AdEx, using three different link-functions, a linear-rectiﬁer (light gray), an exponential link-function (gray) and the link-function deﬁned by Eq. 14 (dark gray), these values are obtained by averaging over 40 different combinations σ and ∆T (see Fig. 4). Error bars are one standard deviation, the stars denote a signiﬁcant difference, two-sample t-test with α = 0.01. F. same as E. but for Md (Eq. 16). then we use Md ∈ [0, 1] as a measure of match: Md = 2 2 (ν1 (t) − ν2 (t)) dt ν1 (t)2 dt + ν2 (t)2 dt (16) Md = 1 means that it is impossible to differentiate the SRM from the AdEx in terms of their PSTHs, whereas a Md of 0 means that the two PSTHs are completely different. Thus Md is a normalized similarity measure between two PSTHs. In practice, Md is estimated from the smoothed (boxcar average of 1 ms half-width) averaged spike train of 1 000 repetitions for each models. We use both the NLL and Md to quantify the ﬁt quality for each of the three damping cases and each of the three link-functions. Figure 3 shows the match between the stochastic AdEx used as a reference and the derived GLM when both are stimulated with the same input current (Fig. 3 A). The resulting voltage traces are almost identical (Fig. 3 B) and both models predict almost the same spike trains and so the same PSTHs (Fig. 3 C and D). More quantitalively, we see on Fig. 3 E and F, that the linear-rectiﬁer ﬁts signiﬁcantly worse than both the exponential and log-exp-exp link-functions, both in terms of NLL and of Md . The exponential link-function performs as well as the log-exp-exp link-function, with a spike train similarity measure Md being almost 1 for both. Finally the likelihood-based method described above gives us the opportunity to look at the relationship between the AdEx parameters σ and ∆T that governs its spike emission and the parameters VT and ∆V of the link-function (Fig. 4). We observe that an increase of the noise level produces a ﬂatter link-function (greater ∆V ) while an increase in ∆T also produces an increase in ∆V and VT (note that Fig. 4 shows ∆V and VT for the exponential link-function only, but equivalent results are obtained with the log-exp-exp link-function). 4 Discussion In Sect. 3.3 we have shown that it is possible to predict with almost perfect accuracy the PSTH of a stochastic AdEx model using an appropriate set of parameters in the SRM. Moreover, since 7 Figure 4: Inﬂuence of the AdEx parameters on the parameters of the exponential link-function. A. VT as a function of ∆T and σ. B. ∆V as a function of ∆T and σ. the subthreshold voltage of the AdEx also gives a good match with the deterministic voltage of the SRM, we expect that the AdEx and the SRM will not differ in higher moments of the spike train probability distributions beyond the PSTH. We therefore conclude that diffusive noise models of the type of Eq. 1-2 are equivalent to GLM of the type of Eq. 3-4. Once combined with similar results on other types of stochastic LIF (e.g. correlated noise), we could bridge the gap between the literature on GLM and the literature on diffusive noise models. Another noteworthy observation pertains to the nature of the link-function. The link-function has been hypothesized to be a linear-rectiﬁer, an exponential, a sigmoidal or a Gaussian [16]. We have observed that for the AdEx the link-function follows Eq. 14 that we called the log-exp-exp linkfunction. Although the link-function is log-exp-exp for most of the AdEx parameters, the exponential link-function gives an equivalently good prediction of the PSTH. This can be explained by the fact that the difference between log-exp-exp and exponential link-functions happens mainly at low voltage (i.e. far from the threshold), where the probability of emitting a spike is so low (Figure 2 C, until -50 mv). Therefore, even if the exponential link-function overestimates the ﬁring probability at these low voltages it rarely produces extra spikes. At voltages closer to the threshold, where most of the spikes are emitted, the two link-functions behave almost identically and hence produce the same PSTH. The Gaussian link-function can be seen as lying in-between the exponential link-function and the log-exp-exp link-function in Fig. 2. This means that the work of Plesser and Gerstner (2000) [16] is in agreement with the results presented here. The importance of the time-derivative of the ˙ voltage stressed by Plesser and Gerstner (leading to a two-dimensional link-function f (V, V )) was not studied here to remain consistent with the typical usage of GLM in neural systems [14]. Finally we restricted our study to exponential non-linearity for spike initiation and do not consider other cases such as the Quadratic Integrate-and-ﬁre (QIF, [5]) or other polynomial functional shapes. We overlooked these cases for two reasons. First, there are many evidences that the non-linearity in neurons (estimated from in-vitro recordings of Pyramidal neurons) is well approximated by a single exponential [9]. Second, the exponential non-linearity of the AdEx only affects the subthreshold voltage at high voltage (close to threshold) and thus can be neglected to derive the ﬁlters κ(t) and η(t). Polynomial non-linearities on the other hand affect a larger range of the subthreshold voltage so that it would be difﬁcult to justify the linearization of subthreshold dynamics essential to the method presented here.

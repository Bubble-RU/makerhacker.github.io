<p>Author: Yi-kai Liu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing an unknown matrix M of rank r and dimension d using O(rd poly log d) Pauli measurements. This has applications in quantum state tomography, and is a non-commutative analogue of a well-known problem in compressed sensing: recovering a sparse vector from a few of its Fourier coefﬁcients. We show that almost all sets of O(rd log6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rankr restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a ﬁxed (“universal”) set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley’s inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality. 1</p><p>3 0.17692818 <a title="264-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-On_the_accuracy_of_l1-filtering_of_signals_with_block-sparse_structure.html">203 nips-2011-On the accuracy of l1-filtering of signals with block-sparse structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Fatma K. Karzan, Arkadi S. Nemirovski, Boris T. Polyak, Anatoli Juditsky</p><p>Abstract: We discuss new methods for the recovery of signals with block-sparse structure, based on 1 -minimization. Our emphasis is on the efﬁciently computable error bounds for the recovery routines. We optimize these bounds with respect to the method parameters to construct the estimators with improved statistical properties. We justify the proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance. 1</p><p>4 0.1523385 <a title="264-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>5 0.14842261 <a title="264-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-SpaRCS%3A_Recovering_low-rank_and_sparse_matrices_from_compressive_measurements.html">257 nips-2011-SpaRCS: Recovering low-rank and sparse matrices from compressive measurements</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew E. Waters, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a matrix M that is the sum of a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S from a small set of linear measurements of the form y = A(M) = A(L + S). This model subsumes three important classes of signal recovery problems: compressive sensing, afﬁne rank minimization, and robust principal component analysis. We propose a natural optimization problem for signal recovery under this model and develop a new greedy algorithm called SpaRCS to solve it. Empirically, SpaRCS inherits a number of desirable properties from the state-of-the-art CoSaMP and ADMiRA algorithms, including exponential convergence and efﬁcient implementation. Simulation results with video compressive sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and robust matrix completion data sets demonstrate both the accuracy and efﬁcacy of the algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.11999267 <a title="264-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Estimation_with_Structured_Dictionaries.html">259 nips-2011-Sparse Estimation with Structured Dictionaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey, Michael I. Jordan, Ameet Talwalkar</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces Divide-Factor-Combine (DFC), a parallel divide-andconquer framework for noisy matrix factorization. DFC divides a large-scale matrix factorization task into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem in parallel using an arbitrary base matrix factorization algorithm, and combines the subproblem solutions using techniques from randomized matrix approximation. Our experiments with collaborative ﬁltering, video background modeling, and simulated data demonstrate the near-linear to super-linear speed-ups attainable with this approach. Moreover, our analysis shows that DFC enjoys high-probability recovery guarantees comparable to those of its base algorithm.</p><p>6 0.74420387 <a title="264-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_with_Replacement.html">209 nips-2011-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement</a></p>

<p>Author: Gautam Kunapuli, Richard Maclin, Jude W. Shavlik</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge-based support vector machines (KBSVMs) incorporate advice from domain experts, which can improve generalization signiﬁcantly. A major limitation that has not been fully addressed occurs when the expert advice is imperfect, which can lead to poorer models. We propose a model that extends KBSVMs and is able to not only learn from data and advice, but also simultaneously improves the advice. The proposed approach is particularly effective for knowledge discovery in domains with few labeled examples. The proposed model contains bilinear constraints, and is solved using two iterative approaches: successive linear programming and a constrained concave-convex approach. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms yield useful reﬁnements to expert advice, as well as improve the performance of the learning algorithm overall.</p><p>4 0.78481221 <a title="264-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Chen, Vidhya Navalpakkam, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A model of human visual search is proposed. It predicts both response time (RT) and error rates (RT) as a function of image parameters such as target contrast and clutter. The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of target present vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the ﬁring pattern of V1/V2 neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integrating information over time is shown to be a ‘soft max’ of diffusions, computed over the visual ﬁeld by ‘hypercolumns’ of neurons that share the same receptive ﬁeld and have different response properties to image features. An approximation of the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather than diffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar predictions to the optimal observer in common psychophysics conditions. A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate between which mechanism is used in the human brain. A B C Figure 1: Visual search. (A) Clutter and camouﬂage make visual search difﬁcult.

<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>6 0.77950692 <a title="264-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-A_More_Powerful_Two-Sample_Test_in_High_Dimensions_using_Random_Projection.html">9 nips-2011-A More Powerful Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions using Random Projection</a></p>

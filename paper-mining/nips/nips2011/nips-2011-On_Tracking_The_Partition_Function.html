<p>Author: Guido F. Montufar, Johannes Rauh, Nihat Ay</p><p>Abstract: We present explicit classes of probability distributions that can be learned by Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) depending on the number of units that they contain, and which are representative for the expressive power of the model. We use this to show that the maximal Kullback-Leibler divergence to the RBM model with n visible and m hidden units is bounded from above by (n−1)−log(m+1). In this way we can specify the number of hidden units that guarantees a sufﬁciently rich model containing different classes of distributions and respecting a given error tolerance. 1</p><p>3 0.16312733 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Facial_Expression_Transfer_with_Input-Output_Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">94 nips-2011-Facial Expression Transfer with Input-Output Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Carl Vondrick, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel active learning framework for video annotation. By judiciously choosing which frames a user should annotate, we can obtain highly accurate tracks with minimal user effort. We cast this problem as one of active learning, and show that we can obtain excellent performance by querying frames that, if annotated, would produce a large expected change in the estimated object track. We implement a constrained tracker and compute the expected change for putative annotations with efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on four datasets, including two benchmark datasets constructed with key frame annotations obtained by Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results indicate that we could obtain equivalent labels for a small fraction of the original cost. 1</p><p>5 0.1365414 <a title="197-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Filtering.html">180 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>6 0.12046118 <a title="197-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Approximating_Semidefinite_Programs_in_Sublinear_Time.html">39 nips-2011-Approximating Semidefinite Programs in Sublinear Time</a></p>

<p>Author: Angela Yao, Juergen Gall, Luc V. Gool, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: A common approach for handling the complexity and inherent ambiguities of 3D human pose estimation is to use pose priors learned from training data. Existing approaches however, are either too simplistic (linear), too complex to learn, or can only learn latent spaces from “simple data”, i.e., single activities such as walking or running. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is able to learn probabilistic non-linear latent spaces composed of multiple activities. Furthermore, we derive an incremental algorithm for the online setting which can update the latent space without extensive relearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of monocular and multi-view tracking and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>5 0.58344346 <a title="197-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Accelerated_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_for_Partition_Function_Computation.html">17 nips-2011-Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefano Ermon, Carla P. Gomes, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the partition function. In particular, we show how to accelerate a ﬂat histogram sampling technique by signiﬁcantly reducing the number of “null moves” in the chain, while maintaining asymptotic convergence properties. Our experiments show that our method converges quickly to highly accurate solutions on a range of benchmark instances, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as IJGP, TRW, and Gibbs sampling both in run-time and accuracy. We also show how obtaining a so-called density of states distribution allows for efﬁcient weight learning in Markov Logic theories. 1</p><p>6 0.53392988 <a title="197-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Modelling_Genetic_Variations_using_Fragmentation-Coagulation_Processes.html">173 nips-2011-Modelling Genetic Variations using Fragmentation-Coagulation Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiayu Zhou, Jianhui Chen, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Multi-task learning (MTL) learns multiple related tasks simultaneously to improve generalization performance. Alternating structure optimization (ASO) is a popular MTL method that learns a shared low-dimensional predictive structure on hypothesis spaces from multiple related tasks. It has been applied successfully in many real world applications. As an alternative MTL approach, clustered multi-task learning (CMTL) assumes that multiple tasks follow a clustered structure, i.e., tasks are partitioned into a set of groups where tasks in the same group are similar to each other, and that such a clustered structure is unknown a priori. The objectives in ASO and CMTL differ in how multiple tasks are related. Interestingly, we show in this paper the equivalence relationship between ASO and CMTL, providing signiﬁcant new insights into ASO and CMTL as well as their inherent relationship. The CMTL formulation is non-convex, and we adopt a convex relaxation to the CMTL formulation. We further establish the equivalence relationship between the proposed convex relaxation of CMTL and an existing convex relaxation of ASO, and show that the proposed convex CMTL formulation is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient especially for high-dimensional data. In addition, we present three algorithms for solving the convex CMTL formulation. We report experimental results on benchmark datasets to demonstrate the efﬁciency of the proposed algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.89380628 <a title="197-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-On_Tracking_The_Partition_Function.html">197 nips-2011-On Tracking The Partition Function</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Mchutchon, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: In standard Gaussian Process regression input locations are assumed to be noise free. We present a simple yet effective GP model for training on input points corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise. To make computations tractable we use a local linear expansion about each input point. This allows the input noise to be recast as output noise proportional to the squared gradient of the GP posterior mean. The input noise variances are inferred from the data as extra hyperparameters. They are trained alongside other hyperparameters by the usual method of maximisation of the marginal likelihood. Training uses an iterative scheme, which alternates between optimising the hyperparameters and calculating the posterior gradient. Analytic predictive moments can then be found for Gaussian distributed test points. We compare our model to others over a range of different regression problems and show that it improves over current methods. 1</p><p>4 0.85891187 <a title="197-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Structure_Learning_for_Optimization.html">274 nips-2011-Structure Learning for Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shulin Yang, Ali Rahimi</p><p>Abstract: We describe a family of global optimization procedures that automatically decompose optimization problems into smaller loosely coupled problems. The solutions of these are subsequently combined with message passing algorithms. We show empirically that these methods produce better solutions with fewer function evaluations than existing global optimization methods. To develop these methods, we introduce a notion of coupling between variables of optimization. This notion of coupling generalizes the notion of independence between random variables in statistics, sparseness of the Hessian in nonlinear optimization, and the generalized distributive law. Despite its generality, this notion of coupling is easier to verify empirically, making structure estimation easy, while allowing us to migrate well-established inference methods on graphical models to the setting of global optimization. 1</p><p>5 0.85821676 <a title="197-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Manifold_Clustering_and_Embedding.html">263 nips-2011-Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm called Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding (SMCE) for simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction of data lying in multiple nonlinear manifolds. Similar to most dimensionality reduction methods, SMCE ﬁnds a small neighborhood around each data point and connects each point to its neighbors with appropriate weights. The key difference is that SMCE ﬁnds both the neighbors and the weights automatically. This is done by solving a sparse optimization problem, which encourages selecting nearby points that lie in the same manifold and approximately span a low-dimensional afﬁne subspace. The optimal solution encodes information that can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction using spectral clustering and embedding. Moreover, the size of the optimal neighborhood of a data point, which can be different for different points, provides an estimate of the dimension of the manifold to which the point belongs. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively handle multiple manifolds that are very close to each other, manifolds with non-uniform sampling and holes, as well as estimate the intrinsic dimensions of the manifolds. 1 1.1</p><p>6 0.85799193 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>

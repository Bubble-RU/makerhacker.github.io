<p>Author: Xaq Pitkow, Yashar Ahmadian, Ken D. Miller</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation performs approximate inference on graphical models with loops. One might hope to compensate for the approximation by adjusting model parameters. Learning algorithms for this purpose have been explored previously, and the claim has been made that every set of locally consistent marginals can arise from belief propagation run on a graphical model. On the contrary, here we show that many probability distributions have marginals that cannot be reached by belief propagation using any set of model parameters or any learning algorithm. We call such marginals ‘unbelievable.’ This problem occurs whenever the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is not positive-deﬁnite at the target marginals. All learning algorithms for belief propagation necessarily fail in these cases, producing beliefs or sets of beliefs that may even be worse than the pre-learning approximation. We then show that averaging inaccurate beliefs, each obtained from belief propagation using model parameters perturbed about some learned mean values, can achieve the unbelievable marginals. 1</p><p>3 0.09744022 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-A_Brain-Machine_Interface_Operating_with_a_Real-Time_Spiking_Neural_Network_Control_Algorithm.html">2 nips-2011-A Brain-Machine Interface Operating with a Real-Time Spiking Neural Network Control Algorithm</a></p>

Boahen</p><p>Abstract: Motor prostheses aim to restore function to disabled patients. Despite compelling proof of concept systems, barriers to clinical translation remain. One challenge is to develop a low-power, fully-implantable system that dissipates only minimal power so as not to damage tissue. To this end, we implemented a Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder via a spiking neural network (SNN) and tested it in brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments with a rhesus monkey. The Kalman ﬁlter was trained to predict the arm’s velocity and mapped on to the SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF). A 2,000-neuron embedded Matlab SNN implementation runs in real-time and its closed-loop performance is quite comparable to that of the standard Kalman ﬁlter. The success of this closed-loop decoder holds promise for hardware SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on neuromorphic chips, which may offer power savings necessary to overcome a major obstacle to the successful clinical translation of neural motor prostheses. ∗ Present: Research Fellow F.R.S.-FNRS, Systmod Unit, University of Liege, Belgium. 1 1 Cortically-controlled motor prostheses: the challenge Motor prostheses aim to restore function for severely disabled patients by translating neural signals from the brain into useful control signals for prosthetic limbs or computer cursors. Several proof of concept demonstrations have shown encouraging results, but barriers to clinical translation still remain. One example is the development of a fully-implantable system that meets power dissipation constraints, but is still powerful enough to perform complex operations. A recently reported closedloop cortically-controlled motor prosthesis is capable of producing quick, accurate, and robust computer cursor movements by decoding neural signals (threshold-crossings) from a 96-electrode array in rhesus macaque premotor/motor cortex [1]-[4]. This, and previous designs (e.g., [5]), employ versions of the Kalman ﬁlter, ubiquitous in statistical signal processing. Such a ﬁlter and its variants are the state-of-the-art decoder for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) in humans [5] and monkeys [2]. While these recent advances are encouraging, clinical translation of such BMIs requires fullyimplanted systems, which in turn impose severe power dissipation constraints. Even though it is an open, actively-debated question as to how much of the neural prosthetic system must be implanted, we note that there are no reports to date demonstrating a fully implantable 100-channel wireless transmission system, motivating performing decoding within the implanted chip. This computation is constrained by a stringent power budget: A 6 × 6mm2 implant must dissipate less than 10mW to avoid heating the brain by more than 1◦ C [6], which is believed to be important for long term cell health. With this power budget, current approaches can not scale to higher electrode densities or to substantially more computer-intensive decode/control algorithms. The feasibility of mapping a Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder algorithm [1]-[4] on to a spiking neural network (SNN) has been explored off-line (open-loop). In these off-line tests, the SNN’s performance virtually matched that of the standard implementation [7]. These simulations provide conﬁdence that this algorithm—and others similar to it—could be implemented using an ultra-low-power approach potentially capable of meeting the severe power constraints set by clinical translation. This neuromorphic approach uses very-large-scale integrated systems containing microelectronic analog circuits to morph neural systems into silicon chips [8, 9]. These neuromorphic circuits may yield tremendous power savings—50nW per silicon neuron [10]—over digital circuits because they use physical operations to perform mathematical computations (analog approach). When implemented on a chip designed using the neuromorphic approach, a 2,000-neuron SNN network can consume as little as 100µW. Demonstrating this approach’s feasibility in a closed-loop system running in real-time is a key, non-incremental step in the development of a fully implantable decoding chip, and is necessary before proceeding with fabricating and implanting the chip. As noise, delay, and over-ﬁtting play a more important role in the closed-loop setting, it is not obvious that the SNN’s stellar open-loop performance will hold up. In addition, performance criteria are different in the closed-loop and openloop settings (e.g., time per target vs. root mean squared error). Therefore, a SNN of a different size may be required to meet the desired speciﬁcations. Here we present results and assess the performance and viability of the SNN Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder in real-time, closed-loop tests, with the monkey performing a center-out-and-back target acquisition task. To achieve closed-loop operation, we developed an embedded Matlab implementation that ran a 2,000-neuron version of the SNN in real-time on a PC. We achieved almost a 50-fold speed-up by performing part of the computation in a lower-dimensional space deﬁned by the formal method we used to map the Kalman ﬁlter on to the SNN. This shortcut allowed us to run a larger SNN in real-time than would otherwise be possible. 2 Spiking neural network mapping of control theory algorithms As reported in [11], a formal methodology, called the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), has been developed to map control-theory algorithms onto a computational fabric consisting of a highly heterogeneous population of spiking neurons simply by programming the strengths of their connections. These artiﬁcial neurons are characterized by a nonlinear multi-dimensional-vector-to-spikerate function—ai (x(t)) for the ith neuron—with parameters (preferred direction, maximum ﬁring rate, and spiking-threshold) drawn randomly from a wide distribution (standard deviation ≈ mean). 2 Spike rate (spikes/s) Representation ˆ x → ai (x) → x = ∑i ai (x)φix ˜ ai (x) = G(αi φix · x + Jibias ) 400 Transformation y = Ax → b j (Aˆ ) x Aˆ = ∑i ai (x)Aφix x x(t) B' y(t) A' 200 0 −1 Dynamics ˙ x = Ax → x = h ∗ A x A = τA + I 0 Stimulus x 1 bk(t) y(t) B' h(t) x(t) A' aj(t) Figure 1: NEF’s three principles. Representation. 1D tuning curves of a population of 50 leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons. The neurons’ tuning curves map control variables (x) to spike rates (ai (x)); this nonlinear transformation is inverted by linear weighted decoding. G() is the neurons’ nonlinear current-to-spike-rate function. Transformation. SNN with populations bk (t) and a j (t) representing y(t) and x(t). Feedforward and recurrent weights are determined by B and A , as described next. Dynamics. The system’s dynamics is captured in a neurally plausible fashion by replacing integration with the synapses’ spike response, h(t), and replacing the matrices with A = τA + I and B = τB to compensate. The neural engineering approach to conﬁguring SNNs to perform arbitrary computations is underlined by three principles (Figure 1) [11]-[14]: Representation is deﬁned by nonlinear encoding of x(t) as a spike rate, ai (x(t))—represented by the neuron tuning curve—combined with optimal weighted linear decoding of ai (x(t)) to recover ˆ an estimate of x(t), x(t) = ∑i ai (x(t))φix , where φix are the decoding weights. Transformation is performed by using alternate decoding weights in the decoding operation to map transformations of x(t) directly into transformations of ai (x(t)). For example, y(t) = Ax(t) is represented by the spike rates b j (Aˆ (t)), where unit j’s input is computed directly from unit i’s x output using Aˆ (t) = ∑i ai (x(t))Aφix , an alternative linear weighting. x Dynamics brings the ﬁrst two principles together and adds the time dimension to the circuit. This principle aims at reuniting the control-theory and neural levels by modifying the matrices to render the system neurally plausible, thereby permitting the synapses’ spike response, h(t), (i.e., impulse ˙ response) to capture the system’s dynamics. For example, for h(t) = τ −1 e−t/τ , x = Ax(t) is realized by replacing A with A = τA + I. This so-called neurally plausible matrix yields an equivalent dynamical system: x(t) = h(t) ∗ A x(t), where convolution replaces integration. The nonlinear encoding process—from a multi-dimensional stimulus, x(t), to a one-dimensional soma current, Ji (x(t)), to a ﬁring rate, ai (x(t))—is speciﬁed as: ai (x(t)) = G(Ji (x(t))). (1) Here G is the neurons’ nonlinear current-to-spike-rate function, which is given by G(Ji (x)) = τ ref − τ RC ln (1 − Jth /Ji (x)) −1 , (2) for the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre model (LIF). The LIF neuron has two behavioral regimes: subthreshold and super-threshold. The sub-threshold regime is described by an RC circuit with time constant τ RC . When the sub-threshold soma voltage reaches the threshold, Vth , the neuron emits a spike δ (t −tn ). After this spike, the neuron is reset and rests for τ ref seconds (absolute refractory period) before it resumes integrating. Jth = Vth /R is the minimum input current that produces spiking. Ignoring the soma’s RC time-constant when specifying the SNN’s dynamics are reasonable because the neurons cross threshold at a rate that is proportional to their input current, which thus sets the spike rate instantaneously, without any ﬁltering [11]. The conversion from a multi-dimensional stimulus, x(t), to a one-dimensional soma current, Ji , is ˜ performed by assigning to the neuron a preferred direction, φix , in the stimulus space and taking the dot-product: ˜ Ji (x(t)) = αi φix · x(t) + Jibias , (3) 3 where αi is a gain or conversion factor, and Jibias is a bias current that accounts for background ˜ activity. For a 1D space, φix is either +1 or −1 (drawn randomly), for ON and OFF neurons, respectively. The resulting tuning curves are illustrated in Figure 1, left. The linear decoding process is characterized by the synapses’ spike response, h(t) (i.e., post-synaptic currents), and the decoding weights, φix , which are obtained by minimizing the mean square error. A single noise term, η, takes into account all sources of noise, which have the effect of introducing uncertainty into the decoding process. Hence, the transmitted ﬁring rate can be written as ai (x(t)) + ηi , where ai (x(t)) represents the noiseless set of tuning curves and ηi is a random variable picked from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance σ 2 . Consequently, the mean square error can be written as [11]: E = 1 ˆ [x(t) − x(t)]2 2 x,η,t = 2 1 2 x(t) − ∑ (ai (x(t)) + ηi ) φix i (4) x,η,t where · x,η denotes integration over the range of x and η, the expected noise. We assume that the noise is independent and has the same variance for each neuron [11], which yields: E= where σ2 1 2 2 x(t) − ∑ ai (x(t))φix i x,t 1 + σ 2 ∑(φix )2 , 2 i (5) is the noise variance ηi η j . This expression is minimized by: N φix = ∑ Γ−1 ϒ j , ij (6) j with Γi j = ai (x)a j (x) x + σ 2 δi j , where δ is the Kronecker delta function matrix, and ϒ j = xa j (x) x [11]. One consequence of modeling noise in the neural representation is that the matrix Γ is invertible despite the use of a highly overcomplete representation. In a noiseless representation, Γ is generally singular because, due to the large number of neurons, there is a high probability of having two neurons with similar tuning curves leading to two similar rows in Γ. 3 Kalman-ﬁlter based cortical decoder In the 1960’s, Kalman described a method that uses linear ﬁltering to track the state of a dynamical system throughout time using a model of the dynamics of the system as well as noisy measurements [15]. The model dynamics gives an estimate of the state of the system at the next time step. This estimate is then corrected using the observations (i.e., measurements) at this time step. The relative weights for these two pieces of information are given by the Kalman gain, K [15, 16]. Whereas the Kalman gain is updated at each iteration, the state and observation matrices (deﬁned below)—and corresponding noise matrices—are supposed constant. In the case of prosthetic applications, the system’s state vector is the cursor’s kinematics, xt = y [veltx , velt , 1], where the constant 1 allows for a ﬁxed offset compensation. The measurement vector, yt , is the neural spike rate (spike counts in each time step) of 192 channels of neural threshold crossings. The system’s dynamics is modeled by: xt yt = Axt−1 + wt , = Cxt + qt , (7) (8) where A is the state matrix, C is the observation matrix, and wt and qt are additive, Gaussian noise sources with wt ∼ N (0, W) and qt ∼ N (0, Q). The model parameters (A, C, W and Q) are ﬁt with training data by correlating the observed hand kinematics with the simultaneously measured neural signals (Figure 2). For an efﬁcient decoding, we derived the steady-state update equation by replacing the adaptive Kalman gain by its steady-state formulation: K = (I + WCQ−1 C)−1 W CT Q−1 . This yields the following estimate of the system’s state: xt = (I − KC)Axt−1 + Kyt = MDT xt−1 + MDT yt , x y 4 (9) a Velocity (cm/s) Neuron 10 c 150 5 100 b 50 20 0 −20 0 0 x−velocity y−velocity 2000 4000 6000 8000 Time (ms) 10000 12000 1cm 14000 Trials: 0034-0049 Figure 2: Neural and kinematic measurements (monkey J, 2011-04-16, 16 continuous trials) used to ﬁt the standard Kalman ﬁlter model. a. The 192 cortical recordings fed as input to ﬁt the Kalman ﬁlter’s matrices (color code refers to the number of threshold crossings observed in each 50ms bin). b. Hand x- and y-velocity measurements correlated with the neural data to obtain the Kalman ﬁlter’s matrices. c. Cursor kinematics of 16 continuous trials under direct hand control. where MDT = (I − KC)A and MDT = K are the discrete time (DT) Kalman matrices. The steadyx y state formulation improves efﬁciency with little loss in accuracy because the optimal Kalman gain rapidly converges (typically less than 100 iterations). Indeed, in neural applications under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions, the difference between the full Kalman ﬁlter and its steadystate implementation falls to within 1% in a few seconds [17]. This simplifying assumption reduces the execution time for decoding a typical neuronal ﬁring rate signal approximately seven-fold [17], a critical speed-up for real-time applications. 4 Kalman ﬁlter with a spiking neural network To implement the Kalman ﬁlter with a SNN by applying the NEF, we ﬁrst convert Equation 9 from DT to continuous time (CT), and then replace the CT matrices with neurally plausible ones, which yields: x(t) = h(t) ∗ A x(t) + B y(t) , (10) where A = τMCT + I, B = τMCT , with MCT = MDT − I /∆t and MCT = MDT /∆t, the CT x y x x y y Kalman matrices, and ∆t = 50ms, the discrete time step; τ is the synaptic time-constant. The jth neuron’s input current (see Equation 3) is computed from the system’s current state, x(t), which is computed from estimates of the system’s previous state (ˆ (t) = ∑i ai (t)φix ) and current x y input (ˆ (t) = ∑k bk (t)φk ) using Equation 10. This yields: y ˜x J j (x(t)) = α j φ j · x(t) + J bias j ˜x ˆ ˆ = α j φ j · h(t) ∗ A x(t) + B y(t) ˜x = α j φ j · h(t) ∗ A + J bias j ∑ ai (t)φix + B ∑ bk (t)φky i + J bias j (11) k This last equation can be written in a neural network form: J j (x(t)) = h(t) ∗ ∑ ω ji ai (t) + ∑ ω jk bk (t) i + J bias j (12) k y ˜x ˜x where ω ji = α j φ j A φix and ω jk = α j φ j B φk are the recurrent and feedforward weights, respectively. 5 Efﬁcient implementation of the SNN In this section, we describe the two distinct steps carried out when implementing the SNN: creating and running the network. The ﬁrst step has no computational constraints whereas the second must be very efﬁcient in order to be successfully deployed in the closed-loop experimental setting. 5 x ( 1000 x ( = 1000 1000 = 1000 x 1000 b 1000 x 1000 1000 a Figure 3: Computing a 1000-neuron pool’s recurrent connections. a. Using connection weights requires multiplying a 1000×1000 matrix by a 1000 ×1 vector. b. Operating in the lower-dimensional state space requires multiplying a 1 × 1000 vector by a 1000 × 1 vector to get the decoded state, multiplying this state by a component of the A matrix to update it, and multiplying the updated state by a 1000 × 1 vector to re-encode it as ﬁring rates, which are then used to update the soma current for every neuron. Network creation: This step generates, for a speciﬁed number of neurons composing the network, x ˜x the gain α j , bias current J bias , preferred direction φ j , and decoding weight φ j for each neuron. The j ˜x preferred directions φ j are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution over the unit sphere. The maximum ﬁring rate, max G(J j (x)), and the normalized x-axis intercept, G(J j (x)) = 0, are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution on [200, 400] Hz and [-1, 1], respectively. From these two speciﬁcations, α j and J bias are computed using Equation 2 and Equation 3. The decoding weights j x φ j are computed by minimizing the mean square error (Equation 6). For efﬁcient implementation, we used two 1D integrators (i.e., two recurrent neuron pools, with each pool representing a scalar) rather than a single 3D integrator (i.e., one recurrent neuron pool, with the pool representing a 3D vector by itself) [13]. The constant 1 is fed to the 1D integrators as an input, rather than continuously integrated as part of the state vector. We also replaced the bk (t) units’ spike rates (Figure 1, middle) with the 192 neural measurements (spike counts in 50ms bins), y which is equivalent to choosing φk from a standard basis (i.e., a unit vector with 1 at the kth position and 0 everywhere else) [7]. Network simulation: This step runs the simulation to update the soma current for every neuron, based on input spikes. The soma voltage is then updated following RC circuit dynamics. Gaussian noise is normally added at this step, the rest of the simulation being noiseless. Neurons with soma voltage above threshold generate a spike and enter their refractory period. The neuron ﬁring rates are decoded using the linear decoding weights to get the updated states values, x and y-velocity. These values are smoothed with a ﬁlter identical to h(t), but with τ set to 5ms instead of 20ms to avoid introducing signiﬁcant delay. Then the simulation step starts over again. In order to ensure rapid execution of the simulation step, neuron interactions are not updated dix rectly using the connection matrix (Equation 12), but rather indirectly with the decoding matrix φ j , ˜x dynamics matrix A , and preferred direction matrix φ j (Equation 11). To see why this is more efﬁcient, suppose we have 1000 neurons in the a population for each of the state vector’s two scalars. Computing the recurrent connections using connection weights requires multiplying a 1000 × 1000 matrix by a 1000-dimensional vector (Figure 3a). This requires 106 multiplications and about 106 sums. Decoding each scalar (i.e., ∑i ai (t)φix ), however, requires only 1000 multiplications and 1000 sums. The decoded state vector is then updated by multiplying it by the (diagonal) A matrix, another 2 products and 1 sum. The updated state vector is then encoded by multiplying it with the neurons’ preferred direction vectors, another 1000 multiplications per scalar (Figure 3b). The resulting total of about 3000 operations is nearly three orders of magnitude fewer than using the connection weights to compute the identical transformation. To measure the speedup, we simulated a 2,000-neuron network on a computer running Matlab 2011a (Intel Core i7, 2.7-GHz, Mac OS X Lion). Although the exact run-times depend on the computing hardware and software, the run-time reduction factor should remain approximately constant across platforms. For each reported result, we ran the simulation 10 times to obtain a reliable estimate of the execution time. The run-time for neuron interactions using the recurrent connection weights was 9.9ms and dropped to 2.7µs in the lower-dimensional space, approximately a 3,500-fold speedup. Only the recurrent interactions beneﬁt from the speedup, the execution time for the rest of the operations remaining constant. The run-time for a 50ms network simulation using the recurrent connec6 Table 1: Model parameters Symbol max G(J j (x)) G(J j (x)) = 0 J bias j αj ˜x φj Range 200-400 Hz −1 to 1 Satisﬁes ﬁrst two Satisﬁes ﬁrst two ˜x φj = 1 Description Maximum ﬁring rate Normalized x-axis intercept Bias current Gain factor Preferred-direction vector σ2 τ RC j τ ref j τ PSC j 0.1 20 ms 1 ms 20 ms Gaussian noise variance RC time constant Refractory period PSC time constant tion weights was 0.94s and dropped to 0.0198s in the lower-dimensional space, a 47-fold speedup. These results demonstrate the efﬁciency the lower-dimensional space offers, which made the closedloop application of SNNs possible. 6 Closed-loop implementation An adult male rhesus macaque (monkey J) was trained to perform a center-out-and-back reaching task for juice rewards to one of eight targets, with a 500ms hold time (Figure 4a) [1]. All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hand position was measured using a Polaris optical tracking system at 60Hz (Northern Digital Inc.). Neural data were recorded from two 96-electrode silicon arrays (Blackrock Microsystems) implanted in the dorsal pre-motor and motor cortex. These recordings (-4.5 RMS threshold crossing applied to each electrode’s signal) yielded tuned activity for the direction and speed of arm movements. As detailed in [1], a standard Kalman ﬁlter model was ﬁt by correlating the observed hand kinematics with the simultaneously measured neural signals, while the monkey moved his arm to acquire virtual targets (Figure 2). The resulting model was used in a closed-loop system to control an on-screen cursor in real-time (Figure 4a, Decoder block). A steady-state version of this model serves as the standard against which the SNN implementation’s performance is compared. We built a SNN using the NEF methodology based on derived Kalman ﬁlter parameters mentioned above. This SNN was then simulated on an xPC Target (Mathworks) x86 system (Dell T3400, Intel Core 2 Duo E8600, 3.33GHz). It ran in closed-loop, replacing the standard Kalman ﬁlter as the decoder block in Figure 4a. The parameter values listed in Table 1 were used for the SNN implementation. We ensured that the time constants τiRC ,τiref , and τiPSC were smaller than the implementation’s time step (50ms). Noise was not explicitly added. It arose naturally from the ﬂuctuations produced by representing a scalar with ﬁltered spike trains, which has been shown to have effects similar to Gaussian noise [11]. For the purpose of computing the linear decoding weights (i.e., Γ), we modeled the resulting noise as Gaussian with a variance of 0.1. A 2,000-neuron version of the SNN-based decoder was tested in a closed-loop system, the largest network our embedded MatLab implementation could run in real-time. There were 1206 trials total among which 301 (center-outs only) were performed with the SNN and 302 with the standard (steady-state) Kalman ﬁlter. The block structure was randomized and interleaved, so that there is no behavioral bias present in the ﬁndings. 100 trials under hand control are used as a baseline comparison. Success corresponds to a target acquisition under 1500ms, with 500ms hold time. Success rates were higher than 99% on all blocks for the SNN implementation and 100% for the standard Kalman ﬁlter. The average time to acquire the target was slightly slower for the SNN (Figure 5b)—711ms vs. 661ms, respectively—we believe this could be improved by using more neurons in the SNN.1 The average distance to target (Figure 5a) and the average velocity of the cursor (Figure 5c) are very similar. 1 Off-line, the SNN performed better as we increased the number of neurons [7]. 7 a Neural Spikes b c BMI: Kalman decoder BMI: SNN decoder Decoder Cursor Velocity 1cm 1cm Trials: 2056-2071 Trials: 1748-1763 5 0 0 400 Time after Target Onset (ms) 800 Target acquisition time histogram 40 Mean cursor velocity 50 Standard Kalman filter 40 20 Hand 30 30 Spiking Neural Network 20 10 0 c Cursor Velocity (cm/s) b Mean distance to target 10 Percent of Trials (%) a Distance to Target (cm) Figure 4: Experimental setup and results. a.

The 2,000-neuron network had success rates higher than 99% on all blocks, with mean distance to target, target acquisition time, and mean cursor velocity curves very similar to the ones obtained with the standard implementation. Future work will explore whether these results extend to additional animals. As the Kalman ﬁlter and its variants are the state-of-the-art in cortically-controlled motor prostheses [1]-[5], these simulations provide conﬁdence that similar levels of performance can be attained with a neuromorphic system, which can potentially overcome the power constraints set by clinical applications. Our ultimate goal is to develop an ultra-low-power neuromorphic chip for prosthetic applications on to which control theory algorithms can be mapped using the NEF. As our next step in this direction, we will begin exploring this mapping with Neurogrid, a hardware platform with sixteen programmable neuromorphic chips that can simulate up to a million spiking neurons in real-time [9]. However, bandwidth limitations prevent Neurogrid from realizing random connectivity patterns. It can only connect each neuron to thousands of others if neighboring neurons share common inputs — just as they do in the cortex. Such columnar organization may be possible with NEF-generated networks if preferred directions vectors are assigned topographically rather than randomly. Implementing this constraint effectively is a subject of ongoing research. Acknowledgment This work was supported in part by the Belgian American Education Foundation(J.

<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>5 0.060728665 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-The_Local_Rademacher_Complexity_of_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">286 nips-2011-The Local Rademacher Complexity of Lp-Norm Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

Previous local approaches analyzed the case p = 1 only while our analysis covers all cases 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, assuming the different feature mappings corresponding to the different kernels to be uncorrelated. We also show a lower bound that shows that the bound is tight, and derive consequences regarding exα cess loss, namely fast convergence rates of the order O(n− 1+α ), where α is the minimum eigenvalue decay rate of the individual kernels. 1</p><p>6 0.057327755 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-High-Dimensional_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Tractable_Graph_Families_and_Necessary_Conditions.html">117 nips-2011-High-Dimensional Graphical Model Selection: Tractable Graph Families and Necessary Conditions</a></p>

<p>Author: Pablo M. Olmos, Luis Salamanca, Juan Fuentes, Fernando Pérez-Cruz</p><p>Abstract: We show an application of a tree structure for approximate inference in graphical models using the expectation propagation algorithm. These approximations are typically used over graphs with short-range cycles. We demonstrate that these approximations also help in sparse graphs with long-range loops, as the ones used in coding theory to approach channel capacity. For asymptotically large sparse graph, the expectation propagation algorithm together with the tree structure yields a completely disconnected approximation to the graphical model but, for for ﬁnite-length practical sparse graphs, the tree structure approximation to the code graph provides accurate estimates for the marginal of each variable. Furthermore, we propose a new method for constructing the tree structure on the ﬂy that might be more amenable for sparse graphs with general factors. 1</p><p>2 0.60714072 <a title="31-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-Learning_unbelievable_probabilities.html">158 nips-2011-Learning unbelievable probabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Xaq Pitkow, Yashar Ahmadian, Ken D. Miller</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation performs approximate inference on graphical models with loops. One might hope to compensate for the approximation by adjusting model parameters. Learning algorithms for this purpose have been explored previously, and the claim has been made that every set of locally consistent marginals can arise from belief propagation run on a graphical model. On the contrary, here we show that many probability distributions have marginals that cannot be reached by belief propagation using any set of model parameters or any learning algorithm. We call such marginals ‘unbelievable.’ This problem occurs whenever the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is not positive-deﬁnite at the target marginals. All learning algorithms for belief propagation necessarily fail in these cases, producing beliefs or sets of beliefs that may even be worse than the pre-learning approximation. We then show that averaging inaccurate beliefs, each obtained from belief propagation using model parameters perturbed about some learned mean values, can achieve the unbelievable marginals. 1</p><p>3 0.58437163 <a title="31-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Uniqueness_of_Belief_Propagation_on_Signed_Graphs.html">296 nips-2011-Uniqueness of Belief Propagation on Signed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: While loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) has been utilized in a wide variety of applications with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, if the interactions of random variables in a graphical model are strong, the behaviors of the algorithm can be difﬁcult to analyze due to underlying phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the uniqueness problem of the LBP ﬁxed point; our new “necessary and sufﬁcient” condition is stated in terms of graphs and signs, where the sign denotes the types (attractive/repulsive) of the interaction (i.e., compatibility function) on the edge. In all previous works, uniqueness is guaranteed only in the situations where the strength of the interactions are “sufﬁciently” small in certain senses. In contrast, our condition covers arbitrary strong interactions on the speciﬁed class of signed graphs. The result of this paper is based on the recent theoretical advance in the LBP algorithm; the connection with the graph zeta function.</p><p>4 0.55011147 <a title="31-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-High-Dimensional_Graphical_Model_Selection%3A_Tractable_Graph_Families_and_Necessary_Conditions.html">117 nips-2011-High-Dimensional Graphical Model Selection: Tractable Graph Families and Necessary Conditions</a></p>
<p>Author: Animashree Anandkumar, Vincent Tan, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Ising and Gaussian graphical model selection given n i.i.d. samples from the model. We propose an efﬁcient threshold-based algorithm for structure estimation based on conditional mutual information thresholding. This simple local algorithm requires only loworder statistics of the data and decides whether two nodes are neighbors in the unknown graph. We identify graph families for which the proposed algorithm has low sample and computational complexities. Under some transparent assumptions, we establish that the proposed algorithm is −4 structurally consistent (or sparsistent) when the number of samples scales as n = Ω(Jmin log p), where p is the number of nodes and Jmin is the minimum edge potential. We also develop novel non-asymptotic techniques for obtaining necessary conditions for graphical model selection.

<p>Author: Xiaoyin Ge, Issam I. Safa, Mikhail Belkin, Yusu Wang</p><p>Abstract: Recovering hidden structure from complex and noisy non-linear data is one of the most fundamental problems in machine learning and statistical inference. While such data is often high-dimensional, it is of interest to approximate it with a lowdimensional or even one-dimensional space, since many important aspects of data are often intrinsically low-dimensional. Furthermore, there are many scenarios where the underlying structure is graph-like, e.g, river/road networks or various trajectories. In this paper, we develop a framework to extract, as well as to simplify, a one-dimensional ”skeleton” from unorganized data using the Reeb graph. Our algorithm is very simple, does not require complex optimizations and can be easily applied to unorganized high-dimensional data such as point clouds or proximity graphs. It can also represent arbitrary graph structures in the data. We also give theoretical results to justify our method. We provide a number of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our algorithm, including comparisons to existing methods, such as principal curves. We believe that the simplicity and practicality of our algorithm will help to promote skeleton graphs as a data analysis tool for a broad range of applications.</p><p>6 0.47508839 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Anatomically_Constrained_Decoding_of_Finger_Flexion_from_Electrocorticographic_Signals.html">38 nips-2011-Anatomically Constrained Decoding of Finger Flexion from Electrocorticographic Signals</a></p>

In many of these problems the amount of data in practice is so large that there is a constant need for faster algorithms. In this work we present the ﬁrst sublinear time approximation algorithm for semideﬁnite programs which we believe may be useful for such problems in which the size of data may cause even linear time algorithms to have prohibitive running times in practice. We present the algorithm and its analysis alongside with some theoretical lower bounds and an improved algorithm for the special problem of supervised learning of a distance metric. 1</p><p>2 0.98231989 <a title="31-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Variance_Reduction_in_Monte-Carlo_Tree_Search.html">300 nips-2011-Variance Reduction in Monte-Carlo Tree Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Veness, Marc Lanctot, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven to be a powerful, generic planning technique for decision-making in single-agent and adversarial environments. The stochastic nature of the Monte-Carlo simulations introduces errors in the value estimates, both in terms of bias and variance. Whilst reducing bias (typically through the addition of domain knowledge) has been studied in the MCTS literature, comparatively little effort has focused on reducing variance. This is somewhat surprising, since variance reduction techniques are a well-studied area in classical statistics. In this paper, we examine the application of some standard techniques for variance reduction in MCTS, including common random numbers, antithetic variates and control variates. We demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to MCTS and explore their efﬁcacy on three different stochastic, single-agent settings: Pig, Can’t Stop and Dominion. 1</p><p>3 0.97616565 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_Dynamic_Difficulty.html">218 nips-2011-Predicting Dynamic Difficulty</a></p>
<p>Author: Olana Missura, Thomas Gärtner</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in electronic games as well as teaching systems, we investigate the problem of dynamic difﬁculty adjustment. The task here is to repeatedly ﬁnd a game difﬁculty setting that is neither ‘too easy’ and bores the player, nor ‘too difﬁcult’ and overburdens the player. The contributions of this paper are (i) the formulation of difﬁculty adjustment as an online learning problem on partially ordered sets, (ii) an exponential update algorithm for dynamic difﬁculty adjustment, (iii) a bound on the number of wrong difﬁculty settings relative to the best static setting chosen in hindsight, and (iv) an empirical investigation of the algorithm when playing against adversaries. 1</p><p>4 0.97357893 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Complexity_of_Inference_in_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">58 nips-2011-Complexity of Inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Dan Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). First, we study the problem of ﬁnding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of topics to words, where the document’s topic distribution is integrated out. We show that, when the e↵ective number of topics per document is small, exact inference takes polynomial time. In contrast, we show that, when a document has a large number of topics, ﬁnding the MAP assignment of topics to words in LDA is NP-hard. Next, we consider the problem of ﬁnding the MAP topic distribution for a document, where the topic-word assignments are integrated out. We show that this problem is also NP-hard. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the problem of sampling from the posterior, showing that this is NP-hard in one restricted setting, but leaving open the general question. 1</p><p>5 0.96482944 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Policy_Gradient_Coagent_Networks.html">215 nips-2011-Policy Gradient Coagent Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel class of actor-critic algorithms for actors consisting of sets of interacting modules. We present, analyze theoretically, and empirically evaluate an update rule for each module, which requires only local information: the module’s input, output, and the TD error broadcast by a critic. Such updates are necessary when computation of compatible features becomes prohibitively difﬁcult and are also desirable to increase the biological plausibility of reinforcement learning methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.95625299 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-An_Application_of_Tree-Structured_Expectation_Propagation_for_Channel_Decoding.html">31 nips-2011-An Application of Tree-Structured Expectation Propagation for Channel Decoding</a></p>

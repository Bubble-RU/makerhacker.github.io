<p>Author: Congcong Li, Ashutosh Saxena, Tsuhan Chen</p><p>Abstract: For most scene understanding tasks (such as object detection or depth estimation), the classiﬁers need to consider contextual information in addition to the local features. We can capture such contextual information by taking as input the features/attributes from all the regions in the image. However, this contextual dependence also varies with the spatial location of the region of interest, and we therefore need a different set of parameters for each spatial location. This results in a very large number of parameters. In this work, we model the independence properties between the parameters for each location and for each task, by deﬁning a Markov Random Field (MRF) over the parameters. In particular, two sets of parameters are encouraged to have similar values if they are spatially close or semantically close. Our method is, in principle, complementary to other ways of capturing context such as the ones that use a graphical model over the labels instead. In extensive evaluation over two different settings, of multi-class object detection and of multiple scene understanding tasks (scene categorization, depth estimation, geometric labeling), our method beats the state-of-the-art methods in all the four tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.24111673 <a title="154-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, Tamara L. Berg</p><p>Abstract: We develop and demonstrate automatic image description methods using a large captioned photo collection. One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset – performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then ﬁltering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning. 1</p><p>4 0.21534704 <a title="154-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Object_Detection_with_Grammar_Models.html">193 nips-2011-Object Detection with Grammar Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ross B. Girshick, Pedro F. Felzenszwalb, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: Compositional models provide an elegant formalism for representing the visual appearance of highly variable objects. While such models are appealing from a theoretical point of view, it has been difﬁcult to demonstrate that they lead to performance advantages on challenging datasets. Here we develop a grammar model for person detection and show that it outperforms previous high-performance systems on the PASCAL benchmark. Our model represents people using a hierarchy of deformable parts, variable structure and an explicit model of occlusion for partially visible objects. To train the model, we introduce a new discriminative framework for learning structured prediction models from weakly-labeled data. 1</p><p>5 0.14581008 <a title="154-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Filtering.html">180 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>6 0.12935485 <a title="154-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Rapid_Deformable_Object_Detection_using_Dual-Tree_Branch-and-Bound.html">233 nips-2011-Rapid Deformable Object Detection using Dual-Tree Branch-and-Bound</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph J. Lim, Antonio Torralba, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Despite the recent trend of increasingly large datasets for object detection, there still exist many classes with few training examples. To overcome this lack of training data for certain classes, we propose a novel way of augmenting the training data for each class by borrowing and transforming examples from other classes. Our model learns which training instances from other classes to borrow and how to transform the borrowed examples so that they become more similar to instances from the target class. Our experimental results demonstrate that our new object detector, with borrowed and transformed examples, improves upon the current state-of-the-art detector on the challenging SUN09 object detection dataset. 1</p><p>4 0.7906546 <a title="154-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-%24%5Ctheta%24-MRF%3A_Capturing_Spatial_and_Semantic_Structure_in_the_Parameters_for_Scene_Understanding.html">1 nips-2011-$\theta$-MRF: Capturing Spatial and Semantic Structure in the Parameters for Scene Understanding</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Geiger, Christian Wojek, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel generative model that is able to reason jointly about the 3D scene layout as well as the 3D location and orientation of objects in the scene. In particular, we infer the scene topology, geometry as well as trafﬁc activities from a short video sequence acquired with a single camera mounted on a moving car. Our generative model takes advantage of dynamic information in the form of vehicle tracklets as well as static information coming from semantic labels and geometry (i.e., vanishing points). Experiments show that our approach outperforms a discriminative baseline based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) which has access to the same image information. Furthermore, as we reason about objects in 3D, we are able to signiﬁcantly increase the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors in their ability to estimate object orientation. 1</p><p>6 0.74356294 <a title="154-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Image_Parsing_with_Stochastic_Scene_Grammar.html">127 nips-2011-Image Parsing with Stochastic Scene Grammar</a></p>

<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha, Sung J. Hwang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to learn discriminative visual representations while exploiting external semantic knowledge about object category relationships. Given a hierarchical taxonomy that captures semantic similarity between the objects, we learn a corresponding tree of metrics (ToM). In this tree, we have one metric for each non-leaf node of the object hierarchy, and each metric is responsible for discriminating among its immediate subcategory children. Speciﬁcally, a Mahalanobis metric learned for a given node must satisfy the appropriate (dis)similarity constraints generated only among its subtree members’ training instances. To further exploit the semantics, we introduce a novel regularizer coupling the metrics that prefers a sparse disjoint set of features to be selected for each metric relative to its ancestor (supercategory) nodes’ metrics. Intuitively, this reﬂects that visual cues most useful to distinguish the generic classes (e.g., feline vs. canine) should be different than those cues most useful to distinguish their component ﬁne-grained classes (e.g., Persian cat vs. Siamese cat). We validate our approach with multiple image datasets using the WordNet taxonomy, show its advantages over alternative metric learning approaches, and analyze the meaning of attribute features selected by our algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.79269683 <a title="154-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Semantic_Labeling_of_3D_Point_Clouds_for_Indoor_Scenes.html">247 nips-2011-Semantic Labeling of 3D Point Clouds for Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Hema S. Koppula, Abhishek Anand, Thorsten Joachims, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data have become widely available. In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an ofﬁce and address the task of semantic labeling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the model’s parsimony becomes important and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efﬁcient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and ofﬁces (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for ofﬁces, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of ﬁnding objects in large cluttered rooms.1 1</p><p>4 0.79150993 <a title="154-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Probabilistic_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Labeling.html">223 nips-2011-Probabilistic Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Ion, Joao Carreira, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint image segmentation and labeling model (JSL) which, given a bag of ﬁgure-ground segment hypotheses extracted at multiple image locations and scales, constructs a joint probability distribution over both the compatible image interpretations (tilings or image segmentations) composed from those segments, and over their labeling into categories. The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as ﬁrst sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect conﬁgurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.</p><p>5 0.78975677 <a title="154-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Higher-Order_Graph_Structure_with_Features_by_Structure_Penalty.html">146 nips-2011-Learning Higher-Order Graph Structure with Features by Structure Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Shilin Ding, Grace Wahba, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In discrete undirected graphical models, the conditional independence of node labels Y is speciﬁed by the graph structure. We study the case where there is another input random vector X (e.g. observed features) such that the distribution P (Y | X) is determined by functions of X that characterize the (higher-order) interactions among the Y ’s. The main contribution of this paper is to learn the graph structure and the functions conditioned on X at the same time. We prove that discrete undirected graphical models with feature X are equivalent to multivariate discrete models. The reparameterization of the potential functions in graphical models by conditional log odds ratios of the latter offers advantages in representation of the conditional independence structure. The functional spaces can be ﬂexibly determined by kernels. Additionally, we impose a Structure Lasso (SLasso) penalty on groups of functions to learn the graph structure. These groups with overlaps are designed to enforce hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. 1</p><p>6 0.784729 <a title="154-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominique Tschopp, Suhas Diggavi, Payam Delgosha, Soheil Mohajer</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ﬁnding the nearest neighbor (or one of the R-nearest neighbors) of a query object q in a database of n objects, when we can only use a comparison oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query object. The main problem we study is how to search the database for the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the questions. The difﬁculty of this problem depends on properties of the underlying database. We show the importance of a characterization: combinatorial disorder D which deﬁnes approximate triangle n inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound of Ω(D log D + D2 ) average number of questions in the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates the fundamental role of D for worst case behavior. We develop 3 a randomized scheme for NN retrieval in O(D3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) 3 questions.

<p>Author: Zhen J. Xiang, Hao Xu, Peter J. Ramadge</p><p>Abstract: Learning sparse representations on data adaptive dictionaries is a state-of-the-art method for modeling data. But when the dictionary is large and the data dimension is high, it is a computationally challenging problem. We explore three aspects of the problem. First, we derive new, greatly improved screening tests that quickly identify codewords that are guaranteed to have zero weights. Second, we study the properties of random projections in the context of learning sparse representations. Finally, we develop a hierarchical framework that uses incremental random projections and screening to learn, in small stages, a hierarchically structured dictionary for sparse representations. Empirical results show that our framework can learn informative hierarchical sparse representations more efﬁciently. 1</p><p>4 0.081868745 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Video_Annotation_and_Tracking_with_Active_Learning.html">303 nips-2011-Video Annotation and Tracking with Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Vondrick, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel active learning framework for video annotation. By judiciously choosing which frames a user should annotate, we can obtain highly accurate tracks with minimal user effort. We cast this problem as one of active learning, and show that we can obtain excellent performance by querying frames that, if annotated, would produce a large expected change in the estimated object track. We implement a constrained tracker and compute the expected change for putative annotations with efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on four datasets, including two benchmark datasets constructed with key frame annotations obtained by Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results indicate that we could obtain equivalent labels for a small fraction of the original cost. 1</p><p>5 0.079581179 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Margin_Multi-Instance_Learning.html">168 nips-2011-Maximum Margin Multi-Instance Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Heng Huang, Farhad Kamangar, Feiping Nie, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Multi-instance learning (MIL) considers input as bags of instances, in which labels are assigned to the bags. MIL is useful in many real-world applications. For example, in image categorization semantic meanings (labels) of an image mostly arise from its regions (instances) instead of the entire image (bag). Existing MIL methods typically build their models using the Bag-to-Bag (B2B) distance, which are often computationally expensive and may not truly reﬂect the semantic similarities. To tackle this, in this paper we approach MIL problems from a new perspective using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance, which directly assesses the relationships between the classes and the bags. Taking into account the two major challenges in MIL, high heterogeneity on data and weak label association, we propose a novel Maximum Margin Multi-Instance Learning (M3 I) approach to parameterize the C2B distance by introducing the class speciﬁc distance metrics and the locally adaptive signiﬁcance coefﬁcients. We apply our new approach to the automatic image categorization tasks on three (one single-label and two multilabel) benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promising results that validate the proposed method.</p><p>6 0.077894472 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Exploiting_spatial_overlap_to_efficiently_compute_appearance_distances_between_image_windows.html">91 nips-2011-Exploiting spatial overlap to efficiently compute appearance distances between image windows</a></p>

<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Viviana Petrescu, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a computationally efﬁcient technique to compute the distance of highdimensional appearance descriptor vectors between image windows. The method exploits the relation between appearance distance and spatial overlap. We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efﬁciently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as ﬁnding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or ﬁnding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18] and on hashing [21]. For example, our algorithm ﬁnds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average. 1</p><p>5 0.50945652 <a title="64-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Target_Neighbor_Consistent_Feature_Weighting_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">279 nips-2011-Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ichiro Takeuchi, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: We consider feature selection and weighting for nearest neighbor classiﬁers. A technical challenge in this scenario is how to cope with discrete update of nearest neighbors when the feature space metric is changed during the learning process. This issue, called the target neighbor change, was not properly addressed in the existing feature weighting and metric learning literature. In this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting algorithm that can exactly and efﬁciently keep track of the correct target neighbors via sequential quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that guarantees the consistency between target neighbors and the feature space metric. We further show that the proposed algorithm can be naturally combined with regularization path tracking, allowing computationally efﬁcient selection of the regularization parameter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.47186846 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Query-Aware_MCMC.html">229 nips-2011-Query-Aware MCMC</a></p>

<p>Author: Sungwoong Kim, Sebastian Nowozin, Pushmeet Kohli, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For many of the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, image segmentation is an important preprocessing step. As such, several image segmentation algorithms have been proposed, however, with certain reservation due to high computational load and many hand-tuning parameters. Correlation clustering, a graphpartitioning algorithm often used in natural language processing and document clustering, has the potential to perform better than previously proposed image segmentation algorithms. We improve the basic correlation clustering formulation by taking into account higher-order cluster relationships. This improves clustering in the presence of local boundary ambiguities. We ﬁrst apply the pairwise correlation clustering to image segmentation over a pairwise superpixel graph and then develop higher-order correlation clustering over a hypergraph that considers higher-order relations among superpixels. Fast inference is possible by linear programming relaxation, and also effective parameter learning framework by structured support vector machine is possible. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed higher-order correlation clustering outperforms other state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77028322 <a title="64-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Convergent_Bounds_on_the_Euclidean_Distance.html">64 nips-2011-Convergent Bounds on the Euclidean Distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoonho Hwang, Hee-kap Ahn</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n vectors in d-dimensional space, we provide an efﬁcient method for computing quality upper and lower bounds of the Euclidean distances between a pair of vectors in V . For this purpose, we deﬁne a distance measure, called the MS-distance, by using the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V . Once we compute the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V in O(dn) time, the MS-distance provides upper and lower bounds of Euclidean distance between any pair of vectors in V in constant time.

An analysis on a random sequence of reﬁnement steps shows that the MS-distance provides very tight bounds in only a few reﬁnement steps. The MS-distance can be used to various applications where the Euclidean distance is used to measure the proximity or similarity between objects. We provide experimental results on the nearest and the farthest neighbor searches. 1</p><p>3 0.70416641 <a title="64-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_Using_Quadratic_Approximation.html">262 nips-2011-Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation Using Quadratic Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Cho-jui Hsieh, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Mátyás A. Sustik</p><p>Abstract: The 1 regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator has been shown to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance matrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of a Gaussian Markov Random Field, from very limited samples. We propose a novel algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem which is a regularized log-determinant program. In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods that largely use ﬁrst order gradient information, our algorithm is based on Newton’s method and employs a quadratic approximation, but with some modiﬁcations that leverage the structure of the sparse Gaussian MLE problem. We show that our method is superlinearly convergent, and also present experimental results using synthetic and real application data that demonstrate the considerable improvements in performance of our method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.70275605 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Tests_for_Optimization_Efficiency.html">271 nips-2011-Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency</a></p>
<p>Author: Levi Boyles, Anoop Korattikara, Deva Ramanan, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: Learning problems, such as logistic regression, are typically formulated as pure optimization problems deﬁned on some loss function. We argue that this view ignores the fact that the loss function depends on stochastically generated data which in turn determines an intrinsic scale of precision for statistical estimation. By considering the statistical properties of the update variables used during the optimization (e.g. gradients), we can construct frequentist hypothesis tests to determine the reliability of these updates. We utilize subsets of the data for computing updates, and use the hypothesis tests for determining when the batch-size needs to be increased. This provides computational beneﬁts and avoids overﬁtting by stopping when the batch-size has become equal to size of the full dataset. Moreover, the proposed algorithms depend on a single interpretable parameter – the probability for an update to be in the wrong direction – which is set to a single value across all algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we illustrate these ideas on three L1 regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1 -regularized L2 -loss SVMs, L1 -regularized logistic regression, and the Lasso, but we emphasize that the underlying methods are much more generally applicable. 1</p><p>5 0.69949818 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Methods_for_Overlapping_Group_Lasso.html">78 nips-2011-Efficient Methods for Overlapping Group Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Yuan, Jun Liu, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predeﬁned) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efﬁcient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using both synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efﬁcient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.69821405 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Nearest_Neighbor_based_Greedy_Coordinate_Descent.html">182 nips-2011-Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent</a></p>

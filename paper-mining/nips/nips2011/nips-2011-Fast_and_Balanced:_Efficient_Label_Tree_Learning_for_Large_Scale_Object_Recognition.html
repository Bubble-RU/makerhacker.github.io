</p><p>5 We demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in test accuracy and efﬁciency with less training time and more balanced trees compared to the previous state of the art by Bengio et al. [sent-6, score-0.632]
</p><p>6 The large number of classes renders the standard one-versus-all multiclass approach too costly, as the complexity grows linearly with the number of classes, for both training and testing, making it prohibitive for practical applications that require low latency or high throughput, e. [sent-9, score-0.341]
</p><p>7 Classiﬁcation with many classes has received increasing attention recently and most approaches appear to have converged to tree based models [2, 3, 9, 1]. [sent-12, score-0.54]
</p><p>8 [1] proposes a label tree model, which has been shown to achieve state of the art performance in testing. [sent-14, score-0.563]
</p><p>9 In a label tree, each node is associated with a subset of class labels and a linear classiﬁer that determines which branch to follow. [sent-15, score-0.478]
</p><p>10 In performing the classiﬁcation task, a test example travels from the root of the tree to a leaf node associated with a single class label. [sent-16, score-0.758]
</p><p>11 Therefore for a well balanced tree, the time required for evaluation is reduced from O(DK) to O(D log K), where K is the number of classes and D is the feature dimensionality. [sent-17, score-0.394]
</p><p>12 The technique can be combined with an embedding ˜ ˜ ˜ technique, so that the evaluation cost can be further reduced to O(D log K + DD) where D D is an embedded label space. [sent-18, score-0.375]
</p><p>13 Despite the success of label trees in addressing testing efﬁciency, the learning technique, critical to ensuring good testing accuracy and efﬁciency, has several limitations. [sent-19, score-0.51]
</p><p>14 Learning the tree structure (determining how to split the classes into subsets) involves ﬁrst training one-vs-all classiﬁers for all K classes to obtain a confusion matrix, and then using spectral clustering to split the classes into disjoint subsets. [sent-20, score-1.372]
</p><p>15 Third, the tree structure may be unbalanced, which can result in sub-optimal test efﬁciency. [sent-23, score-0.369]
</p><p>16 This leads to a novel label tree learning technique that is more efﬁcient and effective. [sent-25, score-0.592]
</p><p>17 2  Related Work  Our approach is directly motivated by the label tree embedding technique proposed by Bengio et al. [sent-27, score-0.696]
</p><p>18 in [1], which is among the few approaches that address sublinear testing cost for multi-class classiﬁcation problems with a large number of classes and has been shown to outperform alternative approaches including Filter Tree [2] and Conditional Probability Tree(CPT) [3]. [sent-28, score-0.347]
</p><p>19 Our contribution is a new technique to achieve more efﬁcient and effective learning for label trees. [sent-29, score-0.259]
</p><p>20 Classifying a large number of object classes has received increasing attention in computer vision as datasets with many classes such as ImageNet [7] become available. [sent-31, score-0.452]
</p><p>21 In particular, it has been observed that object classes can be organized in a tree-like structure both semantically and visually [9, 11, 6], making tree based approaches especially attractive. [sent-34, score-0.578]
</p><p>22 Our work follows this direction, focusing on effective learning methods for building tree models. [sent-35, score-0.333]
</p><p>23 Here we brieﬂy review the label tree learning technique proposed by Bengio et al. [sent-40, score-0.663]
</p><p>24 A label tree is a tree T = (V, E) with nodes V and edges E. [sent-42, score-0.897]
</p><p>25 Each node r ∈ V is associated with a set of class labels κ(r) ⊆ {1, . [sent-43, score-0.286]
</p><p>26 For each child c, there is a linear classiﬁer wc ∈ RD and we require that its label set is a subset of its parent’s, that is, κ(c) ⊆ κ(r), ∀c ∈ σ(r). [sent-48, score-0.455]
</p><p>27 We travel from the root until we reach a leaf node, at each node following the child that has the largest classiﬁer score. [sent-50, score-0.543]
</p><p>28 There is a slight difference than the algorithm in [1] in that the leaf node is not required to have only one class label. [sent-51, score-0.308]
</p><p>29 Algorithm 1 Predict the class of x given the root node r s ← r. [sent-53, score-0.315]
</p><p>30 Learning the tree structure is a fundamentally hard problem because brute force search for the optimal combination of tree structure and classiﬁer weights is intractable. [sent-55, score-0.722]
</p><p>31 [1] instead propose to solve two subproblems: learning the tree structure and learning the classiﬁer weights. [sent-57, score-0.365]
</p><p>32 To learn the tree structure, K one versus all classiﬁers are trained ﬁrst to obtain a confusion matrix C ∈ RK×K on a validation set. [sent-58, score-0.451]
</p><p>33 The class labels are then clustered into disjoint sets by spectral clustering with the confusion between classes as afﬁnity measure. [sent-59, score-0.546]
</p><p>34 Given the tree structure, all classiﬁer weights are then learned jointly to optimize the misclassiﬁcation loss of the tree. [sent-61, score-0.475]
</p><p>35 We ﬁrst analyze the cost of learning by showing that training, with m examples, K classes and D dimensional feature, costs O(mDK). [sent-62, score-0.346]
</p><p>36 It can be difﬁcult to learn a classiﬁer for disjoint subsets when examples of certain classes cannot be reliably classiﬁed to one subset. [sent-73, score-0.311]
</p><p>37 In addition, spectral clustering does not guarantee balanced clusters and thus cannot ensure a desired speedup. [sent-76, score-0.294]
</p><p>38 However, as shown in [1], improperly partitioning the classes can greatly reduce testing accuracy and efﬁciency. [sent-82, score-0.39]
</p><p>39 To preserve accuracy, it is important to split the classes such that they can be easily separated. [sent-83, score-0.254]
</p><p>40 By allowing overlapping splits and explicitly modeling the accuracy and efﬁciency trade-off, this approach also improves testing accuracy and efﬁciency. [sent-87, score-0.417]
</p><p>41 Our approach processes one node of the tree a time, starting with the root node. [sent-88, score-0.589]
</p><p>42 It partitions the classes into a ﬁxed number of child nodes and learns the classiﬁer weights for each of the children. [sent-89, score-0.585]
</p><p>43 In learning a tree model, accuracy and efﬁciency are inherently conﬂicting goals and some trade-off must be made. [sent-91, score-0.459]
</p><p>44 1  Main optimization  Formally, let the current node r represent classes labels κ(r) = {1, . [sent-111, score-0.465]
</p><p>45 The goal is to determine: (1)a partition matrix P ∈ {0, 1}Q×K that represents the assignment of classes to the children, i. [sent-115, score-0.268]
</p><p>46 Pqk = 1 if class label k appear in child q and Pqk = 0 otherwise; (2)the classiﬁer weights w ∈ RD×Q , where a column wq is the classiﬁer weights for child q ∈ σ(r), We measure accuracy by examining whether an example is classiﬁed to the correct child, i. [sent-117, score-0.99]
</p><p>47 Let q = arg maxq∈σ(r) wq x be the child that x follows. [sent-124, score-0.288]
</p><p>48 Given w, P, x, y, the classiﬁcation ˆ 3  loss at the current node r is then L(w, x, y, P ) = 1 − P (ˆ, y). [sent-125, score-0.227]
</p><p>49 q (1) Note that the ﬁnal prediction of the example is made at a leaf node further down the tree, if the child to follow is not already a leaf node. [sent-126, score-0.536]
</p><p>50 Efﬁciency is maximized when each child has a minimal number of class labels so that an unambiguous prediction can be made, otherwise we incur further cost for traveling down the tree. [sent-130, score-0.407]
</p><p>51 Given a test example, we deﬁne ambiguity as our efﬁciency measure, i. [sent-131, score-0.288]
</p><p>52 the size of label set of the child that the example follows, relative to its parent’s size. [sent-133, score-0.405]
</p><p>53 Speciﬁcally, given w and P , the ambiguity for an example x is 1 K  A(w, x, P ) =  K  P (ˆ, k). [sent-134, score-0.252]
</p><p>54 A perfectly balanced K-nary tree would result in an ambiguity of 1/K for all examples at each node. [sent-136, score-0.823]
</p><p>55 , m, we seek to minimize the average ambiguity of all examples while keeping the classiﬁcation loss below , which leads to the following optimization problem: OP1. [sent-146, score-0.416]
</p><p>56 We do not require that the children cover all the classes in the parent. [sent-150, score-0.328]
</p><p>57 It is legal that one class in the parent can be assigned to none of the children, in which case we give up on the training examples from the class. [sent-151, score-0.267]
</p><p>58 This is different from the disjoint label sets in [1]. [sent-159, score-0.245]
</p><p>59 2  Learning classiﬁer weights w given partitions P  Observe that ﬁxing P and optimizing over w is similar to learning a multi-class classiﬁer except for ˜ the overlapping classes. [sent-166, score-0.233]
</p><p>60 Here Ai is the set of children that contain class yi and Bi is the rest of the children. [sent-169, score-0.241]
</p><p>61 Q  minimize λ w  wq  2 2  +  q=1  1 m  m  ˜ L(w, xi , yi , P ) i=1  Note that here the objective is no longer the ambiguity A. [sent-175, score-0.418]
</p><p>62 When the partition P is ﬁxed, w can lower A by classifying examples into the child with the smallest label set. [sent-177, score-0.557]
</p><p>63 Note that the ambiguity is a quantity in [0, 1] and K is the number of classes. [sent-208, score-0.252]
</p><p>64 Therefore for large numbers of classes the rounded solution is almost optimal. [sent-209, score-0.31]
</p><p>65 We summarize the algorithm for building one level of tree nodes in Algorithm 2. [sent-216, score-0.372]
</p><p>66 Note that each training example only affects classiﬁers on one path of the tree, hence the training cost is O(mD log K) for a balanced tree. [sent-218, score-0.462]
</p><p>67 Algorithm 2 Grow a single node r Input: Q, and training examples classiﬁed into node r by its ancestors. [sent-219, score-0.497]
</p><p>68 For each child, randomly pick one class label from the parent, without replacement. [sent-221, score-0.283]
</p><p>69 A solution P can be computed within polynom 1 mial time such that L(P ) ≤ L∗ + maxk ψk , where ψk = m i=1 1(yi = k), is the percentage of training examples from class k. [sent-235, score-0.315]
</p><p>70 i=1 m For uniform distribution of examples among classes, maxk ψk = 1/K and the rounded solution is near optimal for large K. [sent-242, score-0.229]
</p><p>71 One simple workaround is to split the big classes into artiﬁcial subclasses or treat the classes in the tail as one big class, to “equalize” the distribution. [sent-244, score-0.493]
</p><p>72 2M images from 1k classes for training, 50k images for validation and 150k images for test. [sent-249, score-0.257]
</p><p>73 We compare our algorithm with the original label tree learning method by Bengio et al. [sent-257, score-0.596]
</p><p>74 For both algorithms, we ﬁx two parameters, the number of children Q for each node, and the maximum depth H of the tree. [sent-259, score-0.246]
</p><p>75 The depth of each node is deﬁned as the maximum distance to the root(the root 6  Ours [1]  Acc% 11. [sent-260, score-0.381]

</p><p>77 Test speedup is the onevs-all test cost divided by the label tree test cost. [sent-279, score-0.711]
</p><p>78 [1] approach by achieving comparable or better accuracy and efﬁciency, with less training cost, compared with the training cost for Bengio et al. [sent-281, score-0.472]
</p><p>79 2) measured at different depth levels for all trees on the ILSVRC2010 test set(1k classes). [sent-321, score-0.239]
</p><p>80 Our trees are more balanced as efﬁciency is explicitly enforced by capping the ambiguity throughout all levels. [sent-324, score-0.55]
</p><p>81 We require every internal node to split into Q children, with two exceptions: nodes at depth H − 1(parent of leaves) and nodes with fewer than Q classes. [sent-326, score-0.425]
</p><p>82 We use TQ,H to denote a tree built with parameters Q and H. [sent-330, score-0.333]
</p><p>83 We set Q and H such that for a well balanced tree, the number of leaf nodes QH approximate the number of classes K. [sent-331, score-0.507]
</p><p>84 We evaluate the global classiﬁcation accuracy and computational cost in both training and test. [sent-332, score-0.305]
</p><p>85 For instance, running SGD one-versus-all(either independent or single machine SVMs [5]) for K classes costs 2K per example for going through data once, as in each iteration all K classiﬁers are evaluated against the feature vector(dot product) and updated(addition). [sent-338, score-0.263]
</p><p>86 For both algorithms, we build three trees T32,2 , T10,3 , T6,4 for the ILSVRC2010 1k classes and build one tree T101,2 for ImageNet10K classes. [sent-339, score-0.618]
</p><p>87 After forming the tree skeleton by spectral clustering using confusion matrix from the validation set, we learn the weights by solving a joint optimization(see [1]) with two passes of parallel SGD. [sent-343, score-0.65]
</p><p>88 To set the efﬁciency constraint, we measure the average (local) ambiguity of the root node of the tree generated by the Bengio et al. [sent-348, score-0.912]
</p><p>89 We use it as our ambiguity cap throughout our learning, in an attempt to produce a similarly structured tree. [sent-350, score-0.295]
</p><p>90 The results show that for all types of trees, our method achieves comparable or signiﬁcantly better accuracy while achieving better speed-up with much less training cost, even after excluding the 1-versus-all training in Bengio et al. [sent-352, score-0.418]
</p><p>91 The reason is that at depth 1(one level down from root), the splits became highly imbalanced and does not shrink the class sets faster enough until the height limit is reached. [sent-356, score-0.233]
</p><p>92 7  Figure 1: Comparison of partition matrices(32 × 1000) of the root node of T32,2 for our approach(top) and the Bengio et al. [sent-361, score-0.388]
</p><p>93 Figure 2: Paths of the tree T6,4 taken by two test examples. [sent-366, score-0.369]
</p><p>94 almost constant average ambiguity at each level, as enforced in learning. [sent-368, score-0.285]
</p><p>95 This shows an advantage of our algorithm since we are able to explicitly enforce balanced tree while in Bengio et al. [sent-369, score-0.591]
</p><p>96 [1] no such control is possible, although spectral clustering encourages balanced splits. [sent-370, score-0.294]
</p><p>97 The columns are ordered by a depth ﬁrst search of the WordNet tree so that neighboring columns are likely to be semantic similar classes. [sent-373, score-0.488]
</p><p>98 showed in [1] that optimizing the classiﬁers on the tree jointly is significantly better than independently training the classiﬁers for each node, as it encodes the dependency of the classiﬁers along a tree path. [sent-379, score-0.844]
</p><p>99 6  Conclusion  We have presented a novel approach to efﬁciently learn a label tree for large scale classiﬁcation with many classes, allowing ﬁne grained efﬁciency-accuracy tradeoff. [sent-382, score-0.568]

<p>Author: Flavio Chierichetti, David Liben-nowell, Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the spread of on-line information in general and on-line petitions in particular, recent research has raised the following combinatorial estimation problem. There is a tree T that we cannot observe directly (representing the structure along which the information has spread), and certain nodes randomly decide to make their copy of the information public. In the case of a petition, the list of names on each public copy of the petition also reveals a path leading back to the root of the tree. What can we conclude about the properties of the tree we observe from these revealed paths, and can we use the structure of the observed tree to estimate the size of the full unobserved tree T ? Here we provide the ﬁrst algorithm for this size estimation task, together with provable guarantees on its performance. We also establish structural properties of the observed tree, providing the ﬁrst rigorous explanation for some of the unusual structural phenomena present in the spread of real chain-letter petitions on the Internet. 1</p><p>3 0.17221884 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Projection_onto_A_Nonnegative_Max-Heap.html">226 nips-2011-Projection onto A Nonnegative Max-Heap</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Liu, Liang Sun, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean projection of a vector of length p onto a non-negative max-heap—an ordered tree where the values of the nodes are all nonnegative and the value of any parent node is no less than the value(s) of its child node(s). This Euclidean projection plays a building block role in the optimization problem with a non-negative maxheap constraint. Such a constraint is desirable when the features follow an ordered tree structure, that is, a given feature is selected for the given regression/classiﬁcation task only if its parent node is selected. In this paper, we show that such Euclidean projection problem admits an analytical solution and we develop a top-down algorithm where the key operation is to ﬁnd the so-called maximal root-tree of the subtree rooted at each node. A naive approach for ﬁnding the maximal root-tree is to enumerate all the possible root-trees, which, however, does not scale well.

<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.16868839 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Tree_of_Metrics_with_Disjoint_Visual_Features.html">151 nips-2011-Learning a Tree of Metrics with Disjoint Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha, Sung J. Hwang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to learn discriminative visual representations while exploiting external semantic knowledge about object category relationships. Given a hierarchical taxonomy that captures semantic similarity between the objects, we learn a corresponding tree of metrics (ToM). In this tree, we have one metric for each non-leaf node of the object hierarchy, and each metric is responsible for discriminating among its immediate subcategory children. Speciﬁcally, a Mahalanobis metric learned for a given node must satisfy the appropriate (dis)similarity constraints generated only among its subtree members’ training instances. To further exploit the semantics, we introduce a novel regularizer coupling the metrics that prefers a sparse disjoint set of features to be selected for each metric relative to its ancestor (supercategory) nodes’ metrics. Intuitively, this reﬂects that visual cues most useful to distinguish the generic classes (e.g., feline vs. canine) should be different than those cues most useful to distinguish their component ﬁne-grained classes (e.g., Persian cat vs. Siamese cat). We validate our approach with multiple image datasets using the WordNet taxonomy, show its advantages over alternative metric learning approaches, and analyze the meaning of attribute features selected by our algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.16806351 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Category_Structure_Aware_Image_Categorization.html">141 nips-2011-Large-Scale Category Structure Aware Image Categorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Fabio Vitale, Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: Predicting the nodes of a given graph is a fascinating theoretical problem with applications in several domains. Since graph sparsiﬁcation via spanning trees retains enough information while making the task much easier, trees are an important special case of this problem. Although it is known how to predict the nodes of an unweighted tree in a nearly optimal way, in the weighted case a fully satisfactory algorithm is not available yet. We ﬁll this hole and introduce an efﬁcient node predictor, S HAZOO, which is nearly optimal on any weighted tree. Moreover, we show that S HAZOO can be viewed as a common nontrivial generalization of both previous approaches for unweighted trees and weighted lines. Experiments on real-world datasets conﬁrm that S HAZOO performs well in that it fully exploits the structure of the input tree, and gets very close to (and sometimes better than) less scalable energy minimization methods. 1</p><p>3 0.73521364 <a title="96-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Reconstructing_Patterns_of_Information_Diffusion_from_Incomplete_Observations.html">234 nips-2011-Reconstructing Patterns of Information Diffusion from Incomplete Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Flavio Chierichetti, David Liben-nowell, Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the spread of on-line information in general and on-line petitions in particular, recent research has raised the following combinatorial estimation problem. There is a tree T that we cannot observe directly (representing the structure along which the information has spread), and certain nodes randomly decide to make their copy of the information public. In the case of a petition, the list of names on each public copy of the petition also reveals a path leading back to the root of the tree. What can we conclude about the properties of the tree we observe from these revealed paths, and can we use the structure of the observed tree to estimate the size of the full unobserved tree T ? Here we provide the ﬁrst algorithm for this size estimation task, together with provable guarantees on its performance. We also establish structural properties of the observed tree, providing the ﬁrst rigorous explanation for some of the unusual structural phenomena present in the spread of real chain-letter petitions on the Internet. 1</p><p>4 0.73184407 <a title="96-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Projection_onto_A_Nonnegative_Max-Heap.html">226 nips-2011-Projection onto A Nonnegative Max-Heap</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Liu, Liang Sun, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of computing the Euclidean projection of a vector of length p onto a non-negative max-heap—an ordered tree where the values of the nodes are all nonnegative and the value of any parent node is no less than the value(s) of its child node(s). This Euclidean projection plays a building block role in the optimization problem with a non-negative maxheap constraint. Such a constraint is desirable when the features follow an ordered tree structure, that is, a given feature is selected for the given regression/classiﬁcation task only if its parent node is selected. In this paper, we show that such Euclidean projection problem admits an analytical solution and we develop a top-down algorithm where the key operation is to ﬁnd the so-called maximal root-tree of the subtree rooted at each node. A naive approach for ﬁnding the maximal root-tree is to enumerate all the possible root-trees, which, however, does not scale well. We reveal several important properties of the maximal root-tree, based on which we design a bottom-up algorithm with merge for eﬃciently ﬁnding the maximal roottree. The proposed algorithm has a (worst-case) linear time complexity for a sequential list, and O(p2 ) for a general tree.

<p>Author: Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Modern classiﬁcation tasks usually involve many class labels and can be informed by a broad range of features. Many of these tasks are tackled by constructing a set of classiﬁers, which are then applied at test time and then pieced together in a ﬁxed procedure determined in advance or at training time. We present an active classiﬁcation process at the test time, where each classiﬁer in a large ensemble is viewed as a potential observation that might inform our classiﬁcation process. Observations are then selected dynamically based on previous observations, using a value-theoretic computation that balances an estimate of the expected classiﬁcation gain from each observation as well as its computational cost. The expected classiﬁcation gain is computed using a probabilistic model that uses the outcome from previous observations. This active classiﬁcation process is applied at test time for each individual test instance, resulting in an efﬁcient instance-speciﬁc decision path. We demonstrate the beneﬁt of the active scheme on various real-world datasets, and show that it can achieve comparable or even higher classiﬁcation accuracy at a fraction of the computational costs of traditional methods.</p><p>6 0.66272467 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Optimistic_Optimization_of_a_Deterministic_Function_without_the_Knowledge_of_its_Smoothness.html">208 nips-2011-Optimistic Optimization of a Deterministic Function without the Knowledge of its Smoothness</a></p>

<p>Author: Qian Sun, Rita Chattopadhyay, Sethuraman Panchanathan, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative learning when training and test data belong to different distributions is a challenging and complex task. Often times we have very few or no labeled data from the test or target distribution but may have plenty of labeled data from multiple related sources with different distributions. The difference in distributions may be both in marginal and conditional probabilities. Most of the existing domain adaptation work focuses on the marginal probability distribution difference between the domains, assuming that the conditional probabilities are similar. However in many real world applications, conditional probability distribution differences are as commonplace as marginal probability differences. In this paper we propose a two-stage domain adaptation methodology which combines weighted data from multiple sources based on marginal probability differences (ﬁrst stage) as well as conditional probability differences (second stage), with the target domain data. The weights for minimizing the marginal probability differences are estimated independently, while the weights for minimizing conditional probability differences are computed simultaneously by exploiting the potential interaction among multiple sources. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the generalization performance of the proposed multi-source domain adaptation formulation using the weighted Rademacher complexity measure. Empirical comparisons with existing state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods using three real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>2 0.92075741 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Penalty_Decomposition_Methods_for_Rank_Minimization.html">211 nips-2011-Penalty Decomposition Methods for Rank Minimization</a></p>

We ﬁrst show that a class of matrix optimization problems can be solved as lower dimensional vector optimization problems. As a consequence, we establish that a class of rank minimization problems have closed form solutions. Using this result, we then propose penalty decomposition methods for general rank minimization problems. The convergence results of the PD methods have been shown in the longer version of the paper [19]. Finally, we test the performance of our methods by applying them to matrix completion and nearest low-rank correlation matrix problems. The computational results demonstrate that our methods generally outperform the existing methods in terms of solution quality and/or speed. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90552783 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Fast_and_Balanced%3A_Efficient_Label_Tree_Learning_for_Large_Scale_Object_Recognition.html">96 nips-2011-Fast and Balanced: Efficient Label Tree Learning for Large Scale Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Olivier Delalleau, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the representational power of sum-product networks (computation networks analogous to neural networks, but whose individual units compute either products or weighted sums), through a theoretical analysis that compares deep (multiple hidden layers) vs. shallow (one hidden layer) architectures. We prove there exist families of functions that can be represented much more efﬁciently with a deep network than with a shallow one, i.e. with substantially fewer hidden units. Such results were not available until now, and contribute to motivate recent research involving learning of deep sum-product networks, and more generally motivate research in Deep Learning. 1 Introduction and prior work Many learning algorithms are based on searching a family of functions so as to identify one member of said family which minimizes a training criterion. The choice of this family of functions and how members of that family are parameterized can be a crucial one. Although there is no universally optimal choice of parameterization or family of functions (or “architecture”), as demonstrated by the no-free-lunch results [37], it may be the case that some architectures are appropriate (or inappropriate) for a large class of learning tasks and data distributions, such as those related to Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) tasks [4]. Different families of functions have different characteristics that can be appropriate or not depending on the learning task of interest. One of the characteristics that has spurred much interest and research in recent years is depth of the architecture. In the case of a multi-layer neural network, depth corresponds to the number of (hidden and output) layers. A ﬁxedkernel Support Vector Machine is considered to have depth 2 [4] and boosted decision trees to have depth 3 [7]. Here we use the word circuit or network to talk about a directed acyclic graph, where each node is associated with some output value which can be computed based on the values associated with its predecessor nodes. The arguments of the learned function are set at the input nodes of the circuit (which have no predecessor) and the outputs of the function are read off the output nodes of the circuit. Different families of functions correspond to different circuits and allowed choices of computations in each node. Learning can be performed by changing the computation associated with a node, or rewiring the circuit (possibly changing the number of nodes). The depth of the circuit is the length of the longest path in the graph from an input node to an output node. Deep Learning algorithms [3] are tailored to learning circuits with variable depth, typically greater than depth 2. They are based on the idea of multiple levels of representation, with the intuition that the raw input can be represented at different levels of abstraction, with more abstract features of the input or more abstract explanatory factors represented by deeper circuits. These algorithms are often based on unsupervised learning, opening the door to semi-supervised learning and efﬁcient 1 use of large quantities of unlabeled data [3]. Analogies with the structure of the cerebral cortex (in particular the visual cortex) [31] and similarities between features learned with some Deep Learning algorithms and those hypothesized in the visual cortex [17] further motivate investigations into deep architectures. It has been suggested that deep architectures are more powerful in the sense of being able to more efﬁciently represent highly-varying functions [4, 3]. In this paper, we measure “efﬁciency” in terms of the number of computational units in the network. An efﬁcient representation is important mainly because: (i) it uses less memory and is faster to compute, and (ii) given a ﬁxed amount of training samples and computational power, better generalization is expected. The ﬁrst successful algorithms for training deep architectures appeared in 2006, with efﬁcient training procedures for Deep Belief Networks [14] and deep auto-encoders [13, 27, 6], both exploiting the general idea of greedy layer-wise pre-training [6]. Since then, these ideas have been investigated further and applied in many settings, demonstrating state-of-the-art learning performance in object recognition [16, 28, 18, 15] and segmentation [20], audio classiﬁcation [19, 10], natural language processing [9, 36, 21, 32], collaborative ﬁltering [30], modeling textures [24], modeling motion [34, 33], information retrieval [29, 26], and semi-supervised learning [36, 22]. Poon and Domingos [25] introduced deep sum-product networks as a method to compute partition functions of tractable graphical models. These networks are analogous to traditional artiﬁcial neural networks but with nodes that compute either products or weighted sums of their inputs. Analogously to neural networks, we deﬁne “hidden” nodes as those nodes that are neither input nodes nor output nodes. If the nodes are organized in layers, we deﬁne the “hidden” layers to be those that are neither the input layer nor the output layer. Poon and Domingos [25] report experiments with networks much deeper (30+ hidden layers) than those typically used until now, e.g. in Deep Belief Networks [14, 3], where the number of hidden layers is usually on the order of three to ﬁve. Whether such deep architectures have theoretical advantages compared to so-called “shallow” architectures (i.e. those with a single hidden layer) remains an open question. After all, in the case of a sum-product network, the output value can always be written as a sum of products of input variables (possibly raised to some power by allowing multiple connections from the same input), and consequently it is easily rewritten as a shallow network with a sum output unit and product hidden units. The argument supported by our theoretical analysis is that a deep architecture is able to compute some functions much more efﬁciently than a shallow one. Until recently, very few theoretical results supported the idea that deep architectures could present an advantage in terms of representing some functions more efﬁciently. Most related results originate from the analysis of boolean circuits (see e.g. [2] for a review). Well-known results include the proof that solving the n-bit parity task with a depth-2 circuit requires an exponential number of gates [1, 38], and more generally that there exist functions computable with a polynomial-size depthk circuit that would require exponential size when restricted to depth k − 1 [11]. Another recent result on boolean circuits by Braverman [8] offers proof of a longstanding conjecture, showing that bounded-depth boolean circuits are unable to distinguish some (non-uniform) input distributions from the uniform distribution (i.e. they are “fooled” by such input distributions). In particular, Braverman’s result suggests that shallow circuits can in general be fooled more easily than deep ones, i.e., that they would have more difﬁculty efﬁciently representing high-order dependencies (those involving many input variables). It is not obvious that circuit complexity results (that typically consider only boolean or at least discrete nodes) are directly applicable in the context of typical machine learning algorithms such as neural networks (that compute continuous representations of their input). Orponen [23] surveys theoretical results in computational complexity that are relevant to learning algorithms. For instance, H˚ stad and Goldmann [12] extended some results to the case of networks of linear threshold units a with positivity constraints on the weights. Bengio et al. [5, 7] investigate, respectively, complexity issues in networks of Gaussian radial basis functions and decision trees, showing intrinsic limitations of these architectures e.g. on tasks similar to the parity problem. Utgoff and Stracuzzi [35] informally discuss the advantages of depth in boolean circuit in the context of learning architectures. Bengio [3] suggests that some polynomials could be represented more efﬁciently by deep sumproduct networks, but without providing any formal statement or proofs. This work partly addresses this void by demonstrating families of circuits for which a deep architecture can be exponentially more efﬁcient than a shallow one in the context of real-valued polynomials. Note that we do not address in this paper the problem of learning these parameters: even if an efﬁcient deep representation exists for the function we seek to approximate, in general there is no 2 guarantee for standard optimization algorithms to easily converge to this representation. This paper focuses on the representational power of deep sum-product circuits compared to shallow ones, and studies it by considering particular families of target functions (to be represented by the learner). We ﬁrst formally deﬁne sum-product networks. We consider two families of functions represented by deep sum-product networks (families F and G). For each family, we establish a lower bound on the minimal number of hidden units a depth-2 sum-product network would require to represent a function of this family, showing it is much less efﬁcient than the deep representation. 2 Sum-product networks Deﬁnition 1. A sum-product network is a network composed of units that either compute the product of their inputs or a weighted sum of their inputs (where weights are strictly positive). Here, we restrict our deﬁnition of the generic term “sum-product network” to networks whose summation units have positive incoming weights1 , while others are called “negative-weight” networks. Deﬁnition 2. A “negative-weight“ sum-product network may contain summation units whose weights are non-positive (i.e. less than or equal to zero). Finally, we formally deﬁne what we mean by deep vs. shallow networks in the rest of the paper. Deﬁnition 3. A “shallow“ sum-product network contains a single hidden layer (i.e. a total of three layers when counting the input and output layers, and a depth equal to two). Deﬁnition 4. A “deep“ sum-product network contains more than one hidden layer (i.e. a total of at least four layers, and a depth at least three). The family F 3 3.1 Deﬁnition The ﬁrst family of functions we study, denoted by F, is made of functions built from deep sumproduct networks that alternate layers of product and sum units with two inputs each (details are provided below). The basic idea we use here is that composing layers (i.e. using a deep architecture) is equivalent to using a factorized representation of the polynomial function computed by the network. Such a factorized representation can be exponentially more compact than its expansion as a sum of products (which can be associated to a shallow network with product units in its hidden layer and a sum unit as output). This is what we formally show in what follows. + ℓ2 = λ11ℓ1 + µ11ℓ1 = x1x2 + x3x4 = f (x1, x2, x3, x4) 2 1 1 λ11 = 1 µ11 = 1 × ℓ1 = x1x2 1 x1 x2 × ℓ1 = x3x4 2 x3 x4 Figure 1: Sum-product network computing the function f ∈ F such that i = λ11 = µ11 = 1. Let n = 4i , with i a positive integer value. Denote by ℓ0 the input layer containing scalar variables {x1 , . . . , xn }, such that ℓ0 = xj for 1 ≤ j ≤ n. Now deﬁne f ∈ F as any function computed by a j sum-product network (deep for i ≥ 2) composed of alternating product and sum layers: • ℓ2k+1 = ℓ2k · ℓ2k for 0 ≤ k ≤ i − 1 and 1 ≤ j ≤ 22(i−k)−1 2j−1 2j j • ℓ2k = λjk ℓ2k−1 + µjk ℓ2k−1 for 1 ≤ k ≤ i and 1 ≤ j ≤ 22(i−k) j 2j 2j−1 where the weights λjk and µjk of the summation units are strictly positive. The output of the network is given by f (x1 , . . . , xn ) = ℓ2i ∈ R, the unique unit in the last layer. 1 The corresponding (shallow) network for i = 1 and additive weights set to one is shown in Figure 1 1 This condition is required by some of the proofs presented here. 3 (this architecture is also the basic building block of bigger networks for i > 1). Note that both the input size n = 4i and the network’s depth 2i increase with parameter i. 3.2 Theoretical results The main result of this section is presented below in Corollary 1, providing a lower bound on the minimum number of hidden units required by a shallow sum-product network to represent a function f ∈ F. The high-level proof sketch consists in the following steps: (1) Count the number of unique products found in the polynomial representation of f (Lemma 1 and Proposition 1). (2) Show that the only possible architecture for a shallow sum-product network to compute f is to have a hidden layer made of product units, with a sum unit as output (Lemmas 2 to 5). (3) Conclude that the number of hidden units must be at least the number of unique products computed in step 3.2 (Lemma 6 and Corollary 1). Lemma 1. Any element ℓk can be written as a (positively) weighted sum of products of input varij ables, such that each input variable xt is used in exactly one unit of ℓk . Moreover, the number mk of products found in the sum computed by ℓk does not depend on j and obeys the following recurrence j rule for k ≥ 0: if k + 1 is odd, then mk+1 = m2 , otherwise mk+1 = 2mk . k Proof. We prove the lemma by induction on k. It is obviously true for k = 0 since ℓ0 = xj . j Assuming this is true for some k ≥ 0, we consider two cases: k+1 k • If k + 1 is odd, then ℓj = ℓk 2j−1 · ℓ2j . By the inductive hypothesis, it is the product of two (positively) weighted sums of products of input variables, and no input variable can k appear in both ℓk 2j−1 and ℓ2j , so the result is also a (positively) weighted sum of products k of input variables. Additionally, if the number of products in ℓk 2j−1 and ℓ2j is mk , then 2 mk+1 = mk , since all products involved in the multiplication of the two units are different (since they use disjoint subsets of input variables), and the sums have positive weights. Finally, by the induction assumption, an input variable appears in exactly one unit of ℓk . This unit is an input to a single unit of ℓk+1 , that will thus be the only unit of ℓk+1 where this input variable appears. k • If k + 1 is even, then ℓk+1 = λjk ℓk 2j−1 + µjk ℓ2j . Again, from the induction assumption, it j must be a (positively) weighted sum of products of input variables, but with mk+1 = 2mk such products. As in the previous case, an input variable will appear in the single unit of ℓk+1 that has as input the single unit of ℓk in which this variable must appear. 2i Proposition 1. The number of products in the sum computed in the output unit l1 of a network √ n−1 . computing a function in F is m2i = 2 Proof. We ﬁrst prove by induction on k ≥ 1 that for odd k, mk = 22 k 22 1+1 2 2 k+1 2 −2 , and for even k, . This is obviously true for k = 1 since 2 = 2 = 1, and all units in ℓ1 are mk = 2 single products of the form xr xs . Assuming this is true for some k ≥ 1, then: −1 0 −2 • if k + 1 is odd, then from Lemma 1 and the induction assumption, we have: mk+1 = m2 = k 2 k 22 2 −1 k +1 = 22 2 • if k + 1 is even, then instead we have: mk+1 = 2mk = 2 · 22 k+1 2 −2 −2 = 22 = 22 (k+1)+1 2 (k+1) 2 −2 −1 which shows the desired result for k + 1, and thus concludes the induction proof. Applying this result with k = 2i (which is even) yields 2i m2i = 22 2 −1 √ =2 4 22i −1 √ =2 n−1 . 2i Lemma 2. The products computed in the output unit l1 can be split in two groups, one with products containing only variables x1 , . . . , x n and one containing only variables x n +1 , . . . , xn . 2 2 Proof. This is obvious since the last unit is a “sum“ unit that adds two terms whose inputs are these two groups of variables (see e.g. Fig. 1). 2i Lemma 3. The products computed in the output unit l1 involve more than one input variable. k Proof. It is straightforward to show by induction on k ≥ 1 that the products computed by lj all involve more than one input variable, thus it is true in particular for the output layer (k = 2i). Lemma 4. Any shallow sum-product network computing f ∈ F must have a “sum” unit as output. Proof. By contradiction, suppose the output unit of such a shallow sum-product network is multiplicative. This unit must have more than one input, because in the case that it has only one input, the output would be either a (weighted) sum of input variables (which would violate Lemma 3), or a single product of input variables (which would violate Proposition 1), depending on the type (sum or product) of the single input hidden unit. Thus the last unit must compute a product of two or more hidden units. It can be re-written as a product of two factors, where each factor corresponds to either one hidden unit, or a product of multiple hidden units (it does not matter here which speciﬁc factorization is chosen among all possible ones). Regardless of the type (sum or product) of the hidden units involved, those two factors can thus be written as weighted sums of products of variables xt (with positive weights, and input variables potentially raised to powers above one). From Lemma 1, both x1 and xn must be present in the ﬁnal output, and thus they must appear in at least one of these two factors. Without loss of generality, assume x1 appears in the ﬁrst factor. Variables x n +1 , . . . , xn then cannot be present in the second factor, since otherwise one product in the output 2 would contain both x1 and one of these variables (this product cannot cancel out since weights must be positive), violating Lemma 2. But with a similar reasoning, since as a result xn must appear in the ﬁrst factor, variables x1 , . . . , x n cannot be present in the second factor either. Consequently, no 2 input variable can be present in the second factor, leading to the desired contradiction. Lemma 5. Any shallow sum-product network computing f ∈ F must have only multiplicative units in its hidden layer. Proof. By contradiction, suppose there exists a “sum“ unit in the hidden layer, written s = t∈S αt xt with S the set of input indices appearing in this sum, and αt > 0 for all t ∈ S. Since according to Lemma 4 the output unit must also be a sum (and have positive weights according to Deﬁnition 1), then the ﬁnal output will also contain terms of the form βt xt for t ∈ S, with βt > 0. This violates Lemma 3, establishing the contradiction. Lemma 6. Any shallow negative-weight sum-product network (see Deﬁnition 2) computing f ∈ F √ must have at least 2 n−1 hidden units, if its output unit is a sum and its hidden units are products. Proof. Such a network computes a weighted sum of its hidden units, where each hidden unit is a γ product of input variables, i.e. its output can be written as Σj wj Πt xt jt with wj ∈ R and γjt ∈ {0, 1}. In order to compute a function in F, this shallow network thus needs a number of hidden units at least equal to the number of unique products in that function. From Proposition 1, this √ number is equal to 2 n−1 . √ Corollary 1. Any shallow sum-product network computing f ∈ F must have at least 2 units. n−1 hidden Proof. This is a direct corollary of Lemmas 4 (showing the output unit is a sum), 5 (showing that hidden units are products), and 6 (showing the desired result for any shallow network with this speciﬁc structure – regardless of the sign of weights). 5 3.3 Discussion Corollary 1 above shows that in order to compute some function in F with n inputs, the number of √ √ units in a shallow network has to be at least 2 n−1 , (i.e. grows exponentially in n). On another hand, the total number of units in the deep (for i > 1) network computing the same function, as described in Section 3.1, is equal to 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + . . . + 22i−1 (since all units are binary), which is √ also equal to 22i − 1 = n − 1 (i.e. grows only quadratically in n). It shows that some deep sumproduct network with n inputs and depth O(log n) can represent with O(n) units what would √ require O(2 n ) units for a depth-2 network. Lemma 6 also shows a similar result regardless of the sign of the weights in the summation units of the depth-2 network, but assumes a speciﬁc architecture for this network (products in the hidden layer with a sum as output). 4 The family G In this section we present similar results with a different family of functions, denoted by G. Compared to F, one important difference of deep sum-product networks built to deﬁne functions in G is that they can vary their input size independently of their depth. Their analysis thus provides additional insight when comparing the representational efﬁciency of deep vs. shallow sum-product networks in the case of a ﬁxed dataset. 4.1 Deﬁnition Networks in family G also alternate sum and product layers, but their units have as inputs all units from the previous layer except one. More formally, deﬁne the family G = ∪n≥2,i≥0 Gin of functions represented by sum-product networks, where the sub-family Gin is made of all sum-product networks with n input variables and 2i + 2 layers (including the input layer ℓ0 ), such that: 1. ℓ1 contains summation units; further layers alternate multiplicative and summation units. 2. Summation units have positive weights. 3. All layers are of size n, except the last layer ℓ2i+1 that contains a single sum unit that sums all units in the previous layer ℓ2i . k−1 4. In each layer ℓk for 1 ≤ k ≤ 2i, each unit ℓk takes as inputs {ℓm |m = j}. j An example of a network belonging to G1,3 (i.e. with three layers and three input variables) is shown in Figure 2. ℓ3 = x2 + x2 + x2 + 3(x1x2 + x1x3 + x2x3) = g(x1, x2, x3) 3 2 1 1 + ℓ2 = x2 + x1x2 × 1 1 +x1x3 + x2x3 ℓ1 = x2 + x3 1 × ℓ2 = . . . 2 × ℓ2 = x2 + x1x2 3 3 +x1x3 + x2x3 + + ℓ1 = x1 + x3 2 + ℓ1 = x1 + x2 3 x1 x2 x3 Figure 2: Sum-product network computing a function of G1,3 (summation units’ weights are all 1’s). 4.2 Theoretical results The main result is stated in Proposition 3 below, establishing a lower bound on the number of hidden units of a shallow sum-product network computing g ∈ G. The proof sketch is as follows: 1. We show that the polynomial expansion of g must contain a large set of products (Proposition 2 and Corollary 2). 2. We use both the number of products in that set as well as their degree to establish the desired lower bound (Proposition 3). 6 We will also need the following lemma, which states that when n − 1 items each belong to n − 1 sets among a total of n sets, then we can associate to each item one of the sets it belongs to without using the same set for different items. Lemma 7. Let S1 , . . . , Sn be n sets (n ≥ 2) containing elements of {P1 , . . . , Pn−1 }, such that for any q, r, |{r|Pq ∈ Sr }| ≥ n − 1 (i.e. each element Pq belongs to at least n − 1 sets). Then there exist r1 , . . . , rn−1 different indices such that Pq ∈ Srq for 1 ≤ q ≤ n − 1. Proof. Omitted due to lack of space (very easy to prove by construction). Proposition 2. For any 0 ≤ j ≤ i, and any product of variables P = Πn xαt such that αt ∈ N and t=1 t j 2j whose computed value, when expanded as a weighted t αt = (n − 1) , there exists a unit in ℓ sum of products, contains P among these products. Proof. We prove this proposition by induction on j. First, for j = 0, this is obvious since any P of this form must be made of a single input variable xt , that appears in ℓ0 = xt . t Suppose now the proposition is true for some j < i. Consider a product P = Πn xαt such that t=1 t αt ∈ N and t αt = (n − 1)j+1 . P can be factored in n − 1 sub-products of degree (n − 1)j , β i.e. written P = P1 . . . Pn−1 with Pq = Πn xt qt , βqt ∈ N and t βqt = (n − 1)j for all q. By t=1 the induction hypothesis, each Pq can be found in at least one unit ℓ2j . As a result, by property 4 kq (in the deﬁnition of family G), each Pq will also appear in the additive layer ℓ2j+1 , in at least n − 1 different units (the only sum unit that may not contain Pq is the one that does not have ℓ2j as input). kq By Lemma 7, we can thus ﬁnd a set of units ℓ2j+1 such that for any 1 ≤ q ≤ n − 1, the product rq Pq appears in ℓ2j+1 , with indices rq being different from each other. Let 1 ≤ s ≤ n be such that rq 2(j+1) s = rq for all q. Then, from property 4 of family G, the multiplicative unit ℓs computes the n−1 2j+1 product Πq=1 ℓrq , and as a result, when expanded as a sum of products, it contains in particular P1 . . . Pn−1 = P . The proposition is thus true for j + 1, and by induction, is true for all j ≤ i. Corollary 2. The output gin of a sum-product network in Gin , when expanded as a sum of products, contains all products of variables of the form Πn xαt such that αt ∈ N and t αt = (n − 1)i . t=1 t Proof. Applying Proposition 2 with j = i, we obtain that all products of this form can be found in the multiplicative units of ℓ2i . Since the output unit ℓ2i+1 computes a sum of these multiplicative 1 units (weighted with positive weights), those products are also present in the output. Proposition 3. A shallow negative-weight sum-product network computing gin ∈ Gin must have at least (n − 1)i hidden units. Proof. First suppose the output unit of the shallow network is a sum. Then it may be able to compute gin , assuming we allow multiplicative units in the hidden layer in the hidden layer to use powers of their inputs in the product they compute (which we allow here for the proof to be more generic). However, it will require at least as many of these units as the number of unique products that can be found in the expansion of gin . In particular, from Corollary 2, it will require at least the number n of unique tuples of the form (α1 , . . . , αn ) such that αt ∈ N and t=1 αt = (n − 1)i . Denoting ni dni = (n − 1)i , this number is known to be equal to n+dni −1 , and it is easy to verify it is higher d than (or equal to) dni for any n ≥ 2 and i ≥ 0. Now suppose the output unit is multiplicative. Then there can be no multiplicative hidden unit, otherwise it would mean one could factor some input variable xt in the computed function output: this is not possible since by Corollary 2, for any variable xt there exist products in the output function that do not involve xt . So all hidden units must be additive, and since the computed function contains products of degree dni , there must be at least dni such hidden units. 7 4.3 Discussion Proposition 3 shows that in order to compute the same function as gin ∈ Gin , the number of units in the shallow network has to grow exponentially in i, i.e. in the network’s depth (while the deep network’s size grows linearly in i). The shallow network also needs to grow polynomially in the number of input variables n (with a degree equal to i), while the deep network grows only linearly in n. It means that some deep sum-product network with n inputs and depth O(i) can represent with O(ni) units what would require O((n − 1)i ) units for a depth-2 network. Note that in the similar results found for family F, the depth-2 network computing the same function as a function in F had to be constrained to either have a speciﬁc combination of sum and hidden units (in Lemma 6) or to have non-negative weights (in Corollary 1). On the contrary, the result presented here for family G holds without requiring any of these assumptions. 5 Conclusion We compared a deep sum-product network and a shallow sum-product network representing the same function, taken from two families of functions F and G. For both families, we have shown that the number of units in the shallow network has to grow exponentially, compared to a linear growth in the deep network, so as to represent the same functions. The deep version thus offers a much more compact representation of the same functions. This work focuses on two speciﬁc families of functions: ﬁnding more general parameterization of functions leading to similar results would be an interesting topic for future research. Another open question is whether it is possible to represent such functions only approximately (e.g. up to an error bound ǫ) with a much smaller shallow network. Results by Braverman [8] on boolean circuits suggest that similar results as those presented in this paper may still hold, but this topic has yet to be formally investigated in the context of sum-product networks. A related problem is also to look into functions deﬁned only on discrete input variables: our proofs do not trivially extend to this situation because we cannot assume anymore that two polynomials yielding the same output values must have the same expansion coefﬁcients (since the number of input combinations becomes ﬁnite).

<p>Author: Mona Eberts, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We prove a new oracle inequality for support vector machines with Gaussian RBF kernels solving the regularized least squares regression problem. To this end, we apply the modulus of smoothness. With the help of the new oracle inequality we then derive learning rates that can also be achieved by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method. Finally, it turns out that our learning rates are asymptotically optimal for regression functions satisfying certain standard smoothness conditions. 1</p><p>6 0.78628826 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">53 nips-2011-Co-Training for Domain Adaptation</a></p>

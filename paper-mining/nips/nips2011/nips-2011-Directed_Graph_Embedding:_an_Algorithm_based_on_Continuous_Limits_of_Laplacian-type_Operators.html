Perrault-joncas, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of embedding directed graphs in Euclidean space while retaining directional information. We model the observed graph as a sample from a manifold endowed with a vector ﬁeld, and we design an algorithm that separates and recovers the features of this process: the geometry of the manifold, the data density and the vector ﬁeld. The algorithm is motivated by our analysis of Laplacian-type operators and their continuous limit as generators of diffusions on a manifold. We illustrate the recovery algorithm on both artiﬁcially constructed and real data. 1 Motivation Recent advances in graph embedding and visualization have focused on undirected graphs, for which the graph Laplacian properties make the analysis particularly elegant [1, 2]. However, there is an important number of graph data, such as social networks, alignment scores between biological sequences, and citation data, which are naturally asymmetric. A commonly used approach for this type of data is to disregard the asymmetry by studying the spectral properties of W +W T or W T W , where W is the afﬁnity matrix of the graph. Some approaches have been offered to preserve the asymmetry information contained in data: [3], [4], [5] or to deﬁne directed Laplacian operators [6]. Although quite successful, these works adopt a purely graph-theoretical point of view. Thus, they are not concerned with the generative process that produces the graph, nor with the interpretability and statistical properties of their algorithms. In contrast, we view the nodes of a directed graph as a ﬁnite sample from a manifold in Euclidean space, and the edges as macroscopic observations of a diffusion kernel between neighboring points on the manifold. We explore how this diffusion kernel determines the overall connectivity and asymmetry of the resulting graph and demonstrate how Laplacian-type operators of this graph can offer insights into the underlying generative process. Based on the analysis of the Laplacian-type operators, we derive an algorithm that, in the limit of inﬁnite sample and vanishing bandwidth, recovers the key features of the sampling process: manifold geometry, sampling distribution, and local directionality, up to their intrinsic indeterminacies. 2 Model The ﬁrst premise here is that we observe a directed graph G, with n nodes, having weights W = [Wij ] for the edge from node i to node j. In following with common Laplacian-based embedding approaches, we assume that G is a geometric random graph constructed from n points sampled according to distribution p = e−U on an unobserved compact smooth manifold M ⊆ Rl of known intrinsic dimension d ≤ l. The edge weight Wij is then determined by a directed similarity kernel k (xi , xj ) with bandwidth . The directional component of k (xi , xj ) will be taken to be derived 1 from a vector ﬁeld r on M, which assigns a preferred direction between weights Wij and Wji . The choice of a vector ﬁeld r to characterize the directional component of G might seem restrictive at ﬁrst. In the asymptotic limit of → 0 and n → ∞ however, kernels are characterized by their diffusion, drift, and source components [7]. As such, r is sufﬁcient to characterize any directionality associated with a drift component and as it turns out, the component of r normal M in Rl can also be use to characterize any source component. As for the diffusion component, it is not possible to uniquely identify it from G alone [8]. Some absolute knownledge of M is needed to say anything about it. Hence, without loss of generality, we will construct k (xi , xj ) so that the diffusion component ends being isotropic and constant, i.e. equal to Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ on M. The schematic of this generative process is shown in the top left of Figure 1 below. From left to right: the graph generative process mapping the sample on M to geometric random graph G via the kernel k (x, y), then the subsequent embedding (α) Ψn of G by operators Haa,n , (α) Hss,n (deﬁned in section 3.1). As these operators converge to (α) their respective limits, Haa and (α) Hss , so will Ψn → Ψ, pn → p, and rn → r. We design an algorithm that, given G, produces the top right embedding (Ψn , pn , and rn ). Figure 1: Schematic of our framework. The question is then as follows: can the generative process’ geometry M, distribution p = e−U , and directionality r, be recovered from G? In other words, is there an embedding of G in Rm , m ≥ d that approximates all three components of the process and that is also consistent as sample size increases and the bandwidth vanishes? In the case of undirected graphs, the theory of Laplacian eigenmaps [1] and Diffusion maps [9] answers this question in the afﬁrmative, in that the geometry of M and p = e−U can be inferred using spectral graph theory. The aim here is to build on the undirected problem and recover all three components of the generative process from a directed graph G. The spectral approach to undirected graph embedding relies on the fact that eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are known to preserve the local geometry of M [1]. With a consistent empirical Laplace-Beltrami operator based on G, its eigenvectors also recover the geometry of M and converge to the corresponding eigenfunctions on M. For a directed graph G, an additional operator is needed to recover the local directional component r, but the principle remains the same. (α) The schematic for this is shown in Figure 1 where two operators - Hss,n , introduced in [9] for (α) undirected embeddings, and Haa,n , a new operator deﬁned in section 3.1 - are used to obtain the (α) (α) (α) embedding Ψn , distribution pn , and vector ﬁeld rn . As Haa,n and Hss,n converge to Haa and (α) Hss , Ψn , pn , and rn also converge to Ψ, p, and r, where Ψ is the local geometry preserving the embedding of M into Rm . (α) The algorithm we propose in Section 4 will calculate the matrices corresponding to H·,n from the graph G, and with their eigenvectors, will ﬁnd estimates for the node coordinates Ψ, the directional component r, and the sampling distribution p. In the next section we brieﬂy describe the mathematical models of the diffusion processes that our model relies on. 2 2.1 Problem Setting The similarity kernel k (x, y) can be used to deﬁne transport operators on M. The natural transport operator is deﬁned by normalizing k (x, y) as T [f ](x) = M k (x, y) f (y)p(y)dy , where p (x) = p (x) k (x, y)p(y)dy . (1) M T [f ](x) represents the diffusion of a distribution f (y) by the transition density k (x, y)p(y)/ k (x, y )p(y )dy . The eigenfunctions of this inﬁnitesimal operator are the continuous limit of the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix P = D−1 W given by normalizing the afﬁnity matrix W of G by D = diag(W 1) [10]. Meanwhile, the inﬁnitesimal transition ∂f (T − I)f = lim (2) →0 ∂t deﬁnes the backward equation for this diffusion process over M based on kernel k . Obtaining the explicit expression for transport operators like (2) is then the main technical challenge. 2.2 Choice of Kernel In order for T [f ] to have the correct asymptotic form, some hypotheses about the similarity kernel k (x, y) are required. The hypotheses are best presented by considering the decomposition of k (x, y) into symmetric h (x, y) = h (y, x) and anti-symmetric a (x, y) = −a (y, x) components: k (x, y) = h (x, y) + a (x, y) . (3) The symmetric component h (x, y) is assumed to satisfy the following properties: 1. h (||y − 2 x||2 ) = h(||y−x|| / ) , and 2. h ≥ 0 and h is exponentially decreasing as ||y − x|| → ∞. This form d/2 of symmetric kernel was used in [9] to analyze the diffusion map. For the asymmetric part of the similarity kernel, we assume the form a (x, y) = r(x, y) h(||y − x||2 / ) · (y − x) , d/2 2 (4) with r(x, y) = r(y, x) so that a (x, y) = −a (y, x). Here r(x, y) is a smooth vector ﬁeld on the manifold that gives an orientation to the asymmetry of the kernel k (x, y). It is worth noting that the dependence of r(x, y) on both x and y implies that r : M × M → Rl with Rl the ambient space of M; however in the asymptotic limit, the dependence in y is only important “locally” (x = y), and as such it is appropriate to think of r(x, x) being a vector ﬁeld on M. As a side note, it is worth pointing out that even though the form of a (x, y) might seem restrictive at ﬁrst, it is sufﬁciently rich to describe any vector ﬁeld . This can be seen by taking r(x, y) = (w(x) + w(y))/2 so that at x = y the resulting vector ﬁeld is given by r(x, x) = w(x) for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld w(x). 3 Continuous Limit of Laplacian Type Operators We are now ready to state the main asymptotic result. Proposition 3.1 Let M be a compact, closed, smooth manifold of dimension d and k (x, y) an asymmetric similarity kernel satisfying the conditions of section 2.2, then for any function f ∈ C 2 (M), the integral operator based on k has the asymptotic expansion k (x, y)f (y)dy = m0 f (x) + g(f (x), x) + o( ) , (5) M where g(f (x), x) = and m0 = Rd m2 (ω(x)f (x) + ∆f (x) + r · 2 h(||u||2 )du, m2 = Rd u2 h(||u||2 )du. i 3 f (x) + f (x) · r + c(x)f (x)) (6) The proof can be found in [8] along with the deﬁnition of ω(x) and c(x) in (6). For now, it sufﬁces to say that ω(x) corresponds to an interaction between the symmetric kernel h and the curvature of M and was ﬁrst derived in [9]. Meanwhile, c(x) is a new term that originates from the interaction between h and the component of r that is normal to M in the ambient space Rl . Proposition 3.1 foreshadows a general fact about spectral embedding algorithms: in most cases, Laplacian operators confound the effects of spatial proximity, sampling density and directional ﬂow due to the presence of the various terms above. 3.1 Anisotropic Limit Operators Proposition 3.1 above can be used to derive the limits of a variety of Laplacian type operators associated with spectral embedding algorithms like [5, 6, 3]. Although we will focus primarily on a few operators that give the most insight into the generative process and enable us to recover the model deﬁned in Figure 1, we ﬁrst present four distinct families of operators for completeness. These operator families are inspired by the anisotropic family of operators that [9] introduced for undirected graphs, which make use of anisotropic kernels of the form: k (α) (x, y) = k (x, y) pα (x)pα (y) , (7) with α ∈ [0, 1] where α = 0 is the isotropic limit. To normalize the anisotropic kernels, we need (α) (α) (α) as p (x) = M k (x, y)p(y)dy. From (7), four to redeﬁne the outdegrees distribution of k families of diffusion processes of the form ft = H (α) [f ](x) can be derived depending on which kernel is normalized and which outdegree distribution is used for the normalization. Speciﬁcally, (α) (α) we deﬁne transport operators by normalizing the asymmetric k or symmetric h kernels with the 1 asymmetric p or symmetric q = M h (x, y)p(y)dy outdegree distribution . To keep track of all options, we introduce the following notation: the operators will be indexed by the type of kernel and outdegree distribution they correspond to (symmetric or asymmetric), with the ﬁrst index identifying the kernel and the second index identifying the outdegree distribution. For example, the family of anisotropic limit operators introduced by [9] is deﬁned by normalizing the symmetric kernel by (α) the symmetric outdegree distribution, hence they will be denoted as Hss , with the superscript corresponding to the anisotropic power α. Proposition 3.2 With the above notation, (α) Haa [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · f + r· f (α) Has [f ] (α) Hsa [f ] (α) Hss [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2(1 − α) U · (8) f − cf + (α − 1)(r · U )f − ( · r + (α − 1)r · f + (c + f. U )f · r)f + r · f (9) (10) (11) The proof of this proposition, which can be found in [8], follows from repeated application of Proposition 3.1 to p(y) or q(y) and then to k α (x, y) or hα (x, y), as well as the fact that p1 = α 1 p−α [1 − α (ω + ∆p p + 2r · p p +2 · r + c)] + o( ). (α) Thus, if we use the asymmetric k and p , we get Haa , deﬁned by the advected diffusion equa(α) tion (8). In general, Haa is not hermitian, so it commonly has complex eigenvectors. This makes (1) embedding directed graphs with this operator problematic. Nevertheless, Haa will play an important role in extracting the directionality of the sampling process. If we use the symmetric kernel h but the asymmetric outdegree distribution p , we get the family (α) of operators Hsa , of which the WCut of [3] is a special case (α = 0). If we reverse the above, i.e. (α) (α) (α) use k and q , we obtain Has . This turns out to be merely a combination of Haa and Hsa . 1 The reader may notice that there are in fact eight possible combinations of kernel and degree distribution, since the anisotripic kernel (7) could also be deﬁned using a symmetric or asymmetric outdegree distribution. However, there are only four distinct asymptotic results and they are all covered by using one kernel (symmetric or asymmetric) and one degree distribution (symmetric or asymmetric) throughout. 4 Algorithm 1 Directed Embedding Input: Afﬁnity matrix Wi,j and embedding dimension m, (m ≥ d) 1.

Columns 2 to m + 1 of R are the vector ﬁeld components in the direction of the corresponding coordinates of the embedding. (α) Finally, if we only consider the symmetric kernel h and degree distribution q , we recover Hss , the anisotropic kernels of [9] for symmetric graphs. This operator for α = 1 is shown to separate the manifold from the probability distribution [11] and will be used as part of our recovery algorithm. Isolating the Vector Field r 4 Our aim is to esimate the manifold M, the density distribution p = e−U , and the vector ﬁeld r. The (1) ﬁrst two components of the data can be recovered from Hss as shown in [11] and summarized in Algorithm 1. At this juncture, one feature of generative process is missing: the vector ﬁeld r. The natural approach (α) (α) for recovering r is to isolate the linear operator r · from Haa by substracting Hss : (α) (α) Haa − Hss = r · . (12) The advantage of recovering r in operator form as in (12) is that r · is coordinate free. In other words, as long as the chosen embedding of M is diffeomorphic to M2 , (12) can be used to express the component of r that lies in the tangent space T M, which we denote by r|| . Speciﬁcally, let Ψ be a diffeomorphic embedding of M ; the component of r along coordinate ψk is then given by r · ψk = rk , and so, in general, r|| = r · Ψ. (13) The subtle point that only r|| is recovered from (13) follows from the fact that the operator r · only deﬁned along M and hence any directional derivative is necessarily along T M. is Equation (13) and the previous observations are the basis for Algorithm 1, which recovers the three important features of the generative process for an asymmetric graph with afﬁnity matrix W . A similar approach can be employed to recover c + · r, or simply · r if r has no component perpendicular to the tangent space T M (meaning that c ≡ 0). Recovering c + · r is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that (1) (1) (Hsa − Hss ) = (c + 2 · r) , (14) (1) A diffeomorphic embedding is guaranteed by using the eigendecomposition of Hss . 5 (1) (1) which is a diagonal operator. Taking into account that for ﬁnite n (Hsa,n − Hss,n ) is not perfectly (1) (1) diagonal, using ψn ≡ 1n (vector of ones), i.e. (Hsa,n − Hss,n )[1n ] = (cn + · rn ), has been found (1) (1) empirically to be more stable than simply extracting the diagonal of (Hsa,n − Hss,n ). 5 Experiments Artiﬁcial Data For illustrative purposes, we begin by applying our method to an artiﬁcial example. We use the planet Earth as a manifold with a topographic density distribution, where sampling probability is proportional to elevation. We also consider two vector ﬁelds: the ﬁrst is parallel to the line of constant latitude and purely tangential to the sphere, while the second is parallel to the line of constant longitude with a component of the vector ﬁeld perpendicular to the manifold. The true model with constant latitude vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 2, along with the estimated density and vector ﬁeld projected on the true manifold (sphere). Model Recovered Latitudinal (a) Longitudinal (b) Figure 2: (a): Sphere with latitudinal vector ﬁeld, i.e East-West asymmetry, with Wew > Wwe if node w lies to the West of node e. The graph nodes are sampled non-uniformly, with the topographic map of the world as sampling density. We sample n = 5000 nodes, and observe only the resulting W matrix, but not the node locations. From W , our algorithm estimates the sample locations (geometry), the vector ﬁeld (black arrows) generating the observed asymmetries, and the sampling distribution at each data point (colormap). (b) Vector ﬁelds on a spherical region (blue), and their estimates (red): latitudinal vector ﬁeld tangent to the manifold (left) and longitudinal vector ﬁeld with component perpendicular to manifold tangent plane (right). Both the estimated density and vector ﬁeld agree with the true model, demonstrating that for artiﬁcial data, the recovery algorithm 1 performs quite well. We note that the estimated density does not recover all the details of the original density, even for large sample size (here n = 5000 with = 0.07). Meanwhile, the estimated vector ﬁeld performs quite well even when the sampling is reduced to n = 500 with = 0.1. This can be seen in Figure 2, b, where the true and estimated vector ﬁelds are superimposed. Figure 2 also demonstrates how r · only recovers the tangential component of r. The estimated geometry is not shown on any of these ﬁgures, since the success of the diffusion map in recovering the geometry for such a simple manifold is already well established [2, 9]. Real DataThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 Cohort is a representative sample of young men and women in the United States who were followed from 1979 to 2000 [12, 13]. The aim here is to use this survey to obtain a representation of the job market as a diffusion process over a manifold. The data set consists of a sample of 7,816 individual career sequences of length 64, listing the jobs a particular individual held every quarter between the ages of 20 and 36. Each token in the sequence identiﬁes a job. Each job corresponds to an industry × occupation pair. There are 25 unique industry and 20 unique occupation indices. Out of the 500 possible pairings, approximately 450 occur in the data, with only 213 occurring with sufﬁcient frequency to be included here. Thus, our graph G has 213 nodes - the jobs - and our observations consist of 7,816 walks between the graph nodes. We convert these walks to a directed graph with afﬁnity matrix W . Speciﬁcally, Wij represents the number of times a transition from job i to job j was observed (Note that this matrix is asymmetric, 6 i.e Wij = Wji ). Normalizing each row i of W by its outdegree di gives P = diag(di )−1 W , the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov chain over G for the progression (0) of career sequences. This Markov chain has as limit operator Haa , as the granularity of the job market increases along with the number of observations. Thus, in trying to recover the geometry, distribution and vector ﬁeld, we are actually interested in estimating the full advective effect of the (0) diffusion process generated by Haa ; that is, we want to estimate r · − 2 U · where we can use (0) (1) −2 U · = Hss − Hss to complement Algorithm 1. 0.25 1600 0.05 0.1 1400 0.1 3 0.7 1800 0.15 ! 0.8 0.15 0.2 0.9 0.2 2000 0.25 !30.05 0.6 0.5 0 0 0.4 1200 −0.05 −0.05 −0.1 0.3 −0.1 1000 0.2 −0.15 −0.15 800 −0.2 −0.25 0.1 −0.2 −0.25 −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (a) −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (b) Figure 3: Embedding the job market along with ﬁeld r − 2 U over the ﬁrst two non-constant eigenvectors. The color map corresponds to the mean monthly wage in dollars (a) and to the female proportion (b) for each job. We obtain an embedding of the job market that describes the relative position of jobs, their distribution, and the natural time progression from each job. Of these, the relative position and natural time progression are the most interesting. Together, they summarize the job market dynamics by describing which jobs are naturally “close” as well as where they can lead in the future. From a public policy perspective, this can potentially improve focus on certain jobs for helping individuals attain better upward mobility. The job market was found to be a high dimensional manifold. We present only the ﬁrst two dimen(0) sions, that is, the second and third eigenvectors of Hss , since the ﬁrst eigenvector is uninformative (constant) by construction. The eigenvectors showed correlation with important demographic data, such as wages and gender. Figure 3 displays this two-dimensional sub-embedding along with the directional information r − 2 U for each dimension. The plot shows very little net progression toward regions of increasing mean salary3 . This is somewhat surprising, but it is easy to overstate this observation: diffusion alone would be enough to move the individuals towards higher salary. What Figure 3 (a) suggests is that there appear to be no “external forces” advecting individuals towards higher salary. Nevertheless, there appear to be other external forces at play in the job market: Figure 3 (b), which is analogous to Figure 3 (a), but with gender replacing the salary color scheme, suggests that these forces push individuals towards greater gender differentiation. This is especially true amongst male-dominated jobs which appear to be advected toward the left edge of the embedding. Hence, this simple analysis of the job market can be seen as an indication that males and females tend to move away from each other over time, while neither seems to have a monopoly on high- or low- paying jobs. 6 Discussion This paper makes three contributions: (1) it introduces a manifold-based generative model for directed graphs with weighted edges, (2) it obtains asymptotic results for operators constructed from the directed graphs, and (3) these asymptotic results lead to a natural algorithm for estimating the model. 3 It is worth noting that in the NLSY data set, high paying jobs are teacher, nurse and mechanic. This is due to the fact that the career paths observed stop at at age 36, which is relatively early in an individual’s career. 7 Generative Models that assume that data are sampled from a manifold are standard for undirected graphs, but to our knowledge, none have yet been proposed for directed graphs. When W is symmetric, it is natural to assume that it depends on the points’ proximity. For asymmetric afﬁnities W , one must include an additional component to explain the asymmetry. In the asymptotic limit, this is tantamount to deﬁning a vector ﬁeld on the manifold. Algorithm We have used from [9] the idea of deﬁning anisotropic kernels (indexed by α) in order to separate the density p and the manifold geometry M. Also, we adopted their general assumptions about the symmetric part of the kernel. As a consequence, the recovery algorithm for p and M is identical to theirs. However, insofar as the asymmetric part of the kernel is concerned, everything, starting from the deﬁnition and the introduction of the vector ﬁeld r as a way to model the asymmetry, through the derivation of the asymptotic expression for the symmetric plus asymmetric kernel, is new. We go signiﬁcantly beyond the elegant idea of [9] regarding the use of anisotropic kernels by analyzing the four distinct renormalizations possible for a given α, each of them combining different aspects of M, p and r. Only the successful (and novel) combination of two different anisotropic operators is able to recover the directional ﬂow r. Algorithm 1 is natural, but we do not claim it is the only possible one in the context of our model. (α) For instance, we can also use Hsa to recover the operator · r (which empirically seems to have worse numerical properties than r · ). In the National Longitudinal Survery of Youth study, we were interested in the whole advective term, so we estimated it from a different combination of operators. Depending on the speciﬁc question, other features of the model could be obtained Limit Results Proposition 3.1 is a general result on the asymptotics of asymmetric kernels. Recovering the manifold and r is just one, albeit the most useful, of the many ways of exploiting these (0) results. For instance, Hsa is the limit operator of the operators used in [3] and [5]. The limit analysis could be extended to other digraph embedding algorithms such as [4, 6]. How general is our model? Any kernel can be decomposed into a symmetric and an asymmetric part, as we have done. The assumptions on the symmetric part h are standard. The paper of [7] goes one step further from these assumptions; we will discuss it in relationship with our work shortly. The more interesting question is how limiting are our assumptions regarding the choice of kernel, especially the asymmetric part, which we parameterized as a (x, y) = r/2 · (y − x)h (x, y) in (4). In the asymptotic limit, this choice turns out to be fully general, at least up to the identiﬁable aspects of the model. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see [8]. In [7], Ting, Huang and Jordan presented asymptotic results for a general family of kernels that includes asymmetric and random kernels. Our k can be expressed in the notation of [7] by taking wx (y) ← 1+r(x, y)·(y−x), rx (y) ← 1, K0 ← h, h ← . Their assumptions are more general than the assumptions we make here, yet our model is general up to what can be identiﬁed from G alone. The distinction arises because [7] focuses on the graph construction methods from an observed sample of M, while we focus on explaining an observed directed graph G through a manifold generative process. Moreover, while the [7] results can be used to analyze data from directed graphs, they differ from our Proposition 3.1. Speciﬁcally, with respect to the limit in Theorem 3 from [7], we obtain the additional source terms f (x) · r and c(x)f (x) that follow from not enforcing (α) (α) conservation of mass while deﬁning operators Hsa and Has . We applied our theory of directed graph embedding to the analysis of the career sequences in Section 5, but asymmetric afﬁnity data abound in other social contexts, and in the physical and life sciences. Indeed, any “similarity” score that is obtained from a likelihood of the form Wvu =likelihood(u|v) is generally asymmetric. Hence our methods can be applied to study not only social networks, but also patterns of human movement, road trafﬁc, and trade relations, as well as alignment scores in molecular biology. Finally, the physical interpretation of our model also makes it naturally applicable to physical models of ﬂows.

[sent-6, score-0.594]
</p><p>2 We model the observed graph as a sample from a manifold endowed with a vector ﬁeld, and we design an algorithm that separates and recovers the features of this process: the geometry of the manifold, the data density and the vector ﬁeld. [sent-7, score-0.547]
</p><p>3 The algorithm is motivated by our analysis of Laplacian-type operators and their continuous limit as generators of diffusions on a manifold. [sent-8, score-0.367]
</p><p>4 1  Motivation  Recent advances in graph embedding and visualization have focused on undirected graphs, for which the graph Laplacian properties make the analysis particularly elegant [1, 2]. [sent-10, score-0.504]
</p><p>5 Some approaches have been offered to preserve the asymmetry information contained in data: [3], [4], [5] or to deﬁne directed Laplacian operators [6]. [sent-13, score-0.54]
</p><p>6 In contrast, we view the nodes of a directed graph as a ﬁnite sample from a manifold in Euclidean space, and the edges as macroscopic observations of a diffusion kernel between neighboring points on the manifold. [sent-16, score-0.829]
</p><p>7 We explore how this diffusion kernel determines the overall connectivity and asymmetry of the resulting graph and demonstrate how Laplacian-type operators of this graph can offer insights into the underlying generative process. [sent-17, score-0.996]
</p><p>8 Based on the analysis of the Laplacian-type operators, we derive an algorithm that, in the limit of inﬁnite sample and vanishing bandwidth, recovers the key features of the sampling process: manifold geometry, sampling distribution, and local directionality, up to their intrinsic indeterminacies. [sent-18, score-0.338]
</p><p>9 2  Model  The ﬁrst premise here is that we observe a directed graph G, with n nodes, having weights W = [Wij ] for the edge from node i to node j. [sent-19, score-0.383]
</p><p>10 In following with common Laplacian-based embedding approaches, we assume that G is a geometric random graph constructed from n points sampled according to distribution p = e−U on an unobserved compact smooth manifold M ⊆ Rl of known intrinsic dimension d ≤ l. [sent-20, score-0.485]
</p><p>11 The edge weight Wij is then determined by a directed similarity kernel k (xi , xj ) with bandwidth . [sent-21, score-0.375]
</p><p>12 The directional component of k (xi , xj ) will be taken to be derived 1  from a vector ﬁeld r on M, which assigns a preferred direction between weights Wij and Wji . [sent-22, score-0.233]
</p><p>13 The choice of a vector ﬁeld r to characterize the directional component of G might seem restrictive at ﬁrst. [sent-23, score-0.233]
</p><p>14 In the asymptotic limit of → 0 and n → ∞ however, kernels are characterized by their diffusion, drift, and source components [7]. [sent-24, score-0.217]
</p><p>15 As for the diffusion component, it is not possible to uniquely identify it from G alone [8]. [sent-26, score-0.241]
</p><p>16 Hence, without loss of generality, we will construct k (xi , xj ) so that the diffusion component ends being isotropic and constant, i. [sent-28, score-0.304]
</p><p>17 From left to right: the graph generative process mapping the sample on M to geometric random graph G via the kernel k (x, y), then the subsequent embedding (α) Ψn of G by operators Haa,n , (α) Hss,n (deﬁned in section 3. [sent-32, score-0.896]
</p><p>18 As these operators converge to (α) their respective limits, Haa and (α) Hss , so will Ψn → Ψ, pn → p, and rn → r. [sent-34, score-0.29]
</p><p>19 We design an algorithm that, given G, produces the top right embedding (Ψn , pn , and rn ). [sent-35, score-0.245]
</p><p>20 The question is then as follows: can the generative process’ geometry M, distribution p = e−U , and directionality r, be recovered from G? [sent-37, score-0.287]
</p><p>21 In other words, is there an embedding of G in Rm , m ≥ d that approximates all three components of the process and that is also consistent as sample size increases and the bandwidth vanishes? [sent-38, score-0.27]
</p><p>22 In the case of undirected graphs, the theory of Laplacian eigenmaps [1] and Diffusion maps [9] answers this question in the afﬁrmative, in that the geometry of M and p = e−U can be inferred using spectral graph theory. [sent-39, score-0.356]
</p><p>23 The aim here is to build on the undirected problem and recover all three components of the generative process from a directed graph G. [sent-40, score-0.545]
</p><p>24 The spectral approach to undirected graph embedding relies on the fact that eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are known to preserve the local geometry of M [1]. [sent-41, score-0.715]
</p><p>25 With a consistent empirical Laplace-Beltrami operator based on G, its eigenvectors also recover the geometry of M and converge to the corresponding eigenfunctions on M. [sent-42, score-0.408]
</p><p>26 For a directed graph G, an additional operator is needed to recover the local directional component r, but the principle remains the same. [sent-43, score-0.683]
</p><p>27 (α) The schematic for this is shown in Figure 1 where two operators - Hss,n , introduced in [9] for (α) undirected embeddings, and Haa,n , a new operator deﬁned in section 3. [sent-44, score-0.474]
</p><p>28 1 - are used to obtain the (α) (α) (α) embedding Ψn , distribution pn , and vector ﬁeld rn . [sent-45, score-0.278]
</p><p>29 As Haa,n and Hss,n converge to Haa and (α) Hss , Ψn , pn , and rn also converge to Ψ, p, and r, where Ψ is the local geometry preserving the embedding of M into Rm . [sent-46, score-0.344]
</p><p>30 (α)  The algorithm we propose in Section 4 will calculate the matrices corresponding to H·,n from the graph G, and with their eigenvectors, will ﬁnd estimates for the node coordinates Ψ, the directional component r, and the sampling distribution p. [sent-47, score-0.414]
</p><p>31 In the next section we brieﬂy describe the mathematical models of the diffusion processes that our model relies on. [sent-48, score-0.241]
</p><p>32 1  Problem Setting  The similarity kernel k (x, y) can be used to deﬁne transport operators on M. [sent-50, score-0.473]
</p><p>33 The natural transport operator is deﬁned by normalizing k (x, y) as T [f ](x) = M  k (x, y) f (y)p(y)dy , where p (x) = p (x)  k (x, y)p(y)dy . [sent-51, score-0.247]
</p><p>34 (1)  M  T [f ](x) represents the diffusion of a distribution f (y) by the transition density k (x, y)p(y)/ k (x, y )p(y )dy . [sent-52, score-0.306]
</p><p>35 The eigenfunctions of this inﬁnitesimal operator are the continuous limit of the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix P = D−1 W given by normalizing the afﬁnity matrix W of G by D = diag(W 1) [10]. [sent-53, score-0.384]
</p><p>36 Meanwhile, the inﬁnitesimal transition ∂f (T − I)f = lim (2) →0 ∂t deﬁnes the backward equation for this diffusion process over M based on kernel k . [sent-54, score-0.383]
</p><p>37 Obtaining the explicit expression for transport operators like (2) is then the main technical challenge. [sent-55, score-0.329]
</p><p>38 2  Choice of Kernel  In order for T [f ] to have the correct asymptotic form, some hypotheses about the similarity kernel k (x, y) are required. [sent-57, score-0.229]
</p><p>39 This form d/2 of symmetric kernel was used in [9] to analyze the diffusion map. [sent-62, score-0.463]
</p><p>40 For the asymmetric part of the similarity kernel, we assume the form a (x, y) =  r(x, y) h(||y − x||2 / ) · (y − x) , d/2 2  (4)  with r(x, y) = r(y, x) so that a (x, y) = −a (y, x). [sent-63, score-0.31]
</p><p>41 Here r(x, y) is a smooth vector ﬁeld on the manifold that gives an orientation to the asymmetry of the kernel k (x, y). [sent-64, score-0.403]
</p><p>42 1 Let M be a compact, closed, smooth manifold of dimension d and k (x, y) an asymmetric similarity kernel satisfying the conditions of section 2. [sent-70, score-0.585]
</p><p>43 For now, it sufﬁces to say that ω(x) corresponds to an interaction between the symmetric kernel h and the curvature of M and was ﬁrst derived in [9]. [sent-73, score-0.222]
</p><p>44 1 foreshadows a general fact about spectral embedding algorithms: in most cases, Laplacian operators confound the effects of spatial proximity, sampling density and directional ﬂow due to the presence of the various terms above. [sent-76, score-0.725]
</p><p>45 1 above can be used to derive the limits of a variety of Laplacian type operators associated with spectral embedding algorithms like [5, 6, 3]. [sent-79, score-0.531]
</p><p>46 Although we will focus primarily on a few operators that give the most insight into the generative process and enable us to recover the model deﬁned in Figure 1, we ﬁrst present four distinct families of operators for completeness. [sent-80, score-0.687]
</p><p>47 These operator families are inspired by the anisotropic family of operators that [9] introduced for undirected graphs, which make use of anisotropic kernels of the form: k (α) (x, y) =  k (x, y) pα (x)pα (y)  ,  (7)  with α ∈ [0, 1] where α = 0 is the isotropic limit. [sent-81, score-0.913]
</p><p>48 From (7), four to redeﬁne the outdegrees distribution of k families of diffusion processes of the form ft = H (α) [f ](x) can be derived depending on which kernel is normalized and which outdegree distribution is used for the normalization. [sent-83, score-0.54]
</p><p>49 Speciﬁcally, (α) (α) we deﬁne transport operators by normalizing the asymmetric k or symmetric h kernels with the 1 asymmetric p or symmetric q = M h (x, y)p(y)dy outdegree distribution . [sent-84, score-1.375]
</p><p>50 To keep track of all options, we introduce the following notation: the operators will be indexed by the type of kernel and outdegree distribution they correspond to (symmetric or asymmetric), with the ﬁrst index identifying the kernel and the second index identifying the outdegree distribution. [sent-85, score-0.79]
</p><p>51 For example, the family of anisotropic limit operators introduced by [9] is deﬁned by normalizing the symmetric kernel by (α) the symmetric outdegree distribution, hence they will be denoted as Hss , with the superscript corresponding to the anisotropic power α. [sent-86, score-1.283]
</p><p>52 (α)  Thus, if we use the asymmetric k and p , we get Haa , deﬁned by the advected diffusion equa(α) tion (8). [sent-91, score-0.562]
</p><p>53 This makes (1) embedding directed graphs with this operator problematic. [sent-93, score-0.568]
</p><p>54 If we use the symmetric kernel h but the asymmetric outdegree distribution p , we get the family (α) of operators Hsa , of which the WCut of [3] is a special case (α = 0). [sent-95, score-0.907]
</p><p>55 1 The reader may notice that there are in fact eight possible combinations of kernel and degree distribution, since the anisotripic kernel (7) could also be deﬁned using a symmetric or asymmetric outdegree distribution. [sent-100, score-0.768]
</p><p>56 (α)  Finally, if we only consider the symmetric kernel h and degree distribution q , we recover Hss , the anisotropic kernels of [9] for symmetric graphs. [sent-121, score-0.649]
</p><p>57 This operator for α = 1 is shown to separate the manifold from the probability distribution [11] and will be used as part of our recovery algorithm. [sent-122, score-0.31]
</p><p>58 Isolating the Vector Field r  4  Our aim is to esimate the manifold M, the density distribution p = e−U , and the vector ﬁeld r. [sent-123, score-0.264]
</p><p>59 In other words, as long as the chosen embedding of M is diffeomorphic to M2 , (12) can be used to express the component of r that lies in the tangent space T M, which we denote by r|| . [sent-128, score-0.386]
</p><p>60 Speciﬁcally, let Ψ be a diffeomorphic embedding of M ; the component of r along coordinate ψk is then given by r · ψk = rk , and so, in general, r|| = r ·  Ψ. [sent-129, score-0.364]
</p><p>61 (13)  The subtle point that only r|| is recovered from (13) follows from the fact that the operator r · only deﬁned along M and hence any directional derivative is necessarily along T M. [sent-130, score-0.342]
</p><p>62 is  Equation (13) and the previous observations are the basis for Algorithm 1, which recovers the three important features of the generative process for an asymmetric graph with afﬁnity matrix W . [sent-131, score-0.53]
</p><p>63 A similar approach can be employed to recover c + · r, or simply · r if r has no component perpendicular to the tangent space T M (meaning that c ≡ 0). [sent-132, score-0.229]
</p><p>64 Recovering c + · r is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that (1) (1) (Hsa − Hss ) = (c + 2  · r) ,  (14) (1)  A diffeomorphic embedding is guaranteed by using the eigendecomposition of Hss . [sent-133, score-0.272]
</p><p>65 We use the planet Earth as a manifold with a topographic density distribution, where sampling probability is proportional to elevation. [sent-139, score-0.29]
</p><p>66 We also consider two vector ﬁelds: the ﬁrst is parallel to the line of constant latitude and purely tangential to the sphere, while the second is parallel to the line of constant longitude with a component of the vector ﬁeld perpendicular to the manifold. [sent-140, score-0.26]
</p><p>67 The true model with constant latitude vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 2, along with the estimated density and vector ﬁeld projected on the true manifold (sphere). [sent-141, score-0.366]
</p><p>68 (b) Vector ﬁelds on a spherical region (blue), and their estimates (red): latitudinal vector ﬁeld tangent to the manifold (left) and longitudinal vector ﬁeld with component perpendicular to manifold tangent plane (right). [sent-147, score-0.771]
</p><p>69 The estimated geometry is not shown on any of these ﬁgures, since the success of the diffusion map in recovering the geometry for such a simple manifold is already well established [2, 9]. [sent-155, score-0.647]
</p><p>70 The aim here is to use this survey to obtain a representation of the job market as a diffusion process over a manifold. [sent-157, score-0.572]
</p><p>71 The data set consists of a sample of 7,816 individual career sequences of length 64, listing the jobs a particular individual held every quarter between the ages of 20 and 36. [sent-158, score-0.224]
</p><p>72 Each job corresponds to an industry × occupation pair. [sent-160, score-0.237]
</p><p>73 Thus, our graph G has 213 nodes - the jobs - and our observations consist of 7,816 walks between the graph nodes. [sent-163, score-0.421]
</p><p>74 We convert these walks to a directed graph with afﬁnity matrix W . [sent-164, score-0.341]
</p><p>75 Speciﬁcally, Wij represents the number of times a transition from job i to job j was observed (Note that this matrix is asymmetric, 6  i. [sent-165, score-0.334]
</p><p>76 Normalizing each row i of W by its outdegree di gives P = diag(di )−1 W , the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov chain over G for the progression (0) of career sequences. [sent-167, score-0.28]
</p><p>77 This Markov chain has as limit operator Haa , as the granularity of the job market increases along with the number of observations. [sent-168, score-0.49]
</p><p>78 Thus, in trying to recover the geometry, distribution and vector ﬁeld, we are actually interested in estimating the full advective effect of the (0) diffusion process generated by Haa ; that is, we want to estimate r · − 2 U · where we can use (0) (1) −2 U · = Hss − Hss to complement Algorithm 1. [sent-169, score-0.412]
</p><p>79 2  (b)  Figure 3: Embedding the job market along with ﬁeld r − 2 U over the ﬁrst two non-constant eigenvectors. [sent-215, score-0.3]
</p><p>80 We obtain an embedding of the job market that describes the relative position of jobs, their distribution, and the natural time progression from each job. [sent-217, score-0.529]
</p><p>81 Together, they summarize the job market dynamics by describing which jobs are naturally “close” as well as where they can lead in the future. [sent-219, score-0.432]
</p><p>82 The job market was found to be a high dimensional manifold. [sent-221, score-0.271]
</p><p>83 This is somewhat surprising, but it is easy to overstate this observation: diffusion alone would be enough to move the individuals towards higher salary. [sent-226, score-0.287]
</p><p>84 Nevertheless, there appear to be other external forces at play in the job market: Figure 3 (b), which is analogous to Figure 3 (a), but with gender replacing the salary color scheme, suggests that these forces push individuals towards greater gender differentiation. [sent-228, score-0.345]
</p><p>85 Hence, this simple analysis of the job market can be seen as an indication that males and females tend to move away from each other over time, while neither seems to have a monopoly on high- or low- paying jobs. [sent-230, score-0.303]
</p><p>86 7  Generative Models that assume that data are sampled from a manifold are standard for undirected graphs, but to our knowledge, none have yet been proposed for directed graphs. [sent-234, score-0.432]
</p><p>87 For asymmetric afﬁnities W , one must include an additional component to explain the asymmetry. [sent-236, score-0.338]
</p><p>88 Algorithm We have used from [9] the idea of deﬁning anisotropic kernels (indexed by α) in order to separate the density p and the manifold geometry M. [sent-238, score-0.585]
</p><p>89 However, insofar as the asymmetric part of the kernel is concerned, everything, starting from the deﬁnition and the introduction of the vector ﬁeld r as a way to model the asymmetry, through the derivation of the asymptotic expression for the symmetric plus asymmetric kernel, is new. [sent-241, score-0.89]
</p><p>90 We go signiﬁcantly beyond the elegant idea of [9] regarding the use of anisotropic kernels by analyzing the four distinct renormalizations possible for a given α, each of them combining different aspects of M, p and r. [sent-242, score-0.255]
</p><p>91 Only the successful (and novel) combination of two different anisotropic operators is able to recover the directional ﬂow r. [sent-243, score-0.646]
</p><p>92 1 is a general result on the asymptotics of asymmetric kernels. [sent-248, score-0.275]
</p><p>93 For instance, Hsa is the limit operator of the operators used in [3] and [5]. [sent-250, score-0.438]
</p><p>94 The limit analysis could be extended to other digraph embedding algorithms such as [4, 6]. [sent-251, score-0.282]
</p><p>95 Any kernel can be decomposed into a symmetric and an asymmetric part, as we have done. [sent-253, score-0.497]
</p><p>96 The more interesting question is how limiting are our assumptions regarding the choice of kernel, especially the asymmetric part, which we parameterized as a (x, y) = r/2 · (y − x)h (x, y) in (4). [sent-256, score-0.275]
</p><p>97 In [7], Ting, Huang and Jordan presented asymptotic results for a general family of kernels that includes asymmetric and random kernels. [sent-259, score-0.413]
</p><p>98 The distinction arises because [7] focuses on the graph construction methods from an observed sample of M, while we focus on explaining an observed directed graph G through a manifold generative process. [sent-262, score-0.666]
</p><p>99 Speciﬁcally, with respect to the limit in Theorem 3 from [7], we obtain the additional source terms f (x) · r and c(x)f (x) that follow from not enforcing (α) (α) conservation of mass while deﬁning operators Hsa and Has . [sent-265, score-0.327]
</p><p>100 We applied our theory of directed graph embedding to the analysis of the career sequences in Section 5, but asymmetric afﬁnity data abound in other social contexts, and in the physical and life sciences. [sent-266, score-0.881]

<p>Author: Dominique C. Perrault-joncas, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of embedding directed graphs in Euclidean space while retaining directional information. We model the observed graph as a sample from a manifold endowed with a vector ﬁeld, and we design an algorithm that separates and recovers the features of this process: the geometry of the manifold, the data density and the vector ﬁeld. The algorithm is motivated by our analysis of Laplacian-type operators and their continuous limit as generators of diffusions on a manifold. We illustrate the recovery algorithm on both artiﬁcially constructed and real data. 1 Motivation Recent advances in graph embedding and visualization have focused on undirected graphs, for which the graph Laplacian properties make the analysis particularly elegant [1, 2]. However, there is an important number of graph data, such as social networks, alignment scores between biological sequences, and citation data, which are naturally asymmetric. A commonly used approach for this type of data is to disregard the asymmetry by studying the spectral properties of W +W T or W T W , where W is the afﬁnity matrix of the graph. Some approaches have been offered to preserve the asymmetry information contained in data: [3], [4], [5] or to deﬁne directed Laplacian operators [6]. Although quite successful, these works adopt a purely graph-theoretical point of view. Thus, they are not concerned with the generative process that produces the graph, nor with the interpretability and statistical properties of their algorithms. In contrast, we view the nodes of a directed graph as a ﬁnite sample from a manifold in Euclidean space, and the edges as macroscopic observations of a diffusion kernel between neighboring points on the manifold. We explore how this diffusion kernel determines the overall connectivity and asymmetry of the resulting graph and demonstrate how Laplacian-type operators of this graph can offer insights into the underlying generative process. Based on the analysis of the Laplacian-type operators, we derive an algorithm that, in the limit of inﬁnite sample and vanishing bandwidth, recovers the key features of the sampling process: manifold geometry, sampling distribution, and local directionality, up to their intrinsic indeterminacies. 2 Model The ﬁrst premise here is that we observe a directed graph G, with n nodes, having weights W = [Wij ] for the edge from node i to node j. In following with common Laplacian-based embedding approaches, we assume that G is a geometric random graph constructed from n points sampled according to distribution p = e−U on an unobserved compact smooth manifold M ⊆ Rl of known intrinsic dimension d ≤ l. The edge weight Wij is then determined by a directed similarity kernel k (xi , xj ) with bandwidth . The directional component of k (xi , xj ) will be taken to be derived 1 from a vector ﬁeld r on M, which assigns a preferred direction between weights Wij and Wji . The choice of a vector ﬁeld r to characterize the directional component of G might seem restrictive at ﬁrst. In the asymptotic limit of → 0 and n → ∞ however, kernels are characterized by their diffusion, drift, and source components [7]. As such, r is sufﬁcient to characterize any directionality associated with a drift component and as it turns out, the component of r normal M in Rl can also be use to characterize any source component. As for the diffusion component, it is not possible to uniquely identify it from G alone [8]. Some absolute knownledge of M is needed to say anything about it. Hence, without loss of generality, we will construct k (xi , xj ) so that the diffusion component ends being isotropic and constant, i.e. equal to Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ on M. The schematic of this generative process is shown in the top left of Figure 1 below. From left to right: the graph generative process mapping the sample on M to geometric random graph G via the kernel k (x, y), then the subsequent embedding (α) Ψn of G by operators Haa,n , (α) Hss,n (deﬁned in section 3.1). As these operators converge to (α) their respective limits, Haa and (α) Hss , so will Ψn → Ψ, pn → p, and rn → r. We design an algorithm that, given G, produces the top right embedding (Ψn , pn , and rn ). Figure 1: Schematic of our framework. The question is then as follows: can the generative process’ geometry M, distribution p = e−U , and directionality r, be recovered from G? In other words, is there an embedding of G in Rm , m ≥ d that approximates all three components of the process and that is also consistent as sample size increases and the bandwidth vanishes? In the case of undirected graphs, the theory of Laplacian eigenmaps [1] and Diffusion maps [9] answers this question in the afﬁrmative, in that the geometry of M and p = e−U can be inferred using spectral graph theory. The aim here is to build on the undirected problem and recover all three components of the generative process from a directed graph G. The spectral approach to undirected graph embedding relies on the fact that eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are known to preserve the local geometry of M [1]. With a consistent empirical Laplace-Beltrami operator based on G, its eigenvectors also recover the geometry of M and converge to the corresponding eigenfunctions on M. For a directed graph G, an additional operator is needed to recover the local directional component r, but the principle remains the same. (α) The schematic for this is shown in Figure 1 where two operators - Hss,n , introduced in [9] for (α) undirected embeddings, and Haa,n , a new operator deﬁned in section 3.1 - are used to obtain the (α) (α) (α) embedding Ψn , distribution pn , and vector ﬁeld rn . As Haa,n and Hss,n converge to Haa and (α) Hss , Ψn , pn , and rn also converge to Ψ, p, and r, where Ψ is the local geometry preserving the embedding of M into Rm . (α) The algorithm we propose in Section 4 will calculate the matrices corresponding to H·,n from the graph G, and with their eigenvectors, will ﬁnd estimates for the node coordinates Ψ, the directional component r, and the sampling distribution p. In the next section we brieﬂy describe the mathematical models of the diffusion processes that our model relies on. 2 2.1 Problem Setting The similarity kernel k (x, y) can be used to deﬁne transport operators on M. The natural transport operator is deﬁned by normalizing k (x, y) as T [f ](x) = M k (x, y) f (y)p(y)dy , where p (x) = p (x) k (x, y)p(y)dy . (1) M T [f ](x) represents the diffusion of a distribution f (y) by the transition density k (x, y)p(y)/ k (x, y )p(y )dy . The eigenfunctions of this inﬁnitesimal operator are the continuous limit of the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix P = D−1 W given by normalizing the afﬁnity matrix W of G by D = diag(W 1) [10]. Meanwhile, the inﬁnitesimal transition ∂f (T − I)f = lim (2) →0 ∂t deﬁnes the backward equation for this diffusion process over M based on kernel k . Obtaining the explicit expression for transport operators like (2) is then the main technical challenge. 2.2 Choice of Kernel In order for T [f ] to have the correct asymptotic form, some hypotheses about the similarity kernel k (x, y) are required. The hypotheses are best presented by considering the decomposition of k (x, y) into symmetric h (x, y) = h (y, x) and anti-symmetric a (x, y) = −a (y, x) components: k (x, y) = h (x, y) + a (x, y) . (3) The symmetric component h (x, y) is assumed to satisfy the following properties: 1. h (||y − 2 x||2 ) = h(||y−x|| / ) , and 2. h ≥ 0 and h is exponentially decreasing as ||y − x|| → ∞. This form d/2 of symmetric kernel was used in [9] to analyze the diffusion map. For the asymmetric part of the similarity kernel, we assume the form a (x, y) = r(x, y) h(||y − x||2 / ) · (y − x) , d/2 2 (4) with r(x, y) = r(y, x) so that a (x, y) = −a (y, x). Here r(x, y) is a smooth vector ﬁeld on the manifold that gives an orientation to the asymmetry of the kernel k (x, y). It is worth noting that the dependence of r(x, y) on both x and y implies that r : M × M → Rl with Rl the ambient space of M; however in the asymptotic limit, the dependence in y is only important “locally” (x = y), and as such it is appropriate to think of r(x, x) being a vector ﬁeld on M. As a side note, it is worth pointing out that even though the form of a (x, y) might seem restrictive at ﬁrst, it is sufﬁciently rich to describe any vector ﬁeld . This can be seen by taking r(x, y) = (w(x) + w(y))/2 so that at x = y the resulting vector ﬁeld is given by r(x, x) = w(x) for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld w(x). 3 Continuous Limit of Laplacian Type Operators We are now ready to state the main asymptotic result. Proposition 3.1 Let M be a compact, closed, smooth manifold of dimension d and k (x, y) an asymmetric similarity kernel satisfying the conditions of section 2.2, then for any function f ∈ C 2 (M), the integral operator based on k has the asymptotic expansion k (x, y)f (y)dy = m0 f (x) + g(f (x), x) + o( ) , (5) M where g(f (x), x) = and m0 = Rd m2 (ω(x)f (x) + ∆f (x) + r · 2 h(||u||2 )du, m2 = Rd u2 h(||u||2 )du. i 3 f (x) + f (x) · r + c(x)f (x)) (6) The proof can be found in [8] along with the deﬁnition of ω(x) and c(x) in (6). For now, it sufﬁces to say that ω(x) corresponds to an interaction between the symmetric kernel h and the curvature of M and was ﬁrst derived in [9]. Meanwhile, c(x) is a new term that originates from the interaction between h and the component of r that is normal to M in the ambient space Rl . Proposition 3.1 foreshadows a general fact about spectral embedding algorithms: in most cases, Laplacian operators confound the effects of spatial proximity, sampling density and directional ﬂow due to the presence of the various terms above. 3.1 Anisotropic Limit Operators Proposition 3.1 above can be used to derive the limits of a variety of Laplacian type operators associated with spectral embedding algorithms like [5, 6, 3]. Although we will focus primarily on a few operators that give the most insight into the generative process and enable us to recover the model deﬁned in Figure 1, we ﬁrst present four distinct families of operators for completeness. These operator families are inspired by the anisotropic family of operators that [9] introduced for undirected graphs, which make use of anisotropic kernels of the form: k (α) (x, y) = k (x, y) pα (x)pα (y) , (7) with α ∈ [0, 1] where α = 0 is the isotropic limit. To normalize the anisotropic kernels, we need (α) (α) (α) as p (x) = M k (x, y)p(y)dy. From (7), four to redeﬁne the outdegrees distribution of k families of diffusion processes of the form ft = H (α) [f ](x) can be derived depending on which kernel is normalized and which outdegree distribution is used for the normalization. Speciﬁcally, (α) (α) we deﬁne transport operators by normalizing the asymmetric k or symmetric h kernels with the 1 asymmetric p or symmetric q = M h (x, y)p(y)dy outdegree distribution . To keep track of all options, we introduce the following notation: the operators will be indexed by the type of kernel and outdegree distribution they correspond to (symmetric or asymmetric), with the ﬁrst index identifying the kernel and the second index identifying the outdegree distribution. For example, the family of anisotropic limit operators introduced by [9] is deﬁned by normalizing the symmetric kernel by (α) the symmetric outdegree distribution, hence they will be denoted as Hss , with the superscript corresponding to the anisotropic power α. Proposition 3.2 With the above notation, (α) Haa [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · f + r· f (α) Has [f ] (α) Hsa [f ] (α) Hss [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2(1 − α) U · (8) f − cf + (α − 1)(r · U )f − ( · r + (α − 1)r · f + (c + f. U )f · r)f + r · f (9) (10) (11) The proof of this proposition, which can be found in [8], follows from repeated application of Proposition 3.1 to p(y) or q(y) and then to k α (x, y) or hα (x, y), as well as the fact that p1 = α 1 p−α [1 − α (ω + ∆p p + 2r · p p +2 · r + c)] + o( ). (α) Thus, if we use the asymmetric k and p , we get Haa , deﬁned by the advected diffusion equa(α) tion (8). In general, Haa is not hermitian, so it commonly has complex eigenvectors. This makes (1) embedding directed graphs with this operator problematic. Nevertheless, Haa will play an important role in extracting the directionality of the sampling process. If we use the symmetric kernel h but the asymmetric outdegree distribution p , we get the family (α) of operators Hsa , of which the WCut of [3] is a special case (α = 0). If we reverse the above, i.e. (α) (α) (α) use k and q , we obtain Has . This turns out to be merely a combination of Haa and Hsa . 1 The reader may notice that there are in fact eight possible combinations of kernel and degree distribution, since the anisotripic kernel (7) could also be deﬁned using a symmetric or asymmetric outdegree distribution. However, there are only four distinct asymptotic results and they are all covered by using one kernel (symmetric or asymmetric) and one degree distribution (symmetric or asymmetric) throughout. 4 Algorithm 1 Directed Embedding Input: Afﬁnity matrix Wi,j and embedding dimension m, (m ≥ d) 1.

Columns 2 to m + 1 of R are the vector ﬁeld components in the direction of the corresponding coordinates of the embedding. (α) Finally, if we only consider the symmetric kernel h and degree distribution q , we recover Hss , the anisotropic kernels of [9] for symmetric graphs. This operator for α = 1 is shown to separate the manifold from the probability distribution [11] and will be used as part of our recovery algorithm. Isolating the Vector Field r 4 Our aim is to esimate the manifold M, the density distribution p = e−U , and the vector ﬁeld r. The (1) ﬁrst two components of the data can be recovered from Hss as shown in [11] and summarized in Algorithm 1. At this juncture, one feature of generative process is missing: the vector ﬁeld r. The natural approach (α) (α) for recovering r is to isolate the linear operator r · from Haa by substracting Hss : (α) (α) Haa − Hss = r · . (12) The advantage of recovering r in operator form as in (12) is that r · is coordinate free. In other words, as long as the chosen embedding of M is diffeomorphic to M2 , (12) can be used to express the component of r that lies in the tangent space T M, which we denote by r|| . Speciﬁcally, let Ψ be a diffeomorphic embedding of M ; the component of r along coordinate ψk is then given by r · ψk = rk , and so, in general, r|| = r · Ψ. (13) The subtle point that only r|| is recovered from (13) follows from the fact that the operator r · only deﬁned along M and hence any directional derivative is necessarily along T M. is Equation (13) and the previous observations are the basis for Algorithm 1, which recovers the three important features of the generative process for an asymmetric graph with afﬁnity matrix W . A similar approach can be employed to recover c + · r, or simply · r if r has no component perpendicular to the tangent space T M (meaning that c ≡ 0). Recovering c + · r is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that (1) (1) (Hsa − Hss ) = (c + 2 · r) , (14) (1) A diffeomorphic embedding is guaranteed by using the eigendecomposition of Hss . 5 (1) (1) which is a diagonal operator. Taking into account that for ﬁnite n (Hsa,n − Hss,n ) is not perfectly (1) (1) diagonal, using ψn ≡ 1n (vector of ones), i.e. (Hsa,n − Hss,n )[1n ] = (cn + · rn ), has been found (1) (1) empirically to be more stable than simply extracting the diagonal of (Hsa,n − Hss,n ). 5 Experiments Artiﬁcial Data For illustrative purposes, we begin by applying our method to an artiﬁcial example. We use the planet Earth as a manifold with a topographic density distribution, where sampling probability is proportional to elevation. We also consider two vector ﬁelds: the ﬁrst is parallel to the line of constant latitude and purely tangential to the sphere, while the second is parallel to the line of constant longitude with a component of the vector ﬁeld perpendicular to the manifold. The true model with constant latitude vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 2, along with the estimated density and vector ﬁeld projected on the true manifold (sphere). Model Recovered Latitudinal (a) Longitudinal (b) Figure 2: (a): Sphere with latitudinal vector ﬁeld, i.e East-West asymmetry, with Wew > Wwe if node w lies to the West of node e. The graph nodes are sampled non-uniformly, with the topographic map of the world as sampling density. We sample n = 5000 nodes, and observe only the resulting W matrix, but not the node locations. From W , our algorithm estimates the sample locations (geometry), the vector ﬁeld (black arrows) generating the observed asymmetries, and the sampling distribution at each data point (colormap). (b) Vector ﬁelds on a spherical region (blue), and their estimates (red): latitudinal vector ﬁeld tangent to the manifold (left) and longitudinal vector ﬁeld with component perpendicular to manifold tangent plane (right). Both the estimated density and vector ﬁeld agree with the true model, demonstrating that for artiﬁcial data, the recovery algorithm 1 performs quite well. We note that the estimated density does not recover all the details of the original density, even for large sample size (here n = 5000 with = 0.07). Meanwhile, the estimated vector ﬁeld performs quite well even when the sampling is reduced to n = 500 with = 0.1. This can be seen in Figure 2, b, where the true and estimated vector ﬁelds are superimposed. Figure 2 also demonstrates how r · only recovers the tangential component of r. The estimated geometry is not shown on any of these ﬁgures, since the success of the diffusion map in recovering the geometry for such a simple manifold is already well established [2, 9]. Real DataThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 Cohort is a representative sample of young men and women in the United States who were followed from 1979 to 2000 [12, 13]. The aim here is to use this survey to obtain a representation of the job market as a diffusion process over a manifold. The data set consists of a sample of 7,816 individual career sequences of length 64, listing the jobs a particular individual held every quarter between the ages of 20 and 36. Each token in the sequence identiﬁes a job. Each job corresponds to an industry × occupation pair. There are 25 unique industry and 20 unique occupation indices. Out of the 500 possible pairings, approximately 450 occur in the data, with only 213 occurring with sufﬁcient frequency to be included here. Thus, our graph G has 213 nodes - the jobs - and our observations consist of 7,816 walks between the graph nodes. We convert these walks to a directed graph with afﬁnity matrix W . Speciﬁcally, Wij represents the number of times a transition from job i to job j was observed (Note that this matrix is asymmetric, 6 i.e Wij = Wji ). Normalizing each row i of W by its outdegree di gives P = diag(di )−1 W , the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov chain over G for the progression (0) of career sequences. This Markov chain has as limit operator Haa , as the granularity of the job market increases along with the number of observations. Thus, in trying to recover the geometry, distribution and vector ﬁeld, we are actually interested in estimating the full advective effect of the (0) diffusion process generated by Haa ; that is, we want to estimate r · − 2 U · where we can use (0) (1) −2 U · = Hss − Hss to complement Algorithm 1. 0.25 1600 0.05 0.1 1400 0.1 3 0.7 1800 0.15 ! 0.8 0.15 0.2 0.9 0.2 2000 0.25 !30.05 0.6 0.5 0 0 0.4 1200 −0.05 −0.05 −0.1 0.3 −0.1 1000 0.2 −0.15 −0.15 800 −0.2 −0.25 0.1 −0.2 −0.25 −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (a) −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (b) Figure 3: Embedding the job market along with ﬁeld r − 2 U over the ﬁrst two non-constant eigenvectors. The color map corresponds to the mean monthly wage in dollars (a) and to the female proportion (b) for each job. We obtain an embedding of the job market that describes the relative position of jobs, their distribution, and the natural time progression from each job. Of these, the relative position and natural time progression are the most interesting. Together, they summarize the job market dynamics by describing which jobs are naturally “close” as well as where they can lead in the future. From a public policy perspective, this can potentially improve focus on certain jobs for helping individuals attain better upward mobility. The job market was found to be a high dimensional manifold. We present only the ﬁrst two dimen(0) sions, that is, the second and third eigenvectors of Hss , since the ﬁrst eigenvector is uninformative (constant) by construction. The eigenvectors showed correlation with important demographic data, such as wages and gender. Figure 3 displays this two-dimensional sub-embedding along with the directional information r − 2 U for each dimension. The plot shows very little net progression toward regions of increasing mean salary3 . This is somewhat surprising, but it is easy to overstate this observation: diffusion alone would be enough to move the individuals towards higher salary. What Figure 3 (a) suggests is that there appear to be no “external forces” advecting individuals towards higher salary. Nevertheless, there appear to be other external forces at play in the job market: Figure 3 (b), which is analogous to Figure 3 (a), but with gender replacing the salary color scheme, suggests that these forces push individuals towards greater gender differentiation. This is especially true amongst male-dominated jobs which appear to be advected toward the left edge of the embedding. Hence, this simple analysis of the job market can be seen as an indication that males and females tend to move away from each other over time, while neither seems to have a monopoly on high- or low- paying jobs. 6 Discussion This paper makes three contributions: (1) it introduces a manifold-based generative model for directed graphs with weighted edges, (2) it obtains asymptotic results for operators constructed from the directed graphs, and (3) these asymptotic results lead to a natural algorithm for estimating the model. 3 It is worth noting that in the NLSY data set, high paying jobs are teacher, nurse and mechanic. This is due to the fact that the career paths observed stop at at age 36, which is relatively early in an individual’s career. 7 Generative Models that assume that data are sampled from a manifold are standard for undirected graphs, but to our knowledge, none have yet been proposed for directed graphs. When W is symmetric, it is natural to assume that it depends on the points’ proximity. For asymmetric afﬁnities W , one must include an additional component to explain the asymmetry. In the asymptotic limit, this is tantamount to deﬁning a vector ﬁeld on the manifold. Algorithm We have used from [9] the idea of deﬁning anisotropic kernels (indexed by α) in order to separate the density p and the manifold geometry M. Also, we adopted their general assumptions about the symmetric part of the kernel. As a consequence, the recovery algorithm for p and M is identical to theirs. However, insofar as the asymmetric part of the kernel is concerned, everything, starting from the deﬁnition and the introduction of the vector ﬁeld r as a way to model the asymmetry, through the derivation of the asymptotic expression for the symmetric plus asymmetric kernel, is new. We go signiﬁcantly beyond the elegant idea of [9] regarding the use of anisotropic kernels by analyzing the four distinct renormalizations possible for a given α, each of them combining different aspects of M, p and r. Only the successful (and novel) combination of two different anisotropic operators is able to recover the directional ﬂow r. Algorithm 1 is natural, but we do not claim it is the only possible one in the context of our model. (α) For instance, we can also use Hsa to recover the operator · r (which empirically seems to have worse numerical properties than r · ). In the National Longitudinal Survery of Youth study, we were interested in the whole advective term, so we estimated it from a different combination of operators. Depending on the speciﬁc question, other features of the model could be obtained Limit Results Proposition 3.1 is a general result on the asymptotics of asymmetric kernels. Recovering the manifold and r is just one, albeit the most useful, of the many ways of exploiting these (0) results. For instance, Hsa is the limit operator of the operators used in [3] and [5]. The limit analysis could be extended to other digraph embedding algorithms such as [4, 6]. How general is our model? Any kernel can be decomposed into a symmetric and an asymmetric part, as we have done. The assumptions on the symmetric part h are standard. The paper of [7] goes one step further from these assumptions; we will discuss it in relationship with our work shortly. The more interesting question is how limiting are our assumptions regarding the choice of kernel, especially the asymmetric part, which we parameterized as a (x, y) = r/2 · (y − x)h (x, y) in (4). In the asymptotic limit, this choice turns out to be fully general, at least up to the identiﬁable aspects of the model. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see [8]. In [7], Ting, Huang and Jordan presented asymptotic results for a general family of kernels that includes asymmetric and random kernels. Our k can be expressed in the notation of [7] by taking wx (y) ← 1+r(x, y)·(y−x), rx (y) ← 1, K0 ← h, h ← . Their assumptions are more general than the assumptions we make here, yet our model is general up to what can be identiﬁed from G alone. The distinction arises because [7] focuses on the graph construction methods from an observed sample of M, while we focus on explaining an observed directed graph G through a manifold generative process. Moreover, while the [7] results can be used to analyze data from directed graphs, they differ from our Proposition 3.1. Speciﬁcally, with respect to the limit in Theorem 3 from [7], we obtain the additional source terms f (x) · r and c(x)f (x) that follow from not enforcing (α) (α) conservation of mass while deﬁning operators Hsa and Has . We applied our theory of directed graph embedding to the analysis of the career sequences in Section 5, but asymmetric afﬁnity data abound in other social contexts, and in the physical and life sciences. Indeed, any “similarity” score that is obtained from a likelihood of the form Wvu =likelihood(u|v) is generally asymmetric. Hence our methods can be applied to study not only social networks, but also patterns of human movement, road trafﬁc, and trade relations, as well as alignment scores in molecular biology. Finally, the physical interpretation of our model also makes it naturally applicable to physical models of ﬂows.

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Chiyuan Zhang, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning from the vector ﬁeld perspective. Many of the existing work use the graph Laplacian to ensure the smoothness of the prediction function on the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, it is suggested by recent theoretical work that we should ensure second order smoothness for achieving faster rates of convergence for semisupervised regression problems. To achieve this goal, we show that the second order smoothness measures the linearity of the function, and the gradient ﬁeld of a linear function has to be a parallel vector ﬁeld. Consequently, we propose to ﬁnd a function which minimizes the empirical error, and simultaneously requires its gradient ﬁeld to be as parallel as possible. We give a continuous objective function on the manifold and discuss how to discretize it by using random points.

<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm called Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding (SMCE) for simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction of data lying in multiple nonlinear manifolds. Similar to most dimensionality reduction methods, SMCE ﬁnds a small neighborhood around each data point and connects each point to its neighbors with appropriate weights. The key difference is that SMCE ﬁnds both the neighbors and the weights automatically. This is done by solving a sparse optimization problem, which encourages selecting nearby points that lie in the same manifold and approximately span a low-dimensional afﬁne subspace. The optimal solution encodes information that can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction using spectral clustering and embedding. Moreover, the size of the optimal neighborhood of a data point, which can be different for different points, provides an estimate of the dimension of the manifold to which the point belongs. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively handle multiple manifolds that are very close to each other, manifolds with non-uniform sampling and holes, as well as estimate the intrinsic dimensions of the manifolds. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.1031254 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>5 0.099863179 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Noise_Thresholds_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">186 nips-2011-Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>6 0.090280674 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Co-regularized_Multi-view_Spectral_Clustering.html">54 nips-2011-Co-regularized Multi-view Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominique C. Perrault-joncas, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of embedding directed graphs in Euclidean space while retaining directional information. We model the observed graph as a sample from a manifold endowed with a vector ﬁeld, and we design an algorithm that separates and recovers the features of this process: the geometry of the manifold, the data density and the vector ﬁeld. The algorithm is motivated by our analysis of Laplacian-type operators and their continuous limit as generators of diffusions on a manifold. We illustrate the recovery algorithm on both artiﬁcially constructed and real data. 1 Motivation Recent advances in graph embedding and visualization have focused on undirected graphs, for which the graph Laplacian properties make the analysis particularly elegant [1, 2]. However, there is an important number of graph data, such as social networks, alignment scores between biological sequences, and citation data, which are naturally asymmetric. A commonly used approach for this type of data is to disregard the asymmetry by studying the spectral properties of W +W T or W T W , where W is the afﬁnity matrix of the graph. Some approaches have been offered to preserve the asymmetry information contained in data: [3], [4], [5] or to deﬁne directed Laplacian operators [6]. Although quite successful, these works adopt a purely graph-theoretical point of view. Thus, they are not concerned with the generative process that produces the graph, nor with the interpretability and statistical properties of their algorithms. In contrast, we view the nodes of a directed graph as a ﬁnite sample from a manifold in Euclidean space, and the edges as macroscopic observations of a diffusion kernel between neighboring points on the manifold. We explore how this diffusion kernel determines the overall connectivity and asymmetry of the resulting graph and demonstrate how Laplacian-type operators of this graph can offer insights into the underlying generative process. Based on the analysis of the Laplacian-type operators, we derive an algorithm that, in the limit of inﬁnite sample and vanishing bandwidth, recovers the key features of the sampling process: manifold geometry, sampling distribution, and local directionality, up to their intrinsic indeterminacies. 2 Model The ﬁrst premise here is that we observe a directed graph G, with n nodes, having weights W = [Wij ] for the edge from node i to node j. In following with common Laplacian-based embedding approaches, we assume that G is a geometric random graph constructed from n points sampled according to distribution p = e−U on an unobserved compact smooth manifold M ⊆ Rl of known intrinsic dimension d ≤ l. The edge weight Wij is then determined by a directed similarity kernel k (xi , xj ) with bandwidth . The directional component of k (xi , xj ) will be taken to be derived 1 from a vector ﬁeld r on M, which assigns a preferred direction between weights Wij and Wji . The choice of a vector ﬁeld r to characterize the directional component of G might seem restrictive at ﬁrst. In the asymptotic limit of → 0 and n → ∞ however, kernels are characterized by their diffusion, drift, and source components [7]. As such, r is sufﬁcient to characterize any directionality associated with a drift component and as it turns out, the component of r normal M in Rl can also be use to characterize any source component. As for the diffusion component, it is not possible to uniquely identify it from G alone [8]. Some absolute knownledge of M is needed to say anything about it. Hence, without loss of generality, we will construct k (xi , xj ) so that the diffusion component ends being isotropic and constant, i.e. equal to Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ on M. The schematic of this generative process is shown in the top left of Figure 1 below. From left to right: the graph generative process mapping the sample on M to geometric random graph G via the kernel k (x, y), then the subsequent embedding (α) Ψn of G by operators Haa,n , (α) Hss,n (deﬁned in section 3.1). As these operators converge to (α) their respective limits, Haa and (α) Hss , so will Ψn → Ψ, pn → p, and rn → r. We design an algorithm that, given G, produces the top right embedding (Ψn , pn , and rn ). Figure 1: Schematic of our framework. The question is then as follows: can the generative process’ geometry M, distribution p = e−U , and directionality r, be recovered from G? In other words, is there an embedding of G in Rm , m ≥ d that approximates all three components of the process and that is also consistent as sample size increases and the bandwidth vanishes? In the case of undirected graphs, the theory of Laplacian eigenmaps [1] and Diffusion maps [9] answers this question in the afﬁrmative, in that the geometry of M and p = e−U can be inferred using spectral graph theory. The aim here is to build on the undirected problem and recover all three components of the generative process from a directed graph G. The spectral approach to undirected graph embedding relies on the fact that eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are known to preserve the local geometry of M [1]. With a consistent empirical Laplace-Beltrami operator based on G, its eigenvectors also recover the geometry of M and converge to the corresponding eigenfunctions on M. For a directed graph G, an additional operator is needed to recover the local directional component r, but the principle remains the same. (α) The schematic for this is shown in Figure 1 where two operators - Hss,n , introduced in [9] for (α) undirected embeddings, and Haa,n , a new operator deﬁned in section 3.1 - are used to obtain the (α) (α) (α) embedding Ψn , distribution pn , and vector ﬁeld rn . As Haa,n and Hss,n converge to Haa and (α) Hss , Ψn , pn , and rn also converge to Ψ, p, and r, where Ψ is the local geometry preserving the embedding of M into Rm . (α) The algorithm we propose in Section 4 will calculate the matrices corresponding to H·,n from the graph G, and with their eigenvectors, will ﬁnd estimates for the node coordinates Ψ, the directional component r, and the sampling distribution p. In the next section we brieﬂy describe the mathematical models of the diffusion processes that our model relies on. 2 2.1 Problem Setting The similarity kernel k (x, y) can be used to deﬁne transport operators on M. The natural transport operator is deﬁned by normalizing k (x, y) as T [f ](x) = M k (x, y) f (y)p(y)dy , where p (x) = p (x) k (x, y)p(y)dy . (1) M T [f ](x) represents the diffusion of a distribution f (y) by the transition density k (x, y)p(y)/ k (x, y )p(y )dy . The eigenfunctions of this inﬁnitesimal operator are the continuous limit of the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix P = D−1 W given by normalizing the afﬁnity matrix W of G by D = diag(W 1) [10]. Meanwhile, the inﬁnitesimal transition ∂f (T − I)f = lim (2) →0 ∂t deﬁnes the backward equation for this diffusion process over M based on kernel k . Obtaining the explicit expression for transport operators like (2) is then the main technical challenge. 2.2 Choice of Kernel In order for T [f ] to have the correct asymptotic form, some hypotheses about the similarity kernel k (x, y) are required. The hypotheses are best presented by considering the decomposition of k (x, y) into symmetric h (x, y) = h (y, x) and anti-symmetric a (x, y) = −a (y, x) components: k (x, y) = h (x, y) + a (x, y) . (3) The symmetric component h (x, y) is assumed to satisfy the following properties: 1. h (||y − 2 x||2 ) = h(||y−x|| / ) , and 2. h ≥ 0 and h is exponentially decreasing as ||y − x|| → ∞. This form d/2 of symmetric kernel was used in [9] to analyze the diffusion map. For the asymmetric part of the similarity kernel, we assume the form a (x, y) = r(x, y) h(||y − x||2 / ) · (y − x) , d/2 2 (4) with r(x, y) = r(y, x) so that a (x, y) = −a (y, x). Here r(x, y) is a smooth vector ﬁeld on the manifold that gives an orientation to the asymmetry of the kernel k (x, y). It is worth noting that the dependence of r(x, y) on both x and y implies that r : M × M → Rl with Rl the ambient space of M; however in the asymptotic limit, the dependence in y is only important “locally” (x = y), and as such it is appropriate to think of r(x, x) being a vector ﬁeld on M. As a side note, it is worth pointing out that even though the form of a (x, y) might seem restrictive at ﬁrst, it is sufﬁciently rich to describe any vector ﬁeld . This can be seen by taking r(x, y) = (w(x) + w(y))/2 so that at x = y the resulting vector ﬁeld is given by r(x, x) = w(x) for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld w(x). 3 Continuous Limit of Laplacian Type Operators We are now ready to state the main asymptotic result. Proposition 3.1 Let M be a compact, closed, smooth manifold of dimension d and k (x, y) an asymmetric similarity kernel satisfying the conditions of section 2.2, then for any function f ∈ C 2 (M), the integral operator based on k has the asymptotic expansion k (x, y)f (y)dy = m0 f (x) + g(f (x), x) + o( ) , (5) M where g(f (x), x) = and m0 = Rd m2 (ω(x)f (x) + ∆f (x) + r · 2 h(||u||2 )du, m2 = Rd u2 h(||u||2 )du. i 3 f (x) + f (x) · r + c(x)f (x)) (6) The proof can be found in [8] along with the deﬁnition of ω(x) and c(x) in (6). For now, it sufﬁces to say that ω(x) corresponds to an interaction between the symmetric kernel h and the curvature of M and was ﬁrst derived in [9]. Meanwhile, c(x) is a new term that originates from the interaction between h and the component of r that is normal to M in the ambient space Rl . Proposition 3.1 foreshadows a general fact about spectral embedding algorithms: in most cases, Laplacian operators confound the effects of spatial proximity, sampling density and directional ﬂow due to the presence of the various terms above. 3.1 Anisotropic Limit Operators Proposition 3.1 above can be used to derive the limits of a variety of Laplacian type operators associated with spectral embedding algorithms like [5, 6, 3]. Although we will focus primarily on a few operators that give the most insight into the generative process and enable us to recover the model deﬁned in Figure 1, we ﬁrst present four distinct families of operators for completeness. These operator families are inspired by the anisotropic family of operators that [9] introduced for undirected graphs, which make use of anisotropic kernels of the form: k (α) (x, y) = k (x, y) pα (x)pα (y) , (7) with α ∈ [0, 1] where α = 0 is the isotropic limit. To normalize the anisotropic kernels, we need (α) (α) (α) as p (x) = M k (x, y)p(y)dy. From (7), four to redeﬁne the outdegrees distribution of k families of diffusion processes of the form ft = H (α) [f ](x) can be derived depending on which kernel is normalized and which outdegree distribution is used for the normalization. Speciﬁcally, (α) (α) we deﬁne transport operators by normalizing the asymmetric k or symmetric h kernels with the 1 asymmetric p or symmetric q = M h (x, y)p(y)dy outdegree distribution . To keep track of all options, we introduce the following notation: the operators will be indexed by the type of kernel and outdegree distribution they correspond to (symmetric or asymmetric), with the ﬁrst index identifying the kernel and the second index identifying the outdegree distribution. For example, the family of anisotropic limit operators introduced by [9] is deﬁned by normalizing the symmetric kernel by (α) the symmetric outdegree distribution, hence they will be denoted as Hss , with the superscript corresponding to the anisotropic power α. Proposition 3.2 With the above notation, (α) Haa [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · f + r· f (α) Has [f ] (α) Hsa [f ] (α) Hss [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2(1 − α) U · (8) f − cf + (α − 1)(r · U )f − ( · r + (α − 1)r · f + (c + f. U )f · r)f + r · f (9) (10) (11) The proof of this proposition, which can be found in [8], follows from repeated application of Proposition 3.1 to p(y) or q(y) and then to k α (x, y) or hα (x, y), as well as the fact that p1 = α 1 p−α [1 − α (ω + ∆p p + 2r · p p +2 · r + c)] + o( ). (α) Thus, if we use the asymmetric k and p , we get Haa , deﬁned by the advected diffusion equa(α) tion (8). In general, Haa is not hermitian, so it commonly has complex eigenvectors. This makes (1) embedding directed graphs with this operator problematic. Nevertheless, Haa will play an important role in extracting the directionality of the sampling process. If we use the symmetric kernel h but the asymmetric outdegree distribution p , we get the family (α) of operators Hsa , of which the WCut of [3] is a special case (α = 0). If we reverse the above, i.e. (α) (α) (α) use k and q , we obtain Has . This turns out to be merely a combination of Haa and Hsa . 1 The reader may notice that there are in fact eight possible combinations of kernel and degree distribution, since the anisotripic kernel (7) could also be deﬁned using a symmetric or asymmetric outdegree distribution. However, there are only four distinct asymptotic results and they are all covered by using one kernel (symmetric or asymmetric) and one degree distribution (symmetric or asymmetric) throughout. 4 Algorithm 1 Directed Embedding Input: Afﬁnity matrix Wi,j and embedding dimension m, (m ≥ d) 1.

Columns 2 to m + 1 of R are the vector ﬁeld components in the direction of the corresponding coordinates of the embedding. (α) Finally, if we only consider the symmetric kernel h and degree distribution q , we recover Hss , the anisotropic kernels of [9] for symmetric graphs. This operator for α = 1 is shown to separate the manifold from the probability distribution [11] and will be used as part of our recovery algorithm. Isolating the Vector Field r 4 Our aim is to esimate the manifold M, the density distribution p = e−U , and the vector ﬁeld r. The (1) ﬁrst two components of the data can be recovered from Hss as shown in [11] and summarized in Algorithm 1. At this juncture, one feature of generative process is missing: the vector ﬁeld r. The natural approach (α) (α) for recovering r is to isolate the linear operator r · from Haa by substracting Hss : (α) (α) Haa − Hss = r · . (12) The advantage of recovering r in operator form as in (12) is that r · is coordinate free. In other words, as long as the chosen embedding of M is diffeomorphic to M2 , (12) can be used to express the component of r that lies in the tangent space T M, which we denote by r|| . Speciﬁcally, let Ψ be a diffeomorphic embedding of M ; the component of r along coordinate ψk is then given by r · ψk = rk , and so, in general, r|| = r · Ψ. (13) The subtle point that only r|| is recovered from (13) follows from the fact that the operator r · only deﬁned along M and hence any directional derivative is necessarily along T M. is Equation (13) and the previous observations are the basis for Algorithm 1, which recovers the three important features of the generative process for an asymmetric graph with afﬁnity matrix W . A similar approach can be employed to recover c + · r, or simply · r if r has no component perpendicular to the tangent space T M (meaning that c ≡ 0). Recovering c + · r is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that (1) (1) (Hsa − Hss ) = (c + 2 · r) , (14) (1) A diffeomorphic embedding is guaranteed by using the eigendecomposition of Hss . 5 (1) (1) which is a diagonal operator. Taking into account that for ﬁnite n (Hsa,n − Hss,n ) is not perfectly (1) (1) diagonal, using ψn ≡ 1n (vector of ones), i.e. (Hsa,n − Hss,n )[1n ] = (cn + · rn ), has been found (1) (1) empirically to be more stable than simply extracting the diagonal of (Hsa,n − Hss,n ). 5 Experiments Artiﬁcial Data For illustrative purposes, we begin by applying our method to an artiﬁcial example. We use the planet Earth as a manifold with a topographic density distribution, where sampling probability is proportional to elevation. We also consider two vector ﬁelds: the ﬁrst is parallel to the line of constant latitude and purely tangential to the sphere, while the second is parallel to the line of constant longitude with a component of the vector ﬁeld perpendicular to the manifold. The true model with constant latitude vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 2, along with the estimated density and vector ﬁeld projected on the true manifold (sphere). Model Recovered Latitudinal (a) Longitudinal (b) Figure 2: (a): Sphere with latitudinal vector ﬁeld, i.e East-West asymmetry, with Wew > Wwe if node w lies to the West of node e. The graph nodes are sampled non-uniformly, with the topographic map of the world as sampling density. We sample n = 5000 nodes, and observe only the resulting W matrix, but not the node locations. From W , our algorithm estimates the sample locations (geometry), the vector ﬁeld (black arrows) generating the observed asymmetries, and the sampling distribution at each data point (colormap). (b) Vector ﬁelds on a spherical region (blue), and their estimates (red): latitudinal vector ﬁeld tangent to the manifold (left) and longitudinal vector ﬁeld with component perpendicular to manifold tangent plane (right). Both the estimated density and vector ﬁeld agree with the true model, demonstrating that for artiﬁcial data, the recovery algorithm 1 performs quite well. We note that the estimated density does not recover all the details of the original density, even for large sample size (here n = 5000 with = 0.07). Meanwhile, the estimated vector ﬁeld performs quite well even when the sampling is reduced to n = 500 with = 0.1. This can be seen in Figure 2, b, where the true and estimated vector ﬁelds are superimposed. Figure 2 also demonstrates how r · only recovers the tangential component of r. The estimated geometry is not shown on any of these ﬁgures, since the success of the diffusion map in recovering the geometry for such a simple manifold is already well established [2, 9]. Real DataThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 Cohort is a representative sample of young men and women in the United States who were followed from 1979 to 2000 [12, 13]. The aim here is to use this survey to obtain a representation of the job market as a diffusion process over a manifold. The data set consists of a sample of 7,816 individual career sequences of length 64, listing the jobs a particular individual held every quarter between the ages of 20 and 36. Each token in the sequence identiﬁes a job. Each job corresponds to an industry × occupation pair. There are 25 unique industry and 20 unique occupation indices. Out of the 500 possible pairings, approximately 450 occur in the data, with only 213 occurring with sufﬁcient frequency to be included here. Thus, our graph G has 213 nodes - the jobs - and our observations consist of 7,816 walks between the graph nodes. We convert these walks to a directed graph with afﬁnity matrix W . Speciﬁcally, Wij represents the number of times a transition from job i to job j was observed (Note that this matrix is asymmetric, 6 i.e Wij = Wji ). Normalizing each row i of W by its outdegree di gives P = diag(di )−1 W , the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov chain over G for the progression (0) of career sequences. This Markov chain has as limit operator Haa , as the granularity of the job market increases along with the number of observations. Thus, in trying to recover the geometry, distribution and vector ﬁeld, we are actually interested in estimating the full advective effect of the (0) diffusion process generated by Haa ; that is, we want to estimate r · − 2 U · where we can use (0) (1) −2 U · = Hss − Hss to complement Algorithm 1. 0.25 1600 0.05 0.1 1400 0.1 3 0.7 1800 0.15 ! 0.8 0.15 0.2 0.9 0.2 2000 0.25 !30.05 0.6 0.5 0 0 0.4 1200 −0.05 −0.05 −0.1 0.3 −0.1 1000 0.2 −0.15 −0.15 800 −0.2 −0.25 0.1 −0.2 −0.25 −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (a) −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (b) Figure 3: Embedding the job market along with ﬁeld r − 2 U over the ﬁrst two non-constant eigenvectors. The color map corresponds to the mean monthly wage in dollars (a) and to the female proportion (b) for each job. We obtain an embedding of the job market that describes the relative position of jobs, their distribution, and the natural time progression from each job. Of these, the relative position and natural time progression are the most interesting. Together, they summarize the job market dynamics by describing which jobs are naturally “close” as well as where they can lead in the future. From a public policy perspective, this can potentially improve focus on certain jobs for helping individuals attain better upward mobility. The job market was found to be a high dimensional manifold. We present only the ﬁrst two dimen(0) sions, that is, the second and third eigenvectors of Hss , since the ﬁrst eigenvector is uninformative (constant) by construction. The eigenvectors showed correlation with important demographic data, such as wages and gender. Figure 3 displays this two-dimensional sub-embedding along with the directional information r − 2 U for each dimension. The plot shows very little net progression toward regions of increasing mean salary3 . This is somewhat surprising, but it is easy to overstate this observation: diffusion alone would be enough to move the individuals towards higher salary. What Figure 3 (a) suggests is that there appear to be no “external forces” advecting individuals towards higher salary. Nevertheless, there appear to be other external forces at play in the job market: Figure 3 (b), which is analogous to Figure 3 (a), but with gender replacing the salary color scheme, suggests that these forces push individuals towards greater gender differentiation. This is especially true amongst male-dominated jobs which appear to be advected toward the left edge of the embedding. Hence, this simple analysis of the job market can be seen as an indication that males and females tend to move away from each other over time, while neither seems to have a monopoly on high- or low- paying jobs. 6 Discussion This paper makes three contributions: (1) it introduces a manifold-based generative model for directed graphs with weighted edges, (2) it obtains asymptotic results for operators constructed from the directed graphs, and (3) these asymptotic results lead to a natural algorithm for estimating the model. 3 It is worth noting that in the NLSY data set, high paying jobs are teacher, nurse and mechanic. This is due to the fact that the career paths observed stop at at age 36, which is relatively early in an individual’s career. 7 Generative Models that assume that data are sampled from a manifold are standard for undirected graphs, but to our knowledge, none have yet been proposed for directed graphs. When W is symmetric, it is natural to assume that it depends on the points’ proximity. For asymmetric afﬁnities W , one must include an additional component to explain the asymmetry. In the asymptotic limit, this is tantamount to deﬁning a vector ﬁeld on the manifold. Algorithm We have used from [9] the idea of deﬁning anisotropic kernels (indexed by α) in order to separate the density p and the manifold geometry M. Also, we adopted their general assumptions about the symmetric part of the kernel. As a consequence, the recovery algorithm for p and M is identical to theirs. However, insofar as the asymmetric part of the kernel is concerned, everything, starting from the deﬁnition and the introduction of the vector ﬁeld r as a way to model the asymmetry, through the derivation of the asymptotic expression for the symmetric plus asymmetric kernel, is new. We go signiﬁcantly beyond the elegant idea of [9] regarding the use of anisotropic kernels by analyzing the four distinct renormalizations possible for a given α, each of them combining different aspects of M, p and r. Only the successful (and novel) combination of two different anisotropic operators is able to recover the directional ﬂow r. Algorithm 1 is natural, but we do not claim it is the only possible one in the context of our model. (α) For instance, we can also use Hsa to recover the operator · r (which empirically seems to have worse numerical properties than r · ). In the National Longitudinal Survery of Youth study, we were interested in the whole advective term, so we estimated it from a different combination of operators. Depending on the speciﬁc question, other features of the model could be obtained Limit Results Proposition 3.1 is a general result on the asymptotics of asymmetric kernels. Recovering the manifold and r is just one, albeit the most useful, of the many ways of exploiting these (0) results. For instance, Hsa is the limit operator of the operators used in [3] and [5]. The limit analysis could be extended to other digraph embedding algorithms such as [4, 6]. How general is our model? Any kernel can be decomposed into a symmetric and an asymmetric part, as we have done. The assumptions on the symmetric part h are standard. The paper of [7] goes one step further from these assumptions; we will discuss it in relationship with our work shortly. The more interesting question is how limiting are our assumptions regarding the choice of kernel, especially the asymmetric part, which we parameterized as a (x, y) = r/2 · (y − x)h (x, y) in (4). In the asymptotic limit, this choice turns out to be fully general, at least up to the identiﬁable aspects of the model. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see [8]. In [7], Ting, Huang and Jordan presented asymptotic results for a general family of kernels that includes asymmetric and random kernels. Our k can be expressed in the notation of [7] by taking wx (y) ← 1+r(x, y)·(y−x), rx (y) ← 1, K0 ← h, h ← . Their assumptions are more general than the assumptions we make here, yet our model is general up to what can be identiﬁed from G alone. The distinction arises because [7] focuses on the graph construction methods from an observed sample of M, while we focus on explaining an observed directed graph G through a manifold generative process. Moreover, while the [7] results can be used to analyze data from directed graphs, they differ from our Proposition 3.1. Speciﬁcally, with respect to the limit in Theorem 3 from [7], we obtain the additional source terms f (x) · r and c(x)f (x) that follow from not enforcing (α) (α) conservation of mass while deﬁning operators Hsa and Has . We applied our theory of directed graph embedding to the analysis of the career sequences in Section 5, but asymmetric afﬁnity data abound in other social contexts, and in the physical and life sciences. Indeed, any “similarity” score that is obtained from a likelihood of the form Wvu =likelihood(u|v) is generally asymmetric. Hence our methods can be applied to study not only social networks, but also patterns of human movement, road trafﬁc, and trade relations, as well as alignment scores in molecular biology. Finally, the physical interpretation of our model also makes it naturally applicable to physical models of ﬂows.

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Chiyuan Zhang, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning from the vector ﬁeld perspective. Many of the existing work use the graph Laplacian to ensure the smoothness of the prediction function on the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, it is suggested by recent theoretical work that we should ensure second order smoothness for achieving faster rates of convergence for semisupervised regression problems. To achieve this goal, we show that the second order smoothness measures the linearity of the function, and the gradient ﬁeld of a linear function has to be a parallel vector ﬁeld. Consequently, we propose to ﬁnd a function which minimizes the empirical error, and simultaneously requires its gradient ﬁeld to be as parallel as possible. We give a continuous objective function on the manifold and discuss how to discretize it by using random points. The discretized optimization problem turns out to be a sparse linear system which can be solved very efﬁciently. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>3 0.73645175 <a title="71-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Manifold_Clustering_and_Embedding.html">263 nips-2011-Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm called Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding (SMCE) for simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction of data lying in multiple nonlinear manifolds. Similar to most dimensionality reduction methods, SMCE ﬁnds a small neighborhood around each data point and connects each point to its neighbors with appropriate weights. The key difference is that SMCE ﬁnds both the neighbors and the weights automatically. This is done by solving a sparse optimization problem, which encourages selecting nearby points that lie in the same manifold and approximately span a low-dimensional afﬁne subspace. The optimal solution encodes information that can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction using spectral clustering and embedding. Moreover, the size of the optimal neighborhood of a data point, which can be different for different points, provides an estimate of the dimension of the manifold to which the point belongs. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively handle multiple manifolds that are very close to each other, manifolds with non-uniform sampling and holes, as well as estimate the intrinsic dimensions of the manifolds. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.61844891 <a title="71-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Manifold_Precis%3A_An_Annealing_Technique_for_Diverse_Sampling_of_Manifolds.html">164 nips-2011-Manifold Precis: An Annealing Technique for Diverse Sampling of Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitesh Shroff, Pavan Turaga, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Pr´ cis problem of sampling K representative yet e diverse data points from a large dataset. This problem arises frequently in applications such as video and document summarization, exploratory data analysis, and pre-ﬁltering. We formulate a general theory which encompasses not just traditional techniques devised for vector spaces, but also non-Euclidean manifolds, thereby enabling these techniques to shapes, human activities, textures and many other image and video based datasets. We propose intrinsic manifold measures for measuring the quality of a selection of points with respect to their representative power, and their diversity. We then propose efﬁcient algorithms to optimize the cost function using a novel annealing-based iterative alternation algorithm. The proposed formulation is applicable to manifolds of known geometry as well as to manifolds whose geometry needs to be estimated from samples. Experimental results show the strength and generality of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.5694682 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Covariance_Unfolding_%3A_Manifold_Learning_for_Bimodal_Data.html">167 nips-2011-Maximum Covariance Unfolding : Manifold Learning for Bimodal Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Vijay Mahadevan, Chi W. Wong, Jose C. Pereira, Tom Liu, Nuno Vasconcelos, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We propose maximum covariance unfolding (MCU), a manifold learning algorithm for simultaneous dimensionality reduction of data from different input modalities. Given high dimensional inputs from two different but naturally aligned sources, MCU computes a common low dimensional embedding that maximizes the cross-modal (inter-source) correlations while preserving the local (intra-source) distances. In this paper, we explore two applications of MCU. First we use MCU to analyze EEG-fMRI data, where an important goal is to visualize the fMRI voxels that are most strongly correlated with changes in EEG traces. To perform this visualization, we augment MCU with an additional step for metric learning in the high dimensional voxel space. Second, we use MCU to perform cross-modal retrieval of matched image and text samples from Wikipedia. To manage large applications of MCU, we develop a fast implementation based on ideas from spectral graph theory. These ideas transform the original problem for MCU, one of semideﬁnite programming, into a simpler problem in semideﬁnite quadratic linear programming. 1</p><p>6 0.55631536 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Data_Skeletonization_via_Reeb_Graphs.html">67 nips-2011-Data Skeletonization via Reeb Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominique C. Perrault-joncas, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers the problem of embedding directed graphs in Euclidean space while retaining directional information. We model the observed graph as a sample from a manifold endowed with a vector ﬁeld, and we design an algorithm that separates and recovers the features of this process: the geometry of the manifold, the data density and the vector ﬁeld. The algorithm is motivated by our analysis of Laplacian-type operators and their continuous limit as generators of diffusions on a manifold. We illustrate the recovery algorithm on both artiﬁcially constructed and real data. 1 Motivation Recent advances in graph embedding and visualization have focused on undirected graphs, for which the graph Laplacian properties make the analysis particularly elegant [1, 2]. However, there is an important number of graph data, such as social networks, alignment scores between biological sequences, and citation data, which are naturally asymmetric. A commonly used approach for this type of data is to disregard the asymmetry by studying the spectral properties of W +W T or W T W , where W is the afﬁnity matrix of the graph. Some approaches have been offered to preserve the asymmetry information contained in data: [3], [4], [5] or to deﬁne directed Laplacian operators [6]. Although quite successful, these works adopt a purely graph-theoretical point of view. Thus, they are not concerned with the generative process that produces the graph, nor with the interpretability and statistical properties of their algorithms. In contrast, we view the nodes of a directed graph as a ﬁnite sample from a manifold in Euclidean space, and the edges as macroscopic observations of a diffusion kernel between neighboring points on the manifold. We explore how this diffusion kernel determines the overall connectivity and asymmetry of the resulting graph and demonstrate how Laplacian-type operators of this graph can offer insights into the underlying generative process. Based on the analysis of the Laplacian-type operators, we derive an algorithm that, in the limit of inﬁnite sample and vanishing bandwidth, recovers the key features of the sampling process: manifold geometry, sampling distribution, and local directionality, up to their intrinsic indeterminacies. 2 Model The ﬁrst premise here is that we observe a directed graph G, with n nodes, having weights W = [Wij ] for the edge from node i to node j. In following with common Laplacian-based embedding approaches, we assume that G is a geometric random graph constructed from n points sampled according to distribution p = e−U on an unobserved compact smooth manifold M ⊆ Rl of known intrinsic dimension d ≤ l. The edge weight Wij is then determined by a directed similarity kernel k (xi , xj ) with bandwidth . The directional component of k (xi , xj ) will be taken to be derived 1 from a vector ﬁeld r on M, which assigns a preferred direction between weights Wij and Wji . The choice of a vector ﬁeld r to characterize the directional component of G might seem restrictive at ﬁrst. In the asymptotic limit of → 0 and n → ∞ however, kernels are characterized by their diffusion, drift, and source components [7]. As such, r is sufﬁcient to characterize any directionality associated with a drift component and as it turns out, the component of r normal M in Rl can also be use to characterize any source component. As for the diffusion component, it is not possible to uniquely identify it from G alone [8]. Some absolute knownledge of M is needed to say anything about it. Hence, without loss of generality, we will construct k (xi , xj ) so that the diffusion component ends being isotropic and constant, i.e. equal to Laplace-Beltrami operator ∆ on M. The schematic of this generative process is shown in the top left of Figure 1 below. From left to right: the graph generative process mapping the sample on M to geometric random graph G via the kernel k (x, y), then the subsequent embedding (α) Ψn of G by operators Haa,n , (α) Hss,n (deﬁned in section 3.1). As these operators converge to (α) their respective limits, Haa and (α) Hss , so will Ψn → Ψ, pn → p, and rn → r. We design an algorithm that, given G, produces the top right embedding (Ψn , pn , and rn ). Figure 1: Schematic of our framework. The question is then as follows: can the generative process’ geometry M, distribution p = e−U , and directionality r, be recovered from G? In other words, is there an embedding of G in Rm , m ≥ d that approximates all three components of the process and that is also consistent as sample size increases and the bandwidth vanishes? In the case of undirected graphs, the theory of Laplacian eigenmaps [1] and Diffusion maps [9] answers this question in the afﬁrmative, in that the geometry of M and p = e−U can be inferred using spectral graph theory. The aim here is to build on the undirected problem and recover all three components of the generative process from a directed graph G. The spectral approach to undirected graph embedding relies on the fact that eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator are known to preserve the local geometry of M [1]. With a consistent empirical Laplace-Beltrami operator based on G, its eigenvectors also recover the geometry of M and converge to the corresponding eigenfunctions on M. For a directed graph G, an additional operator is needed to recover the local directional component r, but the principle remains the same. (α) The schematic for this is shown in Figure 1 where two operators - Hss,n , introduced in [9] for (α) undirected embeddings, and Haa,n , a new operator deﬁned in section 3.1 - are used to obtain the (α) (α) (α) embedding Ψn , distribution pn , and vector ﬁeld rn . As Haa,n and Hss,n converge to Haa and (α) Hss , Ψn , pn , and rn also converge to Ψ, p, and r, where Ψ is the local geometry preserving the embedding of M into Rm . (α) The algorithm we propose in Section 4 will calculate the matrices corresponding to H·,n from the graph G, and with their eigenvectors, will ﬁnd estimates for the node coordinates Ψ, the directional component r, and the sampling distribution p. In the next section we brieﬂy describe the mathematical models of the diffusion processes that our model relies on. 2 2.1 Problem Setting The similarity kernel k (x, y) can be used to deﬁne transport operators on M. The natural transport operator is deﬁned by normalizing k (x, y) as T [f ](x) = M k (x, y) f (y)p(y)dy , where p (x) = p (x) k (x, y)p(y)dy . (1) M T [f ](x) represents the diffusion of a distribution f (y) by the transition density k (x, y)p(y)/ k (x, y )p(y )dy . The eigenfunctions of this inﬁnitesimal operator are the continuous limit of the eigenvectors of the transition probability matrix P = D−1 W given by normalizing the afﬁnity matrix W of G by D = diag(W 1) [10]. Meanwhile, the inﬁnitesimal transition ∂f (T − I)f = lim (2) →0 ∂t deﬁnes the backward equation for this diffusion process over M based on kernel k . Obtaining the explicit expression for transport operators like (2) is then the main technical challenge. 2.2 Choice of Kernel In order for T [f ] to have the correct asymptotic form, some hypotheses about the similarity kernel k (x, y) are required. The hypotheses are best presented by considering the decomposition of k (x, y) into symmetric h (x, y) = h (y, x) and anti-symmetric a (x, y) = −a (y, x) components: k (x, y) = h (x, y) + a (x, y) . (3) The symmetric component h (x, y) is assumed to satisfy the following properties: 1. h (||y − 2 x||2 ) = h(||y−x|| / ) , and 2. h ≥ 0 and h is exponentially decreasing as ||y − x|| → ∞. This form d/2 of symmetric kernel was used in [9] to analyze the diffusion map. For the asymmetric part of the similarity kernel, we assume the form a (x, y) = r(x, y) h(||y − x||2 / ) · (y − x) , d/2 2 (4) with r(x, y) = r(y, x) so that a (x, y) = −a (y, x). Here r(x, y) is a smooth vector ﬁeld on the manifold that gives an orientation to the asymmetry of the kernel k (x, y). It is worth noting that the dependence of r(x, y) on both x and y implies that r : M × M → Rl with Rl the ambient space of M; however in the asymptotic limit, the dependence in y is only important “locally” (x = y), and as such it is appropriate to think of r(x, x) being a vector ﬁeld on M. As a side note, it is worth pointing out that even though the form of a (x, y) might seem restrictive at ﬁrst, it is sufﬁciently rich to describe any vector ﬁeld . This can be seen by taking r(x, y) = (w(x) + w(y))/2 so that at x = y the resulting vector ﬁeld is given by r(x, x) = w(x) for an arbitrary vector ﬁeld w(x). 3 Continuous Limit of Laplacian Type Operators We are now ready to state the main asymptotic result. Proposition 3.1 Let M be a compact, closed, smooth manifold of dimension d and k (x, y) an asymmetric similarity kernel satisfying the conditions of section 2.2, then for any function f ∈ C 2 (M), the integral operator based on k has the asymptotic expansion k (x, y)f (y)dy = m0 f (x) + g(f (x), x) + o( ) , (5) M where g(f (x), x) = and m0 = Rd m2 (ω(x)f (x) + ∆f (x) + r · 2 h(||u||2 )du, m2 = Rd u2 h(||u||2 )du. i 3 f (x) + f (x) · r + c(x)f (x)) (6) The proof can be found in [8] along with the deﬁnition of ω(x) and c(x) in (6). For now, it sufﬁces to say that ω(x) corresponds to an interaction between the symmetric kernel h and the curvature of M and was ﬁrst derived in [9]. Meanwhile, c(x) is a new term that originates from the interaction between h and the component of r that is normal to M in the ambient space Rl . Proposition 3.1 foreshadows a general fact about spectral embedding algorithms: in most cases, Laplacian operators confound the effects of spatial proximity, sampling density and directional ﬂow due to the presence of the various terms above. 3.1 Anisotropic Limit Operators Proposition 3.1 above can be used to derive the limits of a variety of Laplacian type operators associated with spectral embedding algorithms like [5, 6, 3]. Although we will focus primarily on a few operators that give the most insight into the generative process and enable us to recover the model deﬁned in Figure 1, we ﬁrst present four distinct families of operators for completeness. These operator families are inspired by the anisotropic family of operators that [9] introduced for undirected graphs, which make use of anisotropic kernels of the form: k (α) (x, y) = k (x, y) pα (x)pα (y) , (7) with α ∈ [0, 1] where α = 0 is the isotropic limit. To normalize the anisotropic kernels, we need (α) (α) (α) as p (x) = M k (x, y)p(y)dy. From (7), four to redeﬁne the outdegrees distribution of k families of diffusion processes of the form ft = H (α) [f ](x) can be derived depending on which kernel is normalized and which outdegree distribution is used for the normalization. Speciﬁcally, (α) (α) we deﬁne transport operators by normalizing the asymmetric k or symmetric h kernels with the 1 asymmetric p or symmetric q = M h (x, y)p(y)dy outdegree distribution . To keep track of all options, we introduce the following notation: the operators will be indexed by the type of kernel and outdegree distribution they correspond to (symmetric or asymmetric), with the ﬁrst index identifying the kernel and the second index identifying the outdegree distribution. For example, the family of anisotropic limit operators introduced by [9] is deﬁned by normalizing the symmetric kernel by (α) the symmetric outdegree distribution, hence they will be denoted as Hss , with the superscript corresponding to the anisotropic power α. Proposition 3.2 With the above notation, (α) Haa [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · f + r· f (α) Has [f ] (α) Hsa [f ] (α) Hss [f ] = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2 (1 − α) U · = ∆f − 2(1 − α) U · (8) f − cf + (α − 1)(r · U )f − ( · r + (α − 1)r · f + (c + f. U )f · r)f + r · f (9) (10) (11) The proof of this proposition, which can be found in [8], follows from repeated application of Proposition 3.1 to p(y) or q(y) and then to k α (x, y) or hα (x, y), as well as the fact that p1 = α 1 p−α [1 − α (ω + ∆p p + 2r · p p +2 · r + c)] + o( ). (α) Thus, if we use the asymmetric k and p , we get Haa , deﬁned by the advected diffusion equa(α) tion (8). In general, Haa is not hermitian, so it commonly has complex eigenvectors. This makes (1) embedding directed graphs with this operator problematic. Nevertheless, Haa will play an important role in extracting the directionality of the sampling process. If we use the symmetric kernel h but the asymmetric outdegree distribution p , we get the family (α) of operators Hsa , of which the WCut of [3] is a special case (α = 0). If we reverse the above, i.e. (α) (α) (α) use k and q , we obtain Has . This turns out to be merely a combination of Haa and Hsa . 1 The reader may notice that there are in fact eight possible combinations of kernel and degree distribution, since the anisotripic kernel (7) could also be deﬁned using a symmetric or asymmetric outdegree distribution. However, there are only four distinct asymptotic results and they are all covered by using one kernel (symmetric or asymmetric) and one degree distribution (symmetric or asymmetric) throughout. 4 Algorithm 1 Directed Embedding Input: Afﬁnity matrix Wi,j and embedding dimension m, (m ≥ d) 1.

Columns 2 to m + 1 of R are the vector ﬁeld components in the direction of the corresponding coordinates of the embedding. (α) Finally, if we only consider the symmetric kernel h and degree distribution q , we recover Hss , the anisotropic kernels of [9] for symmetric graphs. This operator for α = 1 is shown to separate the manifold from the probability distribution [11] and will be used as part of our recovery algorithm. Isolating the Vector Field r 4 Our aim is to esimate the manifold M, the density distribution p = e−U , and the vector ﬁeld r. The (1) ﬁrst two components of the data can be recovered from Hss as shown in [11] and summarized in Algorithm 1. At this juncture, one feature of generative process is missing: the vector ﬁeld r. The natural approach (α) (α) for recovering r is to isolate the linear operator r · from Haa by substracting Hss : (α) (α) Haa − Hss = r · . (12) The advantage of recovering r in operator form as in (12) is that r · is coordinate free. In other words, as long as the chosen embedding of M is diffeomorphic to M2 , (12) can be used to express the component of r that lies in the tangent space T M, which we denote by r|| . Speciﬁcally, let Ψ be a diffeomorphic embedding of M ; the component of r along coordinate ψk is then given by r · ψk = rk , and so, in general, r|| = r · Ψ. (13) The subtle point that only r|| is recovered from (13) follows from the fact that the operator r · only deﬁned along M and hence any directional derivative is necessarily along T M. is Equation (13) and the previous observations are the basis for Algorithm 1, which recovers the three important features of the generative process for an asymmetric graph with afﬁnity matrix W . A similar approach can be employed to recover c + · r, or simply · r if r has no component perpendicular to the tangent space T M (meaning that c ≡ 0). Recovering c + · r is achieved by taking advantage of the fact that (1) (1) (Hsa − Hss ) = (c + 2 · r) , (14) (1) A diffeomorphic embedding is guaranteed by using the eigendecomposition of Hss . 5 (1) (1) which is a diagonal operator. Taking into account that for ﬁnite n (Hsa,n − Hss,n ) is not perfectly (1) (1) diagonal, using ψn ≡ 1n (vector of ones), i.e. (Hsa,n − Hss,n )[1n ] = (cn + · rn ), has been found (1) (1) empirically to be more stable than simply extracting the diagonal of (Hsa,n − Hss,n ). 5 Experiments Artiﬁcial Data For illustrative purposes, we begin by applying our method to an artiﬁcial example. We use the planet Earth as a manifold with a topographic density distribution, where sampling probability is proportional to elevation. We also consider two vector ﬁelds: the ﬁrst is parallel to the line of constant latitude and purely tangential to the sphere, while the second is parallel to the line of constant longitude with a component of the vector ﬁeld perpendicular to the manifold. The true model with constant latitude vector ﬁeld is shown in Figure 2, along with the estimated density and vector ﬁeld projected on the true manifold (sphere). Model Recovered Latitudinal (a) Longitudinal (b) Figure 2: (a): Sphere with latitudinal vector ﬁeld, i.e East-West asymmetry, with Wew > Wwe if node w lies to the West of node e. The graph nodes are sampled non-uniformly, with the topographic map of the world as sampling density. We sample n = 5000 nodes, and observe only the resulting W matrix, but not the node locations. From W , our algorithm estimates the sample locations (geometry), the vector ﬁeld (black arrows) generating the observed asymmetries, and the sampling distribution at each data point (colormap). (b) Vector ﬁelds on a spherical region (blue), and their estimates (red): latitudinal vector ﬁeld tangent to the manifold (left) and longitudinal vector ﬁeld with component perpendicular to manifold tangent plane (right). Both the estimated density and vector ﬁeld agree with the true model, demonstrating that for artiﬁcial data, the recovery algorithm 1 performs quite well. We note that the estimated density does not recover all the details of the original density, even for large sample size (here n = 5000 with = 0.07). Meanwhile, the estimated vector ﬁeld performs quite well even when the sampling is reduced to n = 500 with = 0.1. This can be seen in Figure 2, b, where the true and estimated vector ﬁelds are superimposed. Figure 2 also demonstrates how r · only recovers the tangential component of r. The estimated geometry is not shown on any of these ﬁgures, since the success of the diffusion map in recovering the geometry for such a simple manifold is already well established [2, 9]. Real DataThe National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) 1979 Cohort is a representative sample of young men and women in the United States who were followed from 1979 to 2000 [12, 13]. The aim here is to use this survey to obtain a representation of the job market as a diffusion process over a manifold. The data set consists of a sample of 7,816 individual career sequences of length 64, listing the jobs a particular individual held every quarter between the ages of 20 and 36. Each token in the sequence identiﬁes a job. Each job corresponds to an industry × occupation pair. There are 25 unique industry and 20 unique occupation indices. Out of the 500 possible pairings, approximately 450 occur in the data, with only 213 occurring with sufﬁcient frequency to be included here. Thus, our graph G has 213 nodes - the jobs - and our observations consist of 7,816 walks between the graph nodes. We convert these walks to a directed graph with afﬁnity matrix W . Speciﬁcally, Wij represents the number of times a transition from job i to job j was observed (Note that this matrix is asymmetric, 6 i.e Wij = Wji ). Normalizing each row i of W by its outdegree di gives P = diag(di )−1 W , the non-parametric maximum likelihood estimator for the Markov chain over G for the progression (0) of career sequences. This Markov chain has as limit operator Haa , as the granularity of the job market increases along with the number of observations. Thus, in trying to recover the geometry, distribution and vector ﬁeld, we are actually interested in estimating the full advective effect of the (0) diffusion process generated by Haa ; that is, we want to estimate r · − 2 U · where we can use (0) (1) −2 U · = Hss − Hss to complement Algorithm 1. 0.25 1600 0.05 0.1 1400 0.1 3 0.7 1800 0.15 ! 0.8 0.15 0.2 0.9 0.2 2000 0.25 !30.05 0.6 0.5 0 0 0.4 1200 −0.05 −0.05 −0.1 0.3 −0.1 1000 0.2 −0.15 −0.15 800 −0.2 −0.25 0.1 −0.2 −0.25 −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (a) −0.1 −0.05 0 !2 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 (b) Figure 3: Embedding the job market along with ﬁeld r − 2 U over the ﬁrst two non-constant eigenvectors. The color map corresponds to the mean monthly wage in dollars (a) and to the female proportion (b) for each job. We obtain an embedding of the job market that describes the relative position of jobs, their distribution, and the natural time progression from each job. Of these, the relative position and natural time progression are the most interesting. Together, they summarize the job market dynamics by describing which jobs are naturally “close” as well as where they can lead in the future. From a public policy perspective, this can potentially improve focus on certain jobs for helping individuals attain better upward mobility. The job market was found to be a high dimensional manifold. We present only the ﬁrst two dimen(0) sions, that is, the second and third eigenvectors of Hss , since the ﬁrst eigenvector is uninformative (constant) by construction. The eigenvectors showed correlation with important demographic data, such as wages and gender. Figure 3 displays this two-dimensional sub-embedding along with the directional information r − 2 U for each dimension. The plot shows very little net progression toward regions of increasing mean salary3 . This is somewhat surprising, but it is easy to overstate this observation: diffusion alone would be enough to move the individuals towards higher salary. What Figure 3 (a) suggests is that there appear to be no “external forces” advecting individuals towards higher salary. Nevertheless, there appear to be other external forces at play in the job market: Figure 3 (b), which is analogous to Figure 3 (a), but with gender replacing the salary color scheme, suggests that these forces push individuals towards greater gender differentiation. This is especially true amongst male-dominated jobs which appear to be advected toward the left edge of the embedding. Hence, this simple analysis of the job market can be seen as an indication that males and females tend to move away from each other over time, while neither seems to have a monopoly on high- or low- paying jobs. 6 Discussion This paper makes three contributions: (1) it introduces a manifold-based generative model for directed graphs with weighted edges, (2) it obtains asymptotic results for operators constructed from the directed graphs, and (3) these asymptotic results lead to a natural algorithm for estimating the model. 3 It is worth noting that in the NLSY data set, high paying jobs are teacher, nurse and mechanic. This is due to the fact that the career paths observed stop at at age 36, which is relatively early in an individual’s career. 7 Generative Models that assume that data are sampled from a manifold are standard for undirected graphs, but to our knowledge, none have yet been proposed for directed graphs. When W is symmetric, it is natural to assume that it depends on the points’ proximity. For asymmetric afﬁnities W , one must include an additional component to explain the asymmetry. In the asymptotic limit, this is tantamount to deﬁning a vector ﬁeld on the manifold. Algorithm We have used from [9] the idea of deﬁning anisotropic kernels (indexed by α) in order to separate the density p and the manifold geometry M. Also, we adopted their general assumptions about the symmetric part of the kernel. As a consequence, the recovery algorithm for p and M is identical to theirs. However, insofar as the asymmetric part of the kernel is concerned, everything, starting from the deﬁnition and the introduction of the vector ﬁeld r as a way to model the asymmetry, through the derivation of the asymptotic expression for the symmetric plus asymmetric kernel, is new. We go signiﬁcantly beyond the elegant idea of [9] regarding the use of anisotropic kernels by analyzing the four distinct renormalizations possible for a given α, each of them combining different aspects of M, p and r. Only the successful (and novel) combination of two different anisotropic operators is able to recover the directional ﬂow r. Algorithm 1 is natural, but we do not claim it is the only possible one in the context of our model. (α) For instance, we can also use Hsa to recover the operator · r (which empirically seems to have worse numerical properties than r · ). In the National Longitudinal Survery of Youth study, we were interested in the whole advective term, so we estimated it from a different combination of operators. Depending on the speciﬁc question, other features of the model could be obtained Limit Results Proposition 3.1 is a general result on the asymptotics of asymmetric kernels. Recovering the manifold and r is just one, albeit the most useful, of the many ways of exploiting these (0) results. For instance, Hsa is the limit operator of the operators used in [3] and [5]. The limit analysis could be extended to other digraph embedding algorithms such as [4, 6]. How general is our model? Any kernel can be decomposed into a symmetric and an asymmetric part, as we have done. The assumptions on the symmetric part h are standard. The paper of [7] goes one step further from these assumptions; we will discuss it in relationship with our work shortly. The more interesting question is how limiting are our assumptions regarding the choice of kernel, especially the asymmetric part, which we parameterized as a (x, y) = r/2 · (y − x)h (x, y) in (4). In the asymptotic limit, this choice turns out to be fully general, at least up to the identiﬁable aspects of the model. For a more detailed discussion of this issue, see [8]. In [7], Ting, Huang and Jordan presented asymptotic results for a general family of kernels that includes asymmetric and random kernels. Our k can be expressed in the notation of [7] by taking wx (y) ← 1+r(x, y)·(y−x), rx (y) ← 1, K0 ← h, h ← . Their assumptions are more general than the assumptions we make here, yet our model is general up to what can be identiﬁed from G alone. The distinction arises because [7] focuses on the graph construction methods from an observed sample of M, while we focus on explaining an observed directed graph G through a manifold generative process. Moreover, while the [7] results can be used to analyze data from directed graphs, they differ from our Proposition 3.1. Speciﬁcally, with respect to the limit in Theorem 3 from [7], we obtain the additional source terms f (x) · r and c(x)f (x) that follow from not enforcing (α) (α) conservation of mass while deﬁning operators Hsa and Has . We applied our theory of directed graph embedding to the analysis of the career sequences in Section 5, but asymmetric afﬁnity data abound in other social contexts, and in the physical and life sciences. Indeed, any “similarity” score that is obtained from a likelihood of the form Wvu =likelihood(u|v) is generally asymmetric. Hence our methods can be applied to study not only social networks, but also patterns of human movement, road trafﬁc, and trade relations, as well as alignment scores in molecular biology. Finally, the physical interpretation of our model also makes it naturally applicable to physical models of ﬂows.

<p>Author: Xinggang Wang, Xiang Bai, Xingwei Yang, Wenyu Liu, Longin J. Latecki</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel inference framework for ﬁnding maximal cliques in a weighted graph that satisfy hard constraints. The constraints specify the graph nodes that must belong to the solution as well as mutual exclusions of graph nodes, i.e., sets of nodes that cannot belong to the same solution. The proposed inference is based on a novel particle ﬁlter algorithm with state permeations. We apply the inference framework to a challenging problem of learning part-based, deformable object models. Two core problems in the learning framework, matching of image patches and ﬁnding salient parts, are formulated as two instances of the problem of ﬁnding maximal cliques with hard constraints. Our learning framework yields discriminative part based object models that achieve very good detection rate, and outperform other methods on object classes with large deformation. 1</p><p>4 0.5965482 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-On_Learning_Discrete_Graphical_Models_using_Greedy_Methods.html">195 nips-2011-On Learning Discrete Graphical Models using Greedy Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Christopher C. Johnson, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise graphical model from samples in a high-dimensional setting. Our ﬁrst main result studies the sparsistency, or consistency in sparsity pattern recovery, properties of a forward-backward greedy algorithm as applied to general statistical models. As a special case, we then apply this algorithm to learn the structure of a discrete graphical model via neighborhood estimation. As a corollary of our general result, we derive sufﬁcient conditions on the number of samples n, the maximum nodedegree d and the problem size p, as well as other conditions on the model parameters, so that the algorithm recovers all the edges with high probability. Our result guarantees graph selection for samples scaling as n = Ω(d2 log(p)), in contrast to existing convex-optimization based algorithms that require a sample complexity of Ω(d3 log(p)). Further, the greedy algorithm only requires a restricted strong convexity condition which is typically milder than irrepresentability assumptions. We corroborate these results using numerical simulations at the end.</p><p>5 0.53116983 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Noise_Thresholds_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">186 nips-2011-Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>6 0.52002525 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Generalised_Coupled_Tensor_Factorisation.html">102 nips-2011-Generalised Coupled Tensor Factorisation</a></p>

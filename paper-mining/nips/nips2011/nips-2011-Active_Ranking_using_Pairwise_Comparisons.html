<p>Author: Michael L. Wick, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to probabilistic inference such as loopy belief propagation and Gibbs sampling typically compute marginals for all the unobserved variables in a graphical model. However, in many real-world applications the user’s interests are focused on a subset of the variables, speciﬁed by a query. In this case it would be wasteful to uniformly sample, say, one million variables when the query concerns only ten. In this paper we propose a query-speciﬁc approach to MCMC that accounts for the query variables and their generalized mutual information with neighboring variables in order to achieve higher computational efﬁciency. Surprisingly there has been almost no previous work on query-aware MCMC. We demonstrate the success of our approach with positive experimental results on a wide range of graphical models. 1</p><p>3 0.30725056 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Randomized_Algorithms_for_Comparison-based_Search.html">231 nips-2011-Randomized Algorithms for Comparison-based Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Dominique Tschopp, Suhas Diggavi, Payam Delgosha, Soheil Mohajer</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ﬁnding the nearest neighbor (or one of the R-nearest neighbors) of a query object q in a database of n objects, when we can only use a comparison oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query object. The main problem we study is how to search the database for the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the questions. The difﬁculty of this problem depends on properties of the underlying database. We show the importance of a characterization: combinatorial disorder D which deﬁnes approximate triangle n inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound of Ω(D log D + D2 ) average number of questions in the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates the fundamental role of D for worst case behavior. We develop 3 a randomized scheme for NN retrieval in O(D3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) 3 questions. The learning requires asking O(nD3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) questions and O(n log2 n/ log(2D)) bits to store.</p><p>4 0.21640463 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, Tamara L. Berg</p><p>Abstract: We develop and demonstrate automatic image description methods using a large captioned photo collection. One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset – performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then ﬁltering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning. 1</p><p>5 0.21106149 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Active_Learning_Ranking_from_Pairwise_Preferences_with_Almost_Optimal_Query_Complexity.html">20 nips-2011-Active Learning Ranking from Pairwise Preferences with Almost Optimal Query Complexity</a></p>
<p>Author: Nir Ailon</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n elements we wish to linearly order them using pairwise preference labels which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise). The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(n poly(log n, ε−1 )) preference labels for a regret of ε times the optimal loss. This is strictly better, and often signiﬁcantly better than what non-adaptive sampling could achieve. Our main result helps settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? 1</p><p>6 0.17109641 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Penalty_Decomposition_Methods_for_Rank_Minimization.html">211 nips-2011-Penalty Decomposition Methods for Rank Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew A. Kayala, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Being able to predict the course of arbitrary chemical reactions is essential to the theory and applications of organic chemistry. Previous approaches are not highthroughput, are not generalizable or scalable, or lack sufﬁcient data to be effective. We describe single mechanistic reactions as concerted electron movements from an electron orbital source to an electron orbital sink. We use an existing rule-based expert system to derive a dataset consisting of 2,989 productive mechanistic steps and 6.14 million non-productive mechanistic steps. We then pose identifying productive mechanistic steps as a ranking problem: rank potential orbital interactions such that the top ranked interactions yield the major products. The machine learning implementation follows a two-stage approach, in which we ﬁrst train atom level reactivity ﬁlters to prune 94.0% of non-productive reactions with less than a 0.1% false negative rate. Then, we train an ensemble of ranking models on pairs of interacting orbitals to learn a relative productivity function over single mechanistic reactions in a given system. Without the use of explicit transformation patterns, the ensemble perfectly ranks the productive mechanisms at the top 89.1% of the time, rising to 99.9% of the time when top ranked lists with at most four nonproductive reactions are considered. The ﬁnal system allows multi-step reaction prediction. Furthermore, it is generalizable, making reasonable predictions over reactants and conditions which the rule-based expert system does not handle.</p><p>6 0.49577421 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Stochastic_convex_optimization_with_bandit_feedback.html">272 nips-2011-Stochastic convex optimization with bandit feedback</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph L. Austerweil, Abram L. Friesen, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The object people perceive in an image can depend on its orientation relative to the scene it is in (its reference frame). For example, the images of the symbols × and + differ by a 45 degree rotation. Although real scenes have multiple images and reference frames, psychologists have focused on scenes with only one reference frame. We propose an ideal observer model based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics for inferring the number of reference frames in a scene and their parameters. When an ambiguous image could be assigned to two conﬂicting reference frames, the model predicts two factors should inﬂuence the reference frame inferred for the image: The image should be more likely to share the reference frame of the closer object (proximity) and it should be more likely to share the reference frame containing the most objects (alignment). We conﬁrm people use both cues using a novel methodology that allows for easy testing of human reference frame inference. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.94673216 <a title="22-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons.html">22 nips-2011-Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons</a></p>

<p>Author: Fatma K. Karzan, Arkadi S. Nemirovski, Boris T. Polyak, Anatoli Juditsky</p><p>Abstract: We discuss new methods for the recovery of signals with block-sparse structure, based on 1 -minimization. Our emphasis is on the efﬁciently computable error bounds for the recovery routines. We optimize these bounds with respect to the method parameters to construct the estimators with improved statistical properties. We justify the proposed approach with an oracle inequality which links the properties of the recovery algorithms and the best estimation performance. 1</p><p>4 0.93644047 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>5 0.93596846 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>
<p>Author: Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using similarity/distance functions over data. Speciﬁcally, we propose a framework for deﬁning the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework uniﬁes and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [1] and [2]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a ﬁxed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classiﬁer from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a signiﬁcant margin. 1</p><p>6 0.93416572 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Category_Structure_Aware_Image_Categorization.html">141 nips-2011-Large-Scale Category Structure Aware Image Categorization</a></p>

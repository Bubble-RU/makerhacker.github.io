<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>3 0.1640863 <a title="142-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Features_for_PCA-Like_Linear_Regression.html">260 nips-2011-Sparse Features for PCA-Like Linear Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Christos Boutsidis, Petros Drineas, Malik Magdon-Ismail</p><p>Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) is often used as a feature extraction procedure. Given a matrix X ∈ Rn×d , whose rows represent n data points with respect to d features, the top k right singular vectors of X (the so-called eigenfeatures), are arbitrary linear combinations of all available features. The eigenfeatures are very useful in data analysis, including the regularization of linear regression. Enforcing sparsity on the eigenfeatures, i.e., forcing them to be linear combinations of only a small number of actual features (as opposed to all available features), can promote better generalization error and improve the interpretability of the eigenfeatures. We present deterministic and randomized algorithms that construct such sparse eigenfeatures while provably achieving in-sample performance comparable to regularized linear regression. Our algorithms are relatively simple and practically efﬁcient, and we demonstrate their performance on several data sets.</p><p>4 0.14442681 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Demixed_Principal_Component_Analysis.html">68 nips-2011-Demixed Principal Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Wieland Brendel, Ranulfo Romo, Christian K. Machens</p><p>Abstract: In many experiments, the data points collected live in high-dimensional observation spaces, yet can be assigned a set of labels or parameters. In electrophysiological recordings, for instance, the responses of populations of neurons generally depend on mixtures of experimentally controlled parameters. The heterogeneity and diversity of these parameter dependencies can make visualization and interpretation of such data extremely difﬁcult. Standard dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) can provide a succinct and complete description of the data, but the description is constructed independent of the relevant task variables and is often hard to interpret. Here, we start with the assumption that a particularly informative description is one that reveals the dependency of the high-dimensional data on the individual parameters. We show how to modify the loss function of PCA so that the principal components seek to capture both the maximum amount of variance about the data, while also depending on a minimum number of parameters. We call this method demixed principal component analysis (dPCA) as the principal components here segregate the parameter dependencies. We phrase the problem as a probabilistic graphical model, and present a fast Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm for electrophysiological data and show that it serves to demix the parameter-dependence of a neural population response. 1</p><p>5 0.12398791 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis A. Gkioulekas, Todd Zickler</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach for linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction, based on the sparse linear model that has been used to probabilistically interpret sparse coding. We formulate an optimization problem for learning a linear projection from the original signal domain to a lower-dimensional one in a way that approximately preserves, in expectation, pairwise inner products in the sparse domain. We derive solutions to the problem, present nonlinear extensions, and discuss relations to compressed sensing. Our experiments using facial images, texture patches, and images of object categories suggest that the approach can improve our ability to recover meaningful structure in many classes of signals. 1</p><p>6 0.1213544 <a title="142-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Inverse_Covariance_Matrix_Estimation_Using_Quadratic_Approximation.html">262 nips-2011-Sparse Inverse Covariance Matrix Estimation Using Quadratic Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Paramveer Dhillon, Dean P. Foster, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: Recently, there has been substantial interest in using large amounts of unlabeled data to learn word representations which can then be used as features in supervised classiﬁers for NLP tasks. However, most current approaches are slow to train, do not model the context of the word, and lack theoretical grounding. In this paper, we present a new learning method, Low Rank Multi-View Learning (LR-MVL) which uses a fast spectral method to estimate low dimensional context-speciﬁc word representations from unlabeled data. These representation features can then be used with any supervised learner. LR-MVL is extremely fast, gives guaranteed convergence to a global optimum, is theoretically elegant, and achieves state-ofthe-art performance on named entity recognition (NER) and chunking problems. 1 Introduction and Related Work Over the past decade there has been increased interest in using unlabeled data to supplement the labeled data in semi-supervised learning settings to overcome the inherent data sparsity and get improved generalization accuracies in high dimensional domains like NLP. Approaches like [1, 2] have been empirically very successful and have achieved excellent accuracies on a variety of NLP tasks. However, it is often difﬁcult to adapt these approaches to use in conjunction with an existing supervised NLP system as these approaches enforce a particular choice of model. An increasingly popular alternative is to learn representational embeddings for words from a large collection of unlabeled data (typically using a generative model), and to use these embeddings to augment the feature set of a supervised learner. Embedding methods produce features in low dimensional spaces or over a small vocabulary size, unlike the traditional approach of working in the original high dimensional vocabulary space with only one dimension “on” at a given time. Broadly, these embedding methods fall into two categories: 1. Clustering based word representations: Clustering methods, often hierarchical, are used to group distributionally similar words based on their contexts. The two dominant approaches are Brown Clustering [3] and [4]. As recently shown, HMMs can also be used to induce a multinomial distribution over possible clusters [5]. 2. Dense representations: These representations are dense, low dimensional and real-valued. Each dimension of these representations captures latent information about a combination of syntactic and semantic word properties. They can either be induced using neural networks like C&W; embeddings [6] and Hierarchical log-linear (HLBL) embeddings [7] or by eigen-decomposition of the word co-occurrence matrix, e.g. Latent Semantic Analysis/Latent Semantic Indexing (LSA/LSI) [8]. Unfortunately, most of these representations are 1). slow to train, 2). sensitive to the scaling of the embeddings (especially 2 based approaches like LSA/PCA), 3). can get stuck in local optima (like EM trained HMM) and 4). learn a single embedding for a given word type; i.e. all the occurrences 1 of the word “bank” will have the same embedding, irrespective of whether the context of the word suggests it means “a ﬁnancial institution” or “a river bank”. In this paper, we propose a novel context-speciﬁc word embedding method called Low Rank MultiView Learning, LR-MVL, which is fast to train and is guaranteed to converge to the optimal solution. As presented here, our LR-MVL embeddings are context-speciﬁc, but context oblivious embeddings (like the ones used by [6, 7]) can be trivially gotten from our model. Furthermore, building on recent advances in spectral learning for sequence models like HMMs [9, 10, 11] we show that LR-MVL has strong theoretical grounding. Particularly, we show that LR-MVL estimates low dimensional context-speciﬁc word embeddings which preserve all the information in the data if the data were generated by an HMM. Moreover, LR-MVL being linear does not face the danger of getting stuck in local optima as is the case for an EM trained HMM. LR-MVL falls into category (2) mentioned above; it learns real-valued context-speciﬁc word embeddings by performing Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) [12] between the past and future views of low rank approximations of the data. However, LR-MVL is more general than those methods, which work on bigram or trigram co-occurrence matrices, in that it uses longer word sequence information to estimate context-speciﬁc embeddings and also for the reasons mentioned in the last paragraph. The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In the next section we give a brief overview of CCA, which forms the core of our method. Section 3 describes our proposed LR-MVL algorithm in detail and gives theory supporting its performance. Section 4 demonstrates the effectiveness of LR-MVL on the NLP tasks of Named Entity Recognition and Chunking. We conclude with a brief summary in Section 5. 2 Brief Review: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) CCA [12] is the analog to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for pairs of matrices. PCA computes the directions of maximum covariance between elements in a single matrix, whereas CCA computes the directions of maximal correlation between a pair of matrices. Unlike PCA, CCA does not depend on how the observations are scaled. This invariance of CCA to linear data transformations allows proofs that keeping the dominant singular vectors (those with largest singular values) will faithfully capture any state information. More speciﬁcally, given a set of n paired observation vectors {(l1 , r1 ), ..., (ln , rn )}–in our case the two matrices are the left (L) and right (R) context matrices of a word–we would like to simultaneously ﬁnd the directions Φl and Φr that maximize the correlation of the projections of L onto Φl with the projections of R onto Φr . This is expressed as max Φl ,Φr E[ L, Φl R, Φr ] E[ L, Φl 2 ]E[ R, Φr 2 ] (1) where E denotes the empirical expectation. We use the notation Clr (Cll ) to denote the cross (auto) covariance matrices between L and R (i.e. L’R and L’L respectively.). The left and right canonical correlates are the solutions Φl , Φr of the following equations: Cll −1 Clr Crr −1 Crl Φl = λΦl Crr −1 Crl Cll −1 Clr Φr = λΦr 3 (2) Low Rank Multi-View Learning (LR-MVL) In LR-MVL, we compute the CCA between the past and future views of the data on a large unlabeled corpus to ﬁnd the common latent structure, i.e., the hidden state associated with each token. These induced representations of the tokens can then be used as features in a supervised classiﬁer (typically discriminative). The context around a word, consisting of the h words to the right and left of it, sits in a high dimensional space, since for a vocabulary of size v, each of the h words in the context requires an indicator function of dimension v. The key move in LR-MVL is to project the v-dimensional word 2 space down to a k dimensional state space. Thus, all eigenvector computations are done in a space that is v/k times smaller than the original space. Since a typical vocabulary contains at least 50, 000 words, and we use state spaces of order k ≈ 50 dimensions, this gives a 1,000-fold reduction in the size of calculations that are needed. The core of our LR-MVL algorithm is a fast spectral method for learning a v × k matrix A which maps each of the v words in the vocabulary to a k-dimensional state vector. We call this matrix the “eigenfeature dictionary”. We now describe the LR-MVL method, give a theorem that provides intuition into how it works, and formally present the LR-MVL algorithm. The Experiments section then shows that this low rank approximation allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance on NLP tasks. 3.1 The LR-MVL method Given an unlabeled token sequence w={w0 , w1 , . . ., wn } we want to learn a low (k)- dimensional state vector {z0 , z1 , . . . , zn } for each observed token. The key is to ﬁnd a v ×k matrix A (Algorithm 1) that maps each of the v words in the vocabulary to a reduced rank k-dimensional state vector, which is later used to induce context speciﬁc embeddings for the tokens (Algorithm 2). For supervised learning, these context speciﬁc embeddings are supplemented with other information about each token wt , such as its identity, orthographic features such as preﬁxes and sufﬁxes or membership in domain-speciﬁc lexicons, and used as features in a classiﬁer. Section 3.4 gives the algorithm more formally, but the key steps in the algorithm are, in general terms: • Take the h words to the left and to the right of each target word wt (the “Left” and “Right” contexts), and project them each down to k dimensions using A. • Take the CCA between the reduced rank left and right contexts, and use the resulting model to estimate a k dimensional state vector (the “hidden state”) for each token. • Take the CCA between the hidden states and the tokens wt . The singular vectors associated with wt form a new estimate of the eigenfeature dictionary. LR-MVL can be viewed as a type of co-training [13]: The state of each token wt is similar to that of the tokens both before and after it, and it is also similar to the states of the other occurrences of the same word elsewhere in the document (used in the outer iteration). LR-MVL takes advantage of these two different types of similarity by alternately estimating word state using CCA on the smooths of the states of the words before and after each target token and using the average over the states associated with all other occurrences of that word. 3.2 Theoretical Properties of LR-MVL We now present the theory behind the LR-MVL algorithm; particularly we show that the reduced rank matrix A allows a signiﬁcant data reduction while preserving the information in our data and the estimated state does the best possible job of capturing any label information that can be inferred by a linear model. Let L be an n × hv matrix giving the words in the left context of each of the n tokens, where the context is of length h, R be the corresponding n × hv matrix for the right context, and W be an n × v matrix of indicator functions for the words themselves. We will use the following assumptions at various points in our proof: Assumption 1. L, W, and R come from a rank k HMM i.e. it has a rank k observation matrix and rank k transition matrix both of which have the same domain. For example, if the dimension of the hidden state is k and the vocabulary size is v then the observation matrix, which is k × v, has rank k. This rank condition is similar to the one used by [10]. Assumption 1A. For the three views, L, W and R assume that there exists a “hidden state H” of dimension n × k, where each row Hi has the same non-singular variance-covariance matrix and 3 such that E(Li |Hi ) = Hi β T and E(Ri |Hi ) = Hi β T and E(Wi |Hi ) = Hi β T where all β’s are of L R W rank k, where Li , Ri and Wi are the rows of L, R and W respectively. Assumption 1A follows from Assumption 1. Assumption 2. ρ(L, W), ρ(L, R) and ρ(W, R) all have rank k, where ρ(X1 , X2 ) is the expected correlation between X1 and X2 . Assumption 2 is a rank condition similar to that in [9]. Assumption 3. ρ([L, R], W) has k distinct singular values. Assumption 3 just makes the proof a little cleaner, since if there are repeated singular values, then the singular vectors are not unique. Without it, we would have to phrase results in terms of subspaces with identical singular values. We also need to deﬁne the CCA function that computes the left and right singular vectors for a pair of matrices: Deﬁnition 1 (CCA). Compute the CCA between two matrices X1 and X2 . Let ΦX1 be a matrix containing the d largest singular vectors for X1 (sorted from the largest on down). Likewise for ΦX2 . Deﬁne the function CCAd (X1 , X2 ) = [ΦX1 , ΦX2 ]. When we want just one of these Φ’s, we will use CCAd (X1 , X2 )left = ΦX1 for the left singular vectors and CCAd (X1 , X2 )right = ΦX2 for the right singular vectors. Note that the resulting singular vectors, [ΦX1 , ΦX2 ] can be used to give two redundant estimates, X1 ΦX1 and X2 ΦX2 of the “hidden” state relating X1 and X2 , if such a hidden state exists. Deﬁnition 2. Deﬁne the symbol “≈” to mean X1 ≈ X2 ⇐⇒ lim X1 = lim X2 n→∞ n→∞ where n is the sample size. Lemma 1. Deﬁne A by the following limit of the right singular vectors: CCAk ([L, R], W)right ≈ A. Under assumptions 2, 3 and 1A, such that if CCAk (L, R) ≡ [ΦL , ΦR ] then CCAk ([LΦL , RΦR ], W)right ≈ A. Lemma 1 shows that instead of ﬁnding the CCA between the full context and the words, we can take the CCA between the Left and Right contexts, estimate a k dimensional state from them, and take the CCA of that state with the words and get the same result. See the supplementary material for the Proof. ˜ Let Ah denote a matrix formed by stacking h copies of A on top of each other. Right multiplying ˜ L or R by Ah projects each of the words in that context into the k-dimensional reduced rank space. The following theorem addresses the core of the LR-MVL algorithm, showing that there is an A which gives the desired dimensionality reduction. Speciﬁcally, it shows that the previous lemma also holds in the reduced rank space. Theorem 1. Under assumptions 1, 2 and 3 there exists a unique matrix A such that if ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ CCAk (LAh , RAh ) ≡ [ΦL , ΦR ] then ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ CCAk ([LAh ΦL , RAh ΦR ], W)right ≈ A ˜ where Ah is the stacked form of A. See the supplementary material for the Proof 1 . ˆ It is worth noting that our matrix A corresponds to the matrix U used by [9, 10]. They showed that U is sufﬁcient to compute the probability of a sequence of words generated by an HMM; although we do not show ˆ it here (due to limited space), our A provides a more statistically efﬁcient estimate of U than their U , and hence can also be used to estimate the sequence probabilities. 1 4 Under the above assumptions, there is asymptotically (in the limit of inﬁnite data) no beneﬁt to ﬁrst estimating state by ﬁnding the CCA between the left and right contexts and then ﬁnding the CCA between the estimated state and the words. One could instead just directly ﬁnd the CCA between the combined left and rights contexts and the words. However, because of the Zipﬁan distribution of words, many words are rare or even unique, and hence one is not in the asymptotic limit. In this case, CCA between the rare words and context will not be informative, whereas ﬁnding the CCA between the left and right contexts gives a good state vector estimate even for unique words. One can then fruitfully ﬁnd the CCA between the contexts and the estimated state vector for their associated words. 3.3 Using Exponential Smooths In practice, we replace the projected left and right contexts with exponential smooths (weighted average of the previous (or next) token’s state i.e. Zt−1 (or Zt+1 ) and previous (or next) token’s smoothed state i.e. St−1 (or St+1 ).), of them at a few different time scales, thus giving a further dimension reduction by a factor of context length h (say 100 words) divided by the number of smooths (often 5-7). We use a mixture of both very short and very long contexts which capture short and long range dependencies as required by NLP problems as NER, Chunking, WSD etc. Since exponential smooths are linear, we preserve the linearity of our method. 3.4 The LR-MVL Algorithm The LR-MVL algorithm (using exponential smooths) is given in Algorithm 1; it computes the pair of CCAs described above in Theorem 1. Algorithm 1 LR-MVL Algorithm - Learning from Large amounts of Unlabeled Data 1: Input: Token sequence Wn×v , state space size k, smoothing rates αj 2: Initialize the eigenfeature dictionary A to random values N (0, 1). 3: repeat 4: Set the state Zt (1 < t ≤ n) of each token wt to the eigenfeature vector of the corresponding word. Zt = (Aw : w = wt ) 5: Smooth the state estimates before and after each token to get a pair of views for each smoothing rate αj . (l,j) (l,j) = (1 − αj )St−1 + αj Zt−1 // left view L St (r,j) (r,j) j St = (1 − α )St+1 + αj Zt+1 // right view R. (l,j) (r,j) th where the t rows of L and R are, respectively, concatenations of the smooths St and St for (j) each of the α s. 6: Find the left and right canonical correlates, which are the eigenvectors Φl and Φr of (L L)−1 L R(R R)−1 R LΦl = λΦl . (R R)−1 R L(L L)−1 L RΦr = λΦr . 7: Project the left and right views on to the space spanned by the top k/2 left and right CCAs respectively (k/2) (k/2) Xl = LΦl and Xr = RΦr (k/2) (k/2) where Φl , Φr are matrices composed of the singular vectors of Φl , Φr with the k/2 largest magnitude singular values. Estimate the state for each word wt as the union of the left and right estimates: Z = [Xl , Xr ] 8: Estimate the eigenfeatures of each word type, w, as the average of the states estimated for that word. Aw = avg(Zt : wt = w) 9: Compute the change in A from the previous iteration 10: until |∆A| < 11: Output: Φk , Φk , A . r l A few iterations (∼ 5) of the above algorithm are sufﬁcient to converge to the solution. (Since the problem is convex, there is a single solution, so there is no issue of local minima.) As [14] show for PCA, one can start with a random matrix that is only slightly larger than the true rank k of the correlation matrix, and with extremely high likelihood converge in a few iterations to within a small distance of the true principal components. In our case, if the assumptions detailed above (1, 1A, 2 and 3) are satisﬁed, our method converges equally rapidly to the true canonical variates. As mentioned earlier, we get further dimensionality reduction in Step 5, by replacing the Left and Right context matrices with a set of exponentially smoothed values of the reduced rank projections of the context words. Step 6 ﬁnds the CCA between the Left and Right contexts. Step 7 estimates 5 the state by combining the estimates from the left and right contexts, since we don’t know which will best estimate the state. Step 8 takes the CCA between the estimated state Z and the matrix of words W. Because W is a vector of indicator functions, this CCA takes the trivial form of a set of averages. Once we have estimated the CCA model, it is used to generate context speciﬁc embeddings for the tokens from training, development and test sets (as described in Algorithm 2). These embeddings are further supplemented with other baseline features and used in a supervised learner to predict the label of the token. Algorithm 2 LR-MVL Algorithm -Inducing Context Speciﬁc Embeddings for Train/Dev/Test Data 1: Input: Model (Φk , Φk , A) output from above algorithm and Token sequences Wtrain , (Wdev , Wtest ) r l 2: Project the left and right views L and R after smoothing onto the space spanned by the top k left and right CCAs respectively Xl = LΦk and Xr = RΦk r l and the words onto the eigenfeature dictionary Xw = W train A 3: Form the ﬁnal embedding matrix Xtrain:embed by concatenating these three estimates of state Xtrain:embed = [Xl , Xw , Xr ] 4: Output: The embedding matrices Xtrain:embed , (Xdev:embed , Xtest:embed ) with context-speciﬁc representations for the tokens. These embeddings are augmented with baseline set of features mentioned in Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 before learning the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Note that we can get context “oblivious” embeddings i.e. one embedding per word type, just by using the eigenfeature dictionary (Av×k ) output by Algorithm 1. 4 Experimental Results In this section we present the experimental results of LR-MVL on Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Syntactic Chunking tasks. We compare LR-MVL to state-of-the-art semi-supervised approaches like [1] (Alternating Structures Optimization (ASO)) and [2] (Semi-supervised extension of CRFs) as well as embeddings like C&W;, HLBL and Brown Clustering. 4.1 Datasets and Experimental Setup For the NER experiments we used the data from CoNLL 2003 shared task and for Chunking experiments we used the CoNLL 2000 shared task data2 with standard training, development and testing set splits. The CoNLL ’03 and the CoNLL ’00 datasets had ∼ 204K/51K/46K and ∼ 212K/ − /47K tokens respectively for Train/Dev./Test sets. 4.1.1 Named Entity Recognition (NER) We use the same set of baseline features as used by [15, 16] in their experiments. The detailed list of features is as below: • Current Word wi ; Its type information: all-capitalized, is-capitalized, all-digits and so on; Preﬁxes and sufﬁxes of wi • Word tokens in window of 2 around the current word i.e. (wi−2 , wi−1 , wi , wi+1 , wi+2 ); and capitalization pattern in the window. d = • Previous two predictions yi−1 and yi−2 and conjunction of d and yi−1 • Embedding features (LR-MVL, C&W;, HLBL, Brown etc.) in a window of 2 around the current word (if applicable). Following [17] we use regularized averaged perceptron model with above set of baseline features for the NER task. We also used their BILOU text chunk representation and fast greedy inference as it was shown to give superior performance. 2 More details about the data and competition are available at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/ conll2003/ner/ and http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/ 6 We also augment the above set of baseline features with gazetteers, as is standard practice in NER experiments. We tuned our free parameter namely the size of LR-MVL embedding on the development and scaled our embedding features to have a 2 norm of 1 for each token and further multiplied them by a normalization constant (also chosen by cross validation), so that when they are used in conjunction with other categorical features in a linear classiﬁer, they do not exert extra inﬂuence. The size of LR-MVL embeddings (state-space) that gave the best performance on the development set was k = 50 (50 each for Xl , Xw , Xr in Algorithm 2) i.e. the total size of embeddings was 50×3, and the best normalization constant was 0.5. We omit validation plots due to paucity of space. 4.1.2 Chunking For our chunking experiments we use a similar base set of features as above: • Current Word wi and word tokens in window of 2 around the current word i.e. d = (wi−2 , wi−1 , wi , wi+1 , wi+2 ); • POS tags ti in a window of 2 around the current word. • Word conjunction features wi ∩ wi+1 , i ∈ {−1, 0} and Tag conjunction features ti ∩ ti+1 , i ∈ {−2, −1, 0, 1} and ti ∩ ti+1 ∩ ti+2 , i ∈ {−2, −1, 0}. • Embedding features in a window of 2 around the current word (when applicable). Since CoNLL 00 chunking data does not have a development set, we randomly sampled 1000 sentences from the training data (8936 sentences) for development. So, we trained our chunking models on 7936 training sentences and evaluated their F1 score on the 1000 development sentences and used a CRF 3 as the supervised classiﬁer. We tuned the size of embedding and the magnitude of 2 regularization penalty in CRF on the development set and took log (or -log of the magnitude) of the value of the features4 . The regularization penalty that gave best performance on development set was 2 and here again the best size of LR-MVL embeddings (state-space) was k = 50. Finally, we trained the CRF on the entire (“original”) training data i.e. 8936 sentences. 4.1.3 Unlabeled Data and Induction of embeddings For inducing the embeddings we used the RCV1 corpus containing Reuters newswire from Aug ’96 to Aug ’97 and containing about 63 million tokens in 3.3 million sentences5 . Case was left intact and we did not do the “cleaning” as done by [18, 16] i.e. remove all sentences which are less than 90% lowercase a-z, as our multi-view learning approach is robust to such noisy data, like news byline text (mostly all caps) which does not correlate strongly with the text of the article. We induced our LR-MVL embeddings over a period of 3 days (70 core hours on 3.0 GHz CPU) on the entire RCV1 data by performing 4 iterations, a vocabulary size of 300k and using a variety of smoothing rates (α in Algorithm 1) to capture correlations between shorter and longer contexts α = [0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 0.9]; theoretically we could tune the smoothing parameters on the development set but we found this mixture of long and short term dependencies to work well in practice. As far as the other embeddings are concerned i.e. C&W;, HLBL and Brown Clusters, we downloaded them from http://metaoptimize.com/projects/wordreprs. The details about their induction and parameter tuning can be found in [16]; we report their best numbers here. It is also worth noting that the unsupervised training of LR-MVL was (> 1.5 times)6 faster than other embeddings. 4.2 Results The results for NER and Chunking are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively, which show that LR-MVL performs signiﬁcantly better than state-of-the-art competing methods on both NER and Chunking tasks. 3 http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/ Our embeddings are learnt using a linear model whereas CRF is a log-linear model, so to keep things on same scale we did this normalization. 5 We chose this particular dataset to make a fair comparison with [1, 16], who report results using RCV1 as unlabeled data. 6 As some of these embeddings were trained on GPGPU which makes our method even faster comparatively. 4 7 Embedding/Model Baseline C&W;, 200-dim HLBL, 100-dim Brown 1000 clusters Ando & Zhang ’05 Suzuki & Isozaki ’08 LR-MVL (CO) 50 × 3-dim LR-MVL 50 × 3-dim HLBL, 100-dim C&W;, 200-dim Brown, 1000 clusters LR-MVL (CO) 50 × 3-dim LR-MVL 50 × 3-dim No Gazetteers With Gazetteers F1-Score Dev.

The current state-of-the-art for this NER task is 90.90 (Test Set) but using 700 billion tokens of unlabeled data [19].

It is important to note that in problems like NER, the ﬁnal accuracy depends on performance on rare-words and since LR-MVL is robustly able to correlate past with future views, it is able to learn better representations for rare words resulting in overall better accuracy. On rare-words (occurring < 10 times in corpus), we got 11.7%, 10.7% and 9.6% relative reduction in error over C&W;, HLBL and Brown respectively for NER; on chunking the corresponding numbers were 6.7%, 7.1% and 8.7%. Also, it is worth mentioning that modeling the context in embeddings gives decent improvements in accuracies on both NER and Chunking problems. For the case of NER, the polysemous words were mostly like Chicago, Wales, Oakland etc., which could either be a location or organization (Sports teams, Banks etc.), so when we don’t use the gazetteer features, (which are known lists of cities, persons, organizations etc.) we got higher increase in F-score by modeling context, compared to the case when we already had gazetteer features which captured most of the information about polysemous words for NER dataset and modeling the context didn’t help as much. The polysemous words for Chunking dataset were like spot (VP/NP), never (VP/ADVP), more (NP/VP/ADVP/ADJP) etc. and in this case embeddings with context helped signiﬁcantly, giving 3.1 − 6.5% relative improvement in accuracy over context oblivious embeddings. 5 Summary and Conclusion In this paper, we presented a novel CCA-based multi-view learning method, LR-MVL, for large scale sequence learning problems such as arise in NLP. LR-MVL is a spectral method that works in low dimensional state-space so it is computationally efﬁcient, and can be used to train using large amounts of unlabeled data; moreover it does not get stuck in local optima like an EM trained HMM. The embeddings learnt using LR-MVL can be used as features with any supervised learner. LR-MVL has strong theoretical grounding; is much simpler and faster than competing methods and achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on NER and Chunking problems.

<p>Author: Yong Zhang, Zhaosong Lu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider general rank minimization problems with rank appearing in either objective function or constraint. We ﬁrst show that a class of matrix optimization problems can be solved as lower dimensional vector optimization problems. As a consequence, we establish that a class of rank minimization problems have closed form solutions. Using this result, we then propose penalty decomposition methods for general rank minimization problems. The convergence results of the PD methods have been shown in the longer version of the paper [19]. Finally, we test the performance of our methods by applying them to matrix completion and nearest low-rank correlation matrix problems. The computational results demonstrate that our methods generally outperform the existing methods in terms of solution quality and/or speed. 1</p><p>6 0.5789845 <a title="142-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Yisong Yue, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: Diversiﬁed retrieval and online learning are two core research areas in the design of modern information retrieval systems. In this paper, we propose the linear submodular bandits problem, which is an online learning setting for optimizing a general class of feature-rich submodular utility models for diversiﬁed retrieval. We present an algorithm, called LSBG REEDY, and prove that it efﬁciently converges to a near-optimal model. As a case study, we applied our approach to the setting of personalized news recommendation, where the system must recommend small sets of news articles selected from tens of thousands of available articles each day.

In particular, two results are obtained: the ﬁrst one shows that, using the unlabeled samples, the conﬁdence term of the conventional bound can be reduced by a factor of three; the second one shows that the unlabeled samples can be used to obtain much tighter bounds, by building localized versions of the hypothesis class containing the optimal classiﬁer. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85356909 <a title="142-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Sparse_Principal_Component_Analysis_with_Application_to_Text_Data.html">142 nips-2011-Large-Scale Sparse Principal Component Analysis with Application to Text Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Youwei Zhang, Laurent E. Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Sparse PCA provides a linear combination of small number of features that maximizes variance across data. Although Sparse PCA has apparent advantages compared to PCA, such as better interpretability, it is generally thought to be computationally much more expensive. In this paper, we demonstrate the surprising fact that sparse PCA can be easier than PCA in practice, and that it can be reliably applied to very large data sets. This comes from a rigorous feature elimination pre-processing result, coupled with the favorable fact that features in real-life data typically have exponentially decreasing variances, which allows for many features to be eliminated. We introduce a fast block coordinate ascent algorithm with much better computational complexity than the existing ﬁrst-order ones. We provide experimental results obtained on text corpora involving millions of documents and hundreds of thousands of features. These results illustrate how Sparse PCA can help organize a large corpus of text data in a user-interpretable way, providing an attractive alternative approach to topic models. 1</p><p>4 0.81382966 <a title="142-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Estimation_with_Structured_Dictionaries.html">259 nips-2011-Sparse Estimation with Structured Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: In the vast majority of recent work on sparse estimation algorithms, performance has been evaluated using ideal or quasi-ideal dictionaries (e.g., random Gaussian or Fourier) characterized by unit ℓ2 norm, incoherent columns or features. But in reality, these types of dictionaries represent only a subset of the dictionaries that are actually used in practice (largely restricted to idealized compressive sensing applications). In contrast, herein sparse estimation is considered in the context of structured dictionaries possibly exhibiting high coherence between arbitrary groups of columns and/or rows. Sparse penalized regression models are analyzed with the purpose of ﬁnding, to the extent possible, regimes of dictionary invariant performance. In particular, a Type II Bayesian estimator with a dictionarydependent sparsity penalty is shown to have a number of desirable invariance properties leading to provable advantages over more conventional penalties such as the ℓ1 norm, especially in areas where existing theoretical recovery guarantees no longer hold. This can translate into improved performance in applications such as model selection with correlated features, source localization, and compressive sensing with constrained measurement directions. 1</p><p>5 0.81034672 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Convergence_Rates_of_Inexact_Proximal-Gradient_Methods_for_Convex_Optimization.html">63 nips-2011-Convergence Rates of Inexact Proximal-Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Schmidt, Nicolas L. Roux, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a non-smooth convex function using proximal-gradient methods, where an error is present in the calculation of the gradient of the smooth term or in the proximity operator with respect to the non-smooth term. We show that both the basic proximal-gradient method and the accelerated proximal-gradient method achieve the same convergence rate as in the error-free case, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates. Using these rates, we perform as well as or better than a carefully chosen ﬁxed error level on a set of structured sparsity problems. 1</p><p>6 0.8094961 <a title="142-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>

</p><p>5 Our results also show that using patient-speciﬁc attributes can reduce the prediction error on survival time by as much as 20% when compared to using cancer site and stage only. [sent-8, score-1.12]
</p><p>6 Many doctors provide patients with statistics on cancer survival based only on the site and stage of the tumor. [sent-10, score-1.214]
</p><p>7 Commonly used statistics include the 5-year survival rate and median survival time, e. [sent-11, score-1.621]
</p><p>8 , a doctor can tell a speciﬁc patient with early stage lung cancer that s/he has a 50% 5-year survival rate. [sent-13, score-1.16]
</p><p>9 While doctors can make adjustments to their survival time predictions based on these individual differences, it is better to directly incorporate these important factors explicitly in the prognostic models – e. [sent-15, score-0.964]
</p><p>10 In survival analysis [2], the Cox proportional hazards model [3] and other parametric survival distributions have long been used to ﬁt the survival time of a population. [sent-21, score-2.513]
</p><p>11 Researchers and clinicians usually apply these models to compare the survival time of two populations or to test for signiﬁcant risk factors affecting survival; n. [sent-22, score-0.838]
</p><p>12 , these models are not designed for the task of predicting survival 1  time for individual patients. [sent-24, score-0.882]
</p><p>13 Also, as these models work with the hazard function instead of the survival function (see Section 2), they might not give good calibrated predictions on survival rates for individuals. [sent-25, score-1.741]
</p><p>14 In this work we propose a new method, multi-task logistic regression (MTLR), to learn patient-speciﬁc survival distributions. [sent-26, score-0.884]
</p><p>15 MTLR directly models the survival function by combining multiple local logistic regression models in a dependent manner. [sent-27, score-0.926]
</p><p>16 Compared to survival regression methods such as the Cox and Aalen regression models, MTLR gives signiﬁcantly more accurate predictions on survival rates over several datasets, including a large cohort of more than 2000 cancer patients. [sent-29, score-1.959]
</p><p>17 MTLR also reduces the prediction error on survival time by 20% when compared to the common practice of using the median survival time based on cancer site and stage. [sent-30, score-1.932]
</p><p>18 Section 2 surveys basic survival analysis and related works. [sent-31, score-0.795]
</p><p>19 Section 3 introduces our method for learning patient-speciﬁc survival distributions. [sent-32, score-0.795]
</p><p>20 By contrast, it is typical to not know many of the outcome values in survival data. [sent-35, score-0.795]
</p><p>21 We refer to the time recorded as the “event time”, whether it is the true survival time, or just the time of the last visit (censoring time). [sent-39, score-0.866]
</p><p>22 Survival analysis provides many tools for modeling the survival time T of a population, such as a group of stage-3 lung cancer patients. [sent-41, score-1.029]
</p><p>23 A basic quantity of interest is the survival function S(t) = P (T ≥ t), which is the probability that an individual within the population will survive longer than time t. [sent-42, score-0.898]
</p><p>24 Given the survival times of a set of individuals, we can plot the proportion of surviving individuals against time, as a way to visualize S(t). [sent-43, score-0.85]
</p><p>25 0  Regression Models in Survival Analysis  One of the most well-known regression model in survival analysis is Cox’s proportional hazards model [3]. [sent-47, score-0.955]
</p><p>26 The regression coefﬁcients θ are estimated by maximizing a partial likelihood objective, which depends only on the relative ordering of survival time of individuals but not on their actual values. [sent-51, score-0.908]
</p><p>27 Cox regression is mostly used for identifying important risk factors associated with survival in clinical studies. [sent-52, score-0.894]
</p><p>28 It is typically not used to predict survival time since the hazard function is incomplete without the baseline hazard λ0 . [sent-53, score-1.017]
</p><p>29 Although we can ﬁt a non-parametric survival function for λ0 (t) after the coefﬁcients of Cox regression are determined [2], this requires a cumbersome 2-step procedure. [sent-54, score-0.855]
</p><p>30 Another weakness of the Cox model is its proportional hazards assumption, which restricts the effect of each feature on survival to be constant over time. [sent-55, score-0.895]
</p><p>31 (Middle) Example binary encoding for patient 1 (uncensored) with survival time 21. [sent-98, score-0.962]
</p><p>32 (Right) Example discrete survival function for a single patient predicted by MTLR. [sent-101, score-0.962]
</p><p>33 While there are now many estimation techniques, goodness-of-ﬁt tests, hypothesis tests for these survival regression models, they are rarely evaluated on the task of predicting survival time of individual patients. [sent-102, score-1.739]
</p><p>34 In this paper we will test our MTLR method, which directly models the survival function, against Cox regression and Aalen regression as representatives of these survival analysis models. [sent-104, score-1.725]
</p><p>35 In machine learning, there are a few recently proposed regression technqiues for survival prediction [7, 8, 9, 10]. [sent-105, score-0.88]
</p><p>36 Moreover, these methods only predict a single survival time value (a real number) without an associated conﬁdence on prediction, which is a serious drawback in clinical applications. [sent-111, score-0.862]
</p><p>37 While we focus on predicting survival time, they instead focused on evaluating the time-varying effect of prognostic factors and worked with the rank-based partial likelihood objective. [sent-114, score-0.859]
</p><p>38 Equivalently, the logistic regression model can be seen as modeling the individual survival probabilities of cancer patients at the time snapshot t. [sent-119, score-1.273]
</p><p>39 Taking this idea one step further, consider modeling the probability of survival of patients at each of a vector of time points τ = (t1 , t2 , . [sent-120, score-0.967]
</p><p>40 This particular setup allows us to answer queries about the survival probability of individual patients at each of the time snapshots {ti }, getting close to our goal of modeling a personal survival time distribution for individual patients. [sent-128, score-1.845]
</p><p>41 MTLR enforces the dependency of the outputs by predicting the survival status of a patient at each of the time snapshots ti jointly instead of independently. [sent-131, score-1.083]
</p><p>42 We encode the survival time s of a patient as a binary sequence y = (y1 , y2 , . [sent-132, score-0.98]
</p><p>43 , ym ), where yi ∈ {0, 1} denotes the survival status of the patient at time ti , so that yi = 0 (no death event yet) for all i with ti < s, and yi = 1 (death) for all i with ti ≥ s (see Figure 1(middle)). [sent-135, score-1.213]
</p><p>44 We denote such an encoding of the survival time s as y(s), and let yi (s) be the value at its ith position. [sent-136, score-0.835]
</p><p>45 The probability of observing the survival status sequence y = (y1 , y2 , . [sent-144, score-0.872]
</p><p>46 Therefore the log likelihood of a set of uncensored patients with survival time s1 , s2 , . [sent-155, score-0.993]
</p><p>47 Since we model the survival distribution as a series of dependent prediction tasks, we call this model multi-task logistic regression (MTLR). [sent-166, score-0.921]
</p><p>48 Figure 1(right) shows an example survival distribution predicted by MTLR for a test patient. [sent-167, score-0.823]
</p><p>49 1  Handling Censored Data  Our multi-task logistic regression model can handle censoring naturally by marginalizing over the unobserved variables in a survival status sequence (y1 , y2 , . [sent-169, score-1.011]
</p><p>50 In summary, the proposed MTLR model holds several advantages over classical regression models in survival analysis for survival time prediction. [sent-181, score-1.693]
</p><p>51 First, it directly models the more intuitive survival function rather than the hazard function (conditional rate of failure/death), avoiding the difﬁculties of choosing between different forms of hazards. [sent-182, score-0.898]
</p><p>52 Second, by modeling the survival distribution as the joint output of a sequence of dependent local regressors, we can capture the time-varying effects of features and handle censored data easily and naturally. [sent-183, score-1.016]
</p><p>53 Third, we will see that our model can give more accurate predictions on survival and better calibrated probabilities (see Section 4), which are important in clinical applications. [sent-184, score-0.909]
</p><p>54 Our goal here is not to replace these tried-and-tested models in survival analysis, which are very effective for hypothesis testing and prognostic factor discovery. [sent-185, score-0.852]
</p><p>55 Unlike typical sequence labeling problems, the sequence construction of our model might be better viewed as a device to obtain a ﬂexible discrete approximation of the survival distribution of individual patients. [sent-192, score-0.864]
</p><p>56 Our approach can also be seen as an instance of multi-task learning [16], where the prediction of individual survival status at each time snapshot tj can be regarded as a separate task. [sent-193, score-0.962]
</p><p>57 However, unlike typical multi-task learning problems, in our model the outputs of different tasks are dependent to satisfy the monotone condition of a survival function. [sent-195, score-0.807]
</p><p>58 About one third of the patients have censored survival times. [sent-197, score-1.094]
</p><p>59 Table 1 shows the groupings of cancer patients in the dataset and the patient-speciﬁc attributes for learning survival distributions. [sent-198, score-1.109]
</p><p>60 We pick the set of time points τ in these experiments to be the 100 points from the 1st percentile up to the 100th percentile of the event time (true survival time or censoring time) over all patients. [sent-201, score-0.975]
</p><p>61 The Cox proportional hazards model is trained using the survival package in R, followed by the ﬁtting of the baseline hazard λ0 (t) using the Kalbﬂeisch-Prentice estimator [2]. [sent-204, score-1.001]
</p><p>62 As a baseline for this cancer registry dataset, we also provide a prediction based on the median survival time and survival probabilities of the subgroup of patients with cancer at a speciﬁc site and at a speciﬁc stage, estimated from the training fold. [sent-207, score-2.295]
</p><p>63 1  Survival Rate Prediction  Our ﬁrst evaluation focuses on the classiﬁcation accuracy and calibration of predicted survival probabilities at different time thresholds. [sent-209, score-0.875]
</p><p>64 Table 2 shows the classiﬁcation accuracy and MSE on the predicted probabilities of different models at 5, 12, and 22 months, which correspond to the 25% lower quantile, median, and 75% upper quantile of the survival time of all the cancer patients in the dataset. [sent-215, score-1.206]
</p><p>65 Our MTLR models produce predictions on survival status and survival probability that are much more accurate than the Cox and Aalen regression models. [sent-216, score-1.776]
</p><p>66 This shows the advantage of directly modeling the survival function instead of going through the hazard function when predicting survival probabilites. [sent-217, score-1.711]
</p><p>67 All regression models (MTLR, Cox, Aalen) beat the baseline prediction using median survival time based on cancer stage and site only, indicating that there is substantial advantage of employing extra clinical information to improve survival time predictions given to cancer patients. [sent-219, score-2.302]
</p><p>68 Patient 1 is a short survivor who lives for only 3 months from diagnosis, while patient 2 is a long survivor whose survival time is censored at 46 months. [sent-222, score-1.254]
</p><p>69 The MTLR model is able to produce smooth survival curves of different shapes for the two patients (one convex with the other one slightly concave), while the Cox model always predict survival curves of similar shapes because of the proportional hazards assumption. [sent-224, score-1.823]
</p><p>70 Indeed it is well known that the survival curves of two individuals never crosses for a Cox model. [sent-225, score-0.82]
</p><p>71 This is a consequence of the linear hazards assumption (Eq (1)), which allows the hazard to become negative and therefore the survival function to increase. [sent-227, score-0.963]
</p><p>72 This problem is less common when predicting survival curves at population level, but could be more frequent for individual survival distribution predictions. [sent-228, score-1.653]
</p><p>73 3  Survival Time Predictions Optimizing Different Loss Functions  Our third evaluation on the predicted survival distributions involves applying them to make predictions that minimize different clinically-relevant loss functions. [sent-230, score-0.884]
</p><p>74 For example, if the patient is interested in knowing whether s/he has weeks, months, or years to live, then measuring errors in terms of the logarithm of the survival time can be appropriate. [sent-231, score-0.962]
</p><p>75 In this case we can measure the loss 6  Table 2: Classiﬁcation accuracy and MSE of survival probability predictions on cancer registry dataset (standard error of 5CV shown in brackets). [sent-232, score-1.084]

</p><p>78 using the absolute error (AE) over log survival time lAE−log (p, t) = | log p − log t|,  (5)  where p and t are the predicted and true survival time respectively. [sent-297, score-1.674]
</p><p>79 In other scenarios, we might be more concerned about the difference of the predicted and true survival time. [sent-298, score-0.823]
</p><p>80 For example, as the cost of hospital stays and medication scales linearly with the survival time, the AE loss on the survival time could be appropriate, i. [sent-299, score-1.642]
</p><p>81 (6)  We also consider an error measure called the relative absolute error (RAE): lRAE (p, t) = min {|(p − t)/p| , 1} ,  (7)  which is essentially AE scaled by the predicted survival time p, since p is known at prediction time in clinical applications. [sent-301, score-0.943]
</p><p>82 The loss is truncated at 1 to prevent large penalizations for small predicted survival time. [sent-302, score-0.847]
</p><p>83 3 means we can expect the true survival time to be within 30% of the predicted time. [sent-304, score-0.851]
</p><p>84 Given any of these loss models l above, we can make a point prediction hl (x) of the survival time for a patient with features x using the survival distribution PΘ estimated by our MTLR model: hl (x) = argmin p∈{t1 ,. [sent-305, score-1.857]

</p><p>86 Table 3 shows the results on optimizing the three proposed loss functions using the individual survival distribution learned with MTLR against other methods. [sent-309, score-0.855]
</p><p>87 We train two CSVR models, one using the survival time and the other using logarithm of the survival time as regression targets, which correspond to minimizing the AE and AE-log loss functions. [sent-311, score-1.73]
</p><p>88 As we do not know the true survival time for censored patients, we adopt the approach of not penalizing a prediction p for a patient with censoring time t if p > t, i. [sent-313, score-1.231]
</p><p>89 Note that it is undesirable to test on uncensored patients only, as the survival time distributions are very different for censored and uncensored patients. [sent-317, score-1.196]
</p><p>90 Moreover MTLR is able to make survival time prediction with improved RAE, which is difﬁcult for CSVR to optimize directly. [sent-435, score-0.848]
</p><p>91 When compared to the baseline of predicting the median survival time by cancer site and stage, MTLR is able to employ extra clinical features to reduce the absolute error on survival time from 11. [sent-437, score-2.0]

</p><p>95 The thresholds are again chosen at 25% lower quantile, median, and 75% upper quantile of the population survival time. [sent-452, score-0.839]
</p><p>96 5  Conclusions  We plan to extend our model to an online system that can update survival predictions with new measurements. [sent-456, score-0.832]
</p><p>97 Our current data come from measurements taken when cancers are ﬁrst diagnosed; it would be useful to be able to update survival predictions for patients incrementally, based on new blood tests or physician’s assessments. [sent-457, score-1.003]
</p><p>98 Experiments on a large cohort of cancer patients show that our model gives much more accurate predictions of survival rates when compared to the Cox or Aalen survival regression models. [sent-459, score-2.032]
</p><p>99 Our results demonstrate that incorporating patient-speciﬁc features can signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of survival prediction over just using cancer site and stage, with prediction errors reduced by as much as 20%. [sent-460, score-1.089]

<p>Author: Hsiu-chin Lin, Vickie Baracos, Russell Greiner, Chun-nam J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: An accurate model of patient survival time can help in the treatment and care of cancer patients. The common practice of providing survival time estimates based only on population averages for the site and stage of cancer ignores many important individual differences among patients. In this paper, we propose a local regression method for learning patient-speciﬁc survival time distribution based on patient attributes such as blood tests and clinical assessments. When tested on a cohort of more than 2000 cancer patients, our method gives survival time predictions that are much more accurate than popular survival analysis models such as the Cox and Aalen regression models. Our results also show that using patient-speciﬁc attributes can reduce the prediction error on survival time by as much as 20% when compared to using cancer site and stage only. 1</p><p>2 0.16236921 <a title="147-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2011-Continuous-Time_Regression_Models_for_Longitudinal_Networks.html">62 nips-2011-Continuous-Time Regression Models for Longitudinal Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Duy Q. Vu, David Hunter, Padhraic Smyth, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: The development of statistical models for continuous-time longitudinal network data is of increasing interest in machine learning and social science. Leveraging ideas from survival and event history analysis, we introduce a continuous-time regression modeling framework for network event data that can incorporate both time-dependent network statistics and time-varying regression coefﬁcients. We also develop an efﬁcient inference scheme that allows our approach to scale to large networks. On synthetic and real-world data, empirical results demonstrate that the proposed inference approach can accurately estimate the coefﬁcients of the regression model, which is useful for interpreting the evolution of the network; furthermore, the learned model has systematically better predictive performance compared to standard baseline methods.</p><p>3 0.070347257 <a title="147-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Regularized_Laplacian_Estimation_and_Fast_Eigenvector_Approximation.html">236 nips-2011-Regularized Laplacian Estimation and Fast Eigenvector Approximation</a></p>

Our interpretation will be analogous to the manner in which 2 -regularized or 1 -regularized 2 -regression (often called Ridge regression and Lasso regression, respectively) can be interpreted in terms of a Gaussian prior or a Laplace prior, respectively, on the coefﬁcient vector of the regression problem. Our framework will imply that the solutions to the MahoneyOrecchia regularized SDP can be interpreted as regularized estimates of the pseudoinverse of the graph Laplacian. Conversely, it will imply that the solution to this regularized estimation problem can be computed very quickly by running, e.g., the fast diffusion-based PageRank procedure for computing an approximation to the ﬁrst nontrivial eigenvector of the graph Laplacian. Empirical results are also provided to illustrate the manner in which approximate eigenvector computation implicitly performs statistical regularization, relative to running the corresponding exact algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.043503087 <a title="147-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-A_Global_Structural_EM_Algorithm_for_a_Model_of_Cancer_Progression.html">6 nips-2011-A Global Structural EM Algorithm for a Model of Cancer Progression</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Tofigh, Erik Sj̦lund, Mattias H̦glund, Jens Lagergren</p><p>Abstract: Cancer has complex patterns of progression that include converging as well as diverging progressional pathways. Vogelstein’s path model of colon cancer was a pioneering contribution to cancer research. Since then, several attempts have been made at obtaining mathematical models of cancer progression, devising learning algorithms, and applying these to cross-sectional data. Beerenwinkel et al. provided, what they coined, EM-like algorithms for Oncogenetic Trees (OTs) and mixtures of such. Given the small size of current and future data sets, it is important to minimize the number of parameters of a model. For this reason, we too focus on tree-based models and introduce Hidden-variable Oncogenetic Trees (HOTs). In contrast to OTs, HOTs allow for errors in the data and thereby provide more realistic modeling. We also design global structural EM algorithms for learning HOTs and mixtures of HOTs (HOT-mixtures). The algorithms are global in the sense that, during the M-step, they ﬁnd a structure that yields a global maximum of the expected complete log-likelihood rather than merely one that improves it. The algorithm for single HOTs performs very well on reasonable-sized data sets, while that for HOT-mixtures requires data sets of sizes obtainable only with tomorrow’s more cost-efﬁcient technologies. 1</p><p>5 0.037838172 <a title="147-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-A_More_Powerful_Two-Sample_Test_in_High_Dimensions_using_Random_Projection.html">9 nips-2011-A More Powerful Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions using Random Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Miles Lopes, Laurent Jacob, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis testing problem of detecting a shift between the means of two multivariate normal distributions in the high-dimensional setting, allowing for the data dimension p to exceed the sample size n. Our contribution is a new test statistic for the two-sample test of means that integrates a random projection with the classical Hotelling T 2 statistic. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows (p, n) → ∞, we ﬁrst derive an asymptotic power function for our test, and then provide sufﬁcient conditions for it to achieve greater power than other state-of-the-art tests. Using ROC curves generated from simulated data, we demonstrate superior performance against competing tests in the parameter regimes anticipated by our theoretical results. Lastly, we illustrate an advantage of our procedure with comparisons on a high-dimensional gene expression dataset involving the discrimination of different types of cancer. 1</p><p>6 0.037001409 <a title="147-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Priors_over_Recurrent_Continuous_Time_Processes.html">221 nips-2011-Priors over Recurrent Continuous Time Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Hsiu-chin Lin, Vickie Baracos, Russell Greiner, Chun-nam J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: An accurate model of patient survival time can help in the treatment and care of cancer patients. The common practice of providing survival time estimates based only on population averages for the site and stage of cancer ignores many important individual differences among patients. In this paper, we propose a local regression method for learning patient-speciﬁc survival time distribution based on patient attributes such as blood tests and clinical assessments. When tested on a cohort of more than 2000 cancer patients, our method gives survival time predictions that are much more accurate than popular survival analysis models such as the Cox and Aalen regression models. Our results also show that using patient-speciﬁc attributes can reduce the prediction error on survival time by as much as 20% when compared to using cancer site and stage only. 1</p><p>2 0.74956924 <a title="147-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-Continuous-Time_Regression_Models_for_Longitudinal_Networks.html">62 nips-2011-Continuous-Time Regression Models for Longitudinal Networks</a></p>

We also develop an efﬁcient inference scheme that allows our approach to scale to large networks.

<p>Author: Vikas C. Raykar, Shipeng Yu</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of crowdsourcing services it has become quite cheap and reasonably effective to get a dataset labeled by multiple annotators in a short amount of time. Various methods have been proposed to estimate the consensus labels by correcting for the bias of annotators with different kinds of expertise. Often we have low quality annotators or spammers–annotators who assign labels randomly (e.g., without actually looking at the instance). Spammers can make the cost of acquiring labels very expensive and can potentially degrade the quality of the consensus labels. In this paper we formalize the notion of a spammer and deﬁne a score which can be used to rank the annotators—with the spammers having a score close to zero and the good annotators having a high score close to one. 1 Spammers in crowdsourced labeling tasks Annotating an unlabeled dataset is one of the bottlenecks in using supervised learning to build good predictive models. Getting a dataset labeled by experts can be expensive and time consuming. With the advent of crowdsourcing services (Amazon’s Mechanical Turk being a prime example) it has become quite easy and inexpensive to acquire labels from a large number of annotators in a short amount of time (see [8], [10], and [11] for some computer vision and natural language processing case studies). One drawback of most crowdsourcing services is that we do not have tight control over the quality of the annotators. The annotators can come from a diverse pool including genuine experts, novices, biased annotators, malicious annotators, and spammers. Hence in order to get good quality labels requestors typically get each instance labeled by multiple annotators and these multiple annotations are then consolidated either using a simple majority voting or more sophisticated methods that model and correct for the annotator biases [3, 9, 6, 7, 14] and/or task complexity [2, 13, 12]. In this paper we are interested in ranking annotators based on how spammer like each annotator is. In our context a spammer is a low quality annotator who assigns random labels (maybe because the annotator does not understand the labeling criteria, does not look at the instances when labeling, or maybe a bot pretending to be a human annotator). Spammers can signiﬁcantly increase the cost of acquiring annotations (since they need to be paid) and at the same time decrease the accuracy of the ﬁnal consensus labels. A mechanism to detect and eliminate spammers is a desirable feature for any crowdsourcing market place. For example one can give monetary bonuses to good annotators and deny payments to spammers. The main contribution of this paper is to formalize the notion of a spammer for binary, categorical, and ordinal labeling tasks. More speciﬁcally we deﬁne a scalar metric which can be used to rank the annotators—with the spammers having a score close to zero and the good annotators having a score close to one (see Figure 4). We summarize the multiple parameters corresponding to each annotator into a single score indicative of how spammer like the annotator is. While this spammer score was implicit for binary labels in earlier works [3, 9, 2, 6] the extension to categorical and ordinal labels is novel and is quite different from the accuracy computed from the confusion rate matrix. An attempt to quantify the quality of the workers based on the confusion matrix was recently made by [4] where they transformed the observed labels into posterior soft labels based on the estimated confusion 1 matrix. While we obtain somewhat similar annotator rankings, we differ from this work in that our score is directly deﬁned in terms of the annotator parameters (see § 5 for more details). The rest of the paper is organized as follows. For ease of exposition we start with binary labels (§ 2) and later extend it to categorical (§ 3) and ordinal labels (§ 4). We ﬁrst specify the annotator model used, formalize the notion of a spammer, and propose an appropriate score in terms of the annotator model parameters. We do not dwell too much on the estimation of the annotator model parameters. These parameters can either be estimated directly using known gold standard 1 or the iterative algorithms that estimate the annotator model parameters without actually knowing the gold standard [3, 9, 2, 6, 7]. In the experimental section (§ 6) we obtain rankings for the annotators using the proposed spammer scores on some publicly available data from different domains. 2 Spammer score for crowdsourced binary labels j Annotator model Let yi ∈ {0, 1} be the label assigned to the ith instance by the j th annotator, and let yi ∈ {0, 1} be the actual (unobserved) binary label. We model the accuracy of the annotator separately on the positive and the negative examples. If the true label is one, the sensitivity (true positive rate) αj for the j th annotator is deﬁned as the probability that the annotator labels it as one. j αj := Pr[yi = 1|yi = 1]. On the other hand, if the true label is zero, the speciﬁcity (1−false positive rate) β j is deﬁned as the probability that annotator labels it as zero. j β j := Pr[yi = 0|yi = 0]. Extensions of this basic model have been proposed to include item level difﬁculty [2, 13] and also to model the annotator performance based on the feature vector [14]. For simplicity we use the basic model proposed in [7] in our formulation. Based on many instances labeled by multiple annotators the maximum likelihood estimator for the annotator parameters (αj , β j ) and also the consensus ground truth (yi ) can be estimated iteratively [3, 7] via the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm. The EM algorithm iteratively establishes a particular gold standard (initialized via majority voting), measures the performance of the annotators given that gold standard (M-step), and reﬁnes the gold standard based on the performance measures (E-step). Who is a spammer? Intuitively, a spammer assigns labels randomly—maybe because the annotator does not understand the labeling criteria, does not look at the instances when labeling, or maybe a bot pretending to be a human annotator. More precisely an annotator is a spammer if the probability j of observed label yi being one given the true label yi is independent of the true label, i.e., j j Pr[yi = 1|yi ] = Pr[yi = 1]. This means that the annotator is assigning labels randomly by ﬂipping a coin with bias without actually looking at the data. Equivalently (1) can be written as j j Pr[yi = 1|yi = 1] = Pr[yi = 1|yi = 0] which implies αj = 1 − β j . (1) j Pr[yi = 1] (2) Hence in the context of the annotator model deﬁned earlier a perfect spammer is an annotator for whom αj + β j − 1 = 0. This corresponds to the diagonal line on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) plot (see Figure 1(a)) 2 . If αj + β j − 1 < 0 then the annotators lies below the diagonal line and is a malicious annotator who ﬂips the labels. Note that a malicious annotator has discriminatory power if we can detect them and ﬂip their labels. In fact the methods proposed in [3, 7] can automatically ﬂip the labels for the malicious annotators. Hence we deﬁne the spammer score for an annotator as S j = (αj + β j − 1)2 (3) An annotator is a spammer if S j is close to zero. Good annotators have S j > 0 while a perfect annotator has S j = 1. 1 One of the commonly used strategy to ﬁlter out spammers is to inject some items into the annotations with known labels. This is the strategy used by CrowdFlower (http://crowdflower.com/docs/gold). 2 Also note that (αj + β j )/2 is equal to the area shown in the plot and can be considered as a non-parametric approximation to the area under the ROC curve (AUC) based on one observed point. It is also equal to the Balanced Classiﬁcation Rate (BCR). So a spammer can also be deﬁned as having BCR or AUC equal to 0.5. 2 Equal accuracy contours (prevalence=0.5) 0.9 1 Good Annotators Biased Annotators 0.8 0.9 Sensitivity Sensitivity ( αj ) Spammers 0.5 0.4 j 0.3 j 0.6 0.5 0.4 4 0. 5 0. 3 0. 7 0. 6 0. 4 0. 5 0. 2 0. 3 0.

A perfect spammer lies on the diagonal line on the ROC plot. (b) Contours of equal accuracy (4) and (c) equal spammer score (3). Accuracy This notion of a spammer is quite different for that of the accuracy of an annotator. An annotator with high accuracy is a good annotator but one with low accuracy is not necessarily a spammer. The accuracy is computed as 1 j Accuracyj = Pr[yi = yi ] = j Pr[yi = 1|yi = k]Pr[yi = k] = αj p + β j (1 − p), (4) k=0 where p := Pr[yi = 1] is the prevalence of the positive class. Note that accuracy depends on prevalence. Our proposed spammer score does not depend on prevalence and essentially quantiﬁes the annotator’s inherent discriminatory power. Figure 1(b) shows the contours of equal accuracy on the ROC plot. Note that annotators below the diagonal line (malicious annotators) have low accuracy. The malicious annotators are good annotators but they ﬂip their labels and as such are not spammers if we can detect them and then correct for the ﬂipping. In fact the EM algorithms [3, 7] can correctly ﬂip the labels for the malicious annotators and hence they should not be treated as spammers. Figure 1(c) also shows the contours of equal score for our proposed score and it can be seen that the malicious annotators have a high score and only annotators along the diagonal have a low score (spammers). Log-odds Another interpretation of a spammer can be seen from the log odds. Using Bayes’ rule the posterior log-odds can be written as log j Pr[yi = 1|yi ] Pr[yi = j 0|yi ] = log j Pr[yi |yi = 1] j Pr[yi |yi = 0] + log p . 1−p Pr[y =1|y j ] p If an annotator is a spammer (i.e., (2) holds) then log Pr[yi =0|yi ] = log 1−p . Essentially the annotator j i i provides no information in updating the posterior log-odds and hence does not contribute to the estimation of the actual true label. 3 Spammer score for categorical labels Annotator model Suppose there are K ≥ 2 categories. We introduce a multinomial parameter αj = (αj , . . . , αj ) for each annotator, where c c1 cK K j αj := Pr[yi = k|yi = c] ck αj = 1. ck and k=1 αj ck The term denotes the probability that annotator j assigns class k to an instance given that the true class is c. When K = 2, αj and αj are sensitivity and speciﬁcity, respectively. 11 00 Who is a spammer? As earlier a spammer assigns labels randomly, i.e., j j Pr[yi = k|yi ] = Pr[yi = k], ∀k. 3 j j This is equivalent to Pr[yi = k|yi = c] = Pr[yi = k|yi = c ], ∀c, c , k = 1, . . . , K— which means knowing the true class label being c or c does not change the probability of the annotator’s assigned label. This indicates that the annotator j is a spammer if αj = αj k , ∀c, c , k = 1, . . . , K. ck c (5) Let Aj be the K × K confusion rate matrix with entries [Aj ]ck = αck —a spammer would have 0.50 0.50 0.50 all the rows of Aj equal, for example, Aj = 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25 , for a three class categorical annotation problem. Essentially Aj is a rank one matrix of the form Aj = evj , for some column vector vj ∈ RK that satisﬁes vj e = 1, where e is column vector of ones. In the binary case we had this natural notion of spammer as an annotator for whom αj + β j − 1 was close to zero. One natural way to summarize (5) would be in terms of the distance (Frobenius norm) of the confusion matrix to the closest rank one approximation, i.e, S j := Aj − eˆj v 2 F, (6) where ˆj solves v ˆj = arg min Aj − evj v vj 2 F s.t. vj e = 1. (7) Solving (7) yields ˆj = (1/K)Aj e, which is the mean of the rows of Aj . Then from (6) we have v Sj = I− 1 ee K 2 Aj = F 1 K (αj − αj k )2 . ck c c < . . . < K. Annotator model It is conceptually easier to think of the true label to be binary, that is, yi ∈ {0, 1}. For example in mammography a lesion is either malignant (1) or benign (0) (which can be conﬁrmed by biopsy) and the BIRADS ordinal scale is a means for the radiologist to quantify the uncertainty based on the digital mammogram. The radiologist assigns a higher value of the label if he/she thinks the true label is closer to one. As earlier we characterize each annotator by the sensitivity and the speciﬁcity, but the main difference is that we now deﬁne the sensitivity and speciﬁcity for j each ordinal label (or threshold) k ∈ {1, . . . , K}. Let αj and βk be the sensitivity and speciﬁcity k th respectively of the j annotator corresponding to the threshold k, that is, j j j αj = Pr[yi ≥ k | yi = 1] and βk = Pr[yi < k | yi = 0]. k j j Note that αj = 1, β1 = 0 and αj 1 K+1 = 0, βK+1 = 1 from this deﬁnition. Hence each annotator j j is parameterized by a set of 2(K − 1) parameters [αj , β2 , . . . , αj , βK ]. This corresponds to an 2 K empirical ROC curve for the annotator (Figure 2). 4 Who is a spammer? As earlier we deﬁne an an1 j k=1 notator j to be a spammer if Pr[yi = k|yi = 1] = 0.9 j k=2 0.8 Pr[yi = k|yi = 0] ∀k = 1, . . . , K. Note that from j 0.7 k=3 [ 1−β , α ] the annotation model we have 3 Pr[yi = k | yi = 0.6 j j j 1] = αk − αk+1 and Pr[yi = k | yi = 0] = 0.5 k=4 j j 0.4 βk+1 − βk . This implies that annotator j is a spam0.3 j j mer if αj − αj k k+1 = βk+1 − βk , ∀k = 1, . . . , K, 0.2 j j 0.1 which leads to αj + βk = αj + β1 = 1, ∀k. This 1 k j 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 means that for every k, the point (1 − βk , αj ) lies on k 1−Specificity ( β ) the diagonal line in the ROC plot shown in Figure 2. The area under the empirical ROC curve can be comFigure 2: Ordinal labels: An annotator is modK 1 puted as (see Figure 2) AUCj = 2 k=1 (αj + eled by sensitivity/speciﬁcity for each threshold. k+1 j j αj )(βk+1 − βk ), and can be used to deﬁne the folk lowing spammer score as (2AUCj − 1)2 to rank the different annotators. 3 Sensitivity ( αj ) 3 j 2 K (αj k+1 k=1 j S = + j αj )(βk+1 k − j βk ) −1 (9) With two levels this expression defaults to the binary case. An annotator is a spammer if S j is close to zero. Good annotators have S j > 0 while a perfect annotator has S j = 1. 5 Previous work Recently Ipeirotis et.al. [4] proposed a score for categorical labels based on the expected cost of the posterior label. In this section we brieﬂy describe their approach and compare it with our proposed score. For each instance labeled by the annotator they ﬁrst compute the posterior (soft) label j j Pr[yi = c|yi ] for c = 1, . . . , K, where yi is the label assigned to the ith instance by the j th annotator and yi is the true unknown label. The posterior label is computed via Bayes’ rule as j j j Pr[yi = c|yi ] ∝ Pr[yi |yi = c]Pr[yi = c] = (αj )δ(yi ,k) pc , where pc = Pr[yi = c] is the prevack lence of class c. The score for a spammer is based on the intuition that the posterior label vector j j (Pr[yi = 1|yi ], . . . , Pr[yi = K|yi ]) for a good annotator will have all the probability mass concentrated on single class. For example for a three class problem (with equal prevalence), a posterior label vector of (1, 0, 0) (certain that the class is one) comes from a good annotator while a (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) (complete uncertainty about the class label) comes from spammer. Based on this they deﬁne the following score for each annotator 1 Score = N N K K j j costck Pr[yi = k|yi ]Pr[yi = c|yi ] j i=1 . (10) c=1 k=1 where costck is the misclassiﬁcation cost when an instance of class c is classiﬁed as k. Essentially this is capturing some sort of uncertainty of the posterior label averaged over all the instances. Perfect workers have a score Scorej = 0 while spammers will have high score. An entropic version of this score based on similar ideas has also been recently proposed in [5]. Our proposed spammer score differs from this approach in the following aspects: (1) Implicit in the score deﬁned above (10) j is the assumption that an annotator is a spammer when Pr[yi = c|yi ] = Pr[yi = c], i.e., the estimated posterior labels are simply based on the prevalence and do not depend on the observed labels. By j j Bayes’ rule this is equivalent to Pr[yi |yi = c] = Pr[yi ] which is what we have used to deﬁne our spammer score. (2) While both notions of a spammer are equivalent, the approach of [4] ﬁrst computes the posterior labels based on the observed data, the class prevalence and the annotator j j j j This can be seen as follows: Pr[yi = k | yi = 1] = Pr[(yi ≥ k) AND (yi < k + 1) | yi = 1] = Pr[yi ≥ j j j j k | yi = 1] + Pr[yi < k + 1 | yi = 1] − Pr[(yi ≥ k) OR (yi < k + 1) | yi = 1] = Pr[yi ≥ k | yi = j j j 1] − Pr[yi ≥ k + 1 | yi = 1] = αj − αj . Here we used the fact that Pr[(yi ≥ k) OR (yi < k + 1)] = 1. k k+1 3 5 simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators 1 12 0.8 Spammer Score 18 0.6 0.5 22 24 23 25 0.3 29 20 0.2 0.4 0.2 30 16 14 0.1 26 21 27 28 19 0 0 13 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 1−Specificity 0.8 1 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 0.4 0.6 500 500 500 1 0.7 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 500 3 1 500 500 500 2 8 510 7 17 4 9 27 8 30 6 3 28 7 10 2 23 22 26 24 5 1 21 29 25 14 12 17 11 18 20 19 15 16 13 4 0.8 Sensitivity 6 9 0.9 15 11 Annotator (a) Simulation setup (b) Annotator ranking Annotator rank (median) via accuracy simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators Annotator rank (median) via Ipeirotis et.al.[4] simulated | 500 instances | 30 annotators 27 30 30 28 23 22 26 25 24 21 29 25 20 14 17 18 15 20 16 15 11 13 12 19 1 10 5 10 2 7 6 3 5 8 9 4 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 30 (c) Comparison with accuracy 30 18 20 16 15 19 13 12 25 11 14 17 25 20 29 21 51 15 26 22 23 24 10 2 7 10 28 6 3 8 30 5 27 9 4 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 30 (d) Comparison with Ipeirotis et. al.

[4]. parameters and then computes the expected cost. Our proposed spammer score does not depend on the prevalence of the class. Our score is also directly deﬁned only in terms of the annotator confusion matrix and does not need the observed labels. (3) For the score deﬁned in (10) while perfect annotators have a score of 0 it is not clear what should be a good baseline for a spammer. The authors suggest to compute the baseline by assuming that a worker assigns as label the class with maximum prevalence. Our proposed score has a natural scale with a perfect annotator having a score of 1 and a spammer having a score of 0. (4) However one advantage of the approach in [4] is that they can directly incorporate varied misclassiﬁcation costs. 6 Experiments Ranking annotators based on the conﬁdence interval As mentioned earlier the annotator model parameters can be estimated using the iterative EM algorithms [3, 7] and these estimated annotator parameters can then be used to compute the spammer score. The spammer score can then be used to rank the annotators. However one commonly observed phenomenon when working with crowdsourced data is that we have a lot of annotators who label only a very few instances. As a result the annotator parameters cannot be reliably estimated for these annotators. In order to factor this uncertainty in the estimation of the model parameters we compute the spammer score for 100 bootstrap replications. Based on this we compute the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) for the spammer score for each annotator. We rank the annotators based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. The CIs are wider 6 Table 1: Datasets N is the number of instances. M is the number of annotators. M ∗ is the mean/median number of annotators per instance.

The spammer score ranges from 0 to 1, the lower the score, the more spammy the annotator. The mean spammer score and the 95% conﬁdence intervals (CI) are shown—obtained from 100 bootstrap replications. The annotators are ranked based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. The number at the top of the CI bar shows the number of instances annotated by that annotator. Note that the CIs are wider when the annotator labels only a few instances. when the annotator labels only a few instances. For a crowdsourced labeling task the annotator has to be good and also label a reasonable number of instances in order to be reliably identiﬁed. Simulated data We ﬁrst illustrate our proposed spammer score on simulated binary data (with equal prevalence for both classes) consisting of 500 instances labeled by 30 annotators of varying sensitivity and speciﬁcity (see Figure 3(a) for the simulation setup). Of the 30 annotators we have 10 good annotators (annotators 1 to 10 who lie above the diagonal in Figure 3(a)), 10 spammers (annotators 11 to 20 who lie around the diagonal), and 10 malicious annotators (annotators 21 to 30 who lie below the diagonal). Figure 3(b) plots the ranking of annotators obtained using the proposed spammer score with the annotator model parameters estimated via the EM algorithm [3, 7]. The spammer score ranges from 0 to 1, the lower the score, the more spammy the annotator. The mean spammer score and the 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) obtained via bootstrapping are shown. The annotators are ranked based on the lower limit of the 95% CI. As can be seen all the spammers (annotators 11 to 20) have a low spammer score and appear at the bottom of the list. The malicious annotators have higher score than the spammers since we can correct for their ﬂipping. The malicious annotators are good annotators but they ﬂip their labels and as such are not spammers if we detect that they are malicious. Figure 3(c) compares the (median) rank obtained via the spammer score with the (median) rank obtained using accuracy as the score to rank the annotators. While the good annotators are ranked high by both methods the accuracy score gives a low rank to the malicious annotators. Accuracy does not capture the notion of a spammer. Figure 3(d) compares the ranking with the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] which gives almost similar rankings as our proposed score. 7 21 23 10 6 35 4 34 1126 18 147 30 3 31 13 2436 33 25 5 2 20 15 39 19 15 20 28 22 299 12 37 16 38 10 32 1 5 27 25 35 30 8 17 0 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 40 bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators 40 1 6 34 112618 4 31 1013 7 30 2 28 21 5 20 15 39 19 20 15 22 37 16 299 12 38 10 5 8 17 0 0 27 25 35 30 0.6 0.5 35 32 2 0.4 36 11 13 31 24 10 33 28 21 26 18 0 0 40 34 15 19 39 0.1 (a) 22 37 20 38 29 9 0.2 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 Annotator rank (median) via spammer score 6 4 16 0.3 32 1 7 30 25 1 3 14 3 27 5 0.7 24 33 14 36 23 25 12 8 0.9 17 0.8 35 Sensitivity Annotator rank (median) via accuracy bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators Annotator rank (median) via Ipeirotis et.al.[4] bluebird | 108 instances | 39 annotators 40 23 0.2 0.4 0.6 1−Specificity (b) 0.8 1 (c) Figure 5: Comparison of the rank obtained via the spammer score with the rank obtained using (a) accuracy and (b) the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al.

[4] for the two categorial datasets in Table 1. Mechanical Turk data We report results on some publicly available linguistic and image annotation data collected using the Amazon’s Mechanical Turk (AMT) and other sources. Table 1 summarizes the datasets. Figure 4 plots the spammer scores and rankings obtained. The mean and the 95% CI obtained via bootstrapping are also shown. The number at the top of the CI bar shows the number of instances annotated by that annotator. The rankings are based on the lower limit of the 95% CI which factors the number of instances labeled by the annotator into the ranking. An annotator who labels only a few instances will have very wide CI. Some annotators who label only a few instances may have a high mean spammer score but the CI will be wide and hence ranked lower. Ideally we would like to have annotators with a high score and at the same time label a lot of instances so that we can reliablly identify them. The authors [1] for the sentiment dataset shared with us some of the qualitative observations regarding the annotators and they somewhat agree with our rankings. For example the authors made the following comments about Annotator 7 ”Quirky annotator - had a lot of debate about what was the meaning of the annotation question. I’d say he changed his labeling strategy at least once during the process”. Our proposed score gave a low rank to this annotator. Comparison with other approaches Figure 5 and 6 compares the proposed ranking with the rank obtained using accuracy and the method proposed by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] for some binary and categorical datasets in Table 1. Our proposed ranking is somewhat similar to that obtained by Ipeirotis et. al. [4] but accuracy does not quite capture the notion of spammer. For example for the bluebird dataset for annotator 21 (see Figure 5(a)) accuracy ranks it at the bottom of the list while the proposed score puts is in the middle of the list. From the estimated model parameters it can be seen that annotator 21 actually ﬂips the labels (below the diagonal in Figure 5(c)) but is a good annotator. 7 Conclusions We proposed a score to rank annotators for crowdsourced binary, categorical, and ordinal labeling tasks. The obtained rankings and the scores can be used to allocate monetary bonuses to be paid to different annotators and also to eliminate spammers from further labeling tasks. A mechanism to rank annotators should be desirable feature of any crowdsourcing service. The proposed score should also be useful to specify the prior for Bayesian approaches to consolidate annotations. 8 References [1] A. Brew, D. Greene, and P. Cunningham.

<p>Author: Yair Wiener, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: For a learning problem whose associated excess loss class is (β, B)-Bernstein, we show that it is theoretically possible to track the same classiﬁcation performance of the best (unknown) hypothesis in our class, provided that we are free to abstain from prediction in some region of our choice. The (probabilistic) volume of this √ rejected region of the domain is shown to be diminishing at rate O(Bθ( 1/m)β ), where θ is Hanneke’s disagreement coefﬁcient. The strategy achieving this performance has computational barriers because it requires empirical error minimization in an agnostic setting. Nevertheless, we heuristically approximate this strategy and develop a novel selective classiﬁcation algorithm using constrained SVMs. We show empirically that the resulting algorithm consistently outperforms the traditional rejection mechanism based on distance from decision boundary. 1</p><p>5 0.39152789 <a title="147-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-A_More_Powerful_Two-Sample_Test_in_High_Dimensions_using_Random_Projection.html">9 nips-2011-A More Powerful Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions using Random Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Miles Lopes, Laurent Jacob, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis testing problem of detecting a shift between the means of two multivariate normal distributions in the high-dimensional setting, allowing for the data dimension p to exceed the sample size n. Our contribution is a new test statistic for the two-sample test of means that integrates a random projection with the classical Hotelling T 2 statistic. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows (p, n) → ∞, we ﬁrst derive an asymptotic power function for our test, and then provide sufﬁcient conditions for it to achieve greater power than other state-of-the-art tests. Using ROC curves generated from simulated data, we demonstrate superior performance against competing tests in the parameter regimes anticipated by our theoretical results. Lastly, we illustrate an advantage of our procedure with comparisons on a high-dimensional gene expression dataset involving the discrimination of different types of cancer. 1</p><p>6 0.38689497 <a title="147-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Automated_Refinement_of_Bayes_Networks%27_Parameters_based_on_Test_Ordering_Constraints.html">40 nips-2011-Automated Refinement of Bayes Networks' Parameters based on Test Ordering Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Hsiu-chin Lin, Vickie Baracos, Russell Greiner, Chun-nam J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: An accurate model of patient survival time can help in the treatment and care of cancer patients. The common practice of providing survival time estimates based only on population averages for the site and stage of cancer ignores many important individual differences among patients. In this paper, we propose a local regression method for learning patient-speciﬁc survival time distribution based on patient attributes such as blood tests and clinical assessments. When tested on a cohort of more than 2000 cancer patients, our method gives survival time predictions that are much more accurate than popular survival analysis models such as the Cox and Aalen regression models. Our results also show that using patient-speciﬁc attributes can reduce the prediction error on survival time by as much as 20% when compared to using cancer site and stage only. 1</p><p>2 0.65003091 <a title="147-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Improving_Topic_Coherence_with_Regularized_Topic_Models.html">129 nips-2011-Improving Topic Coherence with Regularized Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: David Newman, Edwin V. Bonilla, Wray Buntine</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents. When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reﬂect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data. 1</p><p>3 0.53409356 <a title="147-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Committing_Bandits.html">56 nips-2011-Committing Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Loc X. Bui, Ramesh Johari, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where there are two phases. The ﬁrst phase is an experimentation phase where the decision maker is free to explore multiple options. In the second phase the decision maker has to commit to one of the arms and stick with it. Cost is incurred during both phases with a higher cost during the experimentation phase. We analyze the regret in this setup, and both propose algorithms and provide upper and lower bounds that depend on the ratio of the duration of the experimentation phase to the duration of the commitment phase. Our analysis reveals that if given the choice, it is optimal to experiment Θ(ln T ) steps and then commit, where T is the time horizon.</p><p>4 0.47515485 <a title="147-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image segmentation since for binary random ﬁeld representations of the image, it gives globally optimal results and there are efﬁcient polynomial time implementations. Often, the random ﬁeld is applied over a ﬂat partitioning of the image into non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show that if, instead of a ﬂat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding beneﬁts of global optimality and efﬁciency). As a result of such inference, the image gets partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the tree. We apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference on a segmentation tree (over a ﬂat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization in the pylon model is able to ﬂexibly choose the level of segmentation across the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.41496387 <a title="147-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Noise_Thresholds_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">186 nips-2011-Noise Thresholds for Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>6 0.32767984 <a title="147-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_with_the_weighted_trace-norm_under_arbitrary_sampling_distributions.html">159 nips-2011-Learning with the weighted trace-norm under arbitrary sampling distributions</a></p>

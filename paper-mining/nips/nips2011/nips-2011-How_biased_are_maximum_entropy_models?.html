<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>3 0.17950727 <a title="123-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-t-divergence_Based_Approximate_Inference.html">306 nips-2011-t-divergence Based Approximate Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>5 0.11101525 <a title="123-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Thinning_Measurement_Models_and_Questionnaire_Design.html">288 nips-2011-Thinning Measurement Models and Questionnaire Design</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Silva</p><p>Abstract: Inferring key unobservable features of individuals is an important task in the applied sciences. In particular, an important source of data in ﬁelds such as marketing, social sciences and medicine is questionnaires: answers in such questionnaires are noisy measures of target unobserved features. While comprehensive surveys help to better estimate the latent variables of interest, aiming at a high number of questions comes at a price: refusal to participate in surveys can go up, as well as the rate of missing data; quality of answers can decline; costs associated with applying such questionnaires can also increase. In this paper, we cast the problem of reﬁning existing models for questionnaire data as follows: solve a constrained optimization problem of preserving the maximum amount of information found in a latent variable model using only a subset of existing questions. The goal is to ﬁnd an optimal subset of a given size. For that, we ﬁrst deﬁne an information theoretical measure for quantifying the quality of a reduced questionnaire. Three different approximate inference methods are introduced to solve this problem. Comparisons against a simple but powerful heuristic are presented. 1 Contribution A common goal in the applied sciences is to measure concepts of interest that are not directly observable (Bartholomew et al., 2008). Such is the case in the social sciences, medicine, economics and other ﬁelds, where quantifying key attributes such as “consumer satisfaction,” “anxiety” and “recession” requires the development of indicators: observable variables that are postulated to measure the target latent variables up to some measurement error (Bollen, 1989; Carroll et al., 1995). In a probabilistic framework, this often boils down to a latent variable model (Bishop, 1998). One common setup is to assume each observed indicator Yi as being generated independently given the set of latent variables X. Conditioning on any given observed data point Y gives information about the distribution of the latent vector X, which can then be used for ranking, clustering, visualization or smoothing, among other tasks. Figure 1 provides an illustration. Questionnaires from large surveys are sometimes used to provide such indicators, each Yi recording an answer that typically corresponds to a Bernoulli or ordinal variable. For instance, experts can be given questions concerning whether there is freedom of press in a particular nation, as a way of measuring its democratization level (Bollen, 1989; Palomo et al., 2007). Nations can then be clustering or ranked within an interpretable latent space. Long questionnaires have nevertheless drawbacks, as summarized by Stanton et al. (2002) in the context of psychometric studies: Longer surveys take more time to complete, tend to have more missing data, and have higher refusal rates than short surveys. Arguably, then, techniques to reducing the length of scales while maintaining psychometric quality are wortwhile. 1 Factor scores: countries in the latent space Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 0 Y1 5 X2 (Democratization) X1 (Industrialization) Democratization 10 Dem1960 Dem1965 1 5 9 13 18 23 28 33 38 43 48 53 58 63 68 73 Country (ordered by industrialization factor) (a) (b) Figure 1: (a) A graphical representation of a latent variable model. Notice that in general latent variables will be dependent. Here, the question is how to quantify democratization and industrialization levels of nations given observed indicators Y such as freedom of press and gross national product, among others (Bollen, 1989; Palomo et al., 2007). (b) An example of a result implied by the model (adapted from Palomo et al. (2007)): barplots of the conditional distribution of democratization levels given the observed indicators at two time points, ordered by the posterior mean industrialization level. The distribution of the latent variables given the observations is the basis of the analysis. Our contribution is a methodology for choosing which indicators to preserve (e.g., which items to keep in a questionnaire) given: i.) a latent variable model speciﬁcation of the domain of interest; ii.) a target number of indicators that should be preserved. To accomplish this, we provide: i.) a target objective function that quantiﬁes the amount of information preserved by a choice of a subset of indicators, with respect to the full set; ii.) algorithms for optimizing this choice of subset with respect to the objective function. The general idea is to start with a target posterior distribution of latent variables, deﬁned by some latent variable measurement model M (i.e., PM (X | Y)). We want to choose a subset Yz ⊂ Y so that the resulting conditional distribution PM (X | Yz ) is as close as possible to the original one according to some metric. Model M is provided either by expertise or by numerous standard approaches that can be applied to learn it from data (e.g., methods in Bishop, 2009). We call this task measurement model thinning. Notice that the size of Yz is a domain-dependent choice. Assuming M is a good model for the data, choosing a subset of indicators will incur some information loss. It is up to the analyst to choose a trade-off between loss of information and the design of simpler, cheaper ways of measuring latent variables. Even if a shorter questionnaire is not to be deployed, the outcome of measurement model thinning provides a formal sensitivity analysis of the target latent distribution with respect to the available indicators. The result is useful to generate different insights into the domain. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 deﬁnes a formal criterion to quantify how appropriate a subset Yz is. Section 3 describes different approaches in which this criterion can be optimized. Related work is brieﬂy discussed in Section 4. Experiments with synthetic and real data are discussed in Section 5, followed by the conclusion. 2 An Information-Theoretical Criterion Our focus is on domains where latent variables are not a by-product of a dimensionality reduction technique, but the target of the analysis as in the example of Figure 1. That is, measurement error problems where the variables to be recorded are designed speciﬁcally to obtain information concerning such unknowns (Carroll et al., 1995; Bartholomew et al., 2008). As such, we postulate that the outcome of any analysis should be a functional of PM (X | Y), the conditional distribution of unobservables X given observables Y within a model M. It is assumed that M speciﬁes the joint PM (X, Y). We further assume that observed variables are conditionally independent given X, i.e. p PM (X, Y) = PM (X) i=1 PM (Yi | X), with p being the number of observed indicators. 2 If z ≡ (z1 , z2 , . . . , zp ) is a binary vector of the same dimensionality as Y, and Yz is the subset of Y corresponding the non-zero entries of z, we can assess z by the KL divergence PM (X | Y) dX KL(PM (X | Y) || PM (X | Yz )) ≡ PM (X | Y) log PM (X | Yz ) This is well-deﬁned, since both distributions lie in the same sample space despite the difference of dimensionality between Y and Yz . Moreover, since Y is itself a random vector, our criterion becomes the expected KL divergence KL(PM (X | Y) || PM (X | Yz )) PM (Y) where · denotes expectation. Our goal is to minimize this function with respect to z. Rearranging this expression to drop all constants that do not depend on z, and multiplying it by −1 to get a maximization problem, we obtain the problem of ﬁnding z⋆ such that z⋆ = argmaxz log(PM (Yz | X)) PM (X,Yz ) − log(PM (Yz )) PM (Yz ) p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) = argmaxz ≡ + HM (Yz ) i=1 argmaxz FM (z) PM (X,Yi ) p i=1 zi = K for a choice of K, and zi ∈ {0, 1}. HM (·) denotes here the entropy of subject to a distribution parameterized by M. Notice we used the assumption that indicators are mutually independent given X. There is an intuitive appeal of having a joint entropy term to reward not only marginal relationships between indicators and latent variables, but also selections that are jointly diverse. Notice that optimizing this objective function turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the conditional entropy of latent variables given Yz . Motivating conditional entropy from a more fundamental principle illustrates that other functions can be obtained by changing the divergence. 3 Approaches for Approximate Optimization The problem of optimizing FM (z) subject to the constraints p zi = K, zi ∈ {0, 1}, is hard i=1 not only for its combinatorial nature, but due to the entropy term. This needs to be approximated, and the nature of the approximation should depend on the form taken by M. We will assume that it is possible to efﬁciently compute any marginals of PM (Y) of modest dimensionality (say, 10 dimensions). This is the case, for instance, in the probit model for binary data: X ∼ N (0, Σ), Yi⋆ ∼ N (ΛT X + λi;0 , 1), i Yi = 1, if Yi⋆ > 0, and 0 otherwise where N (m, S) is the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean m and covariance matrix S. The probit model is one of the most common latent variable models for questionnaire data (Bartholomew et al., 2008), with a straigthforward extension to ordinal data. In this model, marginals for a few dozen variables can be obtained efﬁciently since this corresponds to calculating multivariate Gaussian probabilities (Genz, 1992). Parameters can be ﬁt by a variety of methods (Hahn et al., 2010). We also assume that M allows for the computation of log(PM (Yi | X)) PM (X,Yi ) at little cost. Again, in the binary probit model this is simple, since this requires integrating away a single binary variable Yi and a univariate Gaussian ΛT X. i 3.1 Gaussian Entropy One approximation to FM (z) is to replace its entropy term by the corresponding entropy from some Gaussian distribution PN (Yz ). The entropy of a Gaussian distribution is proportional to the logarithm of the determinant of its covariance matrix, and hence can be computed in O(p3 ) steps. This Gaussian can be chosen as the one closest to PM (Yz ) in a KL(PM || PN ) sense: that is, the one with the same ﬁrst and second moments as PM (Yz ). In our case, computing these moments can be done deterministically (up to numerical error) using standard bivariate quadrature methods. No expectation-propagation (Minka, 2001) is necessary. The corresponding objective function is p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;N (z) ≡ i=1 3 PM (X,Yi ) + 0.5 log |Σz | where Σz is the covariance matrix of Yz – which for binary and ordinal data has a sensible interpretation. This function is also an upper bound on the exact function, FM (z), since the Gaussian is the distribution with the largest entropy for a given mean vector and covariance matrix. The resulting function is non-linear in z. In our experiments, we optimize for z using a greedy scheme: for all possible pairs (i, j) such that zi = 1 and zj = 0, we swap its values (so that i zi is always K). We choose the pair with the highest increase in FM;N (z) and repeat the process until convergence. 3.2 Entropy with Bounded Neighborhoods An alternative bound can be derived from a standard fact in information theory: H(Y | S) ≤ H(Y | S ′ ) for S ′ ⊆ S, where H(· | ·) denotes conditional entropy. This was exploited by Globerson and Jaakkola (2007) to deﬁne an upper bound in the entropy of a distribution as follows: consider a permutation e of the set {1, 2, . . . , p}, with e(i) being the i-th element of e. Denote by e(1 : i) the ﬁrst i elements of this permutation (an empty set if i < 1). Moreover, let N (e, i) be a subset of e(1 : i − 1). For a given set variables Y = {Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yp } the following bound holds: p n H(Ye(i) | YN (e,i) ) H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) ≤ H(Y1 , Y2 , . . . Yp ) = (1) i=1 i=1 If each set N (e, i) is no larger than some constant D, then this bound can be computed in O(p · 2D ) steps for binary probit models. The bound holds for any choice of e, but we want it to be as tight as possible so that it gets weighted in a reasonable way against the other terms in FM (·). Since the entropy function is decomposable as a sum of functions that depend on i and N (e, i) only, one can minimize this bound with respect to e by using permutation optimization methods such as (Jaakkola et al., 2010). In our implementation, we use a method similar to Teyssier and Koller (2005) that shufﬂes neighboring entries of e to generate candidates, chooses the optimal N (e, i) for each i given the candidate e, and picks as the next permutation the candidate e with the greatest decrease in the bound. Notice that a permutation choice e and neighborhood choices N (e, i) deﬁne a Bayesian network where N (e, i) are the parents of Ye(i) . Therefore, if this Bayesian network model provides a good approximation to PM (Y), the bound will be reasonably tight. Given e, we will further relax this bound with the goal of obtaining an integer programming formulation for the problem of optimizing an upper bound to FM (z). For any given z, we deﬁne the local term HL (z, i) as    HL (z, i) ≡ HM (Ye(i) | Yz ∩N (e, i)) = S∈P (N (e,i))  j∈S zj   k∈N (e,i)\S (1 − zk ) HM (Ye(i) | S) (2) where P (·) denotes the power set of a set. The new approximate objective function becomes p p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;D (z) ≡ PM (X,Yi ) ze(i) HL (z, i) + (3) i=1 i=1 Notice that HL (z, i) is still an upper bound on HM (Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ). The intuition is that we are bounding HM (Yz ) by the entropy of a Bayesian network where a vertex Ye(i) is included if ze(i) = 1, with corresponding parents given by Yz ∩ N (e, i). This is a well-deﬁned Bayesian network for any choice of z. The shortcoming is that ideally we would like this Bayesian network to be the actual marginal of the model given by e and N (e, i). It is not: if the network implied by e and N (e, i) was, for instance, Y1 → Y2 → Y3 , the choice of z = (1, 0, 1) would result on the entropy of the disconnected graph {Y1 , Y3 }, while the true marginal would correspond instead to the graph Y1 → Y3 . However, our simpliﬁed marginalization has the advantage of avoiding an intractable problem. Moreover, it allows us to redeﬁne the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). Each product ze(i) j zj k (1−zk ) appearing in (3) results in a sum of O(2D ) terms, each of which has (up to a sign) the form qM ≡ m∈M zm for some set M . It is still the case that qM ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, objective function (3) can be interpreted as being linear on a set of binary variables {{z}, {q}}. We need further to enforce the constraints coming from qM = 1 ⇒ {∀m ∈ M, zm = 1}; qM = 0 ⇒ {∃m ∈ M s.t. zm = 0} 4 It is well-known (Glover and Woolsey, 1974) that this corresponds to the linear constraints qM = 1 ⇒ {∀m ∈ M, zm = 1} ⇔ ∀m ∈ M, qM − zm ≤ 0 qM = 0 ⇒ {∃m ∈ M s.t. zm = 0} ⇔ m∈M zm − qM ≤ |M | − 1 p which combined with the linear constraint i=1 zi = K implies that optimizing FM;D (z) is an ILP with O(p · 2D ) variables and O(p2 · 2D ) constraints. In our experiments in Section 5, we were able to solve essentially all of such ILPs exactly using linear programming relaxations with branch-and-bound. 3.3 Entropy with Tree-Structured Bounds The previous bound simpliﬁes marginalization, which might badly overestimate entropies where the corresponding Yz are uniformly spread out in permutation e. We now propose a different type of bound which treats different marginalizations on an equal footing. It comes from the following observation: since H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) is less than or equal to any conditional entropy H(Ye(i) | Yj ) for j ∈ e(1 : i − 1), we have that the tighest bound given by singleton conditioning sets is H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) ≤ min j∈e(1:i−1) HM (Ye(i) | Yj ), resulting in the objective function p p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;tree (z) ≡ ze(i) · PM (X,Yi ) + i=1 i=1 min {Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) (4) where min{Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) ≡ H(Ye(i) ) if Ye(1:i−1) ∩ Yz = ∅. The intuition is that we are bounding the exact entropy using the entropy of a directed tree rooted at Yez (1) , the ﬁrst element of Yz according to e. That is, all variables are marginally dependent in the approximation regardless of what z is, and for a ﬁxed z the tree is, by construction, the one obtained by the usual greedy algorithm of adding edges corresponding to the next legal pair of vertices with maximum mutual information (following an ordering, in this case). It turns out we can also write (4) as a linear objective function of a polynomial number of 0\1 (i−1) (2) (1) be the values of set variables and constraints. Let zi ≡ 1 − zi . Let Hi , Hi , . . . , Hi ¯ (i−1) (1) be{HM (Ye(i) | Ye(1) ), . . . , HM (Ye(i) | Ye(i−1) )} sorted in ascending order, with zi , . . . , zi ing the corresponding permutation of {ze(1) , . . . , ze(i−1) }. We have min{Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) (j) (j) j−1 (1) (1) (1) (2) (2) (1) (2) (3) (3) ¯ ¯ ¯ = z i Hi + z i z i H i + z i z i z i H i + . . . (i−2) (i−1) (i−1) (1) i−1 (j) + j=1 zi HM (Ye(i) ) ¯ Hi zi ¯ zi . . . zi ¯ (i) i−1 (j) (j) + qi HM (Ye(i) ) ≡ j=1 qi Hi (k) ¯ where qi ≡ zi k=1 zi , and also a binary 0\1 variable. Plugging this expression into (4) gives a linear objective function in this extended variable space. The corresponding constraints are (j−1) (j) (1) (j) , zi }, zm = 1} ¯ z qi = 1 ⇒ {∀zm ∈ {¯i , . . . , zi (j−1) (j) (1) (j) , zi } s.t. zm = 0} ¯ z qi = 0 ⇒ {∃zm ∈ {¯i , . . . , zi which, as shown in the previous section, can be written as linear constraints (substituting each zi ¯ by 1 − zi ). The total number of constraints is however O(p3 ), which can be expensive, and often a linear relaxation procedure with branch-and-bound fails to provide guarantees of optimality. 3.4 The Reliability Score Finally, it is important to design cheap, effective criteria whose maxima correlate with the maxima of FM (·). Empirically, we have found high quality selections in binary probit models using the solution to the problem p p wi zi , subject to zi ∈ {0, 1}, maximize FM;R (z) = zi = K i=1 i=1 5 where wi = ΛT ΣΛi . This can be solved by picking the corresponding indicators with the highest i K weights wi . Assuming a probit model where the measurement error for each Yi⋆ has the same variance of 1, this score is related to the “reliability” of an indicator. Simply put, the reliability Ri of an indicator is the proportion of its variance that is due to the latent variables (Bollen, 1989, Chapter 6): Ri = wi /(wi + 1) for each Yi⋆ . There is no current theory linking this solution to the problem of maximizing FM (·): since there is no entropy term, we can set an adversarial problem to easily defeat this method. For instance, this happens in a model where the K indicators of highest reliability all measure the same latent variable Xi and nothing else – much information about Xi would be preserved, but little about other variables. In any case, we found this criterion to be fairly competitive even if at times it produces extreme failures. An honest account of more sophisticated selection mechanisms cannot be performed without including it, as we do in Section 5. 4 Related Work The literature on survey analysis, in the context of latent variable models, contains several examples of guidelines on how to simplify questionnaires (sometimes described as providing “shortened versions” of scales). Much of the literature, however, consists of describing general guidelines and rules-of-thumb to accomplish this task (e.g, Richins, 2004; Stanton et al., 2002). One possible exception is Leite et al. (2008), which uses different model ﬁtness criteria with respect to a given dataset to score candidate solutions, along with an expensive combinatorial optimization method. This conﬂates model selection and questionnaire thinning, and there is no theory linking the score functions to the amount of information preserved. In the machine learning and statistics literature, there is a large body of research in active learning, which is related to our task. One of the closest approaches is the one by Liang et al. (2009), which casts the classical problem of measurement selection within a Bayesian graphical model perspective. In that work, one has to choose which measurements to add. This is done sequentially, partially motivated by problems where collecting new measurements can be done relatively fast and cheap (say, by paying graduate students to annotate text data), and so the choice of next measurement can make use of fresh data. In our case, it not might be realistic to expect we can perform a large number of iterations of data collection – and as such the task of reducing the number of measurements from a large initial collection might be more relevant in practice. Liang et al. also focus on (multivariate) supervised learning instead of purely unsupervised learning. In statistics there is also a considerable body of literature on sufﬁcient dimension reduction and its sparse variants (e.g., Chen et al., 2010). Such techniques create a bottleneck between two sets of variables in a regression problem (say, the mapping from Y to X) while eliminating some of the input variables. In principle one might want to adapt such models to take a latent variable model M as the target mapping. Besides some loss of interpretability, the computational implications might be problematic, though. Moreover, this framework has another free parameter corresponding to the dimensionality of the bottleneck that has to be set. It is not clear how this parameter, along with a choice of sparsity level, would interact with a ﬁxed choice K of indicators to be kept. 5 Experiments In this section, we ﬁrst describe some synthetic experiments to provide insights about the different methods, followed by one brief description of a case study. In all of the experiments, the target models M are binary probit. We set the neighborhood parameter for FM;N (·) to 9. The ordering e for the tree-structured method is obtained by the same greedy search of Section 3.2, where now the score is the average of all H(Yi | Yj ) for all Yj preceding Yi . Finally, all ordering optimization methods were initialized by sorting indicators in a descending order according to their reliability scores, and the initial solution for all entropy-based optimization methods was given by the reliability score solution of Section 3.4. The integer program solver G UROBI 4.02 was used in all experiments. 5.1 Synthetic studies We start with a batch of synthetic experiments. We generated 80 models with 40 indicators and 10 latent variables1 . We further preprocess such models into two groups: in 40 of them, we select a 1 Details on the model generation: we generate 40 models by sampling the latent covariance matrix from an inverse Wishart distribution with 10 degrees of freedom and scale matrix 10I, I being the identity matrix. 6 Improvement ratio: high signal Mean error: high signal Improvement ratio: low signal Mean error: low signal 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0 0 0.25 Reliability score Reliability score 0.4 0.2 0.15 0.25 0.2 0.15 −0.1 −0.1 0.1 N/R T/R G/R N/S T/S G/S N/R T/R G/R N/S T/S 0.1 G/S 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.1 0.15 0.2 Tree bound (a) (c) (b) 0.25 0.3 Tree bound (d) Figure 2: (a) A comparison of the bounded neighborhood (N ), tree-based (T ) and Gaussian (G) methods with respect to a random solution (R) and the reliability score (S).

The bottom-left clouds correspond to the K = 32 trials. target reliability ri for each indicator Yi , uniformly at random from the interval [0.4 0.7]. We then rescale coefﬁcients Λi such that the reliability (deﬁned in Section 3.4) of the respective Yi⋆ becomes ri . For the remaining 40 models, we sample ri uniformly at random from the interval [0.2 0.4]. We perform two choices of subsets: sets Yz of size 20 and 32 (50% and 80% of the total number of indicators). Our evaluation is as follows: since the expected value is perhaps the most common functional of the posterior distribution PM (X | Y), we calculate the expected value of the latent variables for a sample {y(1) , y(2) , . . . , y(1000) } of size 1000 taken from the respective synthetic models. This is done for the full set of 40 indicators, and for each set chosen by our four criteria: for each data point i and each objective function F , we evaluate the average distance (i) (i) (i) (i) ˆ ˆ dF ≡ 10 |ˆj − xj;F |/10. In this case, xj is the expected value of Xj obtained by conditioning j=1 x (i) on all indicators, while xj;F is the one obtained with the subset selected by optimizing F . We denote ˆ (1) (2) (1000) by mF the average of {dF , dF , . . . , dF }. Finally, we compare the three main methods with respect to the reliability score method using the improvement ratio statistic sF = 1 − mF /mFM;R , the proportion of average error decrease with respect to the reliability score. In order to provide a sense of scale on the difﬁculty of each problem, we compute the same ratios with respect to a random selection, obtained by choosing K = 20 and K = 32 indicators uniformly at random. Figure 2 provides a summary of the results. In Figure 2(a), each boxplot shows the distribution over the 40 probit models where reliabilities were sampled between [0.4 0.7] (the “high signal” models). The ﬁrst three boxplots show the scores sF of the bounded neighborhood, tree-structured and Gaussian methods, respectively, compared against random selections. The last three boxplots are comparisons against the reliability heuristic. The tree-based method easily beats the Gaussian method, with about 75% of its outcomes being better than the median Gaussian outcome. The Gaussian approach is also less reliable, with results showing a long lower tail. Although the reliability score is on average a good approach, in only a handful of cases it was better than the tree-based method, and by considerably smaller magnitudes compared to the upper tails in the tree-based outcome distribution. A separate panel (Figure 2(b)) is shown for the 40 models with lower reliabilities. In this case, all methods show stronger improvements over the reliability score, although now there is a less clear difference between the tree method and the Gaussian one. Finally, in panels (c) and (d) we present scatterplots for the average deviances mF of the tree-based method against the reliability score. The two clouds correspond to the solutions with 20 and 32 indicators. Notice that in the vast majority of the cases the tree-based method does better. We then rescale the matrix to make all variances equal to 1. We also generate 40 models using as the inverse Wishart scale matrix the correlation matrix will all off-diagonal entries set to 0.5. Coefﬁcients linking indicators to latent variables were set to zero with probability 0.8, and sampled from a standard Gaussian otherwise. If some latent variable ends up with no child, or an indicator ends up with no parent, we uniformly choose one child/parent to be linked to it.

In 2009, a major survey called the National Health Service National Staff Survey was deployed with the goal of “collect(ing) staff views about working in their local NHS trust” (Care Quality Comission and Aston University, 2010). A questionnaire of 206 items was ﬁlled by 156, 951 respondents. We designed a measurement model based on the structure of the questionnaire and ﬁt it by the posterior expected value estimator. Gaussian and inverse Wishart priors were used, along with Gibbs sampling and a random subset of 50, 000 respondents. See the Supplementary Material for more details. Several items in this survey asked for the NHS staff member to provide degrees of agreement in a Likert scale (Bartholomew et al., 2008) to questions such as • • • • . . . have you ever come to work despite not feeling well enough to perform . . . ? Have you felt pressure from your manager to come to work? Have you felt pressure from colleagues to come to work? Have you put yourself under pressure to come to work? as different probes into an unobservable self-assessed level of work pressure. We preprocessed and binarized the data to ﬁrst narrow it down to 63 questions. We compare selections of 32 (50%) and 50 (80%) items using the same statistics of the previous section. sF ;D sF ;tree sF ;N sF ;random mF ;tree mF ;R K = 32 K = 50 7.8% 10.5% 6.3% 11.9% 0.01% 7.6% −16.0% −0.05% 0.238 0.123 0.255 0.140 Although gains were relatively small (as measured by the difference between reconstruction errors mF ;tree − mF ;R and the good performance of a random selection), we showed that: i.) we do improve results over a popular measure of indicator quality; ii.) we do provide some guarantees about the diversity of the selected items via a information-theoretical measure with an entropy term, with theoretically sound approximations to such a measure. For more details on the preprocessing, and more insights into the different selections, please refer to the Supplementary Material. 6 Conclusion There are problems where one posits that the relevant information is encoded in the posterior distribution of a set of latent variables. Questionnaires (and other instruments) can be used as evidence to generate this posterior, but there is a cost associated with complex questionnaires. One problem is how to simplify such instruments of measurement. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the ﬁrst formal account on how to solve it. Nevertheless, we would like to stress there is no substitute for common sense. While the tools we provide here can be used for a variety of analyses – from deploying simpler questionnaires to sensitivity analysis – the value and cost of keeping particular indicators can go much beyond the information contained in the latent posterior distribution. How to combine this criterion with other domain-dependent criteria is a matter of future research. Another problem of importance is how to deal with model speciﬁcation and transportability across studies. A measurement model built for a very speciﬁc population of respondents might transfer poorly to another group, and therefore taking into account model uncertainty will be important. The Bayesian setup discussed by Liang et al. (2009) might provide some directions on this issue. Also, there is further structure in real-world questionnaires we are not exploiting in the current work. Namely, it is not uncommon to have questionnaires with branching questions and other dynamic behaviour more commonly associated with Web based surveys and/or longitudinal studies. Finally, hybrid approaches combining the bounded neighborhood and the tree-structured methods, along with more sophisticated ordering optimization procedures and the use of other divergence measures and determinant-based criteria (e.g. Kulesza and Taskar, 2011), will also be studied in the future.

<p>Author: Jakob H. Macke, Iain Murray, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy models have become popular statistical models in neuroscience and other areas in biology, and can be useful tools for obtaining estimates of mutual information in biological systems. However, maximum entropy models ﬁt to small data sets can be subject to sampling bias; i.e. the true entropy of the data can be severely underestimated. Here we study the sampling properties of estimates of the entropy obtained from maximum entropy models. We show that if the data is generated by a distribution that lies in the model class, the bias is equal to the number of parameters divided by twice the number of observations. However, in practice, the true distribution is usually outside the model class, and we show here that this misspeciﬁcation can lead to much larger bias. We provide a perturbative approximation of the maximally expected bias when the true model is out of model class, and we illustrate our results using numerical simulations of an Ising model; i.e. the second-order maximum entropy distribution on binary data. 1</p><p>2 0.7255038 <a title="123-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-t-divergence_Based_Approximate_Inference.html">306 nips-2011-t-divergence Based Approximate Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Ricardo Silva</p><p>Abstract: Inferring key unobservable features of individuals is an important task in the applied sciences. In particular, an important source of data in ﬁelds such as marketing, social sciences and medicine is questionnaires: answers in such questionnaires are noisy measures of target unobserved features. While comprehensive surveys help to better estimate the latent variables of interest, aiming at a high number of questions comes at a price: refusal to participate in surveys can go up, as well as the rate of missing data; quality of answers can decline; costs associated with applying such questionnaires can also increase. In this paper, we cast the problem of reﬁning existing models for questionnaire data as follows: solve a constrained optimization problem of preserving the maximum amount of information found in a latent variable model using only a subset of existing questions. The goal is to ﬁnd an optimal subset of a given size. For that, we ﬁrst deﬁne an information theoretical measure for quantifying the quality of a reduced questionnaire. Three different approximate inference methods are introduced to solve this problem. Comparisons against a simple but powerful heuristic are presented. 1 Contribution A common goal in the applied sciences is to measure concepts of interest that are not directly observable (Bartholomew et al., 2008). Such is the case in the social sciences, medicine, economics and other ﬁelds, where quantifying key attributes such as “consumer satisfaction,” “anxiety” and “recession” requires the development of indicators: observable variables that are postulated to measure the target latent variables up to some measurement error (Bollen, 1989; Carroll et al., 1995). In a probabilistic framework, this often boils down to a latent variable model (Bishop, 1998). One common setup is to assume each observed indicator Yi as being generated independently given the set of latent variables X. Conditioning on any given observed data point Y gives information about the distribution of the latent vector X, which can then be used for ranking, clustering, visualization or smoothing, among other tasks. Figure 1 provides an illustration. Questionnaires from large surveys are sometimes used to provide such indicators, each Yi recording an answer that typically corresponds to a Bernoulli or ordinal variable. For instance, experts can be given questions concerning whether there is freedom of press in a particular nation, as a way of measuring its democratization level (Bollen, 1989; Palomo et al., 2007). Nations can then be clustering or ranked within an interpretable latent space. Long questionnaires have nevertheless drawbacks, as summarized by Stanton et al. (2002) in the context of psychometric studies: Longer surveys take more time to complete, tend to have more missing data, and have higher refusal rates than short surveys. Arguably, then, techniques to reducing the length of scales while maintaining psychometric quality are wortwhile. 1 Factor scores: countries in the latent space Y2 Y3 Y4 Y5 0 Y1 5 X2 (Democratization) X1 (Industrialization) Democratization 10 Dem1960 Dem1965 1 5 9 13 18 23 28 33 38 43 48 53 58 63 68 73 Country (ordered by industrialization factor) (a) (b) Figure 1: (a) A graphical representation of a latent variable model. Notice that in general latent variables will be dependent. Here, the question is how to quantify democratization and industrialization levels of nations given observed indicators Y such as freedom of press and gross national product, among others (Bollen, 1989; Palomo et al., 2007). (b) An example of a result implied by the model (adapted from Palomo et al. (2007)): barplots of the conditional distribution of democratization levels given the observed indicators at two time points, ordered by the posterior mean industrialization level. The distribution of the latent variables given the observations is the basis of the analysis. Our contribution is a methodology for choosing which indicators to preserve (e.g., which items to keep in a questionnaire) given: i.) a latent variable model speciﬁcation of the domain of interest; ii.) a target number of indicators that should be preserved. To accomplish this, we provide: i.) a target objective function that quantiﬁes the amount of information preserved by a choice of a subset of indicators, with respect to the full set; ii.) algorithms for optimizing this choice of subset with respect to the objective function. The general idea is to start with a target posterior distribution of latent variables, deﬁned by some latent variable measurement model M (i.e., PM (X | Y)). We want to choose a subset Yz ⊂ Y so that the resulting conditional distribution PM (X | Yz ) is as close as possible to the original one according to some metric. Model M is provided either by expertise or by numerous standard approaches that can be applied to learn it from data (e.g., methods in Bishop, 2009). We call this task measurement model thinning. Notice that the size of Yz is a domain-dependent choice. Assuming M is a good model for the data, choosing a subset of indicators will incur some information loss. It is up to the analyst to choose a trade-off between loss of information and the design of simpler, cheaper ways of measuring latent variables. Even if a shorter questionnaire is not to be deployed, the outcome of measurement model thinning provides a formal sensitivity analysis of the target latent distribution with respect to the available indicators. The result is useful to generate different insights into the domain. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 deﬁnes a formal criterion to quantify how appropriate a subset Yz is. Section 3 describes different approaches in which this criterion can be optimized. Related work is brieﬂy discussed in Section 4. Experiments with synthetic and real data are discussed in Section 5, followed by the conclusion. 2 An Information-Theoretical Criterion Our focus is on domains where latent variables are not a by-product of a dimensionality reduction technique, but the target of the analysis as in the example of Figure 1. That is, measurement error problems where the variables to be recorded are designed speciﬁcally to obtain information concerning such unknowns (Carroll et al., 1995; Bartholomew et al., 2008). As such, we postulate that the outcome of any analysis should be a functional of PM (X | Y), the conditional distribution of unobservables X given observables Y within a model M. It is assumed that M speciﬁes the joint PM (X, Y). We further assume that observed variables are conditionally independent given X, i.e. p PM (X, Y) = PM (X) i=1 PM (Yi | X), with p being the number of observed indicators. 2 If z ≡ (z1 , z2 , . . . , zp ) is a binary vector of the same dimensionality as Y, and Yz is the subset of Y corresponding the non-zero entries of z, we can assess z by the KL divergence PM (X | Y) dX KL(PM (X | Y) || PM (X | Yz )) ≡ PM (X | Y) log PM (X | Yz ) This is well-deﬁned, since both distributions lie in the same sample space despite the difference of dimensionality between Y and Yz . Moreover, since Y is itself a random vector, our criterion becomes the expected KL divergence KL(PM (X | Y) || PM (X | Yz )) PM (Y) where · denotes expectation. Our goal is to minimize this function with respect to z. Rearranging this expression to drop all constants that do not depend on z, and multiplying it by −1 to get a maximization problem, we obtain the problem of ﬁnding z⋆ such that z⋆ = argmaxz log(PM (Yz | X)) PM (X,Yz ) − log(PM (Yz )) PM (Yz ) p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) = argmaxz ≡ + HM (Yz ) i=1 argmaxz FM (z) PM (X,Yi ) p i=1 zi = K for a choice of K, and zi ∈ {0, 1}. HM (·) denotes here the entropy of subject to a distribution parameterized by M. Notice we used the assumption that indicators are mutually independent given X. There is an intuitive appeal of having a joint entropy term to reward not only marginal relationships between indicators and latent variables, but also selections that are jointly diverse. Notice that optimizing this objective function turns out to be equivalent to minimizing the conditional entropy of latent variables given Yz . Motivating conditional entropy from a more fundamental principle illustrates that other functions can be obtained by changing the divergence. 3 Approaches for Approximate Optimization The problem of optimizing FM (z) subject to the constraints p zi = K, zi ∈ {0, 1}, is hard i=1 not only for its combinatorial nature, but due to the entropy term. This needs to be approximated, and the nature of the approximation should depend on the form taken by M. We will assume that it is possible to efﬁciently compute any marginals of PM (Y) of modest dimensionality (say, 10 dimensions). This is the case, for instance, in the probit model for binary data: X ∼ N (0, Σ), Yi⋆ ∼ N (ΛT X + λi;0 , 1), i Yi = 1, if Yi⋆ > 0, and 0 otherwise where N (m, S) is the multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean m and covariance matrix S. The probit model is one of the most common latent variable models for questionnaire data (Bartholomew et al., 2008), with a straigthforward extension to ordinal data. In this model, marginals for a few dozen variables can be obtained efﬁciently since this corresponds to calculating multivariate Gaussian probabilities (Genz, 1992). Parameters can be ﬁt by a variety of methods (Hahn et al., 2010). We also assume that M allows for the computation of log(PM (Yi | X)) PM (X,Yi ) at little cost. Again, in the binary probit model this is simple, since this requires integrating away a single binary variable Yi and a univariate Gaussian ΛT X. i 3.1 Gaussian Entropy One approximation to FM (z) is to replace its entropy term by the corresponding entropy from some Gaussian distribution PN (Yz ). The entropy of a Gaussian distribution is proportional to the logarithm of the determinant of its covariance matrix, and hence can be computed in O(p3 ) steps. This Gaussian can be chosen as the one closest to PM (Yz ) in a KL(PM || PN ) sense: that is, the one with the same ﬁrst and second moments as PM (Yz ). In our case, computing these moments can be done deterministically (up to numerical error) using standard bivariate quadrature methods. No expectation-propagation (Minka, 2001) is necessary. The corresponding objective function is p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;N (z) ≡ i=1 3 PM (X,Yi ) + 0.5 log |Σz | where Σz is the covariance matrix of Yz – which for binary and ordinal data has a sensible interpretation. This function is also an upper bound on the exact function, FM (z), since the Gaussian is the distribution with the largest entropy for a given mean vector and covariance matrix. The resulting function is non-linear in z. In our experiments, we optimize for z using a greedy scheme: for all possible pairs (i, j) such that zi = 1 and zj = 0, we swap its values (so that i zi is always K). We choose the pair with the highest increase in FM;N (z) and repeat the process until convergence. 3.2 Entropy with Bounded Neighborhoods An alternative bound can be derived from a standard fact in information theory: H(Y | S) ≤ H(Y | S ′ ) for S ′ ⊆ S, where H(· | ·) denotes conditional entropy. This was exploited by Globerson and Jaakkola (2007) to deﬁne an upper bound in the entropy of a distribution as follows: consider a permutation e of the set {1, 2, . . . , p}, with e(i) being the i-th element of e. Denote by e(1 : i) the ﬁrst i elements of this permutation (an empty set if i < 1). Moreover, let N (e, i) be a subset of e(1 : i − 1). For a given set variables Y = {Y1 , Y2 , . . . , Yp } the following bound holds: p n H(Ye(i) | YN (e,i) ) H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) ≤ H(Y1 , Y2 , . . . Yp ) = (1) i=1 i=1 If each set N (e, i) is no larger than some constant D, then this bound can be computed in O(p · 2D ) steps for binary probit models. The bound holds for any choice of e, but we want it to be as tight as possible so that it gets weighted in a reasonable way against the other terms in FM (·). Since the entropy function is decomposable as a sum of functions that depend on i and N (e, i) only, one can minimize this bound with respect to e by using permutation optimization methods such as (Jaakkola et al., 2010). In our implementation, we use a method similar to Teyssier and Koller (2005) that shufﬂes neighboring entries of e to generate candidates, chooses the optimal N (e, i) for each i given the candidate e, and picks as the next permutation the candidate e with the greatest decrease in the bound. Notice that a permutation choice e and neighborhood choices N (e, i) deﬁne a Bayesian network where N (e, i) are the parents of Ye(i) . Therefore, if this Bayesian network model provides a good approximation to PM (Y), the bound will be reasonably tight. Given e, we will further relax this bound with the goal of obtaining an integer programming formulation for the problem of optimizing an upper bound to FM (z). For any given z, we deﬁne the local term HL (z, i) as    HL (z, i) ≡ HM (Ye(i) | Yz ∩N (e, i)) = S∈P (N (e,i))  j∈S zj   k∈N (e,i)\S (1 − zk ) HM (Ye(i) | S) (2) where P (·) denotes the power set of a set. The new approximate objective function becomes p p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;D (z) ≡ PM (X,Yi ) ze(i) HL (z, i) + (3) i=1 i=1 Notice that HL (z, i) is still an upper bound on HM (Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ). The intuition is that we are bounding HM (Yz ) by the entropy of a Bayesian network where a vertex Ye(i) is included if ze(i) = 1, with corresponding parents given by Yz ∩ N (e, i). This is a well-deﬁned Bayesian network for any choice of z. The shortcoming is that ideally we would like this Bayesian network to be the actual marginal of the model given by e and N (e, i). It is not: if the network implied by e and N (e, i) was, for instance, Y1 → Y2 → Y3 , the choice of z = (1, 0, 1) would result on the entropy of the disconnected graph {Y1 , Y3 }, while the true marginal would correspond instead to the graph Y1 → Y3 . However, our simpliﬁed marginalization has the advantage of avoiding an intractable problem. Moreover, it allows us to redeﬁne the problem as an integer linear program (ILP). Each product ze(i) j zj k (1−zk ) appearing in (3) results in a sum of O(2D ) terms, each of which has (up to a sign) the form qM ≡ m∈M zm for some set M . It is still the case that qM ∈ {0, 1}. Therefore, objective function (3) can be interpreted as being linear on a set of binary variables {{z}, {q}}. We need further to enforce the constraints coming from qM = 1 ⇒ {∀m ∈ M, zm = 1}; qM = 0 ⇒ {∃m ∈ M s.t. zm = 0} 4 It is well-known (Glover and Woolsey, 1974) that this corresponds to the linear constraints qM = 1 ⇒ {∀m ∈ M, zm = 1} ⇔ ∀m ∈ M, qM − zm ≤ 0 qM = 0 ⇒ {∃m ∈ M s.t. zm = 0} ⇔ m∈M zm − qM ≤ |M | − 1 p which combined with the linear constraint i=1 zi = K implies that optimizing FM;D (z) is an ILP with O(p · 2D ) variables and O(p2 · 2D ) constraints. In our experiments in Section 5, we were able to solve essentially all of such ILPs exactly using linear programming relaxations with branch-and-bound. 3.3 Entropy with Tree-Structured Bounds The previous bound simpliﬁes marginalization, which might badly overestimate entropies where the corresponding Yz are uniformly spread out in permutation e. We now propose a different type of bound which treats different marginalizations on an equal footing. It comes from the following observation: since H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) is less than or equal to any conditional entropy H(Ye(i) | Yj ) for j ∈ e(1 : i − 1), we have that the tighest bound given by singleton conditioning sets is H(Ye(i) | Ye(1:i−1) ) ≤ min j∈e(1:i−1) HM (Ye(i) | Yj ), resulting in the objective function p p zi log(PM (Yi | X)) FM;tree (z) ≡ ze(i) · PM (X,Yi ) + i=1 i=1 min {Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) (4) where min{Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) ≡ H(Ye(i) ) if Ye(1:i−1) ∩ Yz = ∅. The intuition is that we are bounding the exact entropy using the entropy of a directed tree rooted at Yez (1) , the ﬁrst element of Yz according to e. That is, all variables are marginally dependent in the approximation regardless of what z is, and for a ﬁxed z the tree is, by construction, the one obtained by the usual greedy algorithm of adding edges corresponding to the next legal pair of vertices with maximum mutual information (following an ordering, in this case). It turns out we can also write (4) as a linear objective function of a polynomial number of 0\1 (i−1) (2) (1) be the values of set variables and constraints. Let zi ≡ 1 − zi . Let Hi , Hi , . . . , Hi ¯ (i−1) (1) be{HM (Ye(i) | Ye(1) ), . . . , HM (Ye(i) | Ye(i−1) )} sorted in ascending order, with zi , . . . , zi ing the corresponding permutation of {ze(1) , . . . , ze(i−1) }. We have min{Yj ∈Ye(1:i−1) ∩Yz } H(Ye(i) | Yj ) (j) (j) j−1 (1) (1) (1) (2) (2) (1) (2) (3) (3) ¯ ¯ ¯ = z i Hi + z i z i H i + z i z i z i H i + . . . (i−2) (i−1) (i−1) (1) i−1 (j) + j=1 zi HM (Ye(i) ) ¯ Hi zi ¯ zi . . . zi ¯ (i) i−1 (j) (j) + qi HM (Ye(i) ) ≡ j=1 qi Hi (k) ¯ where qi ≡ zi k=1 zi , and also a binary 0\1 variable. Plugging this expression into (4) gives a linear objective function in this extended variable space. The corresponding constraints are (j−1) (j) (1) (j) , zi }, zm = 1} ¯ z qi = 1 ⇒ {∀zm ∈ {¯i , . . . , zi (j−1) (j) (1) (j) , zi } s.t. zm = 0} ¯ z qi = 0 ⇒ {∃zm ∈ {¯i , . . . , zi which, as shown in the previous section, can be written as linear constraints (substituting each zi ¯ by 1 − zi ). The total number of constraints is however O(p3 ), which can be expensive, and often a linear relaxation procedure with branch-and-bound fails to provide guarantees of optimality. 3.4 The Reliability Score Finally, it is important to design cheap, effective criteria whose maxima correlate with the maxima of FM (·). Empirically, we have found high quality selections in binary probit models using the solution to the problem p p wi zi , subject to zi ∈ {0, 1}, maximize FM;R (z) = zi = K i=1 i=1 5 where wi = ΛT ΣΛi . This can be solved by picking the corresponding indicators with the highest i K weights wi . Assuming a probit model where the measurement error for each Yi⋆ has the same variance of 1, this score is related to the “reliability” of an indicator. Simply put, the reliability Ri of an indicator is the proportion of its variance that is due to the latent variables (Bollen, 1989, Chapter 6): Ri = wi /(wi + 1) for each Yi⋆ . There is no current theory linking this solution to the problem of maximizing FM (·): since there is no entropy term, we can set an adversarial problem to easily defeat this method. For instance, this happens in a model where the K indicators of highest reliability all measure the same latent variable Xi and nothing else – much information about Xi would be preserved, but little about other variables. In any case, we found this criterion to be fairly competitive even if at times it produces extreme failures. An honest account of more sophisticated selection mechanisms cannot be performed without including it, as we do in Section 5. 4 Related Work The literature on survey analysis, in the context of latent variable models, contains several examples of guidelines on how to simplify questionnaires (sometimes described as providing “shortened versions” of scales). Much of the literature, however, consists of describing general guidelines and rules-of-thumb to accomplish this task (e.g, Richins, 2004; Stanton et al., 2002). One possible exception is Leite et al. (2008), which uses different model ﬁtness criteria with respect to a given dataset to score candidate solutions, along with an expensive combinatorial optimization method. This conﬂates model selection and questionnaire thinning, and there is no theory linking the score functions to the amount of information preserved. In the machine learning and statistics literature, there is a large body of research in active learning, which is related to our task. One of the closest approaches is the one by Liang et al. (2009), which casts the classical problem of measurement selection within a Bayesian graphical model perspective. In that work, one has to choose which measurements to add. This is done sequentially, partially motivated by problems where collecting new measurements can be done relatively fast and cheap (say, by paying graduate students to annotate text data), and so the choice of next measurement can make use of fresh data. In our case, it not might be realistic to expect we can perform a large number of iterations of data collection – and as such the task of reducing the number of measurements from a large initial collection might be more relevant in practice. Liang et al. also focus on (multivariate) supervised learning instead of purely unsupervised learning. In statistics there is also a considerable body of literature on sufﬁcient dimension reduction and its sparse variants (e.g., Chen et al., 2010). Such techniques create a bottleneck between two sets of variables in a regression problem (say, the mapping from Y to X) while eliminating some of the input variables. In principle one might want to adapt such models to take a latent variable model M as the target mapping. Besides some loss of interpretability, the computational implications might be problematic, though. Moreover, this framework has another free parameter corresponding to the dimensionality of the bottleneck that has to be set. It is not clear how this parameter, along with a choice of sparsity level, would interact with a ﬁxed choice K of indicators to be kept. 5 Experiments In this section, we ﬁrst describe some synthetic experiments to provide insights about the different methods, followed by one brief description of a case study. In all of the experiments, the target models M are binary probit. We set the neighborhood parameter for FM;N (·) to 9. The ordering e for the tree-structured method is obtained by the same greedy search of Section 3.2, where now the score is the average of all H(Yi | Yj ) for all Yj preceding Yi . Finally, all ordering optimization methods were initialized by sorting indicators in a descending order according to their reliability scores, and the initial solution for all entropy-based optimization methods was given by the reliability score solution of Section 3.4. The integer program solver G UROBI 4.02 was used in all experiments. 5.1 Synthetic studies We start with a batch of synthetic experiments. We generated 80 models with 40 indicators and 10 latent variables1 . We further preprocess such models into two groups: in 40 of them, we select a 1 Details on the model generation: we generate 40 models by sampling the latent covariance matrix from an inverse Wishart distribution with 10 degrees of freedom and scale matrix 10I, I being the identity matrix. 6 Improvement ratio: high signal Mean error: high signal Improvement ratio: low signal Mean error: low signal 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0 0 0.25 Reliability score Reliability score 0.4 0.2 0.15 0.25 0.2 0.15 −0.1 −0.1 0.1 N/R T/R G/R N/S T/S G/S N/R T/R G/R N/S T/S 0.1 G/S 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.1 0.15 0.2 Tree bound (a) (c) (b) 0.25 0.3 Tree bound (d) Figure 2: (a) A comparison of the bounded neighborhood (N ), tree-based (T ) and Gaussian (G) methods with respect to a random solution (R) and the reliability score (S).

The bottom-left clouds correspond to the K = 32 trials. target reliability ri for each indicator Yi , uniformly at random from the interval [0.4 0.7]. We then rescale coefﬁcients Λi such that the reliability (deﬁned in Section 3.4) of the respective Yi⋆ becomes ri . For the remaining 40 models, we sample ri uniformly at random from the interval [0.2 0.4]. We perform two choices of subsets: sets Yz of size 20 and 32 (50% and 80% of the total number of indicators). Our evaluation is as follows: since the expected value is perhaps the most common functional of the posterior distribution PM (X | Y), we calculate the expected value of the latent variables for a sample {y(1) , y(2) , . . . , y(1000) } of size 1000 taken from the respective synthetic models. This is done for the full set of 40 indicators, and for each set chosen by our four criteria: for each data point i and each objective function F , we evaluate the average distance (i) (i) (i) (i) ˆ ˆ dF ≡ 10 |ˆj − xj;F |/10. In this case, xj is the expected value of Xj obtained by conditioning j=1 x (i) on all indicators, while xj;F is the one obtained with the subset selected by optimizing F . We denote ˆ (1) (2) (1000) by mF the average of {dF , dF , . . . , dF }. Finally, we compare the three main methods with respect to the reliability score method using the improvement ratio statistic sF = 1 − mF /mFM;R , the proportion of average error decrease with respect to the reliability score. In order to provide a sense of scale on the difﬁculty of each problem, we compute the same ratios with respect to a random selection, obtained by choosing K = 20 and K = 32 indicators uniformly at random. Figure 2 provides a summary of the results. In Figure 2(a), each boxplot shows the distribution over the 40 probit models where reliabilities were sampled between [0.4 0.7] (the “high signal” models). The ﬁrst three boxplots show the scores sF of the bounded neighborhood, tree-structured and Gaussian methods, respectively, compared against random selections. The last three boxplots are comparisons against the reliability heuristic. The tree-based method easily beats the Gaussian method, with about 75% of its outcomes being better than the median Gaussian outcome. The Gaussian approach is also less reliable, with results showing a long lower tail. Although the reliability score is on average a good approach, in only a handful of cases it was better than the tree-based method, and by considerably smaller magnitudes compared to the upper tails in the tree-based outcome distribution. A separate panel (Figure 2(b)) is shown for the 40 models with lower reliabilities. In this case, all methods show stronger improvements over the reliability score, although now there is a less clear difference between the tree method and the Gaussian one. Finally, in panels (c) and (d) we present scatterplots for the average deviances mF of the tree-based method against the reliability score. The two clouds correspond to the solutions with 20 and 32 indicators. Notice that in the vast majority of the cases the tree-based method does better. We then rescale the matrix to make all variances equal to 1. We also generate 40 models using as the inverse Wishart scale matrix the correlation matrix will all off-diagonal entries set to 0.5. Coefﬁcients linking indicators to latent variables were set to zero with probability 0.8, and sampled from a standard Gaussian otherwise. If some latent variable ends up with no child, or an indicator ends up with no parent, we uniformly choose one child/parent to be linked to it.

In 2009, a major survey called the National Health Service National Staff Survey was deployed with the goal of “collect(ing) staff views about working in their local NHS trust” (Care Quality Comission and Aston University, 2010). A questionnaire of 206 items was ﬁlled by 156, 951 respondents. We designed a measurement model based on the structure of the questionnaire and ﬁt it by the posterior expected value estimator. Gaussian and inverse Wishart priors were used, along with Gibbs sampling and a random subset of 50, 000 respondents. See the Supplementary Material for more details. Several items in this survey asked for the NHS staff member to provide degrees of agreement in a Likert scale (Bartholomew et al., 2008) to questions such as • • • • . . . have you ever come to work despite not feeling well enough to perform . . . ? Have you felt pressure from your manager to come to work? Have you felt pressure from colleagues to come to work? Have you put yourself under pressure to come to work? as different probes into an unobservable self-assessed level of work pressure. We preprocessed and binarized the data to ﬁrst narrow it down to 63 questions. We compare selections of 32 (50%) and 50 (80%) items using the same statistics of the previous section. sF ;D sF ;tree sF ;N sF ;random mF ;tree mF ;R K = 32 K = 50 7.8% 10.5% 6.3% 11.9% 0.01% 7.6% −16.0% −0.05% 0.238 0.123 0.255 0.140 Although gains were relatively small (as measured by the difference between reconstruction errors mF ;tree − mF ;R and the good performance of a random selection), we showed that: i.) we do improve results over a popular measure of indicator quality; ii.) we do provide some guarantees about the diversity of the selected items via a information-theoretical measure with an entropy term, with theoretically sound approximations to such a measure. For more details on the preprocessing, and more insights into the different selections, please refer to the Supplementary Material. 6 Conclusion There are problems where one posits that the relevant information is encoded in the posterior distribution of a set of latent variables. Questionnaires (and other instruments) can be used as evidence to generate this posterior, but there is a cost associated with complex questionnaires. One problem is how to simplify such instruments of measurement. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the ﬁrst formal account on how to solve it. Nevertheless, we would like to stress there is no substitute for common sense. While the tools we provide here can be used for a variety of analyses – from deploying simpler questionnaires to sensitivity analysis – the value and cost of keeping particular indicators can go much beyond the information contained in the latent posterior distribution. How to combine this criterion with other domain-dependent criteria is a matter of future research. Another problem of importance is how to deal with model speciﬁcation and transportability across studies. A measurement model built for a very speciﬁc population of respondents might transfer poorly to another group, and therefore taking into account model uncertainty will be important. The Bayesian setup discussed by Liang et al. (2009) might provide some directions on this issue. Also, there is further structure in real-world questionnaires we are not exploiting in the current work. Namely, it is not uncommon to have questionnaires with branching questions and other dynamic behaviour more commonly associated with Web based surveys and/or longitudinal studies. Finally, hybrid approaches combining the bounded neighborhood and the tree-structured methods, along with more sophisticated ordering optimization procedures and the use of other divergence measures and determinant-based criteria (e.g. Kulesza and Taskar, 2011), will also be studied in the future.

<p>Author: Siwei Lyu</p><p>Abstract: When used to learn high dimensional parametric probabilistic models, the classical maximum likelihood (ML) learning often suffers from computational intractability, which motivates the active developments of non-ML learning methods. Yet, because of their divergent motivations and forms, the objective functions of many non-ML learning methods are seemingly unrelated, and there lacks a uniﬁed framework to understand them. In this work, based on an information geometric view of parametric learning, we introduce a general non-ML learning principle termed as minimum KL contraction, where we seek optimal parameters that minimizes the contraction of the KL divergence between the two distributions after they are transformed with a KL contraction operator. We then show that the objective functions of several important or recently developed non-ML learning methods, including contrastive divergence [12], noise-contrastive estimation [11], partial likelihood [7], non-local contrastive objectives [31], score matching [14], pseudo-likelihood [3], maximum conditional likelihood [17], maximum mutual information [2], maximum marginal likelihood [9], and conditional and marginal composite likelihood [24], can be uniﬁed under the minimum KL contraction framework with different choices of the KL contraction operators. 1</p><p>5 0.47583655 <a title="123-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>6 0.45273405 <a title="123-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Analytical_Results_for_the_Error_in_Filtering_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">37 nips-2011-Analytical Results for the Error in Filtering of Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Balazs B. Ujfalussy, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Computational analyses of dendritic computations often assume stationary inputs to neurons, ignoring the pulsatile nature of spike-based communication between neurons and the moment-to-moment ﬂuctuations caused by such spiking inputs. Conversely, circuit computations with spiking neurons are usually formalized without regard to the rich nonlinear nature of dendritic processing. Here we address the computational challenge faced by neurons that compute and represent analogue quantities but communicate with digital spikes, and show that reliable computation of even purely linear functions of inputs can require the interplay of strongly nonlinear subunits within the postsynaptic dendritic tree. Our theory predicts a matching of dendritic nonlinearities and synaptic weight distributions to the joint statistics of presynaptic inputs. This approach suggests normative roles for some puzzling forms of nonlinear dendritic dynamics and plasticity. 1</p><p>2 0.69258487 <a title="123-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Spike_and_Slab_Variational_Inference_for_Multi-Task_and_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">269 nips-2011-Spike and Slab Variational Inference for Multi-Task and Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Miguel Lázaro-gredilla, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a variational Bayesian inference algorithm which can be widely applied to sparse linear models. The algorithm is based on the spike and slab prior which, from a Bayesian perspective, is the golden standard for sparse inference. We apply the method to a general multi-task and multiple kernel learning model in which a common set of Gaussian process functions is linearly combined with task-speciﬁc sparse weights, thus inducing relation between tasks. This model uniﬁes several sparse linear models, such as generalized linear models, sparse factor analysis and matrix factorization with missing values, so that the variational algorithm can be applied to all these cases. We demonstrate our approach in multioutput Gaussian process regression, multi-class classiﬁcation, image processing applications and collaborative ﬁltering. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.68396145 <a title="123-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-How_biased_are_maximum_entropy_models%3F.html">123 nips-2011-How biased are maximum entropy models?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob H. Macke, Iain Murray, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy models have become popular statistical models in neuroscience and other areas in biology, and can be useful tools for obtaining estimates of mutual information in biological systems. However, maximum entropy models ﬁt to small data sets can be subject to sampling bias; i.e. the true entropy of the data can be severely underestimated. Here we study the sampling properties of estimates of the entropy obtained from maximum entropy models. We show that if the data is generated by a distribution that lies in the model class, the bias is equal to the number of parameters divided by twice the number of observations. However, in practice, the true distribution is usually outside the model class, and we show here that this misspeciﬁcation can lead to much larger bias. We provide a perturbative approximation of the maximally expected bias when the true model is out of model class, and we illustrate our results using numerical simulations of an Ising model; i.e. the second-order maximum entropy distribution on binary data. 1</p><p>4 0.61839581 <a title="123-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>5 0.60827452 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Spatial_distance_dependent_Chinese_restaurant_processes_for_image_segmentation.html">266 nips-2011-Spatial distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes for image segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Soumya Ghosh, Andrei B. Ungureanu, Erik B. Sudderth, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: The distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) was recently introduced to accommodate random partitions of non-exchangeable data [1]. The ddCRP clusters data in a biased way: each data point is more likely to be clustered with other data that are near it in an external sense. This paper examines the ddCRP in a spatial setting with the goal of natural image segmentation. We explore the biases of the spatial ddCRP model and propose a novel hierarchical extension better suited for producing “human-like” segmentations. We then study the sensitivity of the models to various distance and appearance hyperparameters, and provide the ﬁrst rigorous comparison of nonparametric Bayesian models in the image segmentation domain. On unsupervised image segmentation, we demonstrate that similar performance to existing nonparametric Bayesian models is possible with substantially simpler models and algorithms.</p><p>6 0.59251332 <a title="123-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Recovery_with_Brownian_Sensing.html">264 nips-2011-Sparse Recovery with Brownian Sensing</a></p>

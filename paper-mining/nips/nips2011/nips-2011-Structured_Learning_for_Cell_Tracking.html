<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>3 0.23551692 <a title="275-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Video_Annotation_and_Tracking_with_Active_Learning.html">303 nips-2011-Video Annotation and Tracking with Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Carl Vondrick, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel active learning framework for video annotation. By judiciously choosing which frames a user should annotate, we can obtain highly accurate tracks with minimal user effort. We cast this problem as one of active learning, and show that we can obtain excellent performance by querying frames that, if annotated, would produce a large expected change in the estimated object track. We implement a constrained tracker and compute the expected change for putative annotations with efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on four datasets, including two benchmark datasets constructed with key frame annotations obtained by Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results indicate that we could obtain equivalent labels for a small fraction of the original cost. 1</p><p>4 0.17566469 <a title="275-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-An_ideal_observer_model_for_identifying_the_reference_frame_of_objects.html">35 nips-2011-An ideal observer model for identifying the reference frame of objects</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph L. Austerweil, Abram L. Friesen, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The object people perceive in an image can depend on its orientation relative to the scene it is in (its reference frame). For example, the images of the symbols × and + differ by a 45 degree rotation. Although real scenes have multiple images and reference frames, psychologists have focused on scenes with only one reference frame. We propose an ideal observer model based on nonparametric Bayesian statistics for inferring the number of reference frames in a scene and their parameters. When an ambiguous image could be assigned to two conﬂicting reference frames, the model predicts two factors should inﬂuence the reference frame inferred for the image: The image should be more likely to share the reference frame of the closer object (proximity) and it should be more likely to share the reference frame containing the most objects (alignment). We conﬁrm people use both cues using a novel methodology that allows for easy testing of human reference frame inference. 1</p><p>5 0.12913382 <a title="275-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Probabilistic_Non-Linear_Latent_Variable_Models_for_Tracking_Complex_Activities.html">148 nips-2011-Learning Probabilistic Non-Linear Latent Variable Models for Tracking Complex Activities</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela Yao, Juergen Gall, Luc V. Gool, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: A common approach for handling the complexity and inherent ambiguities of 3D human pose estimation is to use pose priors learned from training data. Existing approaches however, are either too simplistic (linear), too complex to learn, or can only learn latent spaces from “simple data”, i.e., single activities such as walking or running. In this paper, we present an efﬁcient stochastic gradient descent algorithm that is able to learn probabilistic non-linear latent spaces composed of multiple activities. Furthermore, we derive an incremental algorithm for the online setting which can update the latent space without extensive relearning. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the task of monocular and multi-view tracking and show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>6 0.11125094 <a title="275-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_person-object_interactions_for_action_recognition_in_still_images.html">154 nips-2011-Learning person-object interactions for action recognition in still images</a></p>

<p>Author: Hua Wang, Heng Huang, Farhad Kamangar, Feiping Nie, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Multi-instance learning (MIL) considers input as bags of instances, in which labels are assigned to the bags. MIL is useful in many real-world applications. For example, in image categorization semantic meanings (labels) of an image mostly arise from its regions (instances) instead of the entire image (bag). Existing MIL methods typically build their models using the Bag-to-Bag (B2B) distance, which are often computationally expensive and may not truly reﬂect the semantic similarities. To tackle this, in this paper we approach MIL problems from a new perspective using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance, which directly assesses the relationships between the classes and the bags. Taking into account the two major challenges in MIL, high heterogeneity on data and weak label association, we propose a novel Maximum Margin Multi-Instance Learning (M3 I) approach to parameterize the C2B distance by introducing the class speciﬁc distance metrics and the locally adaptive signiﬁcance coefﬁcients. We apply our new approach to the automatic image categorization tasks on three (one single-label and two multilabel) benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promising results that validate the proposed method.</p><p>3 0.69364965 <a title="275-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Newtron%3A_an_Efficient_Bandit_algorithm_for_Online_Multiclass_Prediction.html">185 nips-2011-Newtron: an Efficient Bandit algorithm for Online Multiclass Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We present an efﬁcient algorithm for the problem of online multiclass prediction with bandit feedback in the fully adversarial setting. We measure its regret with respect to the log-loss deﬁned in [AR09], which is parameterized by a scalar α. We prove that the regret of N EWTRON is O(log T ) when α is a constant that does not vary with horizon T , and at most O(T 2/3 ) if α is allowed to increase to inﬁnity √ with T . For α = O(log T ), the regret is bounded by O( T ), thus solving the open problem of [KSST08, AR09]. Our algorithm is based on a novel application of the online Newton method [HAK07]. We test our algorithm and show it to perform well in experiments, even when α is a small constant. 1</p><p>4 0.68868852 <a title="275-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Multi-Bandit_Best_Arm_Identification.html">175 nips-2011-Multi-Bandit Best Arm Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Gabillon, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Alessandro Lazaric, Sébastien Bubeck</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of identifying the best arm in each of the bandits in a multibandit multi-armed setting. We ﬁrst propose an algorithm called Gap-based Exploration (GapE) that focuses on the arms whose mean is close to the mean of the best arm in the same bandit (i.e., small gap). We then introduce an algorithm, called GapE-V, which takes into account the variance of the arms in addition to their gap. We prove an upper-bound on the probability of error for both algorithms. Since GapE and GapE-V need to tune an exploration parameter that depends on the complexity of the problem, which is often unknown in advance, we also introduce variations of these algorithms that estimate this complexity online. Finally, we evaluate the performance of these algorithms and compare them to other allocation strategies on a number of synthetic problems.</p><p>5 0.68477613 <a title="275-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>
<p>Author: Purushottam Kar, Prateek Jain</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of classiﬁcation using similarity/distance functions over data. Speciﬁcally, we propose a framework for deﬁning the goodness of a (dis)similarity function with respect to a given learning task and propose algorithms that have guaranteed generalization properties when working with such good functions. Our framework uniﬁes and generalizes the frameworks proposed by [1] and [2]. An attractive feature of our framework is its adaptability to data - we do not promote a ﬁxed notion of goodness but rather let data dictate it. We show, by giving theoretical guarantees that the goodness criterion best suited to a problem can itself be learned which makes our approach applicable to a variety of domains and problems. We propose a landmarking-based approach to obtaining a classiﬁer from such learned goodness criteria. We then provide a novel diversity based heuristic to perform task-driven selection of landmark points instead of random selection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our goodness criteria learning method as well as the landmark selection heuristic on a variety of similarity-based learning datasets and benchmark UCI datasets on which our method consistently outperforms existing approaches by a signiﬁcant margin. 1</p><p>6 0.68283999 <a title="275-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>

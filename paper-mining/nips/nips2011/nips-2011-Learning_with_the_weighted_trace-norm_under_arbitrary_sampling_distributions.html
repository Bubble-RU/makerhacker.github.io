<p>Author: Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Non-negative data are commonly encountered in numerous ﬁelds, making nonnegative least squares regression (NNLS) a frequently used tool. At least relative to its simplicity, it often performs rather well in practice. Serious doubts about its usefulness arise for modern high-dimensional linear models. Even in this setting − unlike ﬁrst intuition may suggest − we show that for a broad class of designs, NNLS is resistant to overﬁtting and works excellently for sparse recovery when combined with thresholding, experimentally even outperforming 1 regularization. Since NNLS also circumvents the delicate choice of a regularization parameter, our ﬁndings suggest that NNLS may be the method of choice. 1</p><p>3 0.17460921 <a title="159-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.16739337 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>5 0.1530665 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Large-Scale_Category_Structure_Aware_Image_Categorization.html">141 nips-2011-Large-Scale Category Structure Aware Image Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Bin Zhao, Fei Li, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Most previous research on image categorization has focused on medium-scale data sets, while large-scale image categorization with millions of images from thousands of categories remains a challenge. With the emergence of structured large-scale dataset such as the ImageNet, rich information about the conceptual relationships between images, such as a tree hierarchy among various image categories, become available. As human cognition of complex visual world beneﬁts from underlying semantic relationships between object classes, we believe a machine learning system can and should leverage such information as well for better performance. In this paper, we employ such semantic relatedness among image categories for large-scale image categorization. Speciﬁcally, a category hierarchy is utilized to properly deﬁne loss function and select common set of features for related categories. An efﬁcient optimization method based on proximal approximation and accelerated parallel gradient method is introduced. Experimental results on a subset of ImageNet containing 1.2 million images from 1000 categories demonstrate the effectiveness and promise of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.14801247 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Message-Passing_for_Approximate_MAP_Inference_with_Latent_Variables.html">170 nips-2011-Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiarong Jiang, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general inference setting for discrete probabilistic graphical models where we seek maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subset of the random variables (max nodes), marginalizing over the rest (sum nodes). We present a hybrid message-passing algorithm to accomplish this. The hybrid algorithm passes a mix of sum and max messages depending on the type of source node (sum or max). We derive our algorithm by showing that it falls out as the solution of a particular relaxation of a variational framework. We further show that the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be seen as an approximation to our algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, against several baselines, demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.51151204 <a title="159-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: A hallmark of modern machine learning is its ability to deal with high dimensional problems by exploiting structural assumptions that limit the degrees of freedom in the underlying model. A deep understanding of the capabilities and limits of high dimensional learning methods under specific assumptions such as sparsity, group sparsity, and low rank has been attsined. Efforts [1,2] are now underway to distill this valuable experience by proposing general unified frameworks that can achieve the twio goals of summarizing previous analyses and enabling their application to notions of structure hitherto unexplored. Inspired by these developments, we propose and analyze a general computational scheme based on a greedy strategy to solve convex optimization problems that arise when dealing with structurally constrained high-dimensional problems. Our framework not only unifies existing greedy algorithms by recovering them as special cases but also yields novel ones. Finally, we extend our results to infinite dimensional settings by using interesting connections between smoothness of norms and behavior of martingales in Banach spaces.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82378143 <a title="159-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Learning_with_the_weighted_trace-norm_under_arbitrary_sampling_distributions.html">159 nips-2011-Learning with the weighted trace-norm under arbitrary sampling distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Extracting good representations from images is essential for many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP), which builds a feature hierarchy layer-by-layer using an efﬁcient matching pursuit encoder. It includes three modules: batch (tree) orthogonal matching pursuit, spatial pyramid max pooling, and contrast normalization. We investigate the architecture of HMP, and show that all three components are critical for good performance. To speed up the orthogonal matching pursuit, we propose a batch tree orthogonal matching pursuit that is particularly suitable to encode a large number of observations that share the same large dictionary. HMP is scalable and can efﬁciently handle full-size images. In addition, HMP enables linear support vector machines (SVM) to match the performance of nonlinear SVM while being scalable to large datasets. We compare HMP with many state-of-the-art algorithms including convolutional deep belief networks, SIFT based single layer sparse coding, and kernel based feature learning. HMP consistently yields superior accuracy on three types of image classiﬁcation problems: object recognition (Caltech-101), scene recognition (MIT-Scene), and static event recognition (UIUC-Sports). 1</p><p>4 0.79820669 <a title="159-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_to_Learn_with_Compound_HD_Models.html">156 nips-2011-Learning to Learn with Compound HD Models</a></p>

Speciﬁcally we show how we can learn a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) prior over the activities of the top-level features in a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). This compound HDP-DBM model learns to learn novel concepts from very few training examples, by learning low-level generic features, high-level features that capture correlations among low-level features, and a category hierarchy for sharing priors over the high-level features that are typical of different kinds of concepts. We present efﬁcient learning and inference algorithms for the HDP-DBM model and show that it is able to learn new concepts from very few examples on CIFAR-100 object recognition, handwritten character recognition, and human motion capture datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.77222657 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>6 0.77125239 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons.html">22 nips-2011-Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons</a></p>

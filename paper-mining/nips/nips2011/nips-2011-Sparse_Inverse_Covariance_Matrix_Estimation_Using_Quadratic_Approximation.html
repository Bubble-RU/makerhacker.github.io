<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen, Wojciech Kotlowski, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We extend the classical problem of predicting a sequence of outcomes from a ﬁnite alphabet to the matrix domain. In this extension, the alphabet of n outcomes is replaced by the set of all dyads, i.e. outer products uu where u is a vector in Rn of unit length. Whereas in the classical case the goal is to learn (i.e. sequentially predict as well as) the best multinomial distribution, in the matrix case we desire to learn the density matrix that best explains the observed sequence of dyads. We show how popular online algorithms for learning a multinomial distribution can be extended to learn density matrices. Intuitively, learning the n2 parameters of a density matrix is much harder than learning the n parameters of a multinomial distribution. Completely surprisingly, we prove that the worst-case regrets of certain classical algorithms and their matrix generalizations are identical. The reason is that the worst-case sequence of dyads share a common eigensystem, i.e. the worst case regret is achieved in the classical case. So these matrix algorithms learn the eigenvectors without any regret. 1</p><p>3 0.18276504 <a title="262-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Approximating_Semidefinite_Programs_in_Sublinear_Time.html">39 nips-2011-Approximating Semidefinite Programs in Sublinear Time</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Garber, Elad Hazan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years semideﬁnite optimization has become a tool of major importance in various optimization and machine learning problems. In many of these problems the amount of data in practice is so large that there is a constant need for faster algorithms. In this work we present the ﬁrst sublinear time approximation algorithm for semideﬁnite programs which we believe may be useful for such problems in which the size of data may cause even linear time algorithms to have prohibitive running times in practice. We present the algorithm and its analysis alongside with some theoretical lower bounds and an improved algorithm for the special problem of supervised learning of a distance metric. 1</p><p>4 0.18020256 <a title="262-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_inference_in_matrix-variate_Gaussian_models_with_%5Ciid_observation_noise.html">83 nips-2011-Efficient inference in matrix-variate Gaussian models with \iid observation noise</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Stegle, Christoph Lippert, Joris M. Mooij, Neil D. Lawrence, Karsten M. Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: Inference in matrix-variate Gaussian models has major applications for multioutput prediction and joint learning of row and column covariances from matrixvariate data. Here, we discuss an approach for efﬁcient inference in such models that explicitly account for iid observation noise. Computational tractability can be retained by exploiting the Kronecker product between row and column covariance matrices. Using this framework, we show how to generalize the Graphical Lasso in order to learn a sparse inverse covariance between features while accounting for a low-rank confounding covariance between samples. We show practical utility on applications to biology, where we model covariances with more than 100,000 dimensions. We ﬁnd greater accuracy in recovering biological network structures and are able to better reconstruct the confounders. 1</p><p>5 0.17074163 <a title="262-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Nearest_Neighbor_based_Greedy_Coordinate_Descent.html">182 nips-2011-Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Inderjit S. Dhillon, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Increasingly, optimization problems in machine learning, especially those arising from bigh-dimensional statistical estimation, bave a large number of variables. Modem statistical estimators developed over the past decade have statistical or sample complexity that depends only weakly on the number of parameters when there is some structore to the problem, such as sparsity. A central question is whether similar advances can be made in their computational complexity as well. In this paper, we propose strategies that indicate that such advances can indeed be made. In particular, we investigate the greedy coordinate descent algorithm, and note that performing the greedy step efficiently weakens the costly dependence on the problem size provided the solution is sparse. We then propose a snite of methods that perform these greedy steps efficiently by a reduction to nearest neighbor search. We also devise a more amenable form of greedy descent for composite non-smooth objectives; as well as several approximate variants of such greedy descent. We develop a practical implementation of our algorithm that combines greedy coordinate descent with locality sensitive hashing. Without tuning the latter data structore, we are not only able to significantly speed up the vanilla greedy method, hot also outperform cyclic descent when the problem size becomes large. Our resnlts indicate the effectiveness of our nearest neighbor strategies, and also point to many open questions regarding the development of computational geometric techniques tailored towards first-order optimization methods.</p><p>6 0.16707705 <a title="262-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Online_Learning%3A_Stochastic%2C_Constrained%2C_and_Smoothed_Adversaries.html">204 nips-2011-Online Learning: Stochastic, Constrained, and Smoothed Adversaries</a></p>

<p>Author: Tzu-kuo Huang, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: Vector Auto-regressive models (VAR) are useful tools for analyzing time series data. In quite a few modern time series modelling tasks, the collection of reliable time series turns out to be a major challenge, either due to the slow progression of the dynamic process of interest, or inaccessibility of repetitive measurements of the same dynamic process over time. In those situations, however, we observe that it is often easier to collect a large amount of non-sequence samples, or snapshots of the dynamic process of interest. In this work, we assume a small amount of time series data are available, and propose methods to incorporate non-sequence data into penalized least-square estimation of VAR models. We consider non-sequence data as samples drawn from the stationary distribution of the underlying VAR model, and devise a novel penalization scheme based on the Lyapunov equation concerning the covariance of the stationary distribution. Experiments on synthetic and video data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. 1</p><p>5 0.58493185 <a title="262-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_inference_in_matrix-variate_Gaussian_models_with_%5Ciid_observation_noise.html">83 nips-2011-Efficient inference in matrix-variate Gaussian models with \iid observation noise</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacquelyn A. Shelton, Abdul S. Sheikh, Pietro Berkes, Joerg Bornschein, Joerg Luecke</p><p>Abstract: An increasing number of experimental studies indicate that perception encodes a posterior probability distribution over possible causes of sensory stimuli, which is used to act close to optimally in the environment. One outstanding difﬁculty with this hypothesis is that the exact posterior will in general be too complex to be represented directly, and thus neurons will have to represent an approximation of this distribution. Two inﬂuential proposals of efﬁcient posterior representation by neural populations are: 1) neural activity represents samples of the underlying distribution, or 2) they represent a parametric representation of a variational approximation of the posterior. We show that these approaches can be combined for an inference scheme that retains the advantages of both: it is able to represent multiple modes and arbitrary correlations, a feature of sampling methods, and it reduces the represented space to regions of high probability mass, a strength of variational approximations. Neurally, the combined method can be interpreted as a feed-forward preselection of the relevant state space, followed by a neural dynamics implementation of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to approximate the posterior over the relevant states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efﬁciency of this approach on a sparse coding model. In numerical experiments on artiﬁcial data and image patches, we compare the performance of the algorithms to that of exact EM, variational state space selection alone, MCMC alone, and the combined select and sample approach. The select and sample approach integrates the advantages of the sampling and variational approximations, and forms a robust, neurally plausible, and very efﬁcient model of processing and learning in cortical networks. For sparse coding we show applications easily exceeding a thousand observed and a thousand hidden dimensions. 1</p><p>3 0.73565972 <a title="262-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Blake Shaw, Bert Huang, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world networks are described by both connectivity information and features for every node. To better model and understand these networks, we present structure preserving metric learning (SPML), an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric from a network such that the learned distances are tied to the inherent connectivity structure of the network. Like the graph embedding algorithm structure preserving embedding, SPML learns a metric which is structure preserving, meaning a connectivity algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors will yield the correct connectivity when applied using the distances from the learned metric. We show a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments where SPML predicts link patterns from node features more accurately than standard techniques. We further demonstrate a method for optimizing SPML based on stochastic gradient descent which removes the running-time dependency on the size of the network and allows the method to easily scale to networks of thousands of nodes and millions of edges. 1</p><p>4 0.71967244 <a title="262-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_to_Agglomerate_Superpixel_Hierarchies.html">155 nips-2011-Learning to Agglomerate Superpixel Hierarchies</a></p>
<p>Author: Viren Jain, Srinivas C. Turaga, K Briggman, Moritz N. Helmstaedter, Winfried Denk, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: An agglomerative clustering algorithm merges the most similar pair of clusters at every iteration. The function that evaluates similarity is traditionally handdesigned, but there has been recent interest in supervised or semisupervised settings in which ground-truth clustered data is available for training. Here we show how to train a similarity function by regarding it as the action-value function of a reinforcement learning problem. We apply this general method to segment images by clustering superpixels, an application that we call Learning to Agglomerate Superpixel Hierarchies (LASH). When applied to a challenging dataset of brain images from serial electron microscopy, LASH dramatically improved segmentation accuracy when clustering supervoxels generated by state of the boundary detection algorithms. The naive strategy of directly training only supervoxel similarities and applying single linkage clustering produced less improvement. 1</p><p>5 0.71616924 <a title="262-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Nearest_Neighbor_based_Greedy_Coordinate_Descent.html">182 nips-2011-Nearest Neighbor based Greedy Coordinate Descent</a></p>
<p>Author: Inderjit S. Dhillon, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Increasingly, optimization problems in machine learning, especially those arising from bigh-dimensional statistical estimation, bave a large number of variables. Modem statistical estimators developed over the past decade have statistical or sample complexity that depends only weakly on the number of parameters when there is some structore to the problem, such as sparsity. A central question is whether similar advances can be made in their computational complexity as well. In this paper, we propose strategies that indicate that such advances can indeed be made. In particular, we investigate the greedy coordinate descent algorithm, and note that performing the greedy step efficiently weakens the costly dependence on the problem size provided the solution is sparse. We then propose a snite of methods that perform these greedy steps efficiently by a reduction to nearest neighbor search. We also devise a more amenable form of greedy descent for composite non-smooth objectives; as well as several approximate variants of such greedy descent. We develop a practical implementation of our algorithm that combines greedy coordinate descent with locality sensitive hashing. Without tuning the latter data structore, we are not only able to significantly speed up the vanilla greedy method, hot also outperform cyclic descent when the problem size becomes large. Our resnlts indicate the effectiveness of our nearest neighbor strategies, and also point to many open questions regarding the development of computational geometric techniques tailored towards first-order optimization methods.</p><p>6 0.70406169 <a title="262-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Statistical_Tests_for_Optimization_Efficiency.html">271 nips-2011-Statistical Tests for Optimization Efficiency</a></p>

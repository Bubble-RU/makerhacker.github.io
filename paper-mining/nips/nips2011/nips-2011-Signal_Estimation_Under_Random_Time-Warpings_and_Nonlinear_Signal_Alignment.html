<p>Author: Kamiar R. Rad, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Many fundamental questions in theoretical neuroscience involve optimal decoding and the computation of Shannon information rates in populations of spiking neurons. In this paper, we apply methods from the asymptotic theory of statistical inference to obtain a clearer analytical understanding of these quantities. We ﬁnd that for large neural populations carrying a ﬁnite total amount of information, the full spiking population response is asymptotically as informative as a single observation from a Gaussian process whose mean and covariance can be characterized explicitly in terms of network and single neuron properties. The Gaussian form of this asymptotic sufﬁcient statistic allows us in certain cases to perform optimal Bayesian decoding by simple linear transformations, and to obtain closed-form expressions of the Shannon information carried by the network. One technical advantage of the theory is that it may be applied easily even to non-Poisson point process network models; for example, we ﬁnd that under some conditions, neural populations with strong history-dependent (non-Poisson) effects carry exactly the same information as do simpler equivalent populations of non-interacting Poisson neurons with matched ﬁring rates. We argue that our ﬁndings help to clarify some results from the recent literature on neural decoding and neuroprosthetic design.</p><p>3 0.089384951 <a title="253-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Learning_for_Recurrent_Spiking_Networks.html">302 nips-2011-Variational Learning for Recurrent Spiking Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Danilo J. Rezende, Daan Wierstra, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: We derive a plausible learning rule for feedforward, feedback and lateral connections in a recurrent network of spiking neurons. Operating in the context of a generative model for distributions of spike sequences, the learning mechanism is derived from variational inference principles. The synaptic plasticity rules found are interesting in that they are strongly reminiscent of experimental Spike Time Dependent Plasticity, and in that they differ for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A simulation conﬁrms the method’s applicability to learning both stationary and temporal spike patterns. 1</p><p>4 0.088733129 <a title="253-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Selective_Prediction_of_Financial_Trends_with_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">246 nips-2011-Selective Prediction of Financial Trends with Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Pidan, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: Focusing on short term trend prediction in a Ä?Ĺš nancial context, we consider the problem of selective prediction whereby the predictor can abstain from prediction in order to improve performance. We examine two types of selective mechanisms for HMM predictors. The Ä?Ĺš rst is a rejection in the spirit of ChowĂ˘&euro;&trade;s well-known ambiguity principle. The second is a specialized mechanism for HMMs that identiÄ?Ĺš es low quality HMM states and abstain from prediction in those states. We call this model selective HMM (sHMM). In both approaches we can trade-off prediction coverage to gain better accuracy in a controlled manner. We compare performance of the ambiguity-based rejection technique with that of the sHMM approach. Our results indicate that both methods are effective, and that the sHMM model is superior. 1</p><p>5 0.088310234 <a title="253-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Periodic_Finite_State_Controllers_for_Efficient_POMDP_and_DEC-POMDP_Planning.html">212 nips-2011-Periodic Finite State Controllers for Efficient POMDP and DEC-POMDP Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joni K. Pajarinen, Jaakko Peltonen</p><p>Abstract: Applications such as robot control and wireless communication require planning under uncertainty. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) plan policies for single agents under uncertainty and their decentralized versions (DEC-POMDPs) ﬁnd a policy for multiple agents. The policy in inﬁnite-horizon POMDP and DEC-POMDP problems has been represented as ﬁnite state controllers (FSCs). We introduce a novel class of periodic FSCs, composed of layers connected only to the previous and next layer. Our periodic FSC method ﬁnds a deterministic ﬁnite-horizon policy and converts it to an initial periodic inﬁnitehorizon policy. This policy is optimized by a new inﬁnite-horizon algorithm to yield deterministic periodic policies, and by a new expectation maximization algorithm to yield stochastic periodic policies. Our method yields better results than earlier planning methods and can compute larger solutions than with regular FSCs.</p><p>6 0.075496607 <a title="253-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Probabilistic_amplitude_and_frequency_demodulation.html">225 nips-2011-Probabilistic amplitude and frequency demodulation</a></p>

<p>Author: Gautam Kunapuli, Richard Maclin, Jude W. Shavlik</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge-based support vector machines (KBSVMs) incorporate advice from domain experts, which can improve generalization signiﬁcantly. A major limitation that has not been fully addressed occurs when the expert advice is imperfect, which can lead to poorer models. We propose a model that extends KBSVMs and is able to not only learn from data and advice, but also simultaneously improves the advice. The proposed approach is particularly effective for knowledge discovery in domains with few labeled examples. The proposed model contains bilinear constraints, and is solved using two iterative approaches: successive linear programming and a constrained concave-convex approach. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms yield useful reﬁnements to expert advice, as well as improve the performance of the learning algorithm overall.</p><p>3 0.43331099 <a title="253-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Non-conjugate_Variational_Message_Passing_for_Multinomial_and_Binary_Regression.html">188 nips-2011-Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing for Multinomial and Binary Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: David A. Knowles, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: Variational Message Passing (VMP) is an algorithmic implementation of the Variational Bayes (VB) method which applies only in the special case of conjugate exponential family models. We propose an extension to VMP, which we refer to as Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing (NCVMP) which aims to alleviate this restriction while maintaining modularity, allowing choice in how expectations are calculated, and integrating into an existing message-passing framework: Infer.NET. We demonstrate NCVMP on logistic binary and multinomial regression. In the multinomial case we introduce a novel variational bound for the softmax factor which is tighter than other commonly used bounds whilst maintaining computational tractability. 1</p><p>4 0.41963646 <a title="253-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Selective_Prediction_of_Financial_Trends_with_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">246 nips-2011-Selective Prediction of Financial Trends with Hidden Markov Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Lyu</p><p>Abstract: When used to learn high dimensional parametric probabilistic models, the classical maximum likelihood (ML) learning often suffers from computational intractability, which motivates the active developments of non-ML learning methods. Yet, because of their divergent motivations and forms, the objective functions of many non-ML learning methods are seemingly unrelated, and there lacks a uniﬁed framework to understand them. In this work, based on an information geometric view of parametric learning, we introduce a general non-ML learning principle termed as minimum KL contraction, where we seek optimal parameters that minimizes the contraction of the KL divergence between the two distributions after they are transformed with a KL contraction operator. We then show that the objective functions of several important or recently developed non-ML learning methods, including contrastive divergence [12], noise-contrastive estimation [11], partial likelihood [7], non-local contrastive objectives [31], score matching [14], pseudo-likelihood [3], maximum conditional likelihood [17], maximum mutual information [2], maximum marginal likelihood [9], and conditional and marginal composite likelihood [24], can be uniﬁed under the minimum KL contraction framework with different choices of the KL contraction operators. 1</p><p>6 0.40774989 <a title="253-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-A_blind_sparse_deconvolution_method_for_neural_spike_identification.html">13 nips-2011-A blind sparse deconvolution method for neural spike identification</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin B. Stemmler, Biswa Sengupta, Simon Laughlin, Jeremy Niven</p><p>Abstract: Most action potentials in the nervous system take on the form of strong, rapid, and brief voltage deﬂections known as spikes, in stark contrast to other action potentials, such as in the heart, that are characterized by broad voltage plateaus. We derive the shape of the neuronal action potential from ﬁrst principles, by postulating that action potential generation is strongly constrained by the brain’s need to minimize energy expenditure. For a given height of an action potential, the least energy is consumed when the underlying currents obey the bang-bang principle: the currents giving rise to the spike should be intense, yet short-lived, yielding spikes with sharp onsets and offsets. Energy optimality predicts features in the biophysics that are not per se required for producing the characteristic neuronal action potential: sodium currents should be extraordinarily powerful and inactivate with voltage; both potassium and sodium currents should have kinetics that have a bell-shaped voltage-dependence; and the cooperative action of multiple ‘gates’ should start the ﬂow of current. 1 The paradox Nerve cells communicate with each other over long distances using spike-like action potentials, which are brief electrical events traveling rapidly down axons and dendrites. Each action potential is caused by an accelerating inﬂux of sodium or calcium ions, depolarizing the cell membrane by forty millivolts or more, followed by repolarization of the cell membrane caused by an efﬂux of potassium ions. As different species of ions are swapped across the membrane during the action potential, ion pumps shuttle the excess ions back and restore the ionic concentration gradients. If we label each ionic species by α, the work ∆E done to restore the ionic concentration gradients is [α] ∆E = RT V ∆[α]in ln out , (1) [α]in α where R is the gas constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, V is the cell volume, [α]in|out is the concentration of ion α inside or outside the cell, and ∆[α]in is the concentration change inside the cell, which is assumed to be small relative to the total concentration. The sum α zα ∆[α] = 0, where zα is the charge on ion α, as no net charge accumulates during the action potential and no net work is done by or on the electric ﬁeld. Often, sodium (Na+ ) and potassium (K+ ) play the dominant role in generating action potentials, in which case ∆E = ∆[Na]in F V(ENa − EK ), where F is Faraday’s constant, ENa = RT /F ln [Na]out /[Na]in is the reversal potential for Na+ , at which no net sodium current ﬂows, and EK = RT /F ln [K]out /[K]in . This estimate of the work done does not include heat (due to loss through the membrane resistance) or the work done by the ion channel proteins in changing their conformational state during the action potential. Hence, the action potential’s energetic cost to the cell is directly proportional to ∆[Na]in ; taking into account that each Na+ ion carries one elementary charge, the cost is also proportional to the 1 charge QNa that accumulates inside the cell. A maximally efﬁcient cell reduces the charge per spike to a minimum. If a cell ﬁres action potentials at an average rate f , the cell’s Na/K pumps must move Na+ and K+ ions in opposite directions, against their respective concentration gradients, to counteract an average inward Na+ current of f QNa . Exhaustive measurements on myocytes in the heart, which expend tremendous amounts of energy to keep the heart beating, indicate that Na/K pumps expel ∼ 0.5 µA/cm2 of Na+ current at membrane potentials close to rest [1]. Most excitable cells, even when spiking, spend most of their time close to resting potential, and yet standard models for action potentials can easily lead to accumulating an ionic charge of up to 5 µC/cm2 [2]; most of this accumulation occurs during a very brief time interval. If one were to take an isopotential nerve cell with the same density of ion pumps as in the heart, then such a cell would not be able to produce more than an action potential once every ten seconds on average. The brain should be effectively silent. Clearly, this conﬂicts with what is known about the average ﬁring rates of neurons in the brainstem or even the neocortex, which can sustain spiking up to at least 7 Hz [3]. Part of the discrepancy can be resolved by noting that nerve cells are not isopotential and that action potential generation occurs within a highly restricted area of the membrane. Even so, standard models of action potential generation waste extraordinary amounts of energy; recent evidence [4] points out that many mammalian cortical neurons are much more efﬁcient. As nature places a premium on energy consumption, we will argue that one can predict both the shape of the action potential and the underlying biophysics of the nonlinear, voltage-dependent ionic conductances from the principle of minimal energy consumption. After reviewing the ionic basis of action potentials, we ﬁrst sketch how to compute the minimal energy cost for an arbitrary spike shape, and then solve for the optimal action potential shape with a given height. Finally, we show how minimal energy consumption explains all the dynamical features in the standard HodgkinHuxley (HH) model for neuronal dynamics that distinguish the brain’s action potentials from other highly nonlinear oscillations in physics and chemistry. 2 Ionic basis of the action potential In an excitable cell, synaptic drive forces the membrane permeability to different ions to change rapidly in time, producing the dynamics of the action potential. The current density Iα carried by an ion species α is given by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz (GHK) current equation[5, 6, 2], which assumes that ions are driven independently across the membrane under the inﬂuence of a constant electric ﬁeld. Iα depends upon the ions membrane permeability, Pα , its concentrations on either side of the membrane [α]out and [α]in and the voltage across the membrane, V , according to: Iα = Pα 2 zα V F 2 [α]out − [α]in exp (zα V F/RT ) , RT 1 − exp(zα V F/RT ) (2) To produce the fast currents that generate APs, a subset of the membranes ionic permeabilities Pα are gated by voltage. Changes in the permeability Pα are not instantaneous; the voltage-gated permeability is scaled mathematically by gating variables m(t) and h(t) with their own time dependence. After separating constant from time-dependent components in the permeability, the voltage-gated permeability obeys ¯ Pα (t) = m(t)r h(t)s such that 0 ≤ Pα (t) ≤ Pα , ¯ where r and s are positive, and Pα is the peak permeability to ion α when all channels for ion α are open. Gating is also referred to as activation, and the associated nonlinear permeabilities are called active. There are also passive, voltage-insensitive permeabilities that maintain the resting potential and depolarise the membrane to trigger action potentials. The simplest possible kinetics for the gating variables are ﬁrst order, involving only a single derivative in time. The steady state of each gating variable at a given voltage is determined by a Boltzmann function, to which the gating variables evolve: dm r ¯ τm = Pα m∞ (V ) − m(t) dt dh and τh =h∞ (V ) − h(t), dt 2 −1 with m∞ (V ) = {1 + exp ((V − Vm )/sm )} the Boltzmann function described by the slope sm > −1 0 and the midpoint Vm ; similarly, h∞ (V ) = {1 + exp ((V − Vh )/sh )} , but with sh < 0. Scaling ¯ m∞ (V ) by the rth root of the peak permeability Pα is a matter of mathematical convenience. We will consider both voltage-independent and voltage-dependent time constants, either setting τj = τj,0 to be constant, where j ∈ {m(t), h(t)}, or imposing a bell-shaped voltage dependence τj (V ) = τj,0 sech [sj (V − Vj )] The synaptic, leak, and voltage-dependent currents drive the rate of change in the voltage across the membrane dV C = Isyn + Ileak + Iα , dt α where the synaptic permeability and leak permeability are held constant. 3 Resistive and capacitive components of the energy cost By treating the action potential as the charging and discharging of the cell membrane capacitance, the action potentials measured at the mossy ﬁbre synapse in rats [4] or in mouse thalamocortical neurons [7] were found to be highly energy-efﬁcient: the nonlinear, active conductances inject only slightly more current than is needed to charge a capacitor to the peak voltage of the action potential. The implicit assumption made here is that one can neglect the passive loss of current through the membrane resistance, known as the leak. Any passive loss must be compensated by additional charge, making this loss the primary target of the selection pressure that has shaped the dynamics of action potentials. On the other hand, the membrane capacitance at the site of AP initiation is generally modelled and experimentally conﬁrmed [8] as being fairly constant around 1 µF/cm2 ; in contrast, the propagation, but not generation, of AP’s can be assisted by a reduction in the capacitance achieved by the myelin sheath that wraps some axons. As myelin would block the ﬂow of ions, we posit that the speciﬁc capacitance cannot yield to selection pressure to minimise the work W = QNa (ENa − EK ) needed for AP generation. To address how the shape and dynamics of action potentials might have evolved to consume less energy, we ﬁrst ﬁx the action potential’s shape and solve for the minimum charge QNa ab initio, without treating the cell membrane as a pure capacitor. Regardless of the action potential’s particular time-course V (t), voltage-dependent ionic conductances must transfer Na+ and K+ charge to elicit an action potential. Figure 1 shows a generic action potential and the associated ionic currents, comparing the latter to the minimal currents required. The passive equivalent circuit for the neuron consists of a resistor in parallel with a capacitor, driven by a synaptic current. To charge the membrane to the peak voltage, a neuron in a high-conductance state [9, 10] may well lose more charge through the resistor than is stored on the capacitor. For neurons in a low-conductance state and for rapid voltage deﬂections from the resting potential, membrane capacitance will be the primary determinant of the charge. 4 The norm of spikes How close can voltage-gated channels with realistic properties come to the minimal currents? What time-course for the action potential leads to the smallest minimal currents? To answer these questions, we must solve a constrained optimization problem on the solutions to the nonlinear differential equations for the neuronal dynamics. To separate action potentials from mere small-amplitude oscillations in the voltage, we need to introduce a metric. Smaller action potentials consume less energy, provided the underlying currents are optimal, yet signalling between neurons depends on the action potential’s voltage deﬂection reaching a minimum amplitude. Given the importance of the action potential’s amplitude, we deﬁne an Lp norm on the voltage wave-form V (t) to emphasize the maximal voltage deﬂection: 1 p T V (t) − V p V (t) − V = 0 3 p dt , Generic Action Potential -10 + a V [mV] -20 -30 gsyn -40 -50 -60 0 2 4 6 8 t [ms] 10 12 14 16 gNa Active and Minimal Currents 100 gK + gleak C + + 80 2 current [µA/cm ] 60 b Active IK Minimum IK 40 20 0 -20 For a ﬁxed action potential waveform V (t): Active INa Minimum INa -40 -60 Minimum INa (t) = −LV (t)θ(LV (t)) Minimum IK (t) = −LV (t)θ(−LV (t)) -80 -100 0 2 4 6 8 10 t [ms] 12 14 ˙ with LV (t) ≡ C V (t) + Ileak [V (t)] + Isyn [V (t)]. 16 c Qresistive/Qcapacitive Resistive vs. Capacitive Minimum Charge 1 0.5 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 1.2 leak conductance [mS/cm2] 1.4 Figure 1: To generate an action potential with an arbitrary time-course V (t), the nonlinear, timedependent permeabilities must deliver more charge than just to load the membrane capacitance— resistive losses must be compensated. (a) The action potential’s time-course in a generic HH model for a neuron, represented by the circuit diagram on the right. The peak of the action potential is ∼ 50 mV above the average potential. (b) The inward Na+ current, shown in green going in the negative direction, rapidly depolarizes the potential V (t) and yields the upstroke of the action potential. Concurrently, the K+ current activates, displayed as a positive deﬂection, and leads to the downstroke in the potential V (t). Inward and outward currents overlap signiﬁcantly in time. The dotted lines within the region bounded by the solid lines represent the minimal Na+ current and the minimal K+ current needed to produce the V (t) spike waveform in (a). By the law of current conservation, the sum of capacitive, resistive, and synaptic currents, denoted by ˙ LV (t) ≡ C V (t) + Ileak [V (t)] + Isyn [V (t)], must be balanced by the active currents. If the cell’s passive properties, namely its capacitance and (leak) resistance, and the synaptic conductance are constant, we can deduce the minimal active currents needed to generate a speciﬁed V (t). The minimal currents, by deﬁnition, do not overlap in time. Taking into account passive current ﬂow, restoring the concentration gradients after the action potential requires 29 nJ/cm2 . By contrast, if the active currents were optimal, the cost would be 8.9 nJ/cm2 . (c) To depolarize from the minimum to the maximum of the AP, the synaptic voltage-gated currents must deliver a charge Qcapacitive to charge the membrane capacitance and a charge Qresistive to compensate for the loss of current through leak channels. For a large leak conductance in the cell membrane, Qresistive can be larger than Qcapacitive . 4 where V is the average voltage. In the limit as p → ∞, the norm simply becomes the difference between the action potential’s peak voltage and the mean voltage, whereas a ﬁnite p ensures that the norm is differentiable. In parameter space, we will focus our attention to the manifold of action potentials with constant Lp norm with 2 p < ∞, which entails that the optimal action potential will have a ﬁnite, though possibly narrow width. To be close to the supremum norm, yet still have a norm that is well-behaved under differentiation, we decided to use p = 16. 5 Poincar´ -Lindstedt perturbation of periodic dynamical orbits e Standard (secular) perturbation theory diverges for periodic orbits, so we apply the PoincarLindstedt technique of expanding both in the period and the dynamics of the asymptotic orbit and then derive a set of adjoint sensitivity equations for the differential-algebraic system. Solving once for the adjoint functions, we can easily compute the parameter gradient of any functional on the orbit, even for thousands of parameters. ˙ We start with a set of ordinary differential equations x = F(x; p) for the neuron’s dynamics, an asymptotically periodic orbit xγ (t) that describes the action potential, and a functional G(x; p) on the orbit, representing the energy consumption, for instance. The functional can be written as an integral ω(p)−1 G(xγ ; p) = g(xγ (t); p) dt, 0 over some source term g(xγ (t); p). Assume that locally perturbing a parameter p ∈ p induces a smooth change in the stable limit cycle, preserving its existence. Generally, a perturbation changes not only the limit cycle’s path in state space, but also the average speed with which this orbit is traversed; as a consequence, the value of the functional depends on this change in speed, to lowest order. For simplicity, consider a single, scalar parameter p. G(xγ ; p) is the solution to ω(p)∂τ [G(xγ ; p)] = g(xγ ; p), where we have normalised time via τ = ω(p)t. Denoting partial derivatives by subscripts, we expand p → p + to get the O 1 equation dτ [Gp (xγ ; p)] + ωp g(xγ ; p) = gx (xγ ; p)xp + gp (xγ ; p) in a procedure known as the Poincar´ -Lindstedt method. Hence, e dG = dp ω −1 (gp + gx xp − ωp g) dt, 0 where, once again by the Poincar´ -Lindstedt method, xp is the solution to e ˙ xp =Fx (xγ )xp + Fp (xγ ) − ωp F (xγ ) . Following the approach described by Cao, Li, Petzold, and Serban (2003), introduce a Lagrange vector AG (x) and consider the augmented objective function ω −1 I(xγ ; p) = G(xγ ; p) − ˙ AG (xγ ). (F(xγ ) − xγ ) dt, 0 γ ˙ which is identical to G(x ; p) as F(x) − x = 0. Then dI(xγ ; p) = dp ω −1 ω −1 ˙ AG . (Fp + Fx xp − ωp F − xp ) dt.

We can let the second term vanish by making the vector AG (x) obey ˙ AG (x) = −FT (x; p) AG (x) + gx (x; p). x Label the homogeneous solution (obtained by setting gx (xγ ; p) = 0) as Z(x). It is known that ω −1 the term ωp is given by ωp = ω 0 Z(x).Fp (x) dt, provided Z(x) is normalised to satisfy Z(x).F(x) = 1. We can add any multiple of the homogeneous solution Z(x) to the inhomogeneous solution, so we can always make ω −1 AG (x).F(x) dt = G 0 by taking ω −1 G G AG (x).F(x) dt − ωG . A (x) → A (x) − Z(x) (3) 0 This condition will make AG (x) unique. Finally, with eq. (3) we get dI(xγ ; p) dG(xγ ; p) = = dp dp ω −1 gp − AG . Fp dt. 0 The ﬁrst term in the integral gives rise to the partial derivative ∂G(xγ ; p)/ ∂p. In many cases, this term is either zero, can be made zero, or at least made independent of the dynamical variables. The parameters for the neuron models are listed in Table 1 together with their minimum and maximum allowed values. For each parameter in the neuron model, an auxiliary parameter on the entire real line is introduced, and a mapping from the real line onto the ﬁnite range set by the biophysical limits is deﬁned. Gradient descent on this auxiliary parameter space is performed by orthogonalizing the gradient dQα /dp to the gradient dL/dp of the norm. To correct for drift off the constraint manifold of constant norm, illustrated in Fig. 3, steps of gradient ascent or descent on the Lp norm are performed while keeping Qα constant. The step size during gradient descent is adjusted to assure that ∆Qα < 0 and that a periodic solution xγ exists after adapting the parameters. The energy landscape is locally convex (Fig. 3). 6 Predicting the Hodgkin-Huxley model We start with a single-compartment Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz model neuron containing voltage-gated Na+ and leak conductances (Figure 1). A tonic synaptic input to the model evokes repetitive ﬁring of action potentials. We seek those parameters that minimize the ionic load for an action potential of constant norm—in other words, spikes whose height relative to the average voltage is fairly constant, subject to a trade-off with the spike width. The ionic load is directly proportional to the work W performed by the ion ﬂux. All parameters governing the ion channels’ voltage dependence and kinetics, including their time constants, mid-points, slopes, and peak values, are subject to change. The simplest model capable of generating an action potential must have two dynamical variables and two time scales: one for the upstroke and another for the downstroke.

During optimization, the spikes were constrained to have constant norm V (t) − V 16 = 92 mV, which controls the height of the spike. Insets in the left column display the voltage-dependence of the optimized time constants for sodium inactivation and potassium activation; sodium activation is modeled as occurring instantaneously. (a) Model with voltage-dependent inactivation of Na+ ; time constants for the ﬁrst order permeability kinetics are voltage-independent (inset). Inactivation turns off the Na+ current on the downstroke, but not completely: as the K+ current activates to repolarize the membrane, the inward Na+ current reactivates and counteracts the K+ current; the peak of the resurgent Na+ current is marked by a triangle. (b) Model with voltage-dependent time constants for the ﬁrst order kinetics of activation and inactivation. The voltage dependence minimizes the resurgence of the Na+ current. (c) Power-law gating model with an inwardly rectifying potassium current replacing the leak current. The power law dependence introduces an effective delay in the onset of the K+ current, which further minimizes the overlap of Na+ and K+ currents in time. 7 Energy per Spike Surface of Constant Norm Spikes ya 10 16 V [mV] K 18 10 12 14 14 16 T b V [mV] 0 t [ms] 2 10 18 16 12 s [mV] K V [mV] K T a V [mV] 12 nJ/cm2 ≥ 16.5 16.3 16.3 yc 16 sK [mV] 100 0 -2 16.4 T c 100 0 -2 V [mV] 14 14 VE [nJ/cm2] yc ya τK [ms] yb 12 16.5 yb 20 0 t [ms] 2 100 0 -2 0 t [ms] 2 Figure 3: The energy required for an action potential three parameters governing potassium activation: the midpoint voltage VK , the slope sK , and the (maximum) time constant τK .

Note that the energy within the constrained manifold of constant norm spikes is locally convex. are persistent, current ﬂows in opposite directions at the same time, so that, even at the optimum, the ionic load is 1200 nC/cm2 . On the other hand, no voltage-gated K+ channels are even required for a spike, as long as Na+ channels activate on a fast time scale and inactivate on a slower time scale and the leak is powerful enough to repolarize the neuron. Even so, the load is still 520 nC/cm2 . While spikes require dynamics on two time scales, suppressing the overlap between inward and outward currents calls for a third time scale. The resulting dynamics are higher-dimensional and reduce the load to to 239 nC/cm2 . Making the activation and inactivation time constants voltage-dependent permits ion channels to latch to an open or closed state during the rising and falling phase of the spike, reducing the ionic load to 189 nC/cm2 (Fig. 2) . The minimal Na+ and K+ currents are separated in time, yet dynamics that are linear in the activation variables cannot enforce a true delay between the offset of the Na+ current and the onset of the K+ current. If current ﬂow depends on multiple gates that need to be activated simultaneously, optimization can use the nonlinearity of multiplication to introduce a delay in the rise of the K+ current that abolishes the overlap, and the ionic load drops to 156 nC/cm2 . Any number of kinetic schemes for the nonlinear permeabilities Pα can give rise to the same spike waveform V (t), including the simplest two-dimensional one. Yet only the full Hodgkin-Huxley (HH) model, with its voltage-dependent kinetics that prevent the premature resurgence of inward current and cooperative gating that delays the onset of the outward current, minimizes the energetic cost. More complex models, in which voltage-dependent ion channels make transitions between multiple closed, inactivated, and open states, instantiate the energy-conserving features of the HH system at the molecular level. Furthermore, features that are eliminated during optimization, such as a voltage-dependent inactivation of the outward potassium current, are also not part of the delayed rectiﬁer potassium current in the Hodgkin-Huxley framework. 8 References [1] Paul De Weer, David C.

<p>Author: David Newman, Edwin V. Bonilla, Wray Buntine</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents. When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reﬂect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data. 1</p><p>3 0.68311167 <a title="253-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Neuronal_Adaptation_for_Sampling-Based_Probabilistic_Inference_in_Perceptual_Bistability.html">184 nips-2011-Neuronal Adaptation for Sampling-Based Probabilistic Inference in Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: David P. Reichert, Peggy Series, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: It has been argued that perceptual multistability reﬂects probabilistic inference performed by the brain when sensory input is ambiguous. Alternatively, more traditional explanations of multistability refer to low-level mechanisms such as neuronal adaptation. We employ a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM) model of cortical processing to demonstrate that these two different approaches can be combined in the same framework. Based on recent developments in machine learning, we show how neuronal adaptation can be understood as a mechanism that improves probabilistic, sampling-based inference. Using the ambiguous Necker cube image, we analyze the perceptual switching exhibited by the model. We also examine the inﬂuence of spatial attention, and explore how binocular rivalry can be modeled with the same approach. Our work joins earlier studies in demonstrating how the principles underlying DBMs relate to cortical processing, and offers novel perspectives on the neural implementation of approximate probabilistic inference in the brain. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.66463888 <a title="253-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Signal_Estimation_Under_Random_Time-Warpings_and_Nonlinear_Signal_Alignment.html">253 nips-2011-Signal Estimation Under Random Time-Warpings and Nonlinear Signal Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian A. Kurtek, Anuj Srivastava, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: While signal estimation under random amplitudes, phase shifts, and additive noise is studied frequently, the problem of estimating a deterministic signal under random time-warpings has been relatively unexplored. We present a novel framework for estimating the unknown signal that utilizes the action of the warping group to form an equivalence relation between signals. First, we derive an estimator for the equivalence class of the unknown signal using the notion of Karcher mean on the quotient space of equivalence classes. This step requires the use of Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric and a square-root representation of signals to enable computations of distances and means under this metric. Then, we deﬁne a notion of the center of a class and show that the center of the estimated class is a consistent estimator of the underlying unknown signal. This estimation algorithm has many applications: (1) registration/alignment of functional data, (2) separation of phase/amplitude components of functional data, (3) joint demodulation and carrier estimation, and (4) sparse modeling of functional data. Here we demonstrate only (1) and (2): Given signals are temporally aligned using nonlinear warpings and, thus, separated into their phase and amplitude components. The proposed method for signal alignment is shown to have state of the art performance using Berkeley growth, handwritten signatures, and neuroscience spike train data. 1</p><p>5 0.61080265 <a title="253-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Anatomically_Constrained_Decoding_of_Finger_Flexion_from_Electrocorticographic_Signals.html">38 nips-2011-Anatomically Constrained Decoding of Finger Flexion from Electrocorticographic Signals</a></p>
<p>Author: Zuoguan Wang, Gerwin Schalk, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use brain signals to convey a user’s intent. Some BCI approaches begin by decoding kinematic parameters of movements from brain signals, and then proceed to using these signals, in absence of movements, to allow a user to control an output. Recent results have shown that electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from the surface of the brain in humans can give information about kinematic parameters (e.g., hand velocity or ﬁnger ﬂexion). The decoding approaches in these demonstrations usually employed classical classiﬁcation/regression algorithms that derive a linear mapping between brain signals and outputs. However, they typically only incorporate little prior information about the target kinematic parameter. In this paper, we show that different types of anatomical constraints that govern ﬁnger ﬂexion can be exploited in this context. Speciﬁcally, we incorporate these constraints in the construction, structure, and the probabilistic functions of a switched non-parametric dynamic system (SNDS) model. We then apply the resulting SNDS decoder to infer the ﬂexion of individual ﬁngers from the same ECoG dataset used in a recent study. Our results show that the application of the proposed model, which incorporates anatomical constraints, improves decoding performance compared to the results in the previous work. Thus, the results presented in this paper may ultimately lead to neurally controlled hand prostheses with full ﬁne-grained ﬁnger articulation. 1</p><p>6 0.60989708 <a title="253-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Structural_equations_and_divisive_normalization_for_energy-dependent_component_analysis.html">273 nips-2011-Structural equations and divisive normalization for energy-dependent component analysis</a></p>

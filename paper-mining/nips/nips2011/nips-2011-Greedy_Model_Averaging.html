<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Peter Auer, John S. Shawe-taylor, Ronald Ortner, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We derive an instantaneous (per-round) data-dependent regret bound for stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (also known as contextual bandits). The p scaling of our regret bound with the number of states (contexts) N goes as N I⇢t (S; A), where I⇢t (S; A) is the mutual information between states and actions (the side information) used by the algorithm at round t. If the algorithm p uses all the side information, the regret bound scales as N ln K, where K is the number of actions (arms). However, if the side information I⇢t (S; A) is not fully used, the regret bound is signiﬁcantly tighter. In the extreme case, when I⇢t (S; A) = 0, the dependence on the number of states reduces from linear to logarithmic. Our analysis allows to provide the algorithm large amount of side information, let the algorithm to decide which side information is relevant for the task, and penalize the algorithm only for the side information that it is using de facto. We also present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits with side information with O(K) computational complexity per game round. 1</p><p>3 0.13200542 <a title="109-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Adaptive_Hedge.html">25 nips-2011-Adaptive Hedge</a></p>
<p>Author: Tim V. Erven, Wouter M. Koolen, Steven D. Rooij, Peter Grünwald</p><p>Abstract: Most methods for decision-theoretic online learning are based on the Hedge algorithm, which takes a parameter called the learning rate. In most previous analyses the learning rate was carefully tuned to obtain optimal worst-case performance, leading to suboptimal performance on easy instances, for example when there exists an action that is signiﬁcantly better than all others. We propose a new way of setting the learning rate, which adapts to the difﬁculty of the learning problem: in the worst case our procedure still guarantees optimal performance, but on easy instances it achieves much smaller regret. In particular, our adaptive method achieves constant regret in a probabilistic setting, when there exists an action that on average obtains strictly smaller loss than all other actions. We also provide a simulation study comparing our approach to existing methods. 1</p><p>4 0.1120127 <a title="109-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Speedy_Q-Learning.html">268 nips-2011-Speedy Q-Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Hilbert J. Kappen, Mohammad G. Azar, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new convergent variant of Q-learning, called speedy Q-learning (SQL), to address the problem of slow convergence in the standard form of the Q-learning algorithm. We prove a PAC bound on the performance of SQL, which shows that for an MDP with n state-action pairs and the discount factor γ only T = O log(n)/(ǫ2 (1 − γ)4 ) steps are required for the SQL algorithm to converge to an ǫ-optimal action-value function with high probability. This bound has a better dependency on 1/ǫ and 1/(1 − γ), and thus, is tighter than the best available result for Q-learning. Our bound is also superior to the existing results for both modelfree and model-based instances of batch Q-value iteration that are considered to be more efﬁcient than the incremental methods like Q-learning. 1</p><p>5 0.11129346 <a title="109-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-k-NN_Regression_Adapts_to_Local_Intrinsic_Dimension.html">305 nips-2011-k-NN Regression Adapts to Local Intrinsic Dimension</a></p>
<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe</p><p>Abstract: Many nonparametric regressors were recently shown to converge at rates that depend only on the intrinsic dimension of data. These regressors thus escape the curse of dimension when high-dimensional data has low intrinsic dimension (e.g. a manifold). We show that k-NN regression is also adaptive to intrinsic dimension. In particular our rates are local to a query x and depend only on the way masses of balls centered at x vary with radius. Furthermore, we show a simple way to choose k = k(x) locally at any x so as to nearly achieve the minimax rate at x in terms of the unknown intrinsic dimension in the vicinity of x. We also establish that the minimax rate does not depend on a particular choice of metric space or distribution, but rather that this minimax rate holds for any metric space and doubling measure. 1</p><p>6 0.11100821 <a title="109-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Practical_Variational_Inference_for_Neural_Networks.html">217 nips-2011-Practical Variational Inference for Neural Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Keshet, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider latent structural versions of probit loss and ramp loss. We show that these surrogate loss functions are consistent in the strong sense that for any feature map (ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional) they yield predictors approaching the inﬁmum task loss achievable by any linear predictor over the given features. We also give ﬁnite sample generalization bounds (convergence rates) for these loss functions. These bounds suggest that probit loss converges more rapidly. However, ramp loss is more easily optimized on a given sample. 1</p><p>4 0.58428222 <a title="109-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian_Analysis_of_Contextual_Bandits.html">210 nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Contextual Bandits</a></p>

<p>Author: Maxim Raginsky, Alexander Rakhlin</p><p>Abstract: We develop uniﬁed information-theoretic machinery for deriving lower bounds for passive and active learning schemes. Our bounds involve the so-called Alexander’s capacity function. The supremum of this function has been recently rediscovered by Hanneke in the context of active learning under the name of “disagreement coefﬁcient.” For passive learning, our lower bounds match the upper bounds of Gin´ and Koltchinskii up to constants and generalize analogous results of Mase sart and N´ d´ lec. For active learning, we provide ﬁrst known lower bounds based e e on the capacity function rather than the disagreement coefﬁcient. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78099525 <a title="109-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Greedy_Model_Averaging.html">109 nips-2011-Greedy Model Averaging</a></p>

<p>Author: Neville Mehta, Prasad Tadepalli, Alan Fern</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces two new frameworks for learning action models for planning. In the mistake-bounded planning framework, the learner has access to a planner for the given model representation, a simulator, and a planning problem generator, and aims to learn a model with at most a polynomial number of faulty plans. In the planned exploration framework, the learner does not have access to a problem generator and must instead design its own problems, plan for them, and converge with at most a polynomial number of planning attempts. The paper reduces learning in these frameworks to concept learning with one-sided error and provides algorithms for successful learning in both frameworks. A speciﬁc family of hypothesis spaces is shown to be efﬁciently learnable in both the frameworks. 1</p><p>4 0.71506441 <a title="109-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>5 0.71475077 <a title="109-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Agnostic_Selective_Classification.html">28 nips-2011-Agnostic Selective Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Yair Wiener, Ran El-Yaniv</p><p>Abstract: For a learning problem whose associated excess loss class is (β, B)-Bernstein, we show that it is theoretically possible to track the same classiﬁcation performance of the best (unknown) hypothesis in our class, provided that we are free to abstain from prediction in some region of our choice. The (probabilistic) volume of this √ rejected region of the domain is shown to be diminishing at rate O(Bθ( 1/m)β ), where θ is Hanneke’s disagreement coefﬁcient. The strategy achieving this performance has computational barriers because it requires empirical error minimization in an agnostic setting. Nevertheless, we heuristically approximate this strategy and develop a novel selective classiﬁcation algorithm using constrained SVMs. We show empirically that the resulting algorithm consistently outperforms the traditional rejection mechanism based on distance from decision boundary. 1</p><p>6 0.71323663 <a title="109-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-PiCoDes%3A_Learning_a_Compact_Code_for_Novel-Category_Recognition.html">214 nips-2011-PiCoDes: Learning a Compact Code for Novel-Category Recognition</a></p>

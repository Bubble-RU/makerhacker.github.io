One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset – performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then ﬁltering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results.

<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>4 0.12063314 <a title="166-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Filtering.html">180 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>5 0.11797262 <a title="166-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_person-object_interactions_for_action_recognition_in_still_images.html">154 nips-2011-Learning person-object interactions for action recognition in still images</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Delaitre, Josef Sivic, Ivan Laptev</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a discriminatively trained model of person-object interactions for recognizing common human actions in still images. We build on the locally order-less spatial pyramid bag-of-features model, which was shown to perform extremely well on a range of object, scene and human action recognition tasks. We introduce three principal contributions. First, we replace the standard quantized local HOG/SIFT features with stronger discriminatively trained body part and object detectors. Second, we introduce new person-object interaction features based on spatial co-occurrences of individual body parts and objects. Third, we address the combinatorial problem of a large number of possible interaction pairs and propose a discriminative selection procedure using a linear support vector machine (SVM) with a sparsity inducing regularizer. Learning of action-speciﬁc body part and object interactions bypasses the difﬁcult problem of estimating the complete human body pose conﬁguration. Beneﬁts of the proposed model are shown on human action recognition in consumer photographs, outperforming the strong bag-of-features baseline. 1</p><p>6 0.10829776 <a title="166-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Why_The_Brain_Separates_Face_Recognition_From_Object_Recognition.html">304 nips-2011-Why The Brain Separates Face Recognition From Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Carsten Rother, Martin Kiefel, Lumin Zhang, Bernhard Schölkopf, Peter V. Gehler</p><p>Abstract: We address the challenging task of decoupling material properties from lighting properties given a single image. In the last two decades virtually all works have concentrated on exploiting edge information to address this problem. We take a different route by introducing a new prior on reﬂectance, that models reﬂectance values as being drawn from a sparse set of basis colors. This results in a Random Field model with global, latent variables (basis colors) and pixel-accurate output reﬂectance values. We show that without edge information high-quality results can be achieved, that are on par with methods exploiting this source of information. Finally, we are able to improve on state-of-the-art results by integrating edge information into our model. We believe that our new approach is an excellent starting point for future developments in this ﬁeld. 1</p><p>4 0.58356315 <a title="166-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>

<p>Author: Iasonas Kokkinos</p><p>Abstract: In this work we use Branch-and-Bound (BB) to efﬁciently detect objects with deformable part models. Instead of evaluating the classiﬁer score exhaustively over image locations and scales, we use BB to focus on promising image locations. The core problem is to compute bounds that accommodate part deformations; for this we adapt the Dual Trees data structure [7] to our problem. We evaluate our approach using Mixture-of-Deformable Part Models [4]. We obtain exactly the same results but are 10-20 times faster on average. We also develop a multiple-object detection variation of the system, where hypotheses for 20 categories are inserted in a common priority queue. For the problem of ﬁnding the strongest category in an image this results in a 100-fold speedup.</p><p>6 0.54876798 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Gert R. Lanckriet, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: The goal of this paper is to investigate the advantages and disadvantages of learning in Banach spaces over Hilbert spaces. While many works have been carried out in generalizing Hilbert methods to Banach spaces, in this paper, we consider the simple problem of learning a Parzen window classiﬁer in a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS)—which is closely related to the notion of embedding probability measures into an RKBS—in order to carefully understand its pros and cons over the Hilbert space classiﬁer. We show that while this generalization yields richer distance measures on probabilities compared to its Hilbert space counterpart, it however suffers from serious computational drawback limiting its practical applicability, which therefore demonstrates the need for developing efﬁcient learning algorithms in Banach spaces.</p><p>2 0.76632494 <a title="166-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-A_Collaborative_Mechanism_for_Crowdsourcing_Prediction_Problems.html">3 nips-2011-A Collaborative Mechanism for Crowdsourcing Prediction Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob D. Abernethy, Rafael M. Frongillo</p><p>Abstract: Machine Learning competitions such as the Netﬂix Prize have proven reasonably successful as a method of “crowdsourcing” prediction tasks. But these competitions have a number of weaknesses, particularly in the incentive structure they create for the participants. We propose a new approach, called a Crowdsourced Learning Mechanism, in which participants collaboratively “learn” a hypothesis for a given prediction task. The approach draws heavily from the concept of a prediction market, where traders bet on the likelihood of a future event. In our framework, the mechanism continues to publish the current hypothesis, and participants can modify this hypothesis by wagering on an update. The critical incentive property is that a participant will proﬁt an amount that scales according to how much her update improves performance on a released test set. 1</p><p>3 0.76140851 <a title="166-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Periodic_Finite_State_Controllers_for_Efficient_POMDP_and_DEC-POMDP_Planning.html">212 nips-2011-Periodic Finite State Controllers for Efficient POMDP and DEC-POMDP Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joni K. Pajarinen, Jaakko Peltonen</p><p>Abstract: Applications such as robot control and wireless communication require planning under uncertainty. Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) plan policies for single agents under uncertainty and their decentralized versions (DEC-POMDPs) ﬁnd a policy for multiple agents. The policy in inﬁnite-horizon POMDP and DEC-POMDP problems has been represented as ﬁnite state controllers (FSCs). We introduce a novel class of periodic FSCs, composed of layers connected only to the previous and next layer. Our periodic FSC method ﬁnds a deterministic ﬁnite-horizon policy and converts it to an initial periodic inﬁnitehorizon policy. This policy is optimized by a new inﬁnite-horizon algorithm to yield deterministic periodic policies, and by a new expectation maximization algorithm to yield stochastic periodic policies. Our method yields better results than earlier planning methods and can compute larger solutions than with regular FSCs.</p><p>4 0.75319982 <a title="166-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Optimal_learning_rates_for_least_squares_SVMs_using_Gaussian_kernels.html">207 nips-2011-Optimal learning rates for least squares SVMs using Gaussian kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Mona Eberts, Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: We prove a new oracle inequality for support vector machines with Gaussian RBF kernels solving the regularized least squares regression problem. To this end, we apply the modulus of smoothness. With the help of the new oracle inequality we then derive learning rates that can also be achieved by a simple data-dependent parameter selection method. Finally, it turns out that our learning rates are asymptotically optimal for regression functions satisfying certain standard smoothness conditions. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.74253821 <a title="166-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Maximal_Cliques_that_Satisfy_Hard_Constraints_with_Application_to_Deformable_Object_Model_Learning.html">166 nips-2011-Maximal Cliques that Satisfy Hard Constraints with Application to Deformable Object Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinggang Wang, Xiang Bai, Xingwei Yang, Wenyu Liu, Longin J. Latecki</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel inference framework for ﬁnding maximal cliques in a weighted graph that satisfy hard constraints. The constraints specify the graph nodes that must belong to the solution as well as mutual exclusions of graph nodes, i.e., sets of nodes that cannot belong to the same solution. The proposed inference is based on a novel particle ﬁlter algorithm with state permeations. We apply the inference framework to a challenging problem of learning part-based, deformable object models. Two core problems in the learning framework, matching of image patches and ﬁnding salient parts, are formulated as two instances of the problem of ﬁnding maximal cliques with hard constraints. Our learning framework yields discriminative part based object models that achieve very good detection rate, and outperform other methods on object classes with large deformation. 1</p><p>6 0.65593725 <a title="166-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Similarity-based_Learning_via_Data_Driven_Embeddings.html">254 nips-2011-Similarity-based Learning via Data Driven Embeddings</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexandra Carpentier, Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering the parameter α ∈ RK of a sparse function f (i.e. the number of non-zero entries of α is small compared to the number K of features) given noisy evaluations of f at a set of well-chosen sampling points. We introduce an additional randomization process, called Brownian sensing, based on the computation of stochastic integrals, which produces a Gaussian sensing matrix, for which good recovery properties are proven, independently on the number of sampling points N , even when the features are arbitrarily non-orthogonal. Under the assumption that f is H¨ lder continuous with exponent at least √ we proo 1/2, vide an estimate α of the parameter such that �α − α�2 = O(�η�2 / N ), where � � η is the observation noise. The method uses a set of sampling points uniformly distributed along a one-dimensional curve selected according to the features. We report numerical experiments illustrating our method. 1</p><p>3 0.11770729 <a title="257-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>4 0.10600232 <a title="257-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Universal_low-rank_matrix_recovery_from_Pauli_measurements.html">297 nips-2011-Universal low-rank matrix recovery from Pauli measurements</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi-kai Liu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of reconstructing an unknown matrix M of rank r and dimension d using O(rd poly log d) Pauli measurements. This has applications in quantum state tomography, and is a non-commutative analogue of a well-known problem in compressed sensing: recovering a sparse vector from a few of its Fourier coefﬁcients. We show that almost all sets of O(rd log6 d) Pauli measurements satisfy the rankr restricted isometry property (RIP). This implies that M can be recovered from a ﬁxed (“universal”) set of Pauli measurements, using nuclear-norm minimization (e.g., the matrix Lasso), with nearly-optimal bounds on the error. A similar result holds for any class of measurements that use an orthonormal operator basis whose elements have small operator norm. Our proof uses Dudley’s inequality for Gaussian processes, together with bounds on covering numbers obtained via entropy duality. 1</p><p>5 0.10510033 <a title="257-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-On_the_accuracy_of_l1-filtering_of_signals_with_block-sparse_structure.html">203 nips-2011-On the accuracy of l1-filtering of signals with block-sparse structure</a></p>

<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey, Michael I. Jordan, Ameet Talwalkar</p><p>Abstract: This work introduces Divide-Factor-Combine (DFC), a parallel divide-andconquer framework for noisy matrix factorization. DFC divides a large-scale matrix factorization task into smaller subproblems, solves each subproblem in parallel using an arbitrary base matrix factorization algorithm, and combines the subproblem solutions using techniques from randomized matrix approximation. Our experiments with collaborative ﬁltering, video background modeling, and simulated data demonstrate the near-linear to super-linear speed-ups attainable with this approach. Moreover, our analysis shows that DFC enjoys high-probability recovery guarantees comparable to those of its base algorithm.</p><p>5 0.7258637 <a title="257-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_with_Replacement.html">209 nips-2011-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement</a></p>
<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Ambuj Tewari, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of compressed sensing where the goal is to recover all sparse vectors using a small number offixed linear measurements. For this problem, we propose a novel partial hard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding algorithms like ITI and HTP[17, 10], the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm that we call Orthogonal Matching Pursnit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residnal. However, unlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple change allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse recovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance guarantees under RIP. Given its simple structore, we are able to extend OMPR using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hasb, the first provably sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursnit. We provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for vectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrste that for large-scale problems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than existing methods.</p><p>6 0.7160936 <a title="257-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Universal_low-rank_matrix_recovery_from_Pauli_measurements.html">297 nips-2011-Universal low-rank matrix recovery from Pauli measurements</a></p>

<p>Author: Emin Orhan, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: Extensive evidence suggests that items are not encoded independently in visual short-term memory (VSTM). However, previous research has not quantitatively considered how the encoding of an item inﬂuences the encoding of other items. Here, we model the dependencies among VSTM representations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a stimulus-dependent mean and covariance matrix. We report the results of an experiment designed to determine the speciﬁc form of the stimulus-dependence of the mean and the covariance matrix. We ﬁnd that the magnitude of the covariance between the representations of two items is a monotonically decreasing function of the difference between the items’ feature values, similar to a Gaussian process with a distance-dependent, stationary kernel function. We further show that this type of covariance function can be explained as a natural consequence of encoding multiple stimuli in a population of neurons with correlated responses. 1</p><p>2 0.85198736 <a title="257-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-A_More_Powerful_Two-Sample_Test_in_High_Dimensions_using_Random_Projection.html">9 nips-2011-A More Powerful Two-Sample Test in High Dimensions using Random Projection</a></p>
<p>Author: Miles Lopes, Laurent Jacob, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis testing problem of detecting a shift between the means of two multivariate normal distributions in the high-dimensional setting, allowing for the data dimension p to exceed the sample size n. Our contribution is a new test statistic for the two-sample test of means that integrates a random projection with the classical Hotelling T 2 statistic. Working within a high-dimensional framework that allows (p, n) → ∞, we ﬁrst derive an asymptotic power function for our test, and then provide sufﬁcient conditions for it to achieve greater power than other state-of-the-art tests. Using ROC curves generated from simulated data, we demonstrate superior performance against competing tests in the parameter regimes anticipated by our theoretical results. Lastly, we illustrate an advantage of our procedure with comparisons on a high-dimensional gene expression dataset involving the discrimination of different types of cancer. 1</p><p>3 0.83907509 <a title="257-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>

The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of target present vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the ﬁring pattern of V1/V2 neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integrating information over time is shown to be a ‘soft max’ of diffusions, computed over the visual ﬁeld by ‘hypercolumns’ of neurons that share the same receptive ﬁeld and have different response properties to image features. An approximation of the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather than diffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar predictions to the optimal observer in common psychophysics conditions. A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate between which mechanism is used in the human brain. A B C Figure 1: Visual search. (A) Clutter and camouﬂage make visual search difﬁcult.

<p>Author: Andrew E. Waters, Aswin C. Sankaranarayanan, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering a matrix M that is the sum of a low-rank matrix L and a sparse matrix S from a small set of linear measurements of the form y = A(M) = A(L + S). This model subsumes three important classes of signal recovery problems: compressive sensing, afﬁne rank minimization, and robust principal component analysis. We propose a natural optimization problem for signal recovery under this model and develop a new greedy algorithm called SpaRCS to solve it. Empirically, SpaRCS inherits a number of desirable properties from the state-of-the-art CoSaMP and ADMiRA algorithms, including exponential convergence and efﬁcient implementation. Simulation results with video compressive sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and robust matrix completion data sets demonstrate both the accuracy and efﬁcacy of the algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.82125801 <a title="257-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Advice_Refinement_in_Knowledge-Based_SVMs.html">27 nips-2011-Advice Refinement in Knowledge-Based SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Gautam Kunapuli, Richard Maclin, Jude W. Shavlik</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge-based support vector machines (KBSVMs) incorporate advice from domain experts, which can improve generalization signiﬁcantly. A major limitation that has not been fully addressed occurs when the expert advice is imperfect, which can lead to poorer models. We propose a model that extends KBSVMs and is able to not only learn from data and advice, but also simultaneously improves the advice. The proposed approach is particularly effective for knowledge discovery in domains with few labeled examples. The proposed model contains bilinear constraints, and is solved using two iterative approaches: successive linear programming and a constrained concave-convex approach. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms yield useful reﬁnements to expert advice, as well as improve the performance of the learning algorithm overall.</p><p>6 0.6778301 <a title="257-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-A_Convergence_Analysis_of_Log-Linear_Training.html">4 nips-2011-A Convergence Analysis of Log-Linear Training</a></p>

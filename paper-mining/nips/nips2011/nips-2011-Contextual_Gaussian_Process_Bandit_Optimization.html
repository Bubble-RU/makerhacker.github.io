<p>Author: Michael Kapralov, Rina Panigrahy</p><p>Abstract: Consider a sequence of bits where we are trying to predict the next bit from the previous bits. Assume we are allowed to say ‘predict 0’ or ‘predict 1’, and our payoff is +1 if the prediction is correct and −1 otherwise. We will say that at each point in time the loss of an algorithm is the number of wrong predictions minus the number of right predictions so far. In this paper we are interested in algorithms that have essentially zero (expected) loss over any string at any point in time and yet have small regret with respect to always predicting 0 or always predicting 1. For a sequence of length T our algorithm has regret 14 T and loss √ 2 2 T e− T in expectation for all strings. We show that the tradeoff between loss and regret is optimal up to constant factors. Our techniques extend to the general setting of N experts, where the related problem of trading off regret to the best expert for regret to the ’special’ expert has been studied by Even-Dar et al. (COLT’07). We obtain essentially zero loss with respect to the special expert and optimal loss/regret tradeoff, improving upon the results of Even-Dar et al and settling the main question left open in their paper. The strong loss bounds of the algorithm have some surprising consequences. First, we obtain a parameter free algorithm for the experts problem that has optimal regret bounds with respect to k-shifting optima, i.e. bounds with respect to the optimum that is allowed to change arms multiple times. Moreover, for any window of size n the regret of our algorithm to any expert never exceeds O( n(log N + log T )), where N is the number of experts and T is the time horizon, while maintaining the essentially zero loss property. 1</p><p>3 0.27420992 <a title="61-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Improved_Algorithms_for_Linear_Stochastic_Bandits.html">128 nips-2011-Improved Algorithms for Linear Stochastic Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Yasin Abbasi-yadkori, Csaba Szepesvári, David Tax</p><p>Abstract: We improve the theoretical analysis and empirical performance of algorithms for the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem and the linear stochastic multi-armed bandit problem. In particular, we show that a simple modiﬁcation of Auer’s UCB algorithm (Auer, 2002) achieves with high probability constant regret. More importantly, we modify and, consequently, improve the analysis of the algorithm for the for linear stochastic bandit problem studied by Auer (2002), Dani et al. (2008), Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis (2010), Li et al. (2010). Our modiﬁcation improves the regret bound by a logarithmic factor, though experiments show a vast improvement. In both cases, the improvement stems from the construction of smaller conﬁdence sets. For their construction we use a novel tail inequality for vector-valued martingales. 1</p><p>4 0.22145709 <a title="61-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian_Analysis_of_Contextual_Bandits.html">210 nips-2011-PAC-Bayesian Analysis of Contextual Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Yevgeny Seldin, Peter Auer, John S. Shawe-taylor, Ronald Ortner, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We derive an instantaneous (per-round) data-dependent regret bound for stochastic multiarmed bandits with side information (also known as contextual bandits). The p scaling of our regret bound with the number of states (contexts) N goes as N I⇢t (S; A), where I⇢t (S; A) is the mutual information between states and actions (the side information) used by the algorithm at round t. If the algorithm p uses all the side information, the regret bound scales as N ln K, where K is the number of actions (arms). However, if the side information I⇢t (S; A) is not fully used, the regret bound is signiﬁcantly tighter. In the extreme case, when I⇢t (S; A) = 0, the dependence on the number of states reduces from linear to logarithmic. Our analysis allows to provide the algorithm large amount of side information, let the algorithm to decide which side information is relevant for the task, and penalize the algorithm only for the side information that it is using de facto. We also present an algorithm for multiarmed bandits with side information with O(K) computational complexity per game round. 1</p><p>5 0.21897569 <a title="61-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Additive_Gaussian_Processes.html">26 nips-2011-Additive Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: David K. Duvenaud, Hannes Nickisch, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a Gaussian process model of functions which are additive. An additive function is one which decomposes into a sum of low-dimensional functions, each depending on only a subset of the input variables. Additive GPs generalize both Generalized Additive Models, and the standard GP models which use squared-exponential kernels. Hyperparameter learning in this model can be seen as Bayesian Hierarchical Kernel Learning (HKL). We introduce an expressive but tractable parameterization of the kernel function, which allows efﬁcient evaluation of all input interaction terms, whose number is exponential in the input dimension. The additional structure discoverable by this model results in increased interpretability, as well as state-of-the-art predictive power in regression tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.18681684 <a title="61-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_the_State-Representation_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">245 nips-2011-Selecting the State-Representation in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

We present here some empirical results using Thompson sampling on simulated and real data, and show that it is highly competitive. And since this heuristic is very easy to implement, we argue that it should be part of the standard baselines to compare against. 1</p><p>4 0.61036813 <a title="61-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Additive_Gaussian_Processes.html">26 nips-2011-Additive Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Chen, David E. Carlson, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian methods are developed for analysis of multi-channel spike-train data, with the feature learning and spike sorting performed jointly. The feature learning and sorting are performed simultaneously across all channels. Dictionary learning is implemented via the beta-Bernoulli process, with spike sorting performed via the dynamic hierarchical Dirichlet process (dHDP), with these two models coupled. The dHDP is augmented to eliminate refractoryperiod violations, it allows the “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons over time, and it models smooth variation in the spike statistics. 1</p><p>2 0.99290073 <a title="61-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Image_Parsing_with_Stochastic_Scene_Grammar.html">127 nips-2011-Image Parsing with Stochastic Scene Grammar</a></p>
<p>Author: Yibiao Zhao, Song-chun Zhu</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a parsing algorithm for scene understanding which includes four aspects: computing 3D scene layout, detecting 3D objects (e.g. furniture), detecting 2D faces (windows, doors etc.), and segmenting background. In contrast to previous scene labeling work that applied discriminative classiﬁers to pixels (or super-pixels), we use a generative Stochastic Scene Grammar (SSG). This grammar represents the compositional structures of visual entities from scene categories, 3D foreground/background, 2D faces, to 1D lines. The grammar includes three types of production rules and two types of contextual relations. Production rules: (i) AND rules represent the decomposition of an entity into sub-parts; (ii) OR rules represent the switching among sub-types of an entity; (iii) SET rules represent an ensemble of visual entities. Contextual relations: (i) Cooperative “+” relations represent positive links between binding entities, such as hinged faces of a object or aligned boxes; (ii) Competitive “-” relations represents negative links between competing entities, such as mutually exclusive boxes. We design an efﬁcient MCMC inference algorithm, namely Hierarchical cluster sampling, to search in the large solution space of scene conﬁgurations. The algorithm has two stages: (i) Clustering: It forms all possible higher-level structures (clusters) from lower-level entities by production rules and contextual relations. (ii) Sampling: It jumps between alternative structures (clusters) in each layer of the hierarchy to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration (represented by a parse tree). In our experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our algorithm over existing methods on public dataset. In addition, our approach achieves richer structures in the parse tree. 1</p><p>3 0.99268937 <a title="61-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Active_Learning_with_a_Drifting_Distribution.html">21 nips-2011-Active Learning with a Drifting Distribution</a></p>

We further prove minimax lower bounds for this problem. 1</p><p>4 0.99098325 <a title="61-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_Receptive_Fields_in_Deep_Networks.html">244 nips-2011-Selecting Receptive Fields in Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Coates, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recent deep learning and unsupervised feature learning systems that learn from unlabeled data have achieved high performance in benchmarks by using extremely large architectures with many features (hidden units) at each layer. Unfortunately, for such large architectures the number of parameters can grow quadratically in the width of the network, thus necessitating hand-coded “local receptive ﬁelds” that limit the number of connections from lower level features to higher ones (e.g., based on spatial locality). In this paper we propose a fast method to choose these connections that may be incorporated into a wide variety of unsupervised training methods. Speciﬁcally, we choose local receptive ﬁelds that group together those low-level features that are most similar to each other according to a pairwise similarity metric. This approach allows us to harness the advantages of local receptive ﬁelds (such as improved scalability, and reduced data requirements) when we do not know how to specify such receptive ﬁelds by hand or where our unsupervised training algorithm has no obvious generalization to a topographic setting. We produce results showing how this method allows us to use even simple unsupervised training algorithms to train successful multi-layered networks that achieve state-of-the-art results on CIFAR and STL datasets: 82.0% and 60.1% accuracy, respectively. 1</p><p>5 0.99068016 <a title="61-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">53 nips-2011-Co-Training for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Minmin Chen, Kilian Q. Weinberger, John Blitzer</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain. In many practical cases, the source and target distributions can differ substantially, and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding to the training set both the target features and instances in which the current algorithm is the most conﬁdent. Our algorithm is a variant of co-training [7], and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation). Unlike the original co-training work, we do not assume a particular feature split. Instead, for each iteration of cotraining, we formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor, a split of the feature space into views, and a subset of source and target features to include in the predictor. CODA signiﬁcantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al. [4]. Indeed, over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision CODA achieves the best performance. 1</p><p>6 0.98567361 <a title="61-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Generalized_Beta_Mixtures_of_Gaussians.html">104 nips-2011-Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians</a></p>

<p>Author: Bo Chen, David E. Carlson, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian methods are developed for analysis of multi-channel spike-train data, with the feature learning and spike sorting performed jointly. The feature learning and sorting are performed simultaneously across all channels. Dictionary learning is implemented via the beta-Bernoulli process, with spike sorting performed via the dynamic hierarchical Dirichlet process (dHDP), with these two models coupled. The dHDP is augmented to eliminate refractoryperiod violations, it allows the “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons over time, and it models smooth variation in the spike statistics. 1</p><p>3 0.079592623 <a title="269-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Bayesian_Multi-Task_Learning.html">258 nips-2011-Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shengbo Guo, Onno Zoeter, Cédric Archambeau</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new sparse Bayesian model for multi-task regression and classiﬁcation. The model is able to capture correlations between tasks, or more speciﬁcally a low-rank approximation of the covariance matrix, while being sparse in the features. We introduce a general family of group sparsity inducing priors based on matrix-variate Gaussian scale mixtures. We show the amount of sparsity can be learnt from the data by combining an approximate inference approach with type II maximum likelihood estimation of the hyperparameters. Empirical evaluations on data sets from biology and vision demonstrate the applicability of the model, where on both regression and classiﬁcation tasks it achieves competitive predictive performance compared to previously proposed methods. 1</p><p>4 0.072422244 <a title="269-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-A_blind_sparse_deconvolution_method_for_neural_spike_identification.html">13 nips-2011-A blind sparse deconvolution method for neural spike identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Chaitanya Ekanadham, Daniel Tranchina, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating neural spikes from extracellular voltage recordings. Most current methods are based on clustering, which requires substantial human supervision and systematically mishandles temporally overlapping spikes. We formulate the problem as one of statistical inference, in which the recorded voltage is a noisy sum of the spike trains of each neuron convolved with its associated spike waveform. Joint maximum-a-posteriori (MAP) estimation of the waveforms and spikes is then a blind deconvolution problem in which the coefﬁcients are sparse. We develop a block-coordinate descent procedure to approximate the MAP solution, based on our recently developed continuous basis pursuit method. We validate our method on simulated data as well as real data for which ground truth is available via simultaneous intracellular recordings. In both cases, our method substantially reduces the number of missed spikes and false positives when compared to a standard clustering algorithm, primarily by recovering overlapping spikes. The method offers a fully automated alternative to clustering methods that is less susceptible to systematic errors. 1</p><p>5 0.063543223 <a title="269-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Learning_for_Recurrent_Spiking_Networks.html">302 nips-2011-Variational Learning for Recurrent Spiking Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Danilo J. Rezende, Daan Wierstra, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: We derive a plausible learning rule for feedforward, feedback and lateral connections in a recurrent network of spiking neurons. Operating in the context of a generative model for distributions of spike sequences, the learning mechanism is derived from variational inference principles. The synaptic plasticity rules found are interesting in that they are strongly reminiscent of experimental Spike Time Dependent Plasticity, and in that they differ for excitatory and inhibitory neurons. A simulation conﬁrms the method’s applicability to learning both stationary and temporal spike patterns. 1</p><p>6 0.060755506 <a title="269-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Lu Ren, Yingjian Wang, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A new L´ vy process prior is proposed for an uncountable collection of covariatee dependent feature-learning measures; the model is called the kernel beta process (KBP). Available covariates are handled efﬁciently via the kernel construction, with covariates assumed observed with each data sample (“customer”), and latent covariates learned for each feature (“dish”). Each customer selects dishes from an inﬁnite buffet, in a manner analogous to the beta process, with the added constraint that a customer ﬁrst decides probabilistically whether to “consider” a dish, based on the distance in covariate space between the customer and dish. If a customer does consider a particular dish, that dish is then selected probabilistically as in the beta process. The beta process is recovered as a limiting case of the KBP. An efﬁcient Gibbs sampler is developed for computations, and state-of-the-art results are presented for image processing and music analysis tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.62180966 <a title="269-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-On_the_Analysis_of_Multi-Channel_Neural_Spike_Data.html">200 nips-2011-On the Analysis of Multi-Channel Neural Spike Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Artin Armagan, Merlise Clyde, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, a rich variety of shrinkage priors have been proposed that have great promise in addressing massive regression problems. In general, these new priors can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals, but have more complex forms and better properties than traditional Cauchy and double exponential priors. We ﬁrst propose a new class of normal scale mixtures through a novel generalized beta distribution that encompasses many interesting priors as special cases. This encompassing framework should prove useful in comparing competing priors, considering properties and revealing close connections. We then develop a class of variational Bayes approximations through the new hierarchy presented that will scale more efﬁciently to the types of truly massive data sets that are now encountered routinely. 1</p><p>6 0.60034388 <a title="269-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Nonnegative_dictionary_learning_in_the_exponential_noise_model_for_adaptive_music_signal_representation.html">191 nips-2011-Nonnegative dictionary learning in the exponential noise model for adaptive music signal representation</a></p>

<p>Author: Balazs B. Ujfalussy, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Computational analyses of dendritic computations often assume stationary inputs to neurons, ignoring the pulsatile nature of spike-based communication between neurons and the moment-to-moment ﬂuctuations caused by such spiking inputs. Conversely, circuit computations with spiking neurons are usually formalized without regard to the rich nonlinear nature of dendritic processing. Here we address the computational challenge faced by neurons that compute and represent analogue quantities but communicate with digital spikes, and show that reliable computation of even purely linear functions of inputs can require the interplay of strongly nonlinear subunits within the postsynaptic dendritic tree. Our theory predicts a matching of dendritic nonlinearities and synaptic weight distributions to the joint statistics of presynaptic inputs. This approach suggests normative roles for some puzzling forms of nonlinear dendritic dynamics and plasticity. 1</p><p>3 0.67882693 <a title="269-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-How_biased_are_maximum_entropy_models%3F.html">123 nips-2011-How biased are maximum entropy models?</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob H. Macke, Iain Murray, Peter E. Latham</p><p>Abstract: Maximum entropy models have become popular statistical models in neuroscience and other areas in biology, and can be useful tools for obtaining estimates of mutual information in biological systems. However, maximum entropy models ﬁt to small data sets can be subject to sampling bias; i.e. the true entropy of the data can be severely underestimated. Here we study the sampling properties of estimates of the entropy obtained from maximum entropy models. We show that if the data is generated by a distribution that lies in the model class, the bias is equal to the number of parameters divided by twice the number of observations. However, in practice, the true distribution is usually outside the model class, and we show here that this misspeciﬁcation can lead to much larger bias. We provide a perturbative approximation of the maximally expected bias when the true model is out of model class, and we illustrate our results using numerical simulations of an Ising model; i.e. the second-order maximum entropy distribution on binary data. 1</p><p>4 0.62583619 <a title="269-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Spatial_distance_dependent_Chinese_restaurant_processes_for_image_segmentation.html">266 nips-2011-Spatial distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes for image segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Soumya Ghosh, Andrei B. Ungureanu, Erik B. Sudderth, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: The distance dependent Chinese restaurant process (ddCRP) was recently introduced to accommodate random partitions of non-exchangeable data [1]. The ddCRP clusters data in a biased way: each data point is more likely to be clustered with other data that are near it in an external sense. This paper examines the ddCRP in a spatial setting with the goal of natural image segmentation. We explore the biases of the spatial ddCRP model and propose a novel hierarchical extension better suited for producing “human-like” segmentations. We then study the sensitivity of the models to various distance and appearance hyperparameters, and provide the ﬁrst rigorous comparison of nonparametric Bayesian models in the image segmentation domain. On unsupervised image segmentation, we demonstrate that similar performance to existing nonparametric Bayesian models is possible with substantially simpler models and algorithms.</p><p>5 0.6086278 <a title="269-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>6 0.58374476 <a title="269-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Bayesian_Multi-Task_Learning.html">258 nips-2011-Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Shulin Yang, Ali Rahimi</p><p>Abstract: We describe a family of global optimization procedures that automatically decompose optimization problems into smaller loosely coupled problems. The solutions of these are subsequently combined with message passing algorithms. We show empirically that these methods produce better solutions with fewer function evaluations than existing global optimization methods. To develop these methods, we introduce a notion of coupling between variables of optimization. This notion of coupling generalizes the notion of independence between random variables in statistics, sparseness of the Hessian in nonlinear optimization, and the generalized distributive law. Despite its generality, this notion of coupling is easier to verify empirically, making structure estimation easy, while allowing us to migrate well-established inference methods on graphical models to the setting of global optimization. 1</p><p>3 0.075422123 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Generalized_Beta_Mixtures_of_Gaussians.html">104 nips-2011-Generalized Beta Mixtures of Gaussians</a></p>
<p>Author: Artin Armagan, Merlise Clyde, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, a rich variety of shrinkage priors have been proposed that have great promise in addressing massive regression problems. In general, these new priors can be expressed as scale mixtures of normals, but have more complex forms and better properties than traditional Cauchy and double exponential priors. We ﬁrst propose a new class of normal scale mixtures through a novel generalized beta distribution that encompasses many interesting priors as special cases. This encompassing framework should prove useful in comparing competing priors, considering properties and revealing close connections. We then develop a class of variational Bayes approximations through the new hierarchy presented that will scale more efﬁciently to the types of truly massive data sets that are now encountered routinely. 1</p><p>4 0.069855347 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Maximal_Cliques_that_Satisfy_Hard_Constraints_with_Application_to_Deformable_Object_Model_Learning.html">166 nips-2011-Maximal Cliques that Satisfy Hard Constraints with Application to Deformable Object Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinggang Wang, Xiang Bai, Xingwei Yang, Wenyu Liu, Longin J. Latecki</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel inference framework for ﬁnding maximal cliques in a weighted graph that satisfy hard constraints. The constraints specify the graph nodes that must belong to the solution as well as mutual exclusions of graph nodes, i.e., sets of nodes that cannot belong to the same solution. The proposed inference is based on a novel particle ﬁlter algorithm with state permeations. We apply the inference framework to a challenging problem of learning part-based, deformable object models. Two core problems in the learning framework, matching of image patches and ﬁnding salient parts, are formulated as two instances of the problem of ﬁnding maximal cliques with hard constraints. Our learning framework yields discriminative part based object models that achieve very good detection rate, and outperform other methods on object classes with large deformation. 1</p><p>5 0.069403119 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Accelerated_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_for_Partition_Function_Computation.html">17 nips-2011-Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation</a></p>

<p>Author: David Wingate, Noah Goodman, Andreas Stuhlmueller, Jeffrey M. Siskind</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic programming languages allow modelers to specify a stochastic process using syntax that resembles modern programming languages. Because the program is in machine-readable format, a variety of techniques from compiler design and program analysis can be used to examine the structure of the distribution represented by the probabilistic program. We show how nonstandard interpretations of probabilistic programs can be used to craft efﬁcient inference algorithms: information about the structure of a distribution (such as gradients or dependencies) is generated as a monad-like side computation while executing the program. These interpretations can be easily coded using special-purpose objects and operator overloading. We implement two examples of nonstandard interpretations in two different languages, and use them as building blocks to construct inference algorithms: automatic differentiation, which enables gradient based methods, and provenance tracking, which enables efﬁcient construction of global proposals. 1</p><p>3 0.67632616 <a title="55-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Accelerated_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_for_Partition_Function_Computation.html">17 nips-2011-Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yichuan Zhang, Charles A. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: The performance of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods is often sensitive to the scaling and correlations between the random variables of interest. An important source of information about the local correlation and scale is given by the Hessian matrix of the target distribution, but this is often either computationally expensive or infeasible. In this paper we propose MCMC samplers that make use of quasiNewton approximations, which approximate the Hessian of the target distribution from previous samples and gradients generated by the sampler. A key issue is that MCMC samplers that depend on the history of previous states are in general not valid. We address this problem by using limited memory quasi-Newton methods, which depend only on a ﬁxed window of previous samples. On several real world datasets, we show that the quasi-Newton sampler is more effective than standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo at a fraction of the cost of MCMC methods that require higher-order derivatives. 1</p><p>5 0.55907458 <a title="55-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Simultaneous_Sampling_and_Multi-Structure_Fitting_with_Adaptive_Reversible_Jump_MCMC.html">255 nips-2011-Simultaneous Sampling and Multi-Structure Fitting with Adaptive Reversible Jump MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Trung T. Pham, Tat-jun Chin, Jin Yu, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: Multi-structure model ﬁtting has traditionally taken a two-stage approach: First, sample a (large) number of model hypotheses, then select the subset of hypotheses that optimise a joint ﬁtting and model selection criterion. This disjoint two-stage approach is arguably suboptimal and inefﬁcient — if the random sampling did not retrieve a good set of hypotheses, the optimised outcome will not represent a good ﬁt. To overcome this weakness we propose a new multi-structure ﬁtting approach based on Reversible Jump MCMC. Instrumental in raising the effectiveness of our method is an adaptive hypothesis generator, whose proposal distribution is learned incrementally and online. We prove that this adaptive proposal satisﬁes the diminishing adaptation property crucial for ensuring ergodicity in MCMC. Our method effectively conducts hypothesis sampling and optimisation simultaneously, and yields superior computational efﬁciency over previous two-stage methods. 1</p><p>6 0.55878907 <a title="55-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Priors_over_Recurrent_Continuous_Time_Processes.html">221 nips-2011-Priors over Recurrent Continuous Time Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Maneesh Bhand, Ritvik Mudur, Bipin Suresh, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: The efﬁcient coding hypothesis holds that neural receptive ﬁelds are adapted to the statistics of the environment, but is agnostic to the timescale of this adaptation, which occurs on both evolutionary and developmental timescales. In this work we focus on that component of adaptation which occurs during an organism’s lifetime, and show that a number of unsupervised feature learning algorithms can account for features of normal receptive ﬁeld properties across multiple primary sensory cortices. Furthermore, we show that the same algorithms account for altered receptive ﬁeld properties in response to experimentally altered environmental statistics. Based on these modeling results we propose these models as phenomenological models of receptive ﬁeld plasticity during an organism’s lifetime. Finally, due to the success of the same models in multiple sensory areas, we suggest that these algorithms may provide a constructive realization of the theory, ﬁrst proposed by Mountcastle [1], that a qualitatively similar learning algorithm acts throughout primary sensory cortices. 1</p><p>3 0.59179485 <a title="55-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Uniqueness_of_Belief_Propagation_on_Signed_Graphs.html">296 nips-2011-Uniqueness of Belief Propagation on Signed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: While loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) has been utilized in a wide variety of applications with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, if the interactions of random variables in a graphical model are strong, the behaviors of the algorithm can be difﬁcult to analyze due to underlying phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the uniqueness problem of the LBP ﬁxed point; our new “necessary and sufﬁcient” condition is stated in terms of graphs and signs, where the sign denotes the types (attractive/repulsive) of the interaction (i.e., compatibility function) on the edge. In all previous works, uniqueness is guaranteed only in the situations where the strength of the interactions are “sufﬁciently” small in certain senses. In contrast, our condition covers arbitrary strong interactions on the speciﬁed class of signed graphs. The result of this paper is based on the recent theoretical advance in the LBP algorithm; the connection with the graph zeta function.</p><p>4 0.59068114 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image segmentation since for binary random ﬁeld representations of the image, it gives globally optimal results and there are efﬁcient polynomial time implementations. Often, the random ﬁeld is applied over a ﬂat partitioning of the image into non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show that if, instead of a ﬂat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding beneﬁts of global optimality and efﬁciency). As a result of such inference, the image gets partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the tree. We apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference on a segmentation tree (over a ﬂat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization in the pylon model is able to ﬂexibly choose the level of segmentation across the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.58660328 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Rapid_Deformable_Object_Detection_using_Dual-Tree_Branch-and-Bound.html">233 nips-2011-Rapid Deformable Object Detection using Dual-Tree Branch-and-Bound</a></p>
<p>Author: Iasonas Kokkinos</p><p>Abstract: In this work we use Branch-and-Bound (BB) to efﬁciently detect objects with deformable part models. Instead of evaluating the classiﬁer score exhaustively over image locations and scales, we use BB to focus on promising image locations. The core problem is to compute bounds that accommodate part deformations; for this we adapt the Dual Trees data structure [7] to our problem. We evaluate our approach using Mixture-of-Deformable Part Models [4]. We obtain exactly the same results but are 10-20 times faster on average. We also develop a multiple-object detection variation of the system, where hypotheses for 20 categories are inserted in a common priority queue. For the problem of ﬁnding the strongest category in an image this results in a 100-fold speedup.</p><p>6 0.58646894 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>

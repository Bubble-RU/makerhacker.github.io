<p>Author: Ping Li, Anshumali Shrivastava, Joshua L. Moore, Arnd C. König</p><p>Abstract: Minwise hashing is a standard technique in the context of search for efﬁciently computing set similarities. The recent development of b-bit minwise hashing provides a substantial improvement by storing only the lowest b bits of each hashed value. In this paper, we demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing can be naturally integrated with linear learning algorithms such as linear SVM and logistic regression, to solve large-scale and high-dimensional statistical learning tasks, especially when the data do not ﬁt in memory. We compare b-bit minwise hashing with the Count-Min (CM) and Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithms, which have essentially the same variances as random projections. Our theoretical and empirical comparisons illustrate that b-bit minwise hashing is signiﬁcantly more accurate (at the same storage cost) than VW (and random projections) for binary data.</p><p>3 0.20458873 <a title="157-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Exploiting_spatial_overlap_to_efficiently_compute_appearance_distances_between_image_windows.html">91 nips-2011-Exploiting spatial overlap to efficiently compute appearance distances between image windows</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Viviana Petrescu, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a computationally efﬁcient technique to compute the distance of highdimensional appearance descriptor vectors between image windows. The method exploits the relation between appearance distance and spatial overlap. We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efﬁciently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as ﬁnding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or ﬁnding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18] and on hashing [21]. For example, our algorithm ﬁnds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average. 1</p><p>4 0.16554064 <a title="157-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Randomized_Algorithms_for_Comparison-based_Search.html">231 nips-2011-Randomized Algorithms for Comparison-based Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Dominique Tschopp, Suhas Diggavi, Payam Delgosha, Soheil Mohajer</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ﬁnding the nearest neighbor (or one of the R-nearest neighbors) of a query object q in a database of n objects, when we can only use a comparison oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query object. The main problem we study is how to search the database for the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the questions. The difﬁculty of this problem depends on properties of the underlying database. We show the importance of a characterization: combinatorial disorder D which deﬁnes approximate triangle n inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound of Ω(D log D + D2 ) average number of questions in the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates the fundamental role of D for worst case behavior. We develop 3 a randomized scheme for NN retrieval in O(D3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) 3 questions. The learning requires asking O(nD3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) questions and O(n log2 n/ log(2D)) bits to store.</p><p>5 0.15397464 <a title="157-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-PiCoDes%3A_Learning_a_Compact_Code_for_Novel-Category_Recognition.html">214 nips-2011-PiCoDes: Learning a Compact Code for Novel-Category Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Bergamo, Lorenzo Torresani, Andrew W. Fitzgibbon</p><p>Abstract: We introduce P I C O D ES: a very compact image descriptor which nevertheless allows high performance on object category recognition. In particular, we address novel-category recognition: the task of deﬁning indexing structures and image representations which enable a large collection of images to be searched for an object category that was not known when the index was built. Instead, the training images deﬁning the category are supplied at query time. We explicitly learn descriptors of a given length (from as small as 16 bytes per image) which have good object-recognition performance. In contrast to previous work in the domain of object recognition, we do not choose an arbitrary intermediate representation, but explicitly learn short codes. In contrast to previous approaches to learn compact codes, we optimize explicitly for (an upper bound on) classiﬁcation performance. Optimization directly for binary features is difﬁcult and nonconvex, but we present an alternation scheme and convex upper bound which demonstrate excellent performance in practice. P I C O D ES of 256 bytes match the accuracy of the current best known classiﬁer for the Caltech256 benchmark, but they decrease the database storage size by a factor of 100 and speed-up the training and testing of novel classes by orders of magnitude.</p><p>6 0.13143504 <a title="157-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Orthogonal_Matching_Pursuit_with_Replacement.html">209 nips-2011-Orthogonal Matching Pursuit with Replacement</a></p>

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Ambuj Tewari, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of compressed sensing where the goal is to recover all sparse vectors using a small number offixed linear measurements. For this problem, we propose a novel partial hard-thresholding operator that leads to a general family of iterative algorithms. While one extreme of the family yields well known hard thresholding algorithms like ITI and HTP[17, 10], the other end of the spectrum leads to a novel algorithm that we call Orthogonal Matching Pursnit with Replacement (OMPR). OMPR, like the classic greedy algorithm OMP, adds exactly one coordinate to the support at each iteration, based on the correlation with the current residnal. However, unlike OMP, OMPR also removes one coordinate from the support. This simple change allows us to prove that OMPR has the best known guarantees for sparse recovery in terms of the Restricted Isometry Property (a condition on the measurement matrix). In contrast, OMP is known to have very weak performance guarantees under RIP. Given its simple structore, we are able to extend OMPR using locality sensitive hashing to get OMPR-Hasb, the first provably sub-linear (in dimensionality) algorithm for sparse recovery. Our proof techniques are novel and flexible enough to also permit the tightest known analysis of popular iterative algorithms such as CoSaMP and Subspace Pursnit. We provide experimental results on large problems providing recovery for vectors of size up to million dimensions. We demonstrste that for large-scale problems our proposed methods are more robust and faster than existing methods.</p><p>6 0.45506161 <a title="157-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Randomized_Algorithms_for_Comparison-based_Search.html">231 nips-2011-Randomized Algorithms for Comparison-based Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhen Li, Huazhong Ning, Liangliang Cao, Tong Zhang, Yihong Gong, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications, specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efﬁciency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees, k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems, those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efﬁciency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efﬁciency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efﬁcient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Speciﬁcally, we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efﬁciently converted into an inverted indexing data structure, which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efﬁciency. Experimental results show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing), as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).</p><p>2 0.7850039 <a title="157-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Uniqueness_of_Belief_Propagation_on_Signed_Graphs.html">296 nips-2011-Uniqueness of Belief Propagation on Signed Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: While loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) has been utilized in a wide variety of applications with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, if the interactions of random variables in a graphical model are strong, the behaviors of the algorithm can be difﬁcult to analyze due to underlying phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the uniqueness problem of the LBP ﬁxed point; our new “necessary and sufﬁcient” condition is stated in terms of graphs and signs, where the sign denotes the types (attractive/repulsive) of the interaction (i.e., compatibility function) on the edge. In all previous works, uniqueness is guaranteed only in the situations where the strength of the interactions are “sufﬁciently” small in certain senses. In contrast, our condition covers arbitrary strong interactions on the speciﬁed class of signed graphs. The result of this paper is based on the recent theoretical advance in the LBP algorithm; the connection with the graph zeta function.</p><p>3 0.78157461 <a title="157-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Manifold_Clustering_and_Embedding.html">263 nips-2011-Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehsan Elhamifar, René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose an algorithm called Sparse Manifold Clustering and Embedding (SMCE) for simultaneous clustering and dimensionality reduction of data lying in multiple nonlinear manifolds. Similar to most dimensionality reduction methods, SMCE ﬁnds a small neighborhood around each data point and connects each point to its neighbors with appropriate weights. The key difference is that SMCE ﬁnds both the neighbors and the weights automatically. This is done by solving a sparse optimization problem, which encourages selecting nearby points that lie in the same manifold and approximately span a low-dimensional afﬁne subspace. The optimal solution encodes information that can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction using spectral clustering and embedding. Moreover, the size of the optimal neighborhood of a data point, which can be different for different points, provides an estimate of the dimension of the manifold to which the point belongs. Experiments demonstrate that our method can effectively handle multiple manifolds that are very close to each other, manifolds with non-uniform sampling and holes, as well as estimate the intrinsic dimensions of the manifolds. 1 1.1</p><p>4 0.78008866 <a title="157-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Blake Shaw, Bert Huang, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: Many real-world networks are described by both connectivity information and features for every node. To better model and understand these networks, we present structure preserving metric learning (SPML), an algorithm for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric from a network such that the learned distances are tied to the inherent connectivity structure of the network. Like the graph embedding algorithm structure preserving embedding, SPML learns a metric which is structure preserving, meaning a connectivity algorithm such as k-nearest neighbors will yield the correct connectivity when applied using the distances from the learned metric. We show a variety of synthetic and real-world experiments where SPML predicts link patterns from node features more accurately than standard techniques. We further demonstrate a method for optimizing SPML based on stochastic gradient descent which removes the running-time dependency on the size of the network and allows the method to easily scale to networks of thousands of nodes and millions of edges. 1</p><p>5 0.78008342 <a title="157-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Kernel_Embeddings_of_Latent_Tree_Graphical_Models.html">140 nips-2011-Kernel Embeddings of Latent Tree Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Eric P. Xing, Ankur P. Parikh</p><p>Abstract: Latent tree graphical models are natural tools for expressing long range and hierarchical dependencies among many variables which are common in computer vision, bioinformatics and natural language processing problems. However, existing models are largely restricted to discrete and Gaussian variables due to computational constraints; furthermore, algorithms for estimating the latent tree structure and learning the model parameters are largely restricted to heuristic local search. We present a method based on kernel embeddings of distributions for latent tree graphical models with continuous and non-Gaussian variables. Our method can recover the latent tree structures with provable guarantees and perform local-minimum free parameter learning and efﬁcient inference. Experiments on simulated and real data show the advantage of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.7781359 <a title="157-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-A_Denoising_View_of_Matrix_Completion.html">5 nips-2011-A Denoising View of Matrix Completion</a></p>

<p>Author: Carl Vondrick, Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel active learning framework for video annotation. By judiciously choosing which frames a user should annotate, we can obtain highly accurate tracks with minimal user effort. We cast this problem as one of active learning, and show that we can obtain excellent performance by querying frames that, if annotated, would produce a large expected change in the estimated object track. We implement a constrained tracker and compute the expected change for putative annotations with efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms. We demonstrate our framework on four datasets, including two benchmark datasets constructed with key frame annotations obtained by Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results indicate that we could obtain equivalent labels for a small fraction of the original cost. 1</p><p>3 0.25520328 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Filtering.html">180 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamil A. Wnuk, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a robust ﬁltering approach based on semi-supervised and multiple instance learning (MIL). We assume that the posterior density would be unimodal if not for the eﬀect of outliers that we do not wish to explicitly model. Therefore, we seek for a point estimate at the outset, rather than a generic approximation of the entire posterior. Our approach can be thought of as a combination of standard ﬁnite-dimensional ﬁltering (Extended Kalman Filter, or Unscented Filter) with multiple instance learning, whereby the initial condition comes with a putative set of inlier measurements. We show how both the state (regression) and the inlier set (classiﬁcation) can be estimated iteratively and causally by processing only the current measurement. We illustrate our approach on visual tracking problems whereby the object of interest (target) moves and evolves as a result of occlusions and deformations, and partial knowledge of the target is given in the form of a bounding box (training set). 1</p><p>4 0.21434514 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Joint_3D_Estimation_of_Objects_and_Scene_Layout.html">138 nips-2011-Joint 3D Estimation of Objects and Scene Layout</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Geiger, Christian Wojek, Raquel Urtasun</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel generative model that is able to reason jointly about the 3D scene layout as well as the 3D location and orientation of objects in the scene. In particular, we infer the scene topology, geometry as well as trafﬁc activities from a short video sequence acquired with a single camera mounted on a moving car. Our generative model takes advantage of dynamic information in the form of vehicle tracklets as well as static information coming from semantic labels and geometry (i.e., vanishing points). Experiments show that our approach outperforms a discriminative baseline based on multiple kernel learning (MKL) which has access to the same image information. Furthermore, as we reason about objects in 3D, we are able to signiﬁcantly increase the performance of state-of-the-art object detectors in their ability to estimate object orientation. 1</p><p>5 0.17566469 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Structured_Learning_for_Cell_Tracking.html">275 nips-2011-Structured Learning for Cell Tracking</a></p>

Reliable cell tracking in time-lapse microscopic image sequences is important for modern biomedical research. Existing cell tracking methods are usually kept simple and use only a small number of features to allow for manual parameter tweaking or grid search. We propose a structured learning approach that allows to learn optimum parameters automatically from a training set. This allows for the use of a richer set of features which in turn affords improved tracking compared to recently reported methods on two public benchmark sequences. 1</p><p>6 0.16542204 <a title="35-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>

<p>Author: Simon Wiesler, Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: Log-linear models are widely used probability models for statistical pattern recognition. Typically, log-linear models are trained according to a convex criterion. In recent years, the interest in log-linear models has greatly increased. The optimization of log-linear model parameters is costly and therefore an important topic, in particular for large-scale applications. Different optimization algorithms have been evaluated empirically in many papers. In this work, we analyze the optimization problem analytically and show that the training of log-linear models can be highly ill-conditioned. We verify our ﬁndings on two handwriting tasks. By making use of our convergence analysis, we obtain good results on a large-scale continuous handwriting recognition task with a simple and generic approach. 1</p><p>3 0.87575752 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Active_dendrites%3A_adaptation_to_spike-based_communication.html">23 nips-2011-Active dendrites: adaptation to spike-based communication</a></p>
<p>Author: Balazs B. Ujfalussy, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Computational analyses of dendritic computations often assume stationary inputs to neurons, ignoring the pulsatile nature of spike-based communication between neurons and the moment-to-moment ﬂuctuations caused by such spiking inputs. Conversely, circuit computations with spiking neurons are usually formalized without regard to the rich nonlinear nature of dendritic processing. Here we address the computational challenge faced by neurons that compute and represent analogue quantities but communicate with digital spikes, and show that reliable computation of even purely linear functions of inputs can require the interplay of strongly nonlinear subunits within the postsynaptic dendritic tree. Our theory predicts a matching of dendritic nonlinearities and synaptic weight distributions to the joint statistics of presynaptic inputs. This approach suggests normative roles for some puzzling forms of nonlinear dendritic dynamics and plasticity. 1</p><p>4 0.87554419 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Advice_Refinement_in_Knowledge-Based_SVMs.html">27 nips-2011-Advice Refinement in Knowledge-Based SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Gautam Kunapuli, Richard Maclin, Jude W. Shavlik</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge-based support vector machines (KBSVMs) incorporate advice from domain experts, which can improve generalization signiﬁcantly. A major limitation that has not been fully addressed occurs when the expert advice is imperfect, which can lead to poorer models. We propose a model that extends KBSVMs and is able to not only learn from data and advice, but also simultaneously improves the advice. The proposed approach is particularly effective for knowledge discovery in domains with few labeled examples. The proposed model contains bilinear constraints, and is solved using two iterative approaches: successive linear programming and a constrained concave-convex approach. Experimental results demonstrate that these algorithms yield useful reﬁnements to expert advice, as well as improve the performance of the learning algorithm overall.</p><p>5 0.87451375 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Why_The_Brain_Separates_Face_Recognition_From_Object_Recognition.html">304 nips-2011-Why The Brain Separates Face Recognition From Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Z. Leibo, Jim Mutch, Tomaso Poggio</p><p>Abstract: Many studies have uncovered evidence that visual cortex contains specialized regions involved in processing faces but not other object classes. Recent electrophysiology studies of cells in several of these specialized regions revealed that at least some of these regions are organized in a hierarchical manner with viewpointspeciﬁc cells projecting to downstream viewpoint-invariant identity-speciﬁc cells [1]. A separate computational line of reasoning leads to the claim that some transformations of visual inputs that preserve viewed object identity are class-speciﬁc. In particular, the 2D images evoked by a face undergoing a 3D rotation are not produced by the same image transformation (2D) that would produce the images evoked by an object of another class undergoing the same 3D rotation. However, within the class of faces, knowledge of the image transformation evoked by 3D rotation can be reliably transferred from previously viewed faces to help identify a novel face at a new viewpoint. We show, through computational simulations, that an architecture which applies this method of gaining invariance to class-speciﬁc transformations is effective when restricted to faces and fails spectacularly when applied to other object classes. We argue here that in order to accomplish viewpoint-invariant face identiﬁcation from a single example view, visual cortex must separate the circuitry involved in discounting 3D rotations of faces from the generic circuitry involved in processing other objects. The resulting model of the ventral stream of visual cortex is consistent with the recent physiology results showing the hierarchical organization of the face processing network. 1</p><p>6 0.87402356 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>

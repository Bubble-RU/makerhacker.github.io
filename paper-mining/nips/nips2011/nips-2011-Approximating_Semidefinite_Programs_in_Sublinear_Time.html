<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: Learning theory has largely focused on two main learning scenarios: the classical statistical setting where instances are drawn i.i.d. from a ﬁxed distribution, and the adversarial scenario wherein, at every time step, an adversarially chosen instance is revealed to the player. It can be argued that in the real world neither of these assumptions is reasonable. We deﬁne the minimax value of a game where the adversary is restricted in his moves, capturing stochastic and non-stochastic assumptions on data. Building on the sequential symmetrization approach, we deﬁne a notion of distribution-dependent Rademacher complexity for the spectrum of problems ranging from i.i.d. to worst-case. The bounds let us immediately deduce variation-type bounds. We study a smoothed online learning scenario and show that exponentially small amount of noise can make function classes with inﬁnite Littlestone dimension learnable. 1</p><p>3 0.26814389 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Eigenvectors_for_Free.html">145 nips-2011-Learning Eigenvectors for Free</a></p>
<p>Author: Wouter M. Koolen, Wojciech Kotlowski, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We extend the classical problem of predicting a sequence of outcomes from a ﬁnite alphabet to the matrix domain. In this extension, the alphabet of n outcomes is replaced by the set of all dyads, i.e. outer products uu where u is a vector in Rn of unit length. Whereas in the classical case the goal is to learn (i.e. sequentially predict as well as) the best multinomial distribution, in the matrix case we desire to learn the density matrix that best explains the observed sequence of dyads. We show how popular online algorithms for learning a multinomial distribution can be extended to learn density matrices. Intuitively, learning the n2 parameters of a density matrix is much harder than learning the n parameters of a multinomial distribution. Completely surprisingly, we prove that the worst-case regrets of certain classical algorithms and their matrix generalizations are identical. The reason is that the worst-case sequence of dyads share a common eigensystem, i.e. the worst case regret is achieved in the classical case. So these matrix algorithms learn the eigenvectors without any regret. 1</p><p>4 0.25090092 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Prediction_strategies_without_loss.html">220 nips-2011-Prediction strategies without loss</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Kapralov, Rina Panigrahy</p><p>Abstract: Consider a sequence of bits where we are trying to predict the next bit from the previous bits. Assume we are allowed to say ‘predict 0’ or ‘predict 1’, and our payoff is +1 if the prediction is correct and −1 otherwise. We will say that at each point in time the loss of an algorithm is the number of wrong predictions minus the number of right predictions so far. In this paper we are interested in algorithms that have essentially zero (expected) loss over any string at any point in time and yet have small regret with respect to always predicting 0 or always predicting 1. For a sequence of length T our algorithm has regret 14 T and loss √ 2 2 T e− T in expectation for all strings. We show that the tradeoff between loss and regret is optimal up to constant factors. Our techniques extend to the general setting of N experts, where the related problem of trading off regret to the best expert for regret to the ’special’ expert has been studied by Even-Dar et al. (COLT’07). We obtain essentially zero loss with respect to the special expert and optimal loss/regret tradeoff, improving upon the results of Even-Dar et al and settling the main question left open in their paper. The strong loss bounds of the algorithm have some surprising consequences. First, we obtain a parameter free algorithm for the experts problem that has optimal regret bounds with respect to k-shifting optima, i.e. bounds with respect to the optimum that is allowed to change arms multiple times. Moreover, for any window of size n the regret of our algorithm to any expert never exceeds O( n(log N + log T )), where N is the number of experts and T is the time horizon, while maintaining the essentially zero loss property. 1</p><p>5 0.24887034 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Online_Learning_via_Randomized_Rounding.html">80 nips-2011-Efficient Online Learning via Randomized Rounding</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: We present an efﬁcient algorithm for the problem of online multiclass prediction with bandit feedback in the fully adversarial setting. We measure its regret with respect to the log-loss deﬁned in [AR09], which is parameterized by a scalar α. We prove that the regret of N EWTRON is O(log T ) when α is a constant that does not vary with horizon T , and at most O(T 2/3 ) if α is allowed to increase to inﬁnity √ with T . For α = O(log T ), the regret is bounded by O( T ), thus solving the open problem of [KSST08, AR09]. Our algorithm is based on a novel application of the online Newton method [HAK07]. We test our algorithm and show it to perform well in experiments, even when α is a small constant. 1</p><p>4 0.76516759 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Eigenvectors_for_Free.html">145 nips-2011-Learning Eigenvectors for Free</a></p>

<p>Author: Joel Veness, Marc Lanctot, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) has proven to be a powerful, generic planning technique for decision-making in single-agent and adversarial environments. The stochastic nature of the Monte-Carlo simulations introduces errors in the value estimates, both in terms of bias and variance. Whilst reducing bias (typically through the addition of domain knowledge) has been studied in the MCTS literature, comparatively little effort has focused on reducing variance. This is somewhat surprising, since variance reduction techniques are a well-studied area in classical statistics. In this paper, we examine the application of some standard techniques for variance reduction in MCTS, including common random numbers, antithetic variates and control variates. We demonstrate how these techniques can be applied to MCTS and explore their efﬁcacy on three different stochastic, single-agent settings: Pig, Can’t Stop and Dominion. 1</p><p>3 0.96873176 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_Dynamic_Difficulty.html">218 nips-2011-Predicting Dynamic Difficulty</a></p>
<p>Author: Olana Missura, Thomas Gärtner</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by applications in electronic games as well as teaching systems, we investigate the problem of dynamic difﬁculty adjustment. The task here is to repeatedly ﬁnd a game difﬁculty setting that is neither ‘too easy’ and bores the player, nor ‘too difﬁcult’ and overburdens the player. The contributions of this paper are (i) the formulation of difﬁculty adjustment as an online learning problem on partially ordered sets, (ii) an exponential update algorithm for dynamic difﬁculty adjustment, (iii) a bound on the number of wrong difﬁculty settings relative to the best static setting chosen in hindsight, and (iv) an empirical investigation of the algorithm when playing against adversaries. 1</p><p>4 0.96561229 <a title="39-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Complexity_of_Inference_in_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">58 nips-2011-Complexity of Inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Dan Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). First, we study the problem of ﬁnding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of topics to words, where the document’s topic distribution is integrated out. We show that, when the e↵ective number of topics per document is small, exact inference takes polynomial time. In contrast, we show that, when a document has a large number of topics, ﬁnding the MAP assignment of topics to words in LDA is NP-hard. Next, we consider the problem of ﬁnding the MAP topic distribution for a document, where the topic-word assignments are integrated out. We show that this problem is also NP-hard. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the problem of sampling from the posterior, showing that this is NP-hard in one restricted setting, but leaving open the general question. 1</p><p>5 0.95622444 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Policy_Gradient_Coagent_Networks.html">215 nips-2011-Policy Gradient Coagent Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel class of actor-critic algorithms for actors consisting of sets of interacting modules. We present, analyze theoretically, and empirically evaluate an update rule for each module, which requires only local information: the module’s input, output, and the TD error broadcast by a critic. Such updates are necessary when computation of compatible features becomes prohibitively difﬁcult and are also desirable to increase the biological plausibility of reinforcement learning methods. 1</p><p>6 0.94302547 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-An_Application_of_Tree-Structured_Expectation_Propagation_for_Channel_Decoding.html">31 nips-2011-An Application of Tree-Structured Expectation Propagation for Channel Decoding</a></p>

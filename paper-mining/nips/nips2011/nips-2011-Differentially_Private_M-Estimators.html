<p>Author: Sivaraman Balakrishnan, Min Xu, Akshay Krishnamurthy, Aarti Singh</p><p>Abstract: Although spectral clustering has enjoyed considerable empirical success in machine learning, its theoretical properties are not yet fully developed. We analyze the performance of a spectral algorithm for hierarchical clustering and show that on a class of hierarchically structured similarity matrices, this algorithm can tolerate noise that grows with the number of data points while still perfectly recovering the hierarchical clusters with high probability. We additionally improve upon previous results for k-way spectral clustering to derive conditions under which spectral clustering makes no mistakes. Further, using minimax analysis, we derive tight upper and lower bounds for the clustering problem and compare the performance of spectral clustering to these information theoretic limits. We also present experiments on simulated and real world data illustrating our results. 1</p><p>3 0.063455902 <a title="69-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Bayesian_Bias_Mitigation_for_Crowdsourcing.html">42 nips-2011-Bayesian Bias Mitigation for Crowdsourcing</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian L. Wauthier, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Biased labelers are a systemic problem in crowdsourcing, and a comprehensive toolbox for handling their responses is still being developed. A typical crowdsourcing application can be divided into three steps: data collection, data curation, and learning. At present these steps are often treated separately. We present Bayesian Bias Mitigation for Crowdsourcing (BBMC), a Bayesian model to unify all three. Most data curation methods account for the effects of labeler bias by modeling all labels as coming from a single latent truth. Our model captures the sources of bias by describing labelers as inﬂuenced by shared random effects. This approach can account for more complex bias patterns that arise in ambiguous or hard labeling tasks and allows us to merge data curation and learning into a single computation. Active learning integrates data collection with learning, but is commonly considered infeasible with Gibbs sampling inference. We propose a general approximation strategy for Markov chains to efﬁciently quantify the effect of a perturbation on the stationary distribution and specialize this approach to active learning. Experiments show BBMC to outperform many common heuristics. 1</p><p>4 0.058320593 <a title="69-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>5 0.057295561 <a title="69-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_coding_of_natural_images_with_a_population_of_noisy_Linear-Nonlinear_neurons.html">82 nips-2011-Efficient coding of natural images with a population of noisy Linear-Nonlinear neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>6 0.05615383 <a title="69-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-On_Strategy_Stitching_in_Large_Extensive_Form_Multiplayer_Games.html">196 nips-2011-On Strategy Stitching in Large Extensive Form Multiplayer Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Makoto Yamada, Taiji Suzuki, Takafumi Kanamori, Hirotaka Hachiya, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Divergence estimators based on direct approximation of density-ratios without going through separate approximation of numerator and denominator densities have been successfully applied to machine learning tasks that involve distribution comparison such as outlier detection, transfer learning, and two-sample homogeneity test. However, since density-ratio functions often possess high ﬂuctuation, divergence estimation is still a challenging task in practice. In this paper, we propose to use relative divergences for distribution comparison, which involves approximation of relative density-ratios. Since relative density-ratios are always smoother than corresponding ordinary density-ratios, our proposed method is favorable in terms of the non-parametric convergence speed. Furthermore, we show that the proposed divergence estimator has asymptotic variance independent of the model complexity under a parametric setup, implying that the proposed estimator hardly overﬁts even with complex models. Through experiments, we demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>3 0.59398282 <a title="69-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-On_Causal_Discovery_with_Cyclic_Additive_Noise_Models.html">194 nips-2011-On Causal Discovery with Cyclic Additive Noise Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Dominik Janzing, Tom Heskes, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We study a particular class of cyclic causal models, where each variable is a (possibly nonlinear) function of its parents and additive noise. We prove that the causal graph of such models is generically identiﬁable in the bivariate, Gaussian-noise case. We also propose a method to learn such models from observational data. In the acyclic case, the method reduces to ordinary regression, but in the more challenging cyclic case, an additional term arises in the loss function, which makes it a special case of nonlinear independent component analysis. We illustrate the proposed method on synthetic data. 1</p><p>4 0.58286887 <a title="69-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Learning_of_Generalized_Linear_and_Single_Index_Models_with_Isotonic_Regression.html">77 nips-2011-Efficient Learning of Generalized Linear and Single Index Models with Isotonic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Varun Kanade, Ohad Shamir, Adam Kalai</p><p>Abstract: Generalized Linear Models (GLMs) and Single Index Models (SIMs) provide powerful generalizations of linear regression, where the target variable is assumed to be a (possibly unknown) 1-dimensional function of a linear predictor. In general, these problems entail non-convex estimation procedures, and, in practice, iterative local search heuristics are often used. Kalai and Sastry (2009) provided the ﬁrst provably efﬁcient method, the Isotron algorithm, for learning SIMs and GLMs, under the assumption that the data is in fact generated under a GLM and under certain monotonicity and Lipschitz (bounded slope) constraints. The Isotron algorithm interleaves steps of perceptron-like updates with isotonic regression (ﬁtting a one-dimensional non-decreasing function). However, to obtain provable performance, the method requires a fresh sample every iteration. In this paper, we provide algorithms for learning GLMs and SIMs, which are both computationally and statistically efﬁcient. We modify the isotonic regression step in Isotron to ﬁt a Lipschitz monotonic function, and also provide an efﬁcient O(n log(n)) algorithm for this step, improving upon the previous O(n2 ) algorithm. We provide a brief empirical study, demonstrating the feasibility of our algorithms in practice. 1</p><p>5 0.53618085 <a title="69-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: Many clustering techniques aim at optimizing empirical criteria that are of the form of a U -statistic of degree two. Given a measure of dissimilarity between pairs of observations, the goal is to minimize the within cluster point scatter over a class of partitions of the feature space. It is the purpose of this paper to deﬁne a general statistical framework, relying on the theory of U -processes, for studying the performance of such clustering methods. In this setup, under adequate assumptions on the complexity of the subsets forming the partition candidates, the √ excess of clustering risk is proved to be of the order OP (1/ n). Based on recent results related to the tail behavior of degenerate U -processes, it is also shown how to establish tighter rate bounds. Model selection issues, related to the number of clusters forming the data partition in particular, are also considered. 1</p><p>6 0.53493196 <a title="69-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Minimax_Localization_of_Structural_Information_in_Large_Noisy_Matrices.html">172 nips-2011-Minimax Localization of Structural Information in Large Noisy Matrices</a></p>

<p>Author: Vincent Delaitre, Josef Sivic, Ivan Laptev</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a discriminatively trained model of person-object interactions for recognizing common human actions in still images. We build on the locally order-less spatial pyramid bag-of-features model, which was shown to perform extremely well on a range of object, scene and human action recognition tasks. We introduce three principal contributions. First, we replace the standard quantized local HOG/SIFT features with stronger discriminatively trained body part and object detectors. Second, we introduce new person-object interaction features based on spatial co-occurrences of individual body parts and objects. Third, we address the combinatorial problem of a large number of possible interaction pairs and propose a discriminative selection procedure using a linear support vector machine (SVM) with a sparsity inducing regularizer. Learning of action-speciﬁc body part and object interactions bypasses the difﬁcult problem of estimating the complete human body pose conﬁguration. Beneﬁts of the proposed model are shown on human action recognition in consumer photographs, outperforming the strong bag-of-features baseline. 1</p><p>3 0.58270472 <a title="69-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Trace_Lasso%3A_a_trace_norm_regularization_for_correlated_designs.html">289 nips-2011-Trace Lasso: a trace norm regularization for correlated designs</a></p>
<p>Author: Edouard Grave, Guillaume R. Obozinski, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Using the 1 -norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected covariates, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net. 1</p><p>4 0.58146662 <a title="69-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-On_Learning_Discrete_Graphical_Models_using_Greedy_Methods.html">195 nips-2011-On Learning Discrete Graphical Models using Greedy Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Jalali, Christopher C. Johnson, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of learning the structure of a pairwise graphical model from samples in a high-dimensional setting. Our ﬁrst main result studies the sparsistency, or consistency in sparsity pattern recovery, properties of a forward-backward greedy algorithm as applied to general statistical models. As a special case, we then apply this algorithm to learn the structure of a discrete graphical model via neighborhood estimation. As a corollary of our general result, we derive sufﬁcient conditions on the number of samples n, the maximum nodedegree d and the problem size p, as well as other conditions on the model parameters, so that the algorithm recovers all the edges with high probability. Our result guarantees graph selection for samples scaling as n = Ω(d2 log(p)), in contrast to existing convex-optimization based algorithms that require a sample complexity of Ω(d3 log(p)). Further, the greedy algorithm only requires a restricted strong convexity condition which is typically milder than irrepresentability assumptions. We corroborate these results using numerical simulations at the end.</p><p>5 0.58004487 <a title="69-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-On_fast_approximate_submodular_minimization.html">199 nips-2011-On fast approximate submodular minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefanie Jegelka, Hui Lin, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We are motivated by an application to extract a representative subset of machine learning training data and by the poor empirical performance we observe of the popular minimum norm algorithm. In fact, for our application, minimum norm can have a running time of about O(n7 ) (O(n5 ) oracle calls). We therefore propose a fast approximate method to minimize arbitrary submodular functions. For a large sub-class of submodular functions, the algorithm is exact. Other submodular functions are iteratively approximated by tight submodular upper bounds, and then repeatedly optimized. We show theoretical properties, and empirical results suggest signiﬁcant speedups over minimum norm while retaining higher accuracies. 1</p><p>6 0.57968849 <a title="69-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Prismatic_Algorithm_for_Discrete_D.C._Programming_Problem.html">222 nips-2011-Prismatic Algorithm for Discrete D.C.

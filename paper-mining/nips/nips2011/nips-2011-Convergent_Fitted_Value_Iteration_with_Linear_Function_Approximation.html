<p>Author: Paul Wagner</p><p>Abstract: A majority of approximate dynamic programming approaches to the reinforcement learning problem can be categorized into greedy value function methods and value-based policy gradient methods. The former approach, although fast, is well known to be susceptible to the policy oscillation phenomenon. We take a fresh view to this phenomenon by casting a considerable subset of the former approach as a limiting special case of the latter. We explain the phenomenon in terms of this view and illustrate the underlying mechanism with artiﬁcial examples. We also use it to derive the constrained natural actor-critic algorithm that can interpolate between the aforementioned approaches. In addition, it has been suggested in the literature that the oscillation phenomenon might be subtly connected to the grossly suboptimal performance in the Tetris benchmark problem of all attempted approximate dynamic programming methods. We report empirical evidence against such a connection and in favor of an alternative explanation. Finally, we report scores in the Tetris problem that improve on existing dynamic programming based results. 1</p><p>3 0.12139232 <a title="65-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Action-Gap_Phenomenon_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">18 nips-2011-Action-Gap Phenomenon in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand</p><p>Abstract: Many practitioners of reinforcement learning problems have observed that oftentimes the performance of the agent reaches very close to the optimal performance even though the estimated (action-)value function is still far from the optimal one. The goal of this paper is to explain and formalize this phenomenon by introducing the concept of the action-gap regularity. As a typical result, we prove that for an ˆ agent following the greedy policy π with respect to an action-value function Q, the ˆ ˆ ˆ performance loss E V ∗ (X) − V π (X) is upper bounded by O( Q − Q∗ 1+ζ ), ∞ in which ζ ≥ 0 is the parameter quantifying the action-gap regularity. For ζ > 0, our results indicate smaller performance loss compared to what previous analyses had suggested. Finally, we show how this regularity affects the performance of the family of approximate value iteration algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.093892045 <a title="65-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-MAP_Inference_for_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.html">163 nips-2011-MAP Inference for Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaedeug Choi, Kee-eung Kim</p><p>Abstract: The difﬁculty in inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) arises in choosing the best reward function since there are typically an inﬁnite number of reward functions that yield the given behaviour data as optimal. Using a Bayesian framework, we address this challenge by using the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation for the reward function, and show that most of the previous IRL algorithms can be modeled into our framework. We also present a gradient method for the MAP estimation based on the (sub)differentiability of the posterior distribution. We show the effectiveness of our approach by comparing the performance of the proposed method to those of the previous algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.08825095 <a title="65-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Policy_Gradient_Coagent_Networks.html">215 nips-2011-Policy Gradient Coagent Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip S. Thomas</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel class of actor-critic algorithms for actors consisting of sets of interacting modules. We present, analyze theoretically, and empirically evaluate an update rule for each module, which requires only local information: the module’s input, output, and the TD error broadcast by a critic. Such updates are necessary when computation of compatible features becomes prohibitively difﬁcult and are also desirable to increase the biological plausibility of reinforcement learning methods. 1</p><p>6 0.080522224 <a title="65-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-High-dimensional_regression_with_noisy_and_missing_data%3A_Provable_guarantees_with_non-convexity.html">118 nips-2011-High-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data: Provable guarantees with non-convexity</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingting Zhao, Hirotaka Hachiya, Gang Niu, Masashi Sugiyama</p><p>Abstract: Policy gradient is a useful model-free reinforcement learning approach, but it tends to suffer from instability of gradient estimates. In this paper, we analyze and improve the stability of policy gradient methods. We ﬁrst prove that the variance of gradient estimates in the PGPE (policy gradients with parameter-based exploration) method is smaller than that of the classical REINFORCE method under a mild assumption. We then derive the optimal baseline for PGPE, which contributes to further reducing the variance. We also theoretically show that PGPE with the optimal baseline is more preferable than REINFORCE with the optimal baseline in terms of the variance of gradient estimates. Finally, we demonstrate the usefulness of the improved PGPE method through experiments. 1</p><p>3 0.73682094 <a title="65-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-A_reinterpretation_of_the_policy_oscillation_phenomenon_in_approximate_policy_iteration.html">16 nips-2011-A reinterpretation of the policy oscillation phenomenon in approximate policy iteration</a></p>

<p>Author: Andre S. Barreto, Doina Precup, Joelle Pineau</p><p>Abstract: Kernel-based reinforcement-learning (KBRL) is a method for learning a decision policy from a set of sample transitions which stands out for its strong theoretical guarantees. However, the size of the approximator grows with the number of transitions, which makes the approach impractical for large problems. In this paper we introduce a novel algorithm to improve the scalability of KBRL. We resort to a special decomposition of a transition matrix, called stochastic factorization, to ﬁx the size of the approximator while at the same time incorporating all the information contained in the data. The resulting algorithm, kernel-based stochastic factorization (KBSF), is much faster but still converges to a unique solution. We derive a theoretical upper bound for the distance between the value functions computed by KBRL and KBSF. The effectiveness of our method is illustrated with computational experiments on four reinforcement-learning problems, including a difﬁcult task in which the goal is to learn a neurostimulation policy to suppress the occurrence of seizures in epileptic rat brains. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to compress the information contained in KBRL’s model. Also, on the tasks studied, KBSF outperforms two of the most prominent reinforcement-learning algorithms, namely least-squares policy iteration and ﬁtted Q-iteration. 1</p><p>6 0.70572561 <a title="65-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-A_Non-Parametric_Approach_to_Dynamic_Programming.html">10 nips-2011-A Non-Parametric Approach to Dynamic Programming</a></p>

The developed algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm which responds to the structure of this problem through the relationship between submodularity and convexity. The D.S. programming problem covers a broad range of applications in machine learning. In fact, this generalizes any set-function optimization. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the difference between exact and approximate solutions respectively obtained by the proposed and existing algorithms in feature selection and discriminative structure learning.</p><p>3 0.62722766 <a title="65-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Recovery_with_Brownian_Sensing.html">264 nips-2011-Sparse Recovery with Brownian Sensing</a></p>

We introduce an additional randomization process, called Brownian sensing, based on the computation of stochastic integrals, which produces a Gaussian sensing matrix, for which good recovery properties are proven, independently on the number of sampling points N , even when the features are arbitrarily non-orthogonal. Under the assumption that f is H¨ lder continuous with exponent at least √ we proo 1/2, vide an estimate α of the parameter such that �α − α�2 = O(�η�2 / N ), where � � η is the observation noise.

In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods that largely use ﬁrst order gradient information, our algorithm is based on Newton’s method and employs a quadratic approximation, but with some modiﬁcations that leverage the structure of the sparse Gaussian MLE problem. We show that our method is superlinearly convergent, and also present experimental results using synthetic and real application data that demonstrate the considerable improvements in performance of our method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>5 0.62079662 <a title="65-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Better_Mini-Batch_Algorithms_via_Accelerated_Gradient_Methods.html">46 nips-2011-Better Mini-Batch Algorithms via Accelerated Gradient Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Cotter, Ohad Shamir, Nati Srebro, Karthik Sridharan</p><p>Abstract: Mini-batch algorithms have been proposed as a way to speed-up stochastic convex optimization problems. We study how such algorithms can be improved using accelerated gradient methods. We provide a novel analysis, which shows how standard gradient methods may sometimes be insuﬃcient to obtain a signiﬁcant speed-up and propose a novel accelerated gradient algorithm, which deals with this deﬁciency, enjoys a uniformly superior guarantee and works well in practice. 1</p><p>6 0.61993229 <a title="65-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Machine_Learning.html">187 nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Machine Learning</a></p>

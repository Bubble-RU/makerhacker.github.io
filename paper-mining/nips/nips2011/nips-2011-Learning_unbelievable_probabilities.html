<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: While loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) has been utilized in a wide variety of applications with empirical success, it comes with few theoretical guarantees. Especially, if the interactions of random variables in a graphical model are strong, the behaviors of the algorithm can be difﬁcult to analyze due to underlying phase transitions. In this paper, we develop a novel approach to the uniqueness problem of the LBP ﬁxed point; our new “necessary and sufﬁcient” condition is stated in terms of graphs and signs, where the sign denotes the types (attractive/repulsive) of the interaction (i.e., compatibility function) on the edge. In all previous works, uniqueness is guaranteed only in the situations where the strength of the interactions are “sufﬁciently” small in certain senses. In contrast, our condition covers arbitrary strong interactions on the speciﬁed class of signed graphs. The result of this paper is based on the recent theoretical advance in the LBP algorithm; the connection with the graph zeta function.</p><p>3 0.12852773 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-An_Application_of_Tree-Structured_Expectation_Propagation_for_Channel_Decoding.html">31 nips-2011-An Application of Tree-Structured Expectation Propagation for Channel Decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Pablo M. Olmos, Luis Salamanca, Juan Fuentes, Fernando Pérez-Cruz</p><p>Abstract: We show an application of a tree structure for approximate inference in graphical models using the expectation propagation algorithm. These approximations are typically used over graphs with short-range cycles. We demonstrate that these approximations also help in sparse graphs with long-range loops, as the ones used in coding theory to approach channel capacity. For asymptotically large sparse graph, the expectation propagation algorithm together with the tree structure yields a completely disconnected approximation to the graphical model but, for for ﬁnite-length practical sparse graphs, the tree structure approximation to the code graph provides accurate estimates for the marginal of each variable. Furthermore, we propose a new method for constructing the tree structure on the ﬂy that might be more amenable for sparse graphs with general factors. 1</p><p>4 0.11642536 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Accelerated_Adaptive_Markov_Chain_for_Partition_Function_Computation.html">17 nips-2011-Accelerated Adaptive Markov Chain for Partition Function Computation</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefano Ermon, Carla P. Gomes, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel Adaptive Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to compute the partition function. In particular, we show how to accelerate a ﬂat histogram sampling technique by signiﬁcantly reducing the number of “null moves” in the chain, while maintaining asymptotic convergence properties. Our experiments show that our method converges quickly to highly accurate solutions on a range of benchmark instances, outperforming other state-of-the-art methods such as IJGP, TRW, and Gibbs sampling both in run-time and accuracy. We also show how obtaining a so-called density of states distribution allows for efﬁcient weight learning in Markov Logic theories. 1</p><p>5 0.086333998 <a title="158-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Message-Passing_for_Approximate_MAP_Inference_with_Latent_Variables.html">170 nips-2011-Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiarong Jiang, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general inference setting for discrete probabilistic graphical models where we seek maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subset of the random variables (max nodes), marginalizing over the rest (sum nodes). We present a hybrid message-passing algorithm to accomplish this. The hybrid algorithm passes a mix of sum and max messages depending on the type of source node (sum or max). We derive our algorithm by showing that it falls out as the solution of a particular relaxation of a variational framework. We further show that the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be seen as an approximation to our algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, against several baselines, demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.082237959 <a title="158-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Non-conjugate_Variational_Message_Passing_for_Multinomial_and_Binary_Regression.html">188 nips-2011-Non-conjugate Variational Message Passing for Multinomial and Binary Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Animashree Anandkumar, Vincent Tan, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of Ising and Gaussian graphical model selection given n i.i.d. samples from the model. We propose an efﬁcient threshold-based algorithm for structure estimation based on conditional mutual information thresholding. This simple local algorithm requires only loworder statistics of the data and decides whether two nodes are neighbors in the unknown graph. We identify graph families for which the proposed algorithm has low sample and computational complexities. Under some transparent assumptions, we establish that the proposed algorithm is −4 structurally consistent (or sparsistent) when the number of samples scales as n = Ω(Jmin log p), where p is the number of nodes and Jmin is the minimum edge potential. We also develop novel non-asymptotic techniques for obtaining necessary conditions for graphical model selection.

<p>Author: Javad Azimi, Alan Fern, Xiaoli Z. Fern</p><p>Abstract: Budgeted optimization involves optimizing an unknown function that is costly to evaluate by requesting a limited number of function evaluations at intelligently selected inputs. Typical problem formulations assume that experiments are selected one at a time with a limited total number of experiments, which fail to capture important aspects of many real-world problems. This paper deﬁnes a novel problem formulation with the following important extensions: 1) allowing for concurrent experiments; 2) allowing for stochastic experiment durations; and 3) placing constraints on both the total number of experiments and the total experimental time. We develop both ofﬂine and online algorithms for selecting concurrent experiments in this new setting and provide experimental results on a number of optimization benchmarks. The results show that our algorithms produce highly effective schedules compared to natural baselines. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81485093 <a title="158-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Learning_unbelievable_probabilities.html">158 nips-2011-Learning unbelievable probabilities</a></p>

<p>Author: David Newman, Edwin V. Bonilla, Wray Buntine</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents. When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reﬂect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data. 1</p><p>4 0.74816716 <a title="158-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Signal_Estimation_Under_Random_Time-Warpings_and_Nonlinear_Signal_Alignment.html">253 nips-2011-Signal Estimation Under Random Time-Warpings and Nonlinear Signal Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Sebastian A. Kurtek, Anuj Srivastava, Wei Wu</p><p>Abstract: While signal estimation under random amplitudes, phase shifts, and additive noise is studied frequently, the problem of estimating a deterministic signal under random time-warpings has been relatively unexplored. We present a novel framework for estimating the unknown signal that utilizes the action of the warping group to form an equivalence relation between signals. First, we derive an estimator for the equivalence class of the unknown signal using the notion of Karcher mean on the quotient space of equivalence classes. This step requires the use of Fisher-Rao Riemannian metric and a square-root representation of signals to enable computations of distances and means under this metric. Then, we deﬁne a notion of the center of a class and show that the center of the estimated class is a consistent estimator of the underlying unknown signal. This estimation algorithm has many applications: (1) registration/alignment of functional data, (2) separation of phase/amplitude components of functional data, (3) joint demodulation and carrier estimation, and (4) sparse modeling of functional data. Here we demonstrate only (1) and (2): Given signals are temporally aligned using nonlinear warpings and, thus, separated into their phase and amplitude components. The proposed method for signal alignment is shown to have state of the art performance using Berkeley growth, handwritten signatures, and neuroscience spike train data. 1</p><p>5 0.74731576 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Anatomically_Constrained_Decoding_of_Finger_Flexion_from_Electrocorticographic_Signals.html">38 nips-2011-Anatomically Constrained Decoding of Finger Flexion from Electrocorticographic Signals</a></p>
<p>Author: Zuoguan Wang, Gerwin Schalk, Qiang Ji</p><p>Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) use brain signals to convey a user’s intent. Some BCI approaches begin by decoding kinematic parameters of movements from brain signals, and then proceed to using these signals, in absence of movements, to allow a user to control an output. Recent results have shown that electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from the surface of the brain in humans can give information about kinematic parameters (e.g., hand velocity or ﬁnger ﬂexion). The decoding approaches in these demonstrations usually employed classical classiﬁcation/regression algorithms that derive a linear mapping between brain signals and outputs. However, they typically only incorporate little prior information about the target kinematic parameter. In this paper, we show that different types of anatomical constraints that govern ﬁnger ﬂexion can be exploited in this context. Speciﬁcally, we incorporate these constraints in the construction, structure, and the probabilistic functions of a switched non-parametric dynamic system (SNDS) model. We then apply the resulting SNDS decoder to infer the ﬂexion of individual ﬁngers from the same ECoG dataset used in a recent study. Our results show that the application of the proposed model, which incorporates anatomical constraints, improves decoding performance compared to the results in the previous work. Thus, the results presented in this paper may ultimately lead to neurally controlled hand prostheses with full ﬁne-grained ﬁnger articulation. 1</p><p>6 0.74469942 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-On_Tracking_The_Partition_Function.html">197 nips-2011-On Tracking The Partition Function</a></p>

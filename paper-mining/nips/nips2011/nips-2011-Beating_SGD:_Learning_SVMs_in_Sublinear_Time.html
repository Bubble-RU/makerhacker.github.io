<p>Author: Levi Boyles, Anoop Korattikara, Deva Ramanan, Max Welling</p><p>Abstract: Learning problems, such as logistic regression, are typically formulated as pure optimization problems deﬁned on some loss function. We argue that this view ignores the fact that the loss function depends on stochastically generated data which in turn determines an intrinsic scale of precision for statistical estimation. By considering the statistical properties of the update variables used during the optimization (e.g. gradients), we can construct frequentist hypothesis tests to determine the reliability of these updates. We utilize subsets of the data for computing updates, and use the hypothesis tests for determining when the batch-size needs to be increased. This provides computational beneﬁts and avoids overﬁtting by stopping when the batch-size has become equal to size of the full dataset. Moreover, the proposed algorithms depend on a single interpretable parameter – the probability for an update to be in the wrong direction – which is set to a single value across all algorithms and datasets. In this paper, we illustrate these ideas on three L1 regularized coordinate descent algorithms: L1 -regularized L2 -loss SVMs, L1 -regularized logistic regression, and the Lasso, but we emphasize that the underlying methods are much more generally applicable. 1</p><p>4 0.20766878 <a title="45-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Approximating_Semidefinite_Programs_in_Sublinear_Time.html">39 nips-2011-Approximating Semidefinite Programs in Sublinear Time</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Garber, Elad Hazan</p><p>Abstract: In recent years semideﬁnite optimization has become a tool of major importance in various optimization and machine learning problems. In many of these problems the amount of data in practice is so large that there is a constant need for faster algorithms. In this work we present the ﬁrst sublinear time approximation algorithm for semideﬁnite programs which we believe may be useful for such problems in which the size of data may cause even linear time algorithms to have prohibitive running times in practice. We present the algorithm and its analysis alongside with some theoretical lower bounds and an improved algorithm for the special problem of supervised learning of a distance metric. 1</p><p>5 0.14301457 <a title="45-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Machine_Learning.html">187 nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Machine Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric Moulines, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the minimization of a convex objective function deﬁned on a Hilbert space, which is only available through unbiased estimates of its gradients. This problem includes standard machine learning algorithms such as kernel logistic regression and least-squares regression, and is commonly referred to as a stochastic approximation problem in the operations research community. We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the convergence of two well-known algorithms, stochastic gradient descent (a.k.a. Robbins-Monro algorithm) as well as a simple modiﬁcation where iterates are averaged (a.k.a. Polyak-Ruppert averaging). Our analysis suggests that a learning rate proportional to the inverse of the number of iterations, while leading to the optimal convergence rate in the strongly convex case, is not robust to the lack of strong convexity or the setting of the proportionality constant. This situation is remedied when using slower decays together with averaging, robustly leading to the optimal rate of convergence. We illustrate our theoretical results with simulations on synthetic and standard datasets.</p><p>6 0.13894971 <a title="45-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Online_Learning_via_Randomized_Rounding.html">80 nips-2011-Efficient Online Learning via Randomized Rounding</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Recht, Christopher Re, Stephen Wright, Feng Niu</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm that can achieve stateof-the-art performance on a variety of machine learning tasks. Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performancedestroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called H OGWILD ! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other’s work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then H OGWILD ! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that H OGWILD ! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude. 1</p><p>6 0.64004767 <a title="45-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-On_the_Universality_of_Online_Mirror_Descent.html">202 nips-2011-On the Universality of Online Mirror Descent</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshinobu Kawahara, Takashi Washio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst exact algorithm for minimizing the difference of two submodular functions (D.S.), i.e., the discrete version of the D.C. programming problem. The developed algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm which responds to the structure of this problem through the relationship between submodularity and convexity. The D.S. programming problem covers a broad range of applications in machine learning. In fact, this generalizes any set-function optimization. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the difference between exact and approximate solutions respectively obtained by the proposed and existing algorithms in feature selection and discriminative structure learning.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91803169 <a title="45-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Beating_SGD%3A_Learning_SVMs_in_Sublinear_Time.html">45 nips-2011-Beating SGD: Learning SVMs in Sublinear Time</a></p>

<p>Author: Cho-jui Hsieh, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Mátyás A. Sustik</p><p>Abstract: The 1 regularized Gaussian maximum likelihood estimator has been shown to have strong statistical guarantees in recovering a sparse inverse covariance matrix, or alternatively the underlying graph structure of a Gaussian Markov Random Field, from very limited samples. We propose a novel algorithm for solving the resulting optimization problem which is a regularized log-determinant program. In contrast to other state-of-the-art methods that largely use ﬁrst order gradient information, our algorithm is based on Newton’s method and employs a quadratic approximation, but with some modiﬁcations that leverage the structure of the sparse Gaussian MLE problem. We show that our method is superlinearly convergent, and also present experimental results using synthetic and real application data that demonstrate the considerable improvements in performance of our method when compared to other state-of-the-art methods.</p><p>4 0.88519859 <a title="45-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Manifold_Precis%3A_An_Annealing_Technique_for_Diverse_Sampling_of_Manifolds.html">164 nips-2011-Manifold Precis: An Annealing Technique for Diverse Sampling of Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Nitesh Shroff, Pavan Turaga, Rama Chellappa</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the Pr´ cis problem of sampling K representative yet e diverse data points from a large dataset. This problem arises frequently in applications such as video and document summarization, exploratory data analysis, and pre-ﬁltering. We formulate a general theory which encompasses not just traditional techniques devised for vector spaces, but also non-Euclidean manifolds, thereby enabling these techniques to shapes, human activities, textures and many other image and video based datasets. We propose intrinsic manifold measures for measuring the quality of a selection of points with respect to their representative power, and their diversity. We then propose efﬁcient algorithms to optimize the cost function using a novel annealing-based iterative alternation algorithm. The proposed formulation is applicable to manifolds of known geometry as well as to manifolds whose geometry needs to be estimated from samples. Experimental results show the strength and generality of the proposed approach.</p><p>5 0.88432908 <a title="45-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-The_Fixed_Points_of_Off-Policy_TD.html">283 nips-2011-The Fixed Points of Off-Policy TD</a></p>
<p>Author: J. Z. Kolter</p><p>Abstract: Off-policy learning, the ability for an agent to learn about a policy other than the one it is following, is a key element of Reinforcement Learning, and in recent years there has been much work on developing Temporal Different (TD) algorithms that are guaranteed to converge under off-policy sampling. It has remained an open question, however, whether anything can be said a priori about the quality of the TD solution when off-policy sampling is employed with function approximation. In general the answer is no: for arbitrary off-policy sampling the error of the TD solution can be unboundedly large, even when the approximator can represent the true value function well. In this paper we propose a novel approach to address this problem: we show that by considering a certain convex subset of off-policy distributions we can indeed provide guarantees as to the solution quality similar to the on-policy case. Furthermore, we show that we can efﬁciently project on to this convex set using only samples generated from the system. The end result is a novel TD algorithm that has approximation guarantees even in the case of off-policy sampling and which empirically outperforms existing TD methods. 1</p><p>6 0.88110816 <a title="45-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-A_Reinforcement_Learning_Theory_for_Homeostatic_Regulation.html">11 nips-2011-A Reinforcement Learning Theory for Homeostatic Regulation</a></p>

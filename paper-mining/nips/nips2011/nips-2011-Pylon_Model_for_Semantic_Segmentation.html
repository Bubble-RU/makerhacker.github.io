<p>Author: Adrian Ion, Joao Carreira, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint image segmentation and labeling model (JSL) which, given a bag of ﬁgure-ground segment hypotheses extracted at multiple image locations and scales, constructs a joint probability distribution over both the compatible image interpretations (tilings or image segmentations) composed from those segments, and over their labeling into categories. The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as ﬁrst sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect conﬁgurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.</p><p>3 0.31868032 <a title="227-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Inference_in_Fully_Connected_CRFs_with_Gaussian_Edge_Potentials.html">76 nips-2011-Efficient Inference in Fully Connected CRFs with Gaussian Edge Potentials</a></p>
<p>Author: Philipp Krähenbühl, Vladlen Koltun</p><p>Abstract: Most state-of-the-art techniques for multi-class image segmentation and labeling use conditional random ﬁelds deﬁned over pixels or image regions. While regionlevel models often feature dense pairwise connectivity, pixel-level models are considerably larger and have only permitted sparse graph structures. In this paper, we consider fully connected CRF models deﬁned on the complete set of pixels in an image. The resulting graphs have billions of edges, making traditional inference algorithms impractical. Our main contribution is a highly efﬁcient approximate inference algorithm for fully connected CRF models in which the pairwise edge potentials are deﬁned by a linear combination of Gaussian kernels. Our experiments demonstrate that dense connectivity at the pixel level substantially improves segmentation and labeling accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.2927441 <a title="227-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Higher-Order_Correlation_Clustering_for_Image_Segmentation.html">119 nips-2011-Higher-Order Correlation Clustering for Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Sungwoong Kim, Sebastian Nowozin, Pushmeet Kohli, Chang D. Yoo</p><p>Abstract: For many of the state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms, image segmentation is an important preprocessing step. As such, several image segmentation algorithms have been proposed, however, with certain reservation due to high computational load and many hand-tuning parameters. Correlation clustering, a graphpartitioning algorithm often used in natural language processing and document clustering, has the potential to perform better than previously proposed image segmentation algorithms. We improve the basic correlation clustering formulation by taking into account higher-order cluster relationships. This improves clustering in the presence of local boundary ambiguities. We ﬁrst apply the pairwise correlation clustering to image segmentation over a pairwise superpixel graph and then develop higher-order correlation clustering over a hypergraph that considers higher-order relations among superpixels. Fast inference is possible by linear programming relaxation, and also effective parameter learning framework by structured support vector machine is possible. Experimental results on various datasets show that the proposed higher-order correlation clustering outperforms other state-of-the-art image segmentation algorithms.</p><p>5 0.26513767 <a title="227-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Semantic_Labeling_of_3D_Point_Clouds_for_Indoor_Scenes.html">247 nips-2011-Semantic Labeling of 3D Point Clouds for Indoor Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Hema S. Koppula, Abhishek Anand, Thorsten Joachims, Ashutosh Saxena</p><p>Abstract: Inexpensive RGB-D cameras that give an RGB image together with depth data have become widely available. In this paper, we use this data to build 3D point clouds of full indoor scenes such as an ofﬁce and address the task of semantic labeling of these 3D point clouds. We propose a graphical model that captures various features and contextual relations, including the local visual appearance and shape cues, object co-occurence relationships and geometric relationships. With a large number of object classes and relations, the model’s parsimony becomes important and we address that by using multiple types of edge potentials. The model admits efﬁcient approximate inference, and we train it using a maximum-margin learning approach. In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and ofﬁces (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for ofﬁces, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of ﬁnding objects in large cluttered rooms.1 1</p><p>6 0.1943896 <a title="227-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Spatial_distance_dependent_Chinese_restaurant_processes_for_image_segmentation.html">266 nips-2011-Spatial distance dependent Chinese restaurant processes for image segmentation</a></p>

In our experiments over a total of 52 3D scenes of homes and ofﬁces (composed from about 550 views, having 2495 segments labeled with 27 object classes), we get a performance of 84.06% in labeling 17 object classes for ofﬁces, and 73.38% in labeling 17 object classes for home scenes. Finally, we applied these algorithms successfully on a mobile robot for the task of ﬁnding objects in large cluttered rooms.1 1</p><p>2 0.79070675 <a title="227-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Learning_Higher-Order_Graph_Structure_with_Features_by_Structure_Penalty.html">146 nips-2011-Learning Higher-Order Graph Structure with Features by Structure Penalty</a></p>
<p>Author: Shilin Ding, Grace Wahba, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: In discrete undirected graphical models, the conditional independence of node labels Y is speciﬁed by the graph structure. We study the case where there is another input random vector X (e.g. observed features) such that the distribution P (Y | X) is determined by functions of X that characterize the (higher-order) interactions among the Y ’s. The main contribution of this paper is to learn the graph structure and the functions conditioned on X at the same time. We prove that discrete undirected graphical models with feature X are equivalent to multivariate discrete models. The reparameterization of the potential functions in graphical models by conditional log odds ratios of the latter offers advantages in representation of the conditional independence structure. The functional spaces can be ﬂexibly determined by kernels. Additionally, we impose a Structure Lasso (SLasso) penalty on groups of functions to learn the graph structure. These groups with overlaps are designed to enforce hierarchical function selection. In this way, we are able to shrink higher order interactions to obtain a sparse graph structure. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78642559 <a title="227-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image segmentation since for binary random ﬁeld representations of the image, it gives globally optimal results and there are efﬁcient polynomial time implementations. Often, the random ﬁeld is applied over a ﬂat partitioning of the image into non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show that if, instead of a ﬂat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding beneﬁts of global optimality and efﬁciency). As a result of such inference, the image gets partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the tree. We apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference on a segmentation tree (over a ﬂat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization in the pylon model is able to ﬂexibly choose the level of segmentation across the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.77983028 <a title="227-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Tree_of_Metrics_with_Disjoint_Visual_Features.html">151 nips-2011-Learning a Tree of Metrics with Disjoint Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Fei Sha, Sung J. Hwang</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an approach to learn discriminative visual representations while exploiting external semantic knowledge about object category relationships. Given a hierarchical taxonomy that captures semantic similarity between the objects, we learn a corresponding tree of metrics (ToM). In this tree, we have one metric for each non-leaf node of the object hierarchy, and each metric is responsible for discriminating among its immediate subcategory children. Speciﬁcally, a Mahalanobis metric learned for a given node must satisfy the appropriate (dis)similarity constraints generated only among its subtree members’ training instances. To further exploit the semantics, we introduce a novel regularizer coupling the metrics that prefers a sparse disjoint set of features to be selected for each metric relative to its ancestor (supercategory) nodes’ metrics. Intuitively, this reﬂects that visual cues most useful to distinguish the generic classes (e.g., feline vs. canine) should be different than those cues most useful to distinguish their component ﬁne-grained classes (e.g., Persian cat vs. Siamese cat). We validate our approach with multiple image datasets using the WordNet taxonomy, show its advantages over alternative metric learning approaches, and analyze the meaning of attribute features selected by our algorithm. 1</p><p>5 0.77773803 <a title="227-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Probabilistic_Joint_Image_Segmentation_and_Labeling.html">223 nips-2011-Probabilistic Joint Image Segmentation and Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Ion, Joao Carreira, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: We present a joint image segmentation and labeling model (JSL) which, given a bag of ﬁgure-ground segment hypotheses extracted at multiple image locations and scales, constructs a joint probability distribution over both the compatible image interpretations (tilings or image segmentations) composed from those segments, and over their labeling into categories. The process of drawing samples from the joint distribution can be interpreted as ﬁrst sampling tilings, modeled as maximal cliques, from a graph connecting spatially non-overlapping segments in the bag [1], followed by sampling labels for those segments, conditioned on the choice of a particular tiling. We learn the segmentation and labeling parameters jointly, based on Maximum Likelihood with a novel Incremental Saddle Point estimation procedure. The partition function over tilings and labelings is increasingly more accurately approximated by including incorrect conﬁgurations that a not-yet-competent model rates probable during learning. We show that the proposed methodology matches the current state of the art in the Stanford dataset [2], as well as in VOC2010, where 41.7% accuracy on the test set is achieved.</p><p>6 0.77543581 <a title="227-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-On_U-processes_and_clustering_performance.html">198 nips-2011-On U-processes and clustering performance</a></p>

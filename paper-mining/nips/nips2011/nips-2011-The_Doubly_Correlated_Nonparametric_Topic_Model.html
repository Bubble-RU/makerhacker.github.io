<p>Author: David Sontag, Dan Roy</p><p>Abstract: We consider the computational complexity of probabilistic inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). First, we study the problem of ﬁnding the maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment of topics to words, where the document’s topic distribution is integrated out. We show that, when the e↵ective number of topics per document is small, exact inference takes polynomial time. In contrast, we show that, when a document has a large number of topics, ﬁnding the MAP assignment of topics to words in LDA is NP-hard. Next, we consider the problem of ﬁnding the MAP topic distribution for a document, where the topic-word assignments are integrated out. We show that this problem is also NP-hard. Finally, we brieﬂy discuss the problem of sampling from the posterior, showing that this is NP-hard in one restricted setting, but leaving open the general question. 1</p><p>3 0.14435187 <a title="281-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Improving_Topic_Coherence_with_Regularized_Topic_Models.html">129 nips-2011-Improving Topic Coherence with Regularized Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: David Newman, Edwin V. Bonilla, Wray Buntine</p><p>Abstract: Topic models have the potential to improve search and browsing by extracting useful semantic themes from web pages and other text documents. When learned topics are coherent and interpretable, they can be valuable for faceted browsing, results set diversity analysis, and document retrieval. However, when dealing with small collections or noisy text (e.g. web search result snippets or blog posts), learned topics can be less coherent, less interpretable, and less useful. To overcome this, we propose two methods to regularize the learning of topic models. Our regularizers work by creating a structured prior over words that reﬂect broad patterns in the external data. Using thirteen datasets we show that both regularizers improve topic coherence and interpretability while learning a faithful representation of the collection of interest. Overall, this work makes topic models more useful across a broader range of text data. 1</p><p>4 0.12619823 <a title="281-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchically_Supervised_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">116 nips-2011-Hierarchically Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Adler J. Perotte, Frank Wood, Noemie Elhadad, Nicholas Bartlett</p><p>Abstract: We introduce hierarchically supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (HSLDA), a model for hierarchically and multiply labeled bag-of-word data. Examples of such data include web pages and their placement in directories, product descriptions and associated categories from product hierarchies, and free-text clinical records and their assigned diagnosis codes. Out-of-sample label prediction is the primary goal of this work, but improved lower-dimensional representations of the bagof-word data are also of interest. We demonstrate HSLDA on large-scale data from clinical document labeling and retail product categorization tasks. We show that leveraging the structure from hierarchical labels improves out-of-sample label prediction substantially when compared to models that do not. 1</p><p>5 0.1165048 <a title="281-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Learning_to_Learn_with_Compound_HD_Models.html">156 nips-2011-Learning to Learn with Compound HD Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Antonio Torralba, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce HD (or “Hierarchical-Deep”) models, a new compositional learning architecture that integrates deep learning models with structured hierarchical Bayesian models. Speciﬁcally we show how we can learn a hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) prior over the activities of the top-level features in a Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM). This compound HDP-DBM model learns to learn novel concepts from very few training examples, by learning low-level generic features, high-level features that capture correlations among low-level features, and a category hierarchy for sharing priors over the high-level features that are typical of different kinds of concepts. We present efﬁcient learning and inference algorithms for the HDP-DBM model and show that it is able to learn new concepts from very few examples on CIFAR-100 object recognition, handwritten character recognition, and human motion capture datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.10669572 <a title="281-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchical_Topic_Modeling_for_Analysis_of_Time-Evolving_Personal_Choices.html">115 nips-2011-Hierarchical Topic Modeling for Analysis of Time-Evolving Personal Choices</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin O. Larsson, Johan Ugander</p><p>Abstract: Latent variable mixture models are a powerful tool for exploring the structure in large datasets. A common challenge for interpreting such models is a desire to impose sparsity, the natural assumption that each data point only contains few latent features. Since mixture distributions are constrained in their L1 norm, typical sparsity techniques based on L1 regularization become toothless, and concave regularization becomes necessary. Unfortunately concave regularization typically results in EM algorithms that must perform problematic non-concave M-step maximizations. In this work, we introduce a technique for circumventing this difﬁculty, using the so-called Mountain Pass Theorem to provide easily veriﬁable conditions under which the M-step is well-behaved despite the lacking concavity. We also develop a correspondence between logarithmic regularization and what we term the pseudo-Dirichlet distribution, a generalization of the ordinary Dirichlet distribution well-suited for inducing sparsity. We demonstrate our approach on a text corpus, inferring a sparse topic mixture model for 2,406 weblogs. 1</p><p>5 0.65478897 <a title="281-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchically_Supervised_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">116 nips-2011-Hierarchically Supervised Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Recht, Christopher Re, Stephen Wright, Feng Niu</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular algorithm that can achieve stateof-the-art performance on a variety of machine learning tasks. Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performancedestroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called H OGWILD ! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other’s work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then H OGWILD ! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that H OGWILD ! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80549389 <a title="281-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-The_Doubly_Correlated_Nonparametric_Topic_Model.html">281 nips-2011-The Doubly Correlated Nonparametric Topic Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Guillaume Desjardins, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron C. Courville</p><p>Abstract: Markov Random Fields (MRFs) have proven very powerful both as density estimators and feature extractors for classiﬁcation. However, their use is often limited by an inability to estimate the partition function Z. In this paper, we exploit the gradient descent training procedure of restricted Boltzmann machines (a type of MRF) to track the log partition function during learning. Our method relies on two distinct sources of information: (1) estimating the change ∆Z incurred by each gradient update, (2) estimating the difference in Z over a small set of tempered distributions using bridge sampling. The two sources of information are then combined using an inference procedure similar to Kalman ﬁltering. Learning MRFs through Tempered Stochastic Maximum Likelihood, we can estimate Z using no more temperatures than are required for learning. Comparing to both exact values and estimates using annealed importance sampling (AIS), we show on several datasets that our method is able to accurately track the log partition function. In contrast to AIS, our method provides this estimate at each time-step, at a computational cost similar to that required for training alone. 1</p><p>4 0.71663725 <a title="281-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Exploiting_spatial_overlap_to_efficiently_compute_appearance_distances_between_image_windows.html">91 nips-2011-Exploiting spatial overlap to efficiently compute appearance distances between image windows</a></p>
<p>Author: Bogdan Alexe, Viviana Petrescu, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: We present a computationally efﬁcient technique to compute the distance of highdimensional appearance descriptor vectors between image windows. The method exploits the relation between appearance distance and spatial overlap. We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efﬁciently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as ﬁnding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or ﬁnding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18] and on hashing [21]. For example, our algorithm ﬁnds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average. 1</p><p>5 0.71610838 <a title="281-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Prismatic_Algorithm_for_Discrete_D.C._Programming_Problem.html">222 nips-2011-Prismatic Algorithm for Discrete D.C.

<p>Author: Yoshinobu Kawahara, Takashi Washio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst exact algorithm for minimizing the difference of two submodular functions (D.S.), i.e., the discrete version of the D.C. programming problem. The developed algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm which responds to the structure of this problem through the relationship between submodularity and convexity. The D.S. programming problem covers a broad range of applications in machine learning. In fact, this generalizes any set-function optimization. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the difference between exact and approximate solutions respectively obtained by the proposed and existing algorithms in feature selection and discriminative structure learning.</p><p>6 0.71558923 <a title="281-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_unbelievable_probabilities.html">158 nips-2011-Learning unbelievable probabilities</a></p>

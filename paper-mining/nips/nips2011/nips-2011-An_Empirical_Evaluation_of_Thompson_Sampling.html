[sent-5, score-0.343]
</p><p>2 We present here some empirical results using Thompson sampling on simulated and real data, and show that it is highly competitive. [sent-6, score-0.126]
</p><p>3 1  Introduction  Various algorithms have been proposed to solve exploration / exploitation or bandit problems. [sent-8, score-0.314]
</p><p>4 One of the most popular is Upper Conﬁdence Bound or UCB [7, 3], for which strong theoretical guarantees on the regret can be proved. [sent-9, score-0.225]
</p><p>5 The idea of Thompson sampling is to randomly draw each arm according to its probability of being optimal. [sent-14, score-0.24]
</p><p>6 In contrast to a full Bayesian method like Gittins index, one can often implement Thompson sampling efﬁciently. [sent-15, score-0.102]
</p><p>7 Recent results using Thompson sampling seem promising [5, 6, 14, 12]. [sent-16, score-0.102]
</p><p>8 In this work, we present some empirical results, ﬁrst on a simulated problem and then on two realworld ones: display advertisement selection and news article recommendation. [sent-19, score-0.285]
</p><p>9 In all cases, despite its simplicity, Thompson sampling achieves state-of-the-art results, and in some cases signiﬁcantly outperforms other alternatives like UCB. [sent-20, score-0.102]
</p><p>10 The ﬁndings suggest the necessity to include Thompson sampling as part of the standard baselines to compare against, and to develop ﬁnite-time regret bound for this empirically successful algorithm. [sent-21, score-0.357]
</p><p>11 2  Algorithm  The contextual bandit setting is as follows. [sent-22, score-0.114]
</p><p>12 After choosing an action a ∈ A, we observe a reward r. [sent-24, score-0.144]
</p><p>13 The goal is to ﬁnd a policy that selects actions such that the cumulative reward is as large as possible. [sent-25, score-0.189]
</p><p>14 Thompson sampling is best understood in a Bayesian setting as follows. [sent-26, score-0.102]
</p><p>15 1  In the realizable case, the reward is a stochastic function of the action, context and the unknown, true parameter θ∗ . [sent-29, score-0.118]
</p><p>16 If we are just interested in maximizing the immediate reward (exploitation), then one should choose the action that maximizes E(r|a, x) = E(r|a, x, θ)P (θ|D)dθ. [sent-32, score-0.144]
</p><p>17 But in an exploration / exploitation setting, the probability matching heuristic consists in randomly selecting an action a according to its probability of being optimal. [sent-33, score-0.288]
</p><p>18 , T do Receive context xt Draw θt according to P (θ|D) Select at = arg maxa Er (r|xt , a, θt ) Observe reward rt D = D ∪ (xt , at , rt ) end for In the standard K-armed Bernoulli bandit, each action corresponds to the choice of an arm. [sent-40, score-0.217]
</p><p>19 The ∗ reward of the i-th arm follows a Bernoulli distribution with mean θi . [sent-41, score-0.198]
</p><p>20 It is standard to model the mean reward of each arm using a Beta distribution since it is the conjugate distribution of the binomial distribution. [sent-42, score-0.198]
</p><p>21 The instantiation of Thompson sampling for the Bernoulli bandit is given in algorithm 2. [sent-43, score-0.216]
</p><p>22 Algorithm 2 Thompson sampling for the Bernoulli bandit Require: α, β prior parameters of a Beta distribution Si = 0, Fi = 0, ∀i. [sent-45, score-0.244]
</p><p>23 end for Draw arm ˆ = arg maxi θi and observe reward r ı if r = 1 then Sˆ = Sˆ + 1 ı ı else Fˆ = Fˆ + 1 ı ı end if end for  3  Simulations  We present some simulation results with Thompson sampling for the Bernoulli bandit problem and compare them to the UCB algorithm. [sent-53, score-0.434]
</p><p>24 The reward probability of each of the K arms is modeled by a Beta distribution which is updated after an arm is selected (see algorithm 2). [sent-54, score-0.262]
</p><p>25 Speciﬁcally, we chose the arm for which the following upper 2  conﬁdence bound [8, page 278] is maximum: k 2 m log m  k + m  1 δ  +  2 log 1 δ , m  1 , t  δ=  (1)  where m is the number of times the arm has been selected and k its total reward. [sent-57, score-0.262]
</p><p>26 In this simulation, the best arm has a reward probability of 0. [sent-59, score-0.198]
</p><p>27 The regret as a function of T for various settings is plotted in ﬁgure 1. [sent-63, score-0.225]
</p><p>28 An asymptotic lower bound has been established in [7] for the regret of a bandit algorithm: K  R(T ) ≥ log(T ) i=1  p∗ − pi + o(1) , D(pi ||p∗ )  (2)  where pi is the reward probability of the i-th arm, p∗ = max pi and D is the Kullback-Leibler divergence. [sent-64, score-0.636]
</p><p>29 The plots in ﬁgure 1 show that the regrets are indeed logarithmic in T (the linear trend on the right hand side) and it turns out that the observed constants (slope of the lines) are close to the optimal constants given by the lower bound (2). [sent-66, score-0.116]
</p><p>30 1 10000  900 800 700  Thompson UCB Asymptotic lower bound  Thompson UCB Asymptotic lower bound  8000  Regret  Regret  600 500 400  6000  4000  300 200  2000  100 0 2 10  3  4  10  5  10 T  0 2 10  6  10  10  K=10, ε=0. [sent-71, score-0.122]
</p><p>31 As with any Bayesian algorithm, one can wonder about the robustness of Thompson sampling to prior mismatch. [sent-78, score-0.13]
</p><p>32 In particular, when the reward probability of the best arm is 0. [sent-83, score-0.198]
</p><p>33 We can thus conclude that in these simulations, Thompson sampling is asymptotically optimal and achieves a smaller regret than the popular UCB algorithm. [sent-86, score-0.351]
</p><p>34 Optimistic Thompson sampling The intuition behind UCB and Thompson sampling is that, for the purpose of exploration, it is beneﬁcial to boost the predictions of actions for which we are uncertain. [sent-88, score-0.227]
</p><p>35 But Thompson sampling modiﬁes the predictions in both directions and there is apparently no beneﬁt in decreasing a prediction. [sent-89, score-0.102]
</p><p>36 This observation led to a recently proposed algorithm called Optimistic Bayesian sampling [11] in which the modiﬁed score is never smaller than the mean. [sent-90, score-0.102]
</p><p>37 Simulations in [12] showed some gains using this optimistic version of Thompson sampling. [sent-92, score-0.112]
</p><p>38 A possible explanation is that when the number of arms is large, it is likely that, in standard Thompson sampling, the selected arm has a already a boosted score. [sent-96, score-0.165]
</p><p>39 Posterior reshaping Thompson sampling is a heuristic advocating to draw samples from the posterior, but one might consider changing that heuristic to draw samples from a modiﬁed distribution. [sent-97, score-0.258]
</p><p>40 In particular, sharpening the posterior would have the effect of increasing exploitation while widening it would favor exploration. [sent-98, score-0.155]
</p><p>41 Figure 3 shows the average and distribution of regret for different values of α. [sent-101, score-0.225]
</p><p>42 Values of α smaller than 1 decrease the amount of exploration and often result in lower regret. [sent-102, score-0.13]
</p><p>43 But the price to pay is a higher variance: in some runs, the regret is very large. [sent-103, score-0.225]
</p><p>44 The average regret is asymptotically not as good as with α = 1, but tends to be better in the non-asymptotic regime. [sent-104, score-0.249]
</p><p>45 Impact of delay In a real world system, the feedback is typically not processed immediately because of various runtime constraints. [sent-105, score-0.12]
</p><p>46 We now try to quantify the impact of this delay by doing some simulations that mimic the problem of news articles recommendation [9] that will be described in section 5. [sent-107, score-0.302]
</p><p>47 25  T  Figure 3: Thompson sampling where the parameters of the Beta posterior distribution have been divided by α. [sent-112, score-0.156]
</p><p>48 Table 1: Inﬂuence of the delay: regret when the feedback is provided every δ steps. [sent-117, score-0.255]
</p><p>49 Table 1 shows the average regret (over 100 repetitions) of Thompson sampling and UCB at T = 106 . [sent-129, score-0.327]
</p><p>50 An interesting quantity in this simulation is the relative regret of UCB and Thompson sampling. [sent-130, score-0.245]
</p><p>51 It appears that Thompson sampling is more robust than UCB when the delay is long. [sent-131, score-0.192]
</p><p>52 Thompson sampling alleviates the inﬂuence of delayed feedback by randomizing over actions; on the other hand, UCB is deterministic and suffers a larger regret in case of a sub-optimal choice. [sent-132, score-0.377]
</p><p>53 Given a user visiting a publisher page, the problem is to select the best advertisement for that user. [sent-134, score-0.145]
</p><p>54 A key element in this matching problem is the click-through rate (CTR) estimation: what is the probability that a given ad will be clicked given some context (user, page visited)? [sent-135, score-0.19]
</p><p>55 Indeed, in a cost-per-click (CPC) campaign, the advertiser only pays when his ad gets clicked. [sent-136, score-0.158]
</p><p>56 There is of course a fundamental exploration / exploitation dilemma here: in order to learn the CTR of an ad, it needs to be displayed, leading to a potential loss of short-term revenue. [sent-138, score-0.2]
</p><p>57 {Each weight wi has an independent prior N (mi , qi )} for t = 1, . [sent-151, score-0.107]
</p><p>58 Find w as the minimizer of: mi = wi  1 2  d  n  qi (wi − mi )2 + i=1  log(1 + exp(−yj w xj )). [sent-158, score-0.139]
</p><p>59 j=1  n  x2 pj (1 − pj ), pj = (1 + exp(−w xj ))−1 {Laplace approximation} ij  qi = qi + j=1  end for Evaluating an explore / exploit policy is difﬁcult because we typically do not know the reward of an action that was not chosen. [sent-159, score-0.427]
</p><p>60 A possible solution, as we shall see in section 5, is to use a replayer in which previous, randomized exploration data can be used to produce an unbiased ofﬂine estimator of the new policy [10]. [sent-160, score-0.207]
</p><p>61 [15] studies another promising approach using the idea of importance weighting, but the method applies only when the policy is static, which is not the case for online bandit algorithms that constantly adapt to its history. [sent-162, score-0.162]
</p><p>62 More precisely, the context and the ads are real, but the clicks are simulated using a weight vector w∗ . [sent-164, score-0.191]
</p><p>63 About 13,000 contexts, representing a small random subset of the total trafﬁc, are presented every hour to the policy which has to choose an ad among a set of eligible ads. [sent-167, score-0.276]
</p><p>64 The number of eligible ads for each context depends on numerous constraints set by the advertiser and the publisher. [sent-168, score-0.184]
</p><p>65 Note that in this experiment, the number of eligible ads is smaller than what we would observe in live trafﬁc because we restricted the set of advertisers. [sent-170, score-0.115]
</p><p>66 A feature vector is constructed for every (context, ad) pair and the policy decides which ad to show. [sent-172, score-0.158]
</p><p>67 A click for that ad is then generated with probability (1 + exp(−w∗ x))−1 . [sent-173, score-0.148]
</p><p>68 The total number of clicks received during this one hour period is the reward. [sent-175, score-0.147]
</p><p>69 These strategies are: Thompson sampling This is algorithm 1 where each weight is drawn independently according to −1 its Gaussian posterior approximation N (mi , qi ) (see algorithm 3). [sent-178, score-0.235]
</p><p>70 It selects the ad based on mean and standard deviation. [sent-184, score-0.11]
</p><p>71 It also has a factor α to control the exploration / exploitation trade-off. [sent-185, score-0.2]
</p><p>72 More precisely, LinUCB selects the ad for which d i=1  d  −1 2 mi xi + α i=1 qi xi is maximum. [sent-186, score-0.207]

</p><p>75 ε-greedy Mix between exploitation and random: with ε probability, select a random ad; otherwise, select the one with the highest mean. [sent-221, score-0.155]
</p><p>76 Thompson sampling achieves the best regret and interestingly the modiﬁed version with α = 0. [sent-227, score-0.327]
</p><p>77 Also, the fact that exploit-only is so much better than random might explain why ε-greedy does not beat it: whenever this strategy chooses a random action, it suffers a large regret in average which is not compensated by its exploration beneﬁt. [sent-233, score-0.324]
</p><p>78 Finally ﬁgure 4 shows the regret of three algorithms across time. [sent-234, score-0.225]
</p><p>79 As expected, the regret has a decreasing trend over time. [sent-235, score-0.225]
</p><p>80 5  News Article Recommendation  In this section, we consider another application of Thompson sampling in personalized news article recommendation on Yahoo! [sent-236, score-0.38]
</p><p>81 Each time a user visits the portal, a news article out of a small pool of hand-picked candidates is recommended. [sent-238, score-0.32]
</p><p>82 The candidate pool is dynamic: old articles may retire and new articles may be added in. [sent-239, score-0.165]
</p><p>83 The goal is to choose the most interesting article to users, or formally, maximize the total number of clicks on the recommended articles. [sent-241, score-0.213]
</p><p>84 In this case, we treat articles as arms, and deﬁne the payoff to be 1 if the article is clicked on and 0 otherwise. [sent-242, score-0.241]
</p><p>85 2 1  10  30  60 Delay (min)  Figure 5: Normalized CTRs of various algorithm on the news article recommendation data with different update delays: {10, 30, 60} minutes. [sent-252, score-0.254]
</p><p>86 Each user was associated with a binary raw feature vector of over 1000 dimension, which indicates information of the user like age, gender, geographical location, behavioral targeting, etc. [sent-254, score-0.116]
</p><p>87 Here, we adopted the simpler principal component analysis (PCA), which did not appear to affect the bandit algorithms much in our experience. [sent-257, score-0.114]
</p><p>88 We use logistic regression, as in Algorithm 3, to model article CTRs: given a user feature vector x ∈ 21 , the probability of click on an article a is (1 + exp(−x wa ))−1 for some weight vector wa ∈ 21 to be learned. [sent-261, score-0.432]
</p><p>89 Furthermore, given the size of data, we have not found article features to be helpful. [sent-264, score-0.135]
</p><p>90 Indeed, it is shown in our previous work [9, Figure 5] that article features are helpful in this domain only when data are highly sparse. [sent-265, score-0.135]
</p><p>91 Given the small size of candidate pool, we adopt the unbiased ofﬂine evaluation method of [10] to compare various bandit algorithms. [sent-266, score-0.139]
</p><p>92 In particular, we collected randomized serving events for a random fraction of user visits; in other words, these random users were recommended an article chosen uniformly from the candidate pool. [sent-267, score-0.307]
</p><p>93 From 7 days in June 2009, over 34M randomized serving events were obtained. [sent-268, score-0.113]
</p><p>94 In contrast, randomized algorithms are more robust to delay, and when there is a one-hour delay, (optimistic) Thompson sampling is signiﬁcant better than others (given the size of our data). [sent-274, score-0.137]
</p><p>95 6  Conclusion  The extensive experimental evaluation carried out in this paper reveals that Thompson sampling is a very effective heuristic for addressing the exploration / exploitation trade-off. [sent-275, score-0.343]
</p><p>96 In its simplest form, it does not have any parameter to tune, but our results show that tweaking the posterior to reduce exploration can be beneﬁcial. [sent-276, score-0.185]
</p><p>97 First, it would hopefully contribute to make Thompson sampling as popular as other algorithms for which regret bounds exist. [sent-281, score-0.327]

In particular, we show that a simple modiﬁcation of Auer’s UCB algorithm (Auer, 2002) achieves with high probability constant regret. More importantly, we modify and, consequently, improve the analysis of the algorithm for the for linear stochastic bandit problem studied by Auer (2002), Dani et al. (2008), Rusmevichientong and Tsitsiklis (2010), Li et al. (2010). Our modiﬁcation improves the regret bound by a logarithmic factor, though experiments show a vast improvement. In both cases, the improvement stems from the construction of smaller conﬁdence sets. For their construction we use a novel tail inequality for vector-valued martingales. 1</p><p>3 0.20986629 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_the_State-Representation_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">245 nips-2011-Selecting the State-Representation in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Daniil Ryabko, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past observations to a ﬁnite set) of the observations are given, and it is known that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that, with a regret of order T 2/3 where T is the horizon time. 1</p><p>4 0.17577206 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Committing_Bandits.html">56 nips-2011-Committing Bandits</a></p>
<p>Author: Loc X. Bui, Ramesh Johari, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit problem where there are two phases. The ﬁrst phase is an experimentation phase where the decision maker is free to explore multiple options. In the second phase the decision maker has to commit to one of the arms and stick with it. Cost is incurred during both phases with a higher cost during the experimentation phase.

<p>Author: Andreas Krause, Cheng S. Ong</p><p>Abstract: How should we design experiments to maximize performance of a complex system, taking into account uncontrollable environmental conditions? How should we select relevant documents (ads) to display, given information about the user? These tasks can be formalized as contextual bandit problems, where at each round, we receive context (about the experimental conditions, the query), and have to choose an action (parameters, documents). The key challenge is to trade off exploration by gathering data for estimating the mean payoff function over the context-action space, and to exploit by choosing an action deemed optimal based on the gathered data. We model the payoff function as a sample from a Gaussian process deﬁned over the joint context-action space, and develop CGP-UCB, an intuitive upper-conﬁdence style algorithm. We show that by mixing and matching kernels for contexts and actions, CGP-UCB can handle a variety of practical applications. We further provide generic tools for deriving regret bounds when using such composite kernel functions. Lastly, we evaluate our algorithm on two case studies, in the context of automated vaccine design and sensor management. We show that context-sensitive optimization outperforms no or naive use of context. 1</p><p>6 0.15035516 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Prediction_strategies_without_loss.html">220 nips-2011-Prediction strategies without loss</a></p>

<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Daniil Ryabko, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past observations to a ﬁnite set) of the observations are given, and it is known that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that, with a regret of order T 2/3 where T is the horizon time. 1</p><p>3 0.77773905 <a title="32-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Committing_Bandits.html">56 nips-2011-Committing Bandits</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ohad Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We consider an adversarial online learning setting where a decision maker can choose an action in every stage of the game. In addition to observing the reward of the chosen action, the decision maker gets side observations on the reward he would have obtained had he chosen some of the other actions. The observation structure is encoded as a graph, where node i is linked to node j if sampling i provides information on the reward of j. This setting naturally interpolates between the well-known “experts” setting, where the decision maker can view all rewards, and the multi-armed bandits setting, where the decision maker can only view the reward of the chosen action. We develop practical algorithms with provable regret guarantees, which depend on non-trivial graph-theoretic properties of the information feedback structure. We also provide partially-matching lower bounds. 1</p><p>6 0.68628973 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Finite_Time_Analysis_of_Stratified_Sampling_for_Monte_Carlo.html">97 nips-2011-Finite Time Analysis of Stratified Sampling for Monte Carlo</a></p>

<p>Author: Jakob H. Macke, Lars Buesing, John P. Cunningham, Byron M. Yu, Krishna V. Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Neurons in the neocortex code and compute as part of a locally interconnected population. Large-scale multi-electrode recording makes it possible to access these population processes empirically by ﬁtting statistical models to unaveraged data. What statistical structure best describes the concurrent spiking of cells within a local network? We argue that in the cortex, where ﬁring exhibits extensive correlations in both time and space and where a typical sample of neurons still reﬂects only a very small fraction of the local population, the most appropriate model captures shared variability by a low-dimensional latent process evolving with smooth dynamics, rather than by putative direct coupling. We test this claim by comparing a latent dynamical model with realistic spiking observations to coupled generalised linear spike-response models (GLMs) using cortical recordings. We ﬁnd that the latent dynamical approach outperforms the GLM in terms of goodness-ofﬁt, and reproduces the temporal correlations in the data more accurately. We also compare models whose observations models are either derived from a Gaussian or point-process models, ﬁnding that the non-Gaussian model provides slightly better goodness-of-ﬁt and more realistic population spike counts. 1</p><p>3 0.81198335 <a title="32-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Improved_Algorithms_for_Linear_Stochastic_Bandits.html">128 nips-2011-Improved Algorithms for Linear Stochastic Bandits</a></p>

While many works have been carried out in generalizing Hilbert methods to Banach spaces, in this paper, we consider the simple problem of learning a Parzen window classiﬁer in a reproducing kernel Banach space (RKBS)—which is closely related to the notion of embedding probability measures into an RKBS—in order to carefully understand its pros and cons over the Hilbert space classiﬁer.

<p>Author: Matthias S. Keil</p><p>Abstract: Many species show avoidance reactions in response to looming object approaches. In locusts, the corresponding escape behavior correlates with the activity of the lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) neuron. During an object approach, its ﬁring rate was reported to gradually increase until a peak is reached, and then it declines quickly. The η-function predicts that the LGMD activity is a product ˙ between an exponential function of angular size exp(−Θ) and angular velocity Θ, and that peak activity is reached before time-to-contact (ttc). The η-function has become the prevailing LGMD model because it reproduces many experimental observations, and even experimental evidence for the multiplicative operation was reported. Several inconsistencies remain unresolved, though. Here we address ˙ these issues with a new model (ψ-model), which explicitly connects Θ and Θ to biophysical quantities. The ψ-model avoids biophysical problems associated with implementing exp(·), implements the multiplicative operation of η via divisive inhibition, and explains why activity peaks could occur after ttc. It consistently predicts response features of the LGMD, and provides excellent ﬁts to published experimental data, with goodness of ﬁt measures comparable to corresponding ﬁts with the η-function. 1 Introduction: τ and η Collision sensitive neurons were reported in species such different as monkeys [5, 4], pigeons [36, 34], frogs [16, 20], and insects [33, 26, 27, 10, 38]. This indicates a high ecological relevance, and raises the question about how neurons compute a signal that eventually triggers corresponding movement patterns (e.g. escape behavior or interceptive actions). Here, we will focus on visual stimulation. Consider, for simplicity, a circular object (diameter 2l), which approaches the eye at a collision course with constant velocity v. If we do not have any a priori knowledge about the object in question (e.g. its typical size or speed), then we will be able to access only two information sources. These information sources can be measured at the retina and are called optical variables (OVs). The ﬁrst is the visual angle Θ, which can be derived from the number of stimulated photore˙ ˙ ceptors (spatial contrast). The second is its rate of change dΘ(t)/dt ≡ Θ(t). Angular velocity Θ is related to temporal contrast. ˙ How should we combine Θ and Θ in order to track an imminent collision? The perhaps simplest ˙ combination is τ (t) ≡ Θ(t)/Θ(t) [13, 18]. If the object hit us at time tc , then τ (t) ≈ tc − t will ∗ Also: www.ir3c.ub.edu, Research Institute for Brain, Cognition, and Behaviour (IR3C) Ediﬁci de Ponent, Campus Mundet, Universitat de Barcelona, Passeig Vall d’Hebron, 171. E-08035 Barcelona 1 give us a running estimation of the time that is left until contact1 . Moreover, we do not need to know anything about the approaching object: The ttc estimation computed by τ is practically independent of object size and velocity. Neurons with τ -like responses were indeed identiﬁed in the nucleus retundus of the pigeon brain [34]. In humans, only fast interceptive actions seem to rely exclusively on τ [37, 35]. Accurate ttc estimation, however, seems to involve further mechanisms (rate of disparity change [31]). ˙ Another function of OVs with biological relevance is η ≡ Θ exp(−αΘ), with α = const. [10]. While η-type neurons were found again in pigeons [34] and bullfrogs [20], most data were gathered from the LGMD2 in locusts (e.g. [10, 9, 7, 23]). The η-function is a phenomenological model for the LGMD, and implies three principal hypothesis: (i) An implementation of an exponential function exp(·). Exponentation is thought to take place in the LGMD axon, via active membrane conductances [8]. Experimental data, though, seem to favor a third-power law rather than exp(·). (ii) The LGMD carries out biophysical computations for implementing the multiplicative operation. It has been suggested that multiplication is done within the LGMD itself, by subtracting the loga˙ rithmically encoded variables log Θ − αΘ [10, 8]. (iii) The peak of the η-function occurs before ˆ ttc, at visual angle Θ(t) = 2 arctan(1/α) [9]. It follows ttc for certain stimulus conﬁgurations (e.g. ˆ l/|v| 5ms). In principle, t > tc can be accounted for by η(t + δ) with a ﬁxed delay δ < 0 (e.g. −27ms). But other researchers observed that LGMD activity continuous to rise after ttc even for l/|v| 5ms [28]. These discrepancies remain unexplained so far [29], but stimulation dynamics perhaps plays a role. We we will address these three issues by comparing the novel function “ψ” with the η-function. LGMD computations with the ψ-function: No multiplication, no exponentiation 2 A circular object which starts its approach at distance x0 and with speed v projects a visual angle Θ(t) = 2 arctan[l/(x0 − vt)] on the retina [34, 9]. The kinematics is hence entirely speciﬁed by the ˙ half-size-to-velocity ratio l/|v|, and x0 . Furthermore, Θ(t) = 2lv/((x0 − vt)2 + l2 ). In order to deﬁne ψ, we consider at ﬁrst the LGMD neuron as an RC-circuit with membrane potential3 V [17] dV Cm = β (Vrest − V ) + gexc (Vexc − V ) + ginh (Vinh − V ) (1) dt 4 Cm = membrane capacity ; β ≡ 1/Rm denotes leakage conductance across the cell membrane (Rm : membrane resistance); gexc and ginh are excitatory and inhibitory inputs. Each conductance gi (i = exc, inh ) can drive the membrane potential to its associated reversal potential Vi (usually Vinh ≤ Vexc ). Shunting inhibition means Vinh = Vrest . Shunting inhibition lurks “silently” because it gets effective only if the neuron is driven away from its resting potential. With synaptic input, the neuron decays into its equilibrium state Vrest β + Vexc gexc + Vinh ginh V∞ ≡ (2) β + gexc + ginh according to V (t) = V∞ (1 − exp(−t/τm )). Without external input, V (t 1) → Vrest . The time scale is set by τm . Without synaptic input τm ≡ Cm /β. Slowly varying inputs gexc , ginh > 0 modify the time scale to approximately τm /(1 + (gexc + ginh )/β). For highly dynamic inputs, such as in late phase of the object approach, the time scale gets dynamical as well. The ψ-model assigns synaptic inputs5 ˙ ˙ ˙ ˙ gexc (t) = ϑ(t), ϑ(t) = ζ1 ϑ(t − ∆tstim ) + (1 − ζ1 )Θ(t) (3a) e ginh (t) = [γϑ(t)] , ϑ(t) = ζ0 ϑ(t − ∆tstim ) + (1 − ζ0 )Θ(t) 1 (3b) This linear approximation gets worse with increasing Θ, but turns out to work well until short before ttc (τ adopts a minimum at tc − 0.428978 · l/|v|). 2 LGMD activity is usually monitored via its postsynaptic neuron, the Descending Contralateral Movement Detector (DCMD) neuron. This represents no problem as LGMD spikes follow DCMD spikes 1:1 under visual stimulation [22] from 300Hz [21] to at least 400Hz [24]. 3 Here we assume that the membrane potential serves as a predictor for the LGMD’s mean ﬁring rate. 4 Set to unity for all simulations. 5 LGMD receives also inhibition from a laterally acting network [21]. The η-function considers only direct feedforward inhibition [22, 6], and so do we. 2 Θ ∈ [7.63Â°, 180.00Â°[ temporal resolution ∆ tstim=1.0ms l/|v|=20.00ms, β=1.00, γ=7.50, e=3.00, ζ0=0.90, ζ1=0.99, nrelax=25 0.04 scaled dΘ/dt continuous discretized 0.035 0.03 Θ(t) (input) ϑ(t) (filtered) voltage V(t) (output) t = 56ms max t =300ms c 0.025 0 10 2 η(t): α=3.29, R =1.00 n =10 → t =37ms log Θ(t) amplitude relax max 0.02 0.015 0.01 0.005 0 −0.005 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 −0.01 0 350 time [ms] 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 time [ms] (b) ψ versus η (a) discretized optical variables Figure 1: (a) The continuous visual angle of an approaching object is shown along with its discretized version.

For continuous optical variables, the peak would occur 4ms earlier, and η would have α = 4.44 with R2 = 1.

Line ﬁts with slope α and intercept δ were added (lines). The predicted linear relationship in all cases is consistent with experimental evidence [9]. (a) The stimulus time scale is held constant at ∆tstim = 1ms, and several LGMD time scales are deﬁned by nrelax (= number of intercalated relaxation steps for each integration time step). Bigger values of nrelax move V (t) closer to its equilibrium V∞ (t), implying higher slopes α in turn. (b) LGMD time scale is ﬁxed at nrelax = 25, and ∆tstim is manipulated. Because of the discretization of optical variables (OVs) in our simulation, increasing ∆tstim translates to an overall smaller number of jumps in OVs, but each with higher amplitude. Thus, we say ψ(t) ≡ V (t) if and only if gexc and ginh are deﬁned with the last equation. The time ˙ scale of stimulation is deﬁned by ∆tstim (by default 1ms). The variables ϑ and ϑ are lowpass ﬁltered angular size and rate of expansion, respectively. The amount of ﬁltering is deﬁned by memory constants ζ0 and ζ1 (no ﬁltering if zero). The idea is to continue with generating synaptic input ˙ after ttc, where Θ(t > tc ) = const and thus Θ(t > tc ) = 0. Inhibition is ﬁrst weighted by γ, and then potentiated by the exponent e. Hodgkin-Huxley potentiates gating variables n, m ∈ [0, 1] instead (potassium ∝ n4 , sodium ∝ m3 , [12]) and multiplies them with conductances. Gabbiani and co-workers found that the function which transforms membrane potential to ﬁring rate is better described by a power function with e = 3 than by exp(·) (Figure 4d in [8]). 3 Dynamics of the ψ-function 3 Discretization. In a typical experiment, a monitor is placed a short distance away from the insect’s eye, and an approaching object is displayed. Computer screens have a ﬁxed spatial resolution, and as a consequence size increments of the displayed object proceed in discrete jumps. The locust retina is furthermore composed of a discrete array of ommatidia units. We therefore can expect a corresponding step-wise increment of Θ with time, although optical and neuronal ﬁltering may ˙ smooth Θ to some extent again, resulting in ϑ (ﬁgure 1). Discretization renders Θ discontinuous, ˙ For simulating the dynamics of ψ, we discretized angular size what again will be alleviated in ϑ. ˙ with ﬂoor(Θ), and Θ(t) ≈ [Θ(t + ∆tstim ) − Θ(t)]/∆tstim . Discretized optical variables (OVs) were re-normalized to match the range of original (i.e. continuous) OVs. To peak, or not to peak? Rind & Simmons reject the hypothesis that the activity peak signals impending collision on grounds of two arguments [28]: (i) If Θ(t + ∆tstim ) − Θ(t) 3o in consecutively displayed stimulus frames, the illusion of an object approach would be lost. Such stimulation would rather be perceived as a sequence of rapidly appearing (but static) objects, causing reduced responses. (ii) After the last stimulation frame has been displayed (that is Θ = const), LGMD responses keep on building up beyond ttc. This behavior clearly depends on l/|v|, also according to their own data (e.g. Figure 4 in [26]): Response build up after ttc is typically observed for sufﬁ˙ ciently small values of l/|v|. Input into ψ in situations where Θ = const and Θ = 0, respectively, ˙ is accommodated by ϑ and ϑ, respectively. We simulated (i) by setting ∆tstim = 5ms, thus producing larger and more infrequent jumps in discrete OVs than with ∆tstim = 1ms (default). As a consequence, ϑ(t) grows more slowly (deˆ layed build up of inhibition), and the peak occurs later (tmax ≡ tc − t = 10ms with everything else ˆ ˆ identical with ﬁgure 1b). The peak amplitude V = V (t) decreases nearly sixfold with respect to default. Our model thus predicts the reduced responses observed by Rind & Simmons [28]. Linearity. Time of peak ﬁring rate is linearly related to l/|v| [10, 9]. The η-function is consistent ˆ with this experimental evidence: t = tc − αl/|v| + δ (e.g. α = 4.7, δ = −27ms). The ψ-function reproduces this relationship as well (ﬁgure 2), where α depends critically on the time scale of biophysical processes in the LGMD. We studied the impact of this time scale by choosing 10µs for the numerical integration of equation 1 (algorithm: 4th order Runge-Kutta). Apart from improving the numerical stability of the integration algorithm, ψ is far from its equilibrium V∞ (t) in every moment ˙ t, given the stimulation time scale ∆tstim = 1ms 6 . Now, at each value of Θ(t) and Θ(t), respectively, we intercalated nrelax iterations for integrating ψ. Each iteration takes V (t) asymptotically closer to V∞ (t), and limnrelax 1 V (t) = V∞ (t). If the internal processes in the LGMD cannot keep up with stimulation (nrelax = 0), we obtain slopes values that underestimate experimentally found values (ﬁgure 2a). In contrast, for nrelax 25 we get an excellent agreement with the experimentally determined α. This means that – under the reported experimental stimulation conditions (e.g. [9]) – the LGMD would operate relatively close to its steady state7 . Now we ﬁx nrelax at 25 and manipulate ∆tstim instead (ﬁgure 2b). The default value ∆tstim = 1ms corresponds to α = 3.91. Slightly bigger values of ∆tstim (2.5ms and 5ms) underestimate the experimental α. In addition, the line ﬁts also return smaller intercept values then. We see tmax < 0 up to l/|v| ≈ 13.5ms – LGMD activity peaks after ttc! Or, in other words, LGMD activity continues to increase after ttc. In the limit, where stimulus dynamics is extremely fast, and LGMD processes are kept far from equilibrium at each instant of the approach, α gets very small. As a consequence, tmax gets largely independent of l/|v|: The activity peak would cling to tmax although we varied l/|v|. 4 Freeze! Experimental data versus steady state of “psi” In the previous section, experimentally plausible values for α were obtained if ψ is close to equilibrium at each instant of time during stimulation. In this section we will thus introduce a steady-state 6 Assuming one ∆tstim for each integration time step. This means that by default stimulation and biophysical dynamics will proceed at identical time scales. 7 Notice that in this moment we can only make relative statements - we do not have data at hand for deﬁning absolute time scales 4 tc=500ms, v=2.00m/s ψ∞ → (β varies), γ=3.50, e=3.00, Vinh=−0.001 tc=500ms, v=2.00m/s ψ∞ → β=2.50, γ=3.50, (e varies), Vinh=−0.001 300 tc=500ms, v=2.00m/s ψ∞ → β=2.50, (γ varies), e=3.00, Vinh=−0.001 350 300 β=10.00 β=5.00 norm. rmse = 0.058...0.153 correlation (β,α)=−0.90 (n=4) ∞ β=1.00 e=4.00 norm. |η−ψ | = 0.009...0.114 e=3.00 300 norm. rmse = 0.014...0.160 correlation (e,α)=0.98 (n=4) ∞ e=2.50 250 250 norm. |η−ψ | = 0.043...0.241 ∞ norm. rmse = 0.085...0.315 correlation (γ,α)=1.00 (n=5) 150 tmax [ms] 200 tmax [ms] 200 tmax [ms] γ=5.00 γ=2.50 γ=1.00 γ=0.50 γ=0.25 e=5.00 norm. |η−ψ | = 0.020...0.128 β=2.50 250 200 150 100 150 100 100 50 50 50 0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 0 5 50 10 15 20 l/|v| [ms] 25 30 35 40 45 0 5 50 10 15 20 l/|v| [ms] (a) β varies 25 30 35 40 45 50 l/|v| [ms] (b) e varies (c) γ varies ˆ ˆ Figure 3: Each curve shows how the peak ψ∞ ≡ ψ∞ (t) depends on the half-size-to-velocity ratio.

It visualizes the time averaged absolute difference between normalized ψ∞ (t) & normalized η(t). For η, its value of α was chosen such that the maxima of both functions coincide. Although not being a ﬁt, it gives a rough estimate on how the shape of both curves deviate from each other. The maximum possible difference would be one. version of ψ (i.e. equation 2 with Vrest = 0, Vexc = 1, and equations 3 plugged in), ψ∞ (t) ≡ e ˙ Θ(t) + Vinh [γΘ(t)] e ˙ β + Θ(t) + [γΘ(t)] (4) (Here we use continuous versions of angular size and rate of expansion). The ψ∞ -function makes life easier when it comes to ﬁtting experimental data. However, it has its limitations, because we brushed the whole dynamic of ψ under the carpet. Figure 3 illustrates how the linˆ ear relationship (=“linearity”) between tmax ≡ tc − t and l/|v| is inﬂuenced by changes in parameter values. Changing any of the values of e, β, γ predominantly causes variation in line slopes. The smallest slope changes are obtained by varying Vinh (data not shown; we checked Vinh = 0, −0.001, −0.01, −0.1). For Vinh −0.01, linearity is getting slightly compromised, as slope increases with l/|v| (e.g. Vinh = −1 α ∈ [4.2, 4.7]). In order to get a notion about how well the shape of ψ∞ (t) matches η(t), we computed timeaveraged difference measures between normalized versions of both functions (details: ﬁgure 3 & 4). Bigger values of β match η better at smaller, but worse at bigger values of l/|v| (ﬁgure 4a). Smaller β cause less variation across l/|v|. As to variation of e, overall curve shapes seem to be best aligned with e = 3 to e = 4 (ﬁgure 4b). Furthermore, better matches between ψ∞ (t) and η(t) correspond to bigger values of γ (ﬁgure 4c). And ﬁnally, Vinh marches again to a different tune (data not shown). Vinh = −0.1 leads to the best agreement (≈ 0.04 across l/|v|) of all Vinh , quite different from the other considered values. For the rest, ψ∞ (t) and η(t) align the same (all have maximum 0.094), 5 ˙ (a) Θ = 126o /s ˙ (b) Θ = 63o /s Figure 5: The original data (legend label “HaGaLa95”) were resampled from ref.

The η-function (ﬁtting function: Aη(t+δ)+o) and ψ∞ (ﬁtting function: Aψ∞ (t)+o) were ﬁtted to these data: (a) (Figure 3 Di in [10]) Good ﬁts for ψ∞ are obtained with e = 5 or higher (e = 3 R2 = 0.35 and rmse = 0.644; e = 4 R2 = 0.45 and rmse = 0.592). “Psi” adopts a sigmoid-like curve form which (subjectively) appears to ﬁt the original data better than η.

The spike trace (sampled at 104 Hz) was full wave rectiﬁed, lowpass ﬁltered, and sub-sampled to 1ms resolution. Firing rate was estimated with Savitzky-Golay ﬁltering (“sgolay”). The ﬁts of the η-function (Aη(t + δ) + o; 4 coefﬁcients) and ψ∞ -function (Aψ∞ (t) with ﬁxed e, o, δ, Vinh ; 3 coefﬁcients) provide both excellent ﬁts to ﬁring rate. (b) Fitting coefﬁcient α (→ η-function) inversely correlates with β (→ ψ∞ ) when ﬁtting ﬁring rates of another 5 trials as just described (continuous line = line ﬁt to the data points). Similar correlation values would be obtained if e is ﬁxed at values e = 2.5, 4, 5 c = −0.95, −0.96, −0.91. If o was determined by the ﬁtting algorithm, then c = −0.70. No clear correlations with α were obtained for γ. despite of covering different orders of magnitude with Vinh = 0, −0.001, −0.01. Decelerating approach. Hatsopoulos et al. [10] recorded DCMD activity in response to an ap˙ proaching object which projected image edges on the retina moving at constant velocity: Θ = const. ˙ This “linear approach” is perceived as if the object is getting increasingly implies Θ(t) = Θ0 + Θt. slower. But what appears a relatively unnatural movement pattern serves as a test for the functions η & ψ∞ . Figure 5 illustrates that ψ∞ passes the test, and consistently predicts that activity sharply rises in the initial approach phase, and subsequently declines (η passed this test already in the year 1995). 6 Spike traces. We re-sampled about 30 curves obtained from LGMD recordings from a variety of publications, and ﬁtted η & ψ∞ -functions. We cannot show the results here, but in terms of goodness of ﬁt measures, both functions are in the same ballbark. Rather, ﬁgure 6a shows a representative example [30]. When α and β are plotted against each other for ﬁve trials, we see a strong inverse correlation (ﬁgure 6b). Although ﬁve data points are by no means a ﬁrm statistical sample, the strong correlation could indicate that β and α play similar roles in both functions. Biophysically, β is the leakage conductance, which determines the (passive) membrane time constant τm ∝ 1/β of the neuron. Voltage drops within τm to exp(−1) times its initial value. Bigger values of β mean shorter τm (i.e., “faster neurons”). Getting back to η, this would suggest α ∝ τm , such that higher (absolute) values for α would possibly indicate a slower dynamic of the underlying processes. 5 Discussion (“The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly”) Up to now, mainly two classes of LGMD models existed: The phenomenological η-function on the one hand, and computational models with neuronal layers presynaptic to the LGMD on the other (e.g. [25, 15]; real-world video sequences & robotics: e.g. [3, 14, 32, 2]). Computational models predict that LGMD response features originate from excitatory and inhibitory interactions in – and between – presynaptic neuronal layers. Put differently, non-linear operations are generated in the presynaptic network, and can be a function of many (model) parameters (e.g. synaptic weights, time constants, etc.). In contrast, the η-function assigns concrete nonlinear operations to the LGMD [7]. The η-function is accessible to mathematical analysis, whereas computational models have to be probed with videos or artiﬁcial stimulus sequences. The η-function is vague about biophysical parameters, whereas (good) computational models need to be precise at each (model) parameter value. The η-function establishes a clear link between physical stimulus attributes and LGMD activity: It postulates what is to be computed from the optical variables (OVs). But in computational models, such a clear understanding of LGMD inputs cannot always be expected: Presynaptic processing may strongly transform OVs. The ψ function thus represents an intermediate model class: It takes OVs as input, and connects them with biophysical parameters of the LGMD. For the neurophysiologist, the situation could hardly be any better. Psi implements the multiplicative operation of the η-function by shunting inhibition (equation 1: Vexc ≈ Vrest and Vinh ≈ Vrest ). The η-function ﬁts ψ very well according to our dynamical simulations (ﬁgure 1), and satisfactory by the approximate criterion of ﬁgure 4. We can conclude that ψ implements the η-function in a biophysically plausible way. However, ψ does neither explicitly specify η’s multiplicative operation, nor its exponential function exp(·). Instead we have an interaction between shunting inhibition and a power law (·)e , with e ≈ 3. So what about power laws in neurons? Because of e > 1, we have an expansive nonlinearity. Expansive power-law nonlinearities are well established in phenomenological models of simple cells of the primate visual cortex [1, 11]. Such models approximate a simple cell’s instantaneous ﬁring rate r from linear ﬁltering of a stimulus (say Y ) by r ∝ ([Y ]+ )e , where [·]+ sets all negative values to zero and lets all positive pass. Although experimental evidence favors linear thresholding operations like r ∝ [Y − Ythres ]+ , neuronal responses can behave according to power law functions if Y includes stimulus-independent noise [19]. Given this evidence, the power-law function of the inhibitory input into ψ could possibly be interpreted as a phenomenological description of presynaptic processes. The power law would also be the critical feature by means of which the neurophysiologist could distinguish between the η function and ψ. A study of Gabbiani et al. aimed to provide direct evidence for a neuronal implementation of the η-function [8]. Consequently, the study would be an evidence ˙ for a biophysical implementation of “direct” multiplication via log Θ − αΘ. Their experimental evidence fell somewhat short in the last part, where “exponentation through active membrane conductances” should invert logarithmic encoding. Speciﬁcally, the authors observed that “In 7 out of 10 neurons, a third-order power law best described the data” (sixth-order in one animal). Alea iacta est.

<p>Author: Faisal Khan, Bilge Mutlu, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We study the empirical strategies that humans follow as they teach a target concept with a simple 1D threshold to a robot.1 Previous studies of computational teaching, particularly the teaching dimension model and the curriculum learning principle, offer contradictory predictions on what optimal strategy the teacher should follow in this teaching task. We show through behavioral studies that humans employ three distinct teaching strategies, one of which is consistent with the curriculum learning principle, and propose a novel theoretical framework as a potential explanation for this strategy. This framework, which assumes a teaching goal of minimizing the learner’s expected generalization error at each iteration, extends the standard teaching dimension model and offers a theoretical justiﬁcation for curriculum learning. 1</p><p>3 0.26176399 <a title="48-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Autonomous_Learning_of_Action_Models_for_Planning.html">41 nips-2011-Autonomous Learning of Action Models for Planning</a></p>
<p>Author: Neville Mehta, Prasad Tadepalli, Alan Fern</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces two new frameworks for learning action models for planning. In the mistake-bounded planning framework, the learner has access to a planner for the given model representation, a simulator, and a planning problem generator, and aims to learn a model with at most a polynomial number of faulty plans. In the planned exploration framework, the learner does not have access to a problem generator and must instead design its own problems, plan for them, and converge with at most a polynomial number of planning attempts. The paper reduces learning in these frameworks to concept learning with one-sided error and provides algorithms for successful learning in both frameworks. A speciﬁc family of hypothesis spaces is shown to be efﬁciently learnable in both the frameworks. 1</p><p>4 0.10226495 <a title="48-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Offline_Communication_Policies_for_Factored_Multiagent_POMDPs.html">79 nips-2011-Efficient Offline Communication Policies for Factored Multiagent POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: João V. Messias, Matthijs Spaan, Pedro U. Lima</p><p>Abstract: Factored Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (DecPOMDPs) form a powerful framework for multiagent planning under uncertainty, but optimal solutions require a rigid history-based policy representation. In this paper we allow inter-agent communication which turns the problem in a centralized Multiagent POMDP (MPOMDP). We map belief distributions over state factors to an agent’s local actions by exploiting structure in the joint MPOMDP policy. The key point is that when sparse dependencies between the agents’ decisions exist, often the belief over its local state factors is sufﬁcient for an agent to unequivocally identify the optimal action, and communication can be avoided. We formalize these notions by casting the problem into convex optimization form, and present experimental results illustrating the savings in communication that we can obtain.</p><p>5 0.098213077 <a title="48-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_the_State-Representation_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">245 nips-2011-Selecting the State-Representation in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Daniil Ryabko, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past observations to a ﬁnite set) of the observations are given, and it is known that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that, with a regret of order T 2/3 where T is the horizon time. 1</p><p>6 0.096506909 <a title="48-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-MAP_Inference_for_Bayesian_Inverse_Reinforcement_Learning.html">163 nips-2011-MAP Inference for Bayesian Inverse Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Scott Niekum, Andrew G. Barto</p><p>Abstract: Skill discovery algorithms in reinforcement learning typically identify single states or regions in state space that correspond to task-speciﬁc subgoals. However, such methods do not directly address the question of how many distinct skills are appropriate for solving the tasks that the agent faces. This can be highly inefﬁcient when many identiﬁed subgoals correspond to the same underlying skill, but are all used individually as skill goals. Furthermore, skills created in this manner are often only transferable to tasks that share identical state spaces, since corresponding subgoals across tasks are not merged into a single skill goal. We show that these problems can be overcome by clustering subgoal data deﬁned in an agent-space and using the resulting clusters as templates for skill termination conditions. Clustering via a Dirichlet process mixture model is used to discover a minimal, sufﬁcient collection of portable skills. 1</p><p>6 0.30612072 <a title="48-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Monte_Carlo_Value_Iteration_with_Macro-Actions.html">174 nips-2011-Monte Carlo Value Iteration with Macro-Actions</a></p>

<p>Author: Binbin Lin, Chiyuan Zhang, Xiaofei He</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of semi-supervised learning from the vector ﬁeld perspective. Many of the existing work use the graph Laplacian to ensure the smoothness of the prediction function on the data manifold. However, beyond smoothness, it is suggested by recent theoretical work that we should ensure second order smoothness for achieving faster rates of convergence for semisupervised regression problems. To achieve this goal, we show that the second order smoothness measures the linearity of the function, and the gradient ﬁeld of a linear function has to be a parallel vector ﬁeld. Consequently, we propose to ﬁnd a function which minimizes the empirical error, and simultaneously requires its gradient ﬁeld to be as parallel as possible. We give a continuous objective function on the manifold and discuss how to discretize it by using random points. The discretized optimization problem turns out to be a sparse linear system which can be solved very efﬁciently. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed approach. 1</p><p>2 0.91921806 <a title="48-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Analytical_Results_for_the_Error_in_Filtering_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">37 nips-2011-Analytical Results for the Error in Filtering of Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex K. Susemihl, Ron Meir, Manfred Opper</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic stimuli has received a great deal of attention recently. It has been applied to describe the way in which biological systems dynamically represent and make decisions about the environment. There have been no exact results for the error in the biologically plausible setting of inference on point process, however. We present an exact analysis of the evolution of the meansquared error in a state estimation task using Gaussian-tuned point processes as sensors. This allows us to study the dynamics of the error of an optimal Bayesian decoder, providing insights into the limits obtainable in this task. This is done for Markovian and a class of non-Markovian Gaussian processes. We ﬁnd that there is an optimal tuning width for which the error is minimized. This leads to a characterization of the optimal encoding for the setting as a function of the statistics of the stimulus, providing a mathematically sound primer for an ecological theory of sensory processing. 1</p><p>3 0.86675537 <a title="48-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-On_Causal_Discovery_with_Cyclic_Additive_Noise_Models.html">194 nips-2011-On Causal Discovery with Cyclic Additive Noise Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Dominik Janzing, Tom Heskes, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We study a particular class of cyclic causal models, where each variable is a (possibly nonlinear) function of its parents and additive noise. We prove that the causal graph of such models is generically identiﬁable in the bivariate, Gaussian-noise case. We also propose a method to learn such models from observational data. In the acyclic case, the method reduces to ordinary regression, but in the more challenging cyclic case, an additional term arises in the loss function, which makes it a special case of nonlinear independent component analysis. We illustrate the proposed method on synthetic data. 1</p><p>4 0.85939628 <a title="48-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Covariance_Unfolding_%3A_Manifold_Learning_for_Bimodal_Data.html">167 nips-2011-Maximum Covariance Unfolding : Manifold Learning for Bimodal Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Vijay Mahadevan, Chi W. Wong, Jose C. Pereira, Tom Liu, Nuno Vasconcelos, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We propose maximum covariance unfolding (MCU), a manifold learning algorithm for simultaneous dimensionality reduction of data from different input modalities. Given high dimensional inputs from two different but naturally aligned sources, MCU computes a common low dimensional embedding that maximizes the cross-modal (inter-source) correlations while preserving the local (intra-source) distances. In this paper, we explore two applications of MCU. First we use MCU to analyze EEG-fMRI data, where an important goal is to visualize the fMRI voxels that are most strongly correlated with changes in EEG traces. To perform this visualization, we augment MCU with an additional step for metric learning in the high dimensional voxel space. Second, we use MCU to perform cross-modal retrieval of matched image and text samples from Wikipedia. To manage large applications of MCU, we develop a fast implementation based on ideas from spectral graph theory. These ideas transform the original problem for MCU, one of semideﬁnite programming, into a simpler problem in semideﬁnite quadratic linear programming. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.85779637 <a title="48-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Blending_Autonomous_Exploration_and_Apprenticeship_Learning.html">48 nips-2011-Blending Autonomous Exploration and Apprenticeship Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas J. Walsh, Daniel K. Hewlett, Clayton T. Morrison</p><p>Abstract: We present theoretical and empirical results for a framework that combines the beneﬁts of apprenticeship and autonomous reinforcement learning. Our approach modiﬁes an existing apprenticeship learning framework that relies on teacher demonstrations and does not necessarily explore the environment. The ﬁrst change is replacing previously used Mistake Bound model learners with a recently proposed framework that melds the KWIK and Mistake Bound supervised learning protocols. The second change is introducing a communication of expected utility from the student to the teacher. The resulting system only uses teacher traces when the agent needs to learn concepts it cannot efﬁciently learn on its own. 1</p><p>6 0.84128088 <a title="48-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Clustering_via_Dirichlet_Process_Mixture_Models_for_Portable_Skill_Discovery.html">52 nips-2011-Clustering via Dirichlet Process Mixture Models for Portable Skill Discovery</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects). In general, the ranking of n objects can be identiﬁed by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reﬂect their relative distances from a common reference point in Rd . We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis. 1</p><p>3 0.22224264 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Query-Aware_MCMC.html">229 nips-2011-Query-Aware MCMC</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael L. Wick, Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: Traditional approaches to probabilistic inference such as loopy belief propagation and Gibbs sampling typically compute marginals for all the unobserved variables in a graphical model. However, in many real-world applications the user’s interests are focused on a subset of the variables, speciﬁed by a query. In this case it would be wasteful to uniformly sample, say, one million variables when the query concerns only ten. In this paper we propose a query-speciﬁc approach to MCMC that accounts for the query variables and their generalized mutual information with neighboring variables in order to achieve higher computational efﬁciency. Surprisingly there has been almost no previous work on query-aware MCMC. We demonstrate the success of our approach with positive experimental results on a wide range of graphical models. 1</p><p>4 0.16554064 <a title="231-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Learning_to_Search_Efficiently_in_High_Dimensions.html">157 nips-2011-Learning to Search Efficiently in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhen Li, Huazhong Ning, Liangliang Cao, Tong Zhang, Yihong Gong, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications, specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efﬁciency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees, k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems, those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efﬁciency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efﬁciency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efﬁcient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Speciﬁcally, we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efﬁciently converted into an inverted indexing data structure, which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efﬁciency. Experimental results show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing), as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).</p><p>5 0.16265666 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>
<p>Author: Vicente Ordonez, Girish Kulkarni, Tamara L. Berg</p><p>Abstract: We develop and demonstrate automatic image description methods using a large captioned photo collection. One contribution is our technique for the automatic collection of this new dataset – performing a huge number of Flickr queries and then ﬁltering the noisy results down to 1 million images with associated visually relevant captions. Such a collection allows us to approach the extremely challenging problem of description generation using relatively simple non-parametric methods and produces surprisingly effective results. We also develop methods incorporating many state of the art, but fairly noisy, estimates of image content to produce even more pleasing results. Finally we introduce a new objective performance measure for image captioning. 1</p><p>6 0.15019065 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Target_Neighbor_Consistent_Feature_Weighting_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">279 nips-2011-Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Nir Ailon</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n elements we wish to linearly order them using pairwise preference labels which may be non-transitive (due to irrationality or arbitrary noise). The goal is to linearly order the elements while disagreeing with as few pairwise preference labels as possible. Our performance is measured by two parameters: The number of disagreements (loss) and the query complexity (number of pairwise preference labels). Our algorithm adaptively queries at most O(n poly(log n, ε−1 )) preference labels for a regret of ε times the optimal loss. This is strictly better, and often signiﬁcantly better than what non-adaptive sampling could achieve. Our main result helps settle an open problem posed by learning-to-rank (from pairwise information) theoreticians and practitioners: What is a provably correct way to sample preference labels? 1</p><p>5 0.70701826 <a title="231-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Convergent_Bounds_on_the_Euclidean_Distance.html">64 nips-2011-Convergent Bounds on the Euclidean Distance</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoonho Hwang, Hee-kap Ahn</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n vectors in d-dimensional space, we provide an efﬁcient method for computing quality upper and lower bounds of the Euclidean distances between a pair of vectors in V . For this purpose, we deﬁne a distance measure, called the MS-distance, by using the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V . Once we compute the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V in O(dn) time, the MS-distance provides upper and lower bounds of Euclidean distance between any pair of vectors in V in constant time. Furthermore, these bounds can be reﬁned further in such a way to converge monotonically to the exact Euclidean distance within d reﬁnement steps. An analysis on a random sequence of reﬁnement steps shows that the MS-distance provides very tight bounds in only a few reﬁnement steps. The MS-distance can be used to various applications where the Euclidean distance is used to measure the proximity or similarity between objects. We provide experimental results on the nearest and the farthest neighbor searches. 1</p><p>6 0.54934478 <a title="231-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_to_Search_Efficiently_in_High_Dimensions.html">157 nips-2011-Learning to Search Efficiently in High Dimensions</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Graves</p><p>Abstract: Variational methods have been previously explored as a tractable approximation to Bayesian inference for neural networks. However the approaches proposed so far have only been applicable to a few simple network architectures. This paper introduces an easy-to-implement stochastic variational method (or equivalently, minimum description length loss function) that can be applied to most neural networks. Along the way it revisits several common regularisers from a variational perspective. It also provides a simple pruning heuristic that can both drastically reduce the number of network weights and lead to improved generalisation. Experimental results are provided for a hierarchical multidimensional recurrent neural network applied to the TIMIT speech corpus. 1</p><p>3 0.77500975 <a title="231-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems.html">301 nips-2011-Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Michalis K. Titsias, Andreas Damianou</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional time series are endemic in applications of machine learning such as robotics (sensor data), computational biology (gene expression data), vision (video sequences) and graphics (motion capture data). Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences. 1</p><p>4 0.77097428 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Prismatic_Algorithm_for_Discrete_D.C._Programming_Problem.html">222 nips-2011-Prismatic Algorithm for Discrete D.C.

<p>Author: Yoshinobu Kawahara, Takashi Washio</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose the ﬁrst exact algorithm for minimizing the difference of two submodular functions (D.S.), i.e., the discrete version of the D.C. programming problem. The developed algorithm is a branch-and-bound-based algorithm which responds to the structure of this problem through the relationship between submodularity and convexity. The D.S. programming problem covers a broad range of applications in machine learning. In fact, this generalizes any set-function optimization. We empirically investigate the performance of our algorithm, and illustrate the difference between exact and approximate solutions respectively obtained by the proposed and existing algorithms in feature selection and discriminative structure learning.</p><p>5 0.76552981 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Pylon_Model_for_Semantic_Segmentation.html">227 nips-2011-Pylon Model for Semantic Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lempitsky, Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Graph cut optimization is one of the standard workhorses of image segmentation since for binary random ﬁeld representations of the image, it gives globally optimal results and there are efﬁcient polynomial time implementations. Often, the random ﬁeld is applied over a ﬂat partitioning of the image into non-intersecting elements, such as pixels or super-pixels. In the paper we show that if, instead of a ﬂat partitioning, the image is represented by a hierarchical segmentation tree, then the resulting energy combining unary and boundary terms can still be optimized using graph cut (with all the corresponding beneﬁts of global optimality and efﬁciency). As a result of such inference, the image gets partitioned into a set of segments that may come from different layers of the tree. We apply this formulation, which we call the pylon model, to the task of semantic segmentation where the goal is to separate an image into areas belonging to different semantic classes. The experiments highlight the advantage of inference on a segmentation tree (over a ﬂat partitioning) and demonstrate that the optimization in the pylon model is able to ﬂexibly choose the level of segmentation across the image. Overall, the proposed system has superior segmentation accuracy on several datasets (Graz-02, Stanford background) compared to previously suggested approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.76502872 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-On_Learning_Discrete_Graphical_Models_using_Greedy_Methods.html">195 nips-2011-On Learning Discrete Graphical Models using Greedy Methods</a></p>

</p><p>5 1  Introduction  In each trial of a standard visual short-term memory (VSTM) experiment (e. [sent-11, score-0.285]
</p><p>6 [1,2]), subjects are ﬁrst presented with a display containing multiple items with simple features (e. [sent-13, score-0.816]
</p><p>7 colored squares) for a brief duration and then, after a delay interval, their memory for the feature value of one of the items is probed using either a recognition or a recall task. [sent-15, score-0.615]
</p><p>8 , sN ]T denote the feature values of the N items in the display on a given trial. [sent-19, score-0.563]
</p><p>9 In this paper, our goal is to provide a quantitative description of the content of a subject’s visual memory for the display after the delay interval. [sent-20, score-0.38]
</p><p>10 We note s that most research on VSTM is concerned with characterizing how subjects encode a single item in VSTM (for instance, the precision with which a single item can be encoded [1,2]) and, thus, does not consider the joint encoding of multiple items. [sent-27, score-0.651]
</p><p>11 In particular, we are not aware of any previous work attempting to experimentally probe and characterize exactly how the encoding of an item inﬂuences the encoding of other items, i. [sent-28, score-0.614]
</p><p>12 s ˆ ˆ A simple (perhaps simplistic) suggestion is to assume that the encoding of an item does not inﬂuence the encoding of other items, i. [sent-34, score-0.388]

</p><p>15 , sN ) as an N -dimensional multivaris ˆ ˆ ate Gaussian distribution with mean m(s) and full covariance matrix Σ(s), both of which depend on the actual stimuli s appearing in a display. [sent-52, score-0.272]
</p><p>16 Although more complex models incorporating higher-order dependencies between the representations of items in VSTM can be considered, it would be difﬁcult to experimentally determine the parameters of these models. [sent-54, score-0.477]
</p><p>17 This is to allow for the possibility that subjects might encode stimuli with different similarity relations differently. [sent-57, score-0.38]
</p><p>18 For instance (and to foreshadow our experimental results), if the items in a display have similar feature values, one might reasonably expect there to be large dependencies among the representations of these items. [sent-58, score-0.663]
</p><p>19 Conversely, the correlations among the representations of items might be smaller if the items in a display are dissimilar. [sent-59, score-1.15]
</p><p>20 We ask similar questions about our stimulus-dependent covariance matrix Σ(s): Does the covariance between VSTM representations of two stimuli depend only on the absolute difference between their feature values, |si − sj |, or is the relationship non-stationary and more complex? [sent-67, score-0.432]
</p><p>21 Modeling subjects’ VSTM representations of multiple items as a joint probability distribution allows us to explain an intriguing ﬁnding by Jiang, Olson and Chun [3] in an elegant way. [sent-71, score-0.431]
</p><p>22 [3] showed that relations between items in a display, as well as items’ individual characteristics, are encoded in VSTM. [sent-74, score-0.419]
</p><p>23 In the single probe condition, only one of the squares (called the target probe) reappeared, either with the same color as in the original display, or with a different color. [sent-77, score-0.397]
</p><p>24 In the minimal color change condition, the target probe (again with the same color or with a different color) reappeared together with distracter probes which always had the same colors as in the original display. [sent-78, score-0.664]
</p><p>25 In both conditions, subjects decided whether a color change occurred in the target probe. [sent-79, score-0.414]
</p><p>26 [3] found that subjects’ performances were signiﬁcantly better in the minimal color change condition than in the single probe condition. [sent-81, score-0.461]
</p><p>27 s Intuitively, the single probe condition taps the marginal probability of the memory for the target item, p(ˆt ), where t represents the index of the target item. [sent-85, score-0.491]
</p><p>28 If the target probe has high probability under these distributions, then the subject will be more likely to respond ‘no-change’, whereas if it has low probability, then the subject will be more likely to respond ‘change’. [sent-88, score-0.424]
</p><p>29 If the items are represented independently in VSTM, the marginal and conditional distributions are the same; i. [sent-89, score-0.412]
</p><p>30 Hence, s s s the independent-representation assumption predicts that there should be no difference in subjects’ performances in the single probe and minimal color change conditions. [sent-92, score-0.467]
</p><p>31 It is also easy to understand why subjects performed better in the minimal color change condition than in the single probe condition. [sent-94, score-0.679]
</p><p>32 ˆ−t = b, the conditional distribution p(ˆt |ˆ−t ) is biased away from a, explaining the poorer s s s performance in the maximal change condition than in the single probe condition. [sent-100, score-0.304]
</p><p>33 Procedure: Each trial began with the display of a ﬁxation cross at a random location within an approximately 12◦ × 16◦ region of the screen for 1 second. [sent-103, score-0.387]
</p><p>34 Subjects were then presented with a number of colored squares (N = 2 or N = 3 squares in separate experiments) on linearly spaced dark and thin horizontal lines for 100 ms. [sent-104, score-0.332]
</p><p>35 After a delay interval of 1 second, a probe screen was presented. [sent-105, score-0.322]
</p><p>36 Initially, the probe screen contained only the horizontal lines. [sent-106, score-0.433]
</p><p>37 Subjects were asked to use the computer mouse to indicate their estimate of the horizontal location of each of the colored squares presented on that trial. [sent-107, score-0.318]
</p><p>38 We note that this is a novelty of our experimental task, since in most other VSTM tasks, only one of the items is probed and the subject is asked to report the content of their memory associated with the probed item. [sent-108, score-0.664]
</p><p>39 Requiring subjects to indicate the feature values of all presented items allows us to study the dependencies between the memories for different items. [sent-109, score-0.729]
</p><p>40 To study the dependence of m(s) and Σ(s) on the horizontal locations of the squares s = [s1 , s2 , . [sent-113, score-0.248]
</p><p>41 To cover a range of possible display conﬁgurations, we selected uniformly-spaced points along the horizontal dimension, considered all possible combinations of these points (e. [sent-118, score-0.336]
</p><p>42 item 1 is at horizontal location s1 and item 2 is at location s2 ), and then added a small amount of jitter to each combination. [sent-120, score-0.524]
</p><p>43 In the experiment with two items, 6 points were selected along the horizontal dimension, and thus there were 36 (6×6) different display conﬁgurations. [sent-121, score-0.401]
</p><p>44 Subjects participating in the same experiment (either two or three items) saw the same set of display conﬁgurations. [sent-137, score-0.251]
</p><p>45 Participants: 8 naive subjects participated in the experiments (4 in each experiment). [sent-138, score-0.253]
</p><p>46 All subjects had normal or corrected-to-normal vision, and they were compensated at a rate of $10 per hour. [sent-139, score-0.253]
</p><p>47 For both set sizes, subjects completed the experiment in two sessions. [sent-140, score-0.318]
</p><p>48 This tendency was strongest when items were at similar horizontal positions [e. [sent-147, score-0.527]
</p><p>49 distributions are more likely to exhibit signiﬁcant correlations for display conﬁgurations close to the main diagonal (s1 = s2 )]. [sent-149, score-0.342]
</p><p>50 In this graph, conﬁgurations were divided into 6 equal-length bins according to their |s1 −s2 | values, and the correlations shown are the mean correlation coefﬁcients (and standard errors of the means) for each bin. [sent-152, score-0.264]
</p><p>51 One might consider this graph as representing a stationary kernel function that speciﬁes how the covariance between the memory representations of two items changes as a function of the distance |s1 − s2 | between their feature values. [sent-156, score-0.713]
</p><p>52 However, as can be observed from Figure 2a, the experimental kernel function that characterizes the dependencies between the VSTM representations of different items is not perfectly stationary. [sent-157, score-0.517]
</p><p>53 Additional analyses (not detailed here) indicate that subjects had a bias toward the center of the display. [sent-158, score-0.253]
</p><p>54 In other words, when an item appeared on the left side of a display, subjects were likely to estimate its location as being to the 4  1  Distance in 1 − d  1  0. [sent-159, score-0.44]

</p><p>56 d(i, j) is measured either (a) in one dimension (considering only horizontal locations) or (b) in two dimensions (considering both horizontal and vertical locations). [sent-164, score-0.355]
</p><p>57 Conversely, items appearing on the right side of a display were estimated as lying to the left of their actual locations. [sent-167, score-0.642]
</p><p>58 Results for the experiment with three items were qualitatively similar. [sent-170, score-0.442]
</p><p>59 Figure 3 shows that, similar to the results observed in the experiment with two items, the magnitude of the correlations between subjects’ position estimates decreases with Euclidean distance between items. [sent-171, score-0.285]
</p><p>60 Overall subjects exhibited a smaller number of signiﬁcant s1 -s3 correlations than s1 -s2 or s2 -s3 correlations. [sent-175, score-0.409]
</p><p>61 4  Explaining the covariances with correlated neural population responses  What could be the source of the speciﬁc form of covariances observed in our experiments? [sent-177, score-0.536]
</p><p>62 In this section we argue that dependencies of the form we observed in our experiments would naturally arise as a consequence of encoding multiple items in a population of neurons with correlated responses. [sent-178, score-1.081]
</p><p>63 To show this, we ﬁrst consider encoding multiple stimuli with an idealized, correlated neural population and analytically derive an expression for the Fisher information matrix (FIM) in this model. [sent-179, score-0.534]
</p><p>64 We then simulate a more detailed and realistic network of spiking neurons and consider encoding and decoding the features of multiple items in this network. [sent-181, score-0.927]
</p><p>65 Encoding multiple stimuli in a neural population with correlated responses We ﬁrst consider the problem of encoding N stimuli (s = [s1 , . [sent-184, score-0.714]
</p><p>66 [16] showed that correlations between motion direction selective MT neurons decrease with the difference in their preferred directions. [sent-192, score-0.439]
</p><p>67 This ‘limited-range’ assumption about the covariances between the ﬁring rates of neurons will be crucial in explaining our experimental results in terms of the FIM of a correlated neural population encoding multiple stimuli. [sent-193, score-0.798]
</p><p>68 We are interested in deriving the FIM, J(s), for our correlated neural population encoding the stimuli s. [sent-194, score-0.534]
</p><p>69 To derive an analytical expression for J(s), we make a number of assumptions: (i) all neurons encode the same feature dimension (e. [sent-197, score-0.283]
</p><p>70 horizontal location in our experiment); (ii) indices of the neurons can be assigned such that neurons with adjacent indices have the closest tuning function centers; (iii) the centers of the tuning functions of neurons are linearly spaced with density η. [sent-199, score-1.269]
</p><p>71 The last two assumptions imply α that the covariance between neurons with indices k and l can be expressed as Qkl = ρ|k−l| afk flα (we omitted the s-dependence of Q and f for brevity) with ρ = exp(−1/(Lη)) where L is a length parameter determining the spatial extent of the correlations. [sent-200, score-0.457]
</p><p>72 Although not necessary for our results (see Supplementary Material), for convenience, we further assume that the neurons can be divided into N groups where in each group the tuning functions are a function of the feature value of only one of the stimuli, i. [sent-202, score-0.337]
</p><p>73 fk (s) = fk (sn ) for neurons in group n, so that the effects of other stimuli on the mean ﬁring rates of neurons in group n are negligible. [sent-204, score-1.007]
</p><p>74 A population of neurons satisfying this assumption, as well as the assumptions (i)-(iii) above, for N = 2 is schematically illustrated in Figure 4a. [sent-205, score-0.436]
</p><p>75 We consider Gaussian tuning functions of the form: fk (s) = g exp(−(s − ck )2 /σ 2 ), with ck linearly spaced between −12◦ and 12◦ and g and σ 2 are assumed to be the same for all neurons. [sent-206, score-0.254]
</p><p>76 We see that the inverse of the FIM predicts correlations between the estimates of s1 and s2 and these correlations decrease with |s1 − s2 |, just as we observed in our experiments (see Figure 4c). [sent-210, score-0.387]
</p><p>77 For such broad tuning functions, the inverse of the FIM also predicts negative correlations when |s1 − s2 | is very large, which does not seem to be as strong in our data. [sent-212, score-0.254]
</p><p>78 Consider the hypothetical neural population shown in Figure 4a encoding the pair s1 , s2 . [sent-214, score-0.325]
</p><p>79 In this population, it is assumed that fk (s) = fk (s1 ) 1 −1 J (s) provides a lower bound on the covariance matrix of any unbiased estimator of s in the matrix sense (where A ≥ B means A − B is positive semi-deﬁnite). [sent-215, score-0.448]

</p><p>81 For neurons in the upper row fk (s) = fk (s1 ), and for neurons in the lower row fk (s) = fk (s2 ). [sent-230, score-1.194]

</p><p>85 However, since the responses of the neurons are stochastic, on some trials, neurons to the left (right) of the k-th neuron will have the highest ﬁring rate in response to s1 . [sent-241, score-0.7]
</p><p>86 When this happens, neurons in the lower row with similar preferences will be more likely to get activated, due to the limited-range correlations between the neurons. [sent-242, score-0.439]
</p><p>87 Encoding and decoding multiple stimuli in a network of spiking neurons There might be two concerns about the analytical argument given in the previous subsection. [sent-244, score-0.537]
</p><p>88 In the input layer, there were 169 Poisson neurons arranged in a 13 × 13 grid with linearly spaced receptive ﬁeld centers between −12◦ and 12◦ along both horizontal and vertical directions. [sent-251, score-0.616]
</p><p>89 Here · is the Euclidean norm, xi is the vertical and horizontal locations of the i-th stimulus, c(k) is the receptive ﬁeld center of the input neuron, gin is a gain parameter and σin is a scale parameter (both assumed to be the same for all input neurons). [sent-253, score-0.343]
</p><p>90 There were 169 of these neurons arranged in a 13 × 13 grid with the receptive ﬁeld center of each neuron matching the receptive ﬁeld center of the corresponding neuron in the input layer. [sent-255, score-0.535]
</p><p>91 We induced limited-range correlations between the output neurons through receptive ﬁeld overlap, although other ways of introducing limited-range correlations can be considered such as through local lateral connections. [sent-256, score-0.64]
</p><p>92 (b) The mean correlation coefﬁcients (and standard errors of the means) as a function of |s1 − s2 | (red: model prediction; black: collapsed data from all 4 subjects in the experiment with N = 2). [sent-262, score-0.375]
</p><p>93 The output neurons had a threshold of -55 mV and a reset potential of -70 mV. [sent-266, score-0.283]
</p><p>94 Each spike of an input neuron k instantaneously increased the voltage of an output neuron l by 10wkl mV, where wkl is the connection weight between the two neurons and the voltage decayed with a time constant of 10 ms. [sent-267, score-0.445]
</p><p>95 We simulated this network with the same display conﬁgurations presented to our subjects in the experiment with N = 2. [sent-269, score-0.552]
</p><p>96 Similar to our experimental results, the spiking network model predicts correlations between the estimates of s1 and s2 and these correlations decrease with |s1 − s2 | (correlations differed signiﬁcantly across different bins as indicated by a one-way ANOVA: F (5, 30) = 22. [sent-275, score-0.575]
</p><p>97 This is due to the fact that output neurons near the center of the display tended to have higher activity levels, since they have more connections with the input neurons compared to the output neurons near the edges of the display. [sent-278, score-1.035]
</p><p>98 However, the implications of these correlations for jointly encoding multiple items in memory are not known. [sent-280, score-0.785]
</p><p>99 Our results here suggest that one consequence of limited-range neural correlations might be correlations in the estimates of the feature values of different items that decrease with the absolute difference between their feature values. [sent-281, score-0.752]

<p>Author: Emin Orhan, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: Extensive evidence suggests that items are not encoded independently in visual short-term memory (VSTM). However, previous research has not quantitatively considered how the encoding of an item inﬂuences the encoding of other items. Here, we model the dependencies among VSTM representations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a stimulus-dependent mean and covariance matrix. We report the results of an experiment designed to determine the speciﬁc form of the stimulus-dependence of the mean and the covariance matrix. We ﬁnd that the magnitude of the covariance between the representations of two items is a monotonically decreasing function of the difference between the items’ feature values, similar to a Gaussian process with a distance-dependent, stationary kernel function. We further show that this type of covariance function can be explained as a natural consequence of encoding multiple stimuli in a population of neurons with correlated responses. 1</p><p>2 0.23533112 <a title="224-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Chen, Vidhya Navalpakkam, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: A model of human visual search is proposed. It predicts both response time (RT) and error rates (RT) as a function of image parameters such as target contrast and clutter. The model is an ideal observer, in that it optimizes the Bayes ratio of target present vs target absent. The ratio is computed on the ﬁring pattern of V1/V2 neurons, modeled by Poisson distributions. The optimal mechanism for integrating information over time is shown to be a ‘soft max’ of diffusions, computed over the visual ﬁeld by ‘hypercolumns’ of neurons that share the same receptive ﬁeld and have different response properties to image features. An approximation of the optimal Bayesian observer, based on integrating local decisions, rather than diffusions, is also derived; it is shown experimentally to produce very similar predictions to the optimal observer in common psychophysics conditions. A psychophyisics experiment is proposed that may discriminate between which mechanism is used in the human brain. A B C Figure 1: Visual search. (A) Clutter and camouﬂage make visual search difﬁcult.

<p>Author: Johanni Brea, Walter Senn, Jean-pascal Pfister</p><p>Abstract: We consider a statistical framework in which recurrent networks of spiking neurons learn to generate spatio-temporal spike patterns. Given biologically realistic stochastic neuronal dynamics we derive a tractable learning rule for the synaptic weights towards hidden and visible neurons that leads to optimal recall of the training sequences. We show that learning synaptic weights towards hidden neurons signiﬁcantly improves the storing capacity of the network. Furthermore, we derive an approximate online learning rule and show that our learning rule is consistent with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity in that if a presynaptic spike shortly precedes a postynaptic spike, potentiation is induced and otherwise depression is elicited.</p><p>4 0.1791485 <a title="224-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_coding_of_natural_images_with_a_population_of_noisy_Linear-Nonlinear_neurons.html">82 nips-2011-Efficient coding of natural images with a population of noisy Linear-Nonlinear neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding provides a powerful principle for explaining early sensory coding. Most attempts to test this principle have been limited to linear, noiseless models, and when applied to natural images, have yielded oriented ﬁlters consistent with responses in primary visual cortex. Here we show that an efﬁcient coding model that incorporates biologically realistic ingredients – input and output noise, nonlinear response functions, and a metabolic cost on the ﬁring rate – predicts receptive ﬁelds and response nonlinearities similar to those observed in the retina. Speciﬁcally, we develop numerical methods for simultaneously learning the linear ﬁlters and response nonlinearities of a population of model neurons, so as to maximize information transmission subject to metabolic costs. When applied to an ensemble of natural images, the method yields ﬁlters that are center-surround and nonlinearities that are rectifying. The ﬁlters are organized into two populations, with On- and Off-centers, which independently tile the visual space. As observed in the primate retina, the Off-center neurons are more numerous and have ﬁlters with smaller spatial extent. In the absence of noise, our method reduces to a generalized version of independent components analysis, with an adapted nonlinear “contrast” function; in this case, the optimal ﬁlters are localized and oriented.</p><p>5 0.17713372 <a title="224-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Learning_for_Recurrent_Spiking_Networks.html">302 nips-2011-Variational Learning for Recurrent Spiking Networks</a></p>

Operating in the context of a generative model for distributions of spike sequences, the learning mechanism is derived from variational inference principles. The synaptic plasticity rules found are interesting in that they are strongly reminiscent of experimental Spike Time Dependent Plasticity, and in that they differ for excitatory and inhibitory neurons.

<p>Author: Emin Orhan, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: Extensive evidence suggests that items are not encoded independently in visual short-term memory (VSTM). However, previous research has not quantitatively considered how the encoding of an item inﬂuences the encoding of other items. Here, we model the dependencies among VSTM representations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a stimulus-dependent mean and covariance matrix. We report the results of an experiment designed to determine the speciﬁc form of the stimulus-dependence of the mean and the covariance matrix. We ﬁnd that the magnitude of the covariance between the representations of two items is a monotonically decreasing function of the difference between the items’ feature values, similar to a Gaussian process with a distance-dependent, stationary kernel function. We further show that this type of covariance function can be explained as a natural consequence of encoding multiple stimuli in a population of neurons with correlated responses. 1</p><p>2 0.81389982 <a title="224-lsi-2" href="./nips-2011-Predicting_response_time_and_error_rates_in_visual_search.html">219 nips-2011-Predicting response time and error rates in visual search</a></p>

Boahen</p><p>Abstract: Motor prostheses aim to restore function to disabled patients. Despite compelling proof of concept systems, barriers to clinical translation remain. One challenge is to develop a low-power, fully-implantable system that dissipates only minimal power so as not to damage tissue. To this end, we implemented a Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder via a spiking neural network (SNN) and tested it in brain-machine interface (BMI) experiments with a rhesus monkey. The Kalman ﬁlter was trained to predict the arm’s velocity and mapped on to the SNN using the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF). A 2,000-neuron embedded Matlab SNN implementation runs in real-time and its closed-loop performance is quite comparable to that of the standard Kalman ﬁlter. The success of this closed-loop decoder holds promise for hardware SNN implementations of statistical signal processing algorithms on neuromorphic chips, which may offer power savings necessary to overcome a major obstacle to the successful clinical translation of neural motor prostheses. ∗ Present: Research Fellow F.R.S.-FNRS, Systmod Unit, University of Liege, Belgium. 1 1 Cortically-controlled motor prostheses: the challenge Motor prostheses aim to restore function for severely disabled patients by translating neural signals from the brain into useful control signals for prosthetic limbs or computer cursors. Several proof of concept demonstrations have shown encouraging results, but barriers to clinical translation still remain. One example is the development of a fully-implantable system that meets power dissipation constraints, but is still powerful enough to perform complex operations. A recently reported closedloop cortically-controlled motor prosthesis is capable of producing quick, accurate, and robust computer cursor movements by decoding neural signals (threshold-crossings) from a 96-electrode array in rhesus macaque premotor/motor cortex [1]-[4]. This, and previous designs (e.g., [5]), employ versions of the Kalman ﬁlter, ubiquitous in statistical signal processing. Such a ﬁlter and its variants are the state-of-the-art decoder for brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) in humans [5] and monkeys [2]. While these recent advances are encouraging, clinical translation of such BMIs requires fullyimplanted systems, which in turn impose severe power dissipation constraints. Even though it is an open, actively-debated question as to how much of the neural prosthetic system must be implanted, we note that there are no reports to date demonstrating a fully implantable 100-channel wireless transmission system, motivating performing decoding within the implanted chip. This computation is constrained by a stringent power budget: A 6 × 6mm2 implant must dissipate less than 10mW to avoid heating the brain by more than 1◦ C [6], which is believed to be important for long term cell health. With this power budget, current approaches can not scale to higher electrode densities or to substantially more computer-intensive decode/control algorithms. The feasibility of mapping a Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder algorithm [1]-[4] on to a spiking neural network (SNN) has been explored off-line (open-loop). In these off-line tests, the SNN’s performance virtually matched that of the standard implementation [7]. These simulations provide conﬁdence that this algorithm—and others similar to it—could be implemented using an ultra-low-power approach potentially capable of meeting the severe power constraints set by clinical translation. This neuromorphic approach uses very-large-scale integrated systems containing microelectronic analog circuits to morph neural systems into silicon chips [8, 9]. These neuromorphic circuits may yield tremendous power savings—50nW per silicon neuron [10]—over digital circuits because they use physical operations to perform mathematical computations (analog approach). When implemented on a chip designed using the neuromorphic approach, a 2,000-neuron SNN network can consume as little as 100µW. Demonstrating this approach’s feasibility in a closed-loop system running in real-time is a key, non-incremental step in the development of a fully implantable decoding chip, and is necessary before proceeding with fabricating and implanting the chip. As noise, delay, and over-ﬁtting play a more important role in the closed-loop setting, it is not obvious that the SNN’s stellar open-loop performance will hold up. In addition, performance criteria are different in the closed-loop and openloop settings (e.g., time per target vs. root mean squared error). Therefore, a SNN of a different size may be required to meet the desired speciﬁcations. Here we present results and assess the performance and viability of the SNN Kalman-ﬁlter based decoder in real-time, closed-loop tests, with the monkey performing a center-out-and-back target acquisition task. To achieve closed-loop operation, we developed an embedded Matlab implementation that ran a 2,000-neuron version of the SNN in real-time on a PC. We achieved almost a 50-fold speed-up by performing part of the computation in a lower-dimensional space deﬁned by the formal method we used to map the Kalman ﬁlter on to the SNN. This shortcut allowed us to run a larger SNN in real-time than would otherwise be possible. 2 Spiking neural network mapping of control theory algorithms As reported in [11], a formal methodology, called the Neural Engineering Framework (NEF), has been developed to map control-theory algorithms onto a computational fabric consisting of a highly heterogeneous population of spiking neurons simply by programming the strengths of their connections. These artiﬁcial neurons are characterized by a nonlinear multi-dimensional-vector-to-spikerate function—ai (x(t)) for the ith neuron—with parameters (preferred direction, maximum ﬁring rate, and spiking-threshold) drawn randomly from a wide distribution (standard deviation ≈ mean). 2 Spike rate (spikes/s) Representation ˆ x → ai (x) → x = ∑i ai (x)φix ˜ ai (x) = G(αi φix · x + Jibias ) 400 Transformation y = Ax → b j (Aˆ ) x Aˆ = ∑i ai (x)Aφix x x(t) B' y(t) A' 200 0 −1 Dynamics ˙ x = Ax → x = h ∗ A x A = τA + I 0 Stimulus x 1 bk(t) y(t) B' h(t) x(t) A' aj(t) Figure 1: NEF’s three principles. Representation. 1D tuning curves of a population of 50 leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons. The neurons’ tuning curves map control variables (x) to spike rates (ai (x)); this nonlinear transformation is inverted by linear weighted decoding. G() is the neurons’ nonlinear current-to-spike-rate function. Transformation. SNN with populations bk (t) and a j (t) representing y(t) and x(t). Feedforward and recurrent weights are determined by B and A , as described next. Dynamics. The system’s dynamics is captured in a neurally plausible fashion by replacing integration with the synapses’ spike response, h(t), and replacing the matrices with A = τA + I and B = τB to compensate. The neural engineering approach to conﬁguring SNNs to perform arbitrary computations is underlined by three principles (Figure 1) [11]-[14]: Representation is deﬁned by nonlinear encoding of x(t) as a spike rate, ai (x(t))—represented by the neuron tuning curve—combined with optimal weighted linear decoding of ai (x(t)) to recover ˆ an estimate of x(t), x(t) = ∑i ai (x(t))φix , where φix are the decoding weights. Transformation is performed by using alternate decoding weights in the decoding operation to map transformations of x(t) directly into transformations of ai (x(t)). For example, y(t) = Ax(t) is represented by the spike rates b j (Aˆ (t)), where unit j’s input is computed directly from unit i’s x output using Aˆ (t) = ∑i ai (x(t))Aφix , an alternative linear weighting. x Dynamics brings the ﬁrst two principles together and adds the time dimension to the circuit. This principle aims at reuniting the control-theory and neural levels by modifying the matrices to render the system neurally plausible, thereby permitting the synapses’ spike response, h(t), (i.e., impulse ˙ response) to capture the system’s dynamics. For example, for h(t) = τ −1 e−t/τ , x = Ax(t) is realized by replacing A with A = τA + I. This so-called neurally plausible matrix yields an equivalent dynamical system: x(t) = h(t) ∗ A x(t), where convolution replaces integration. The nonlinear encoding process—from a multi-dimensional stimulus, x(t), to a one-dimensional soma current, Ji (x(t)), to a ﬁring rate, ai (x(t))—is speciﬁed as: ai (x(t)) = G(Ji (x(t))). (1) Here G is the neurons’ nonlinear current-to-spike-rate function, which is given by G(Ji (x)) = τ ref − τ RC ln (1 − Jth /Ji (x)) −1 , (2) for the leaky integrate-and-ﬁre model (LIF). The LIF neuron has two behavioral regimes: subthreshold and super-threshold. The sub-threshold regime is described by an RC circuit with time constant τ RC . When the sub-threshold soma voltage reaches the threshold, Vth , the neuron emits a spike δ (t −tn ). After this spike, the neuron is reset and rests for τ ref seconds (absolute refractory period) before it resumes integrating. Jth = Vth /R is the minimum input current that produces spiking. Ignoring the soma’s RC time-constant when specifying the SNN’s dynamics are reasonable because the neurons cross threshold at a rate that is proportional to their input current, which thus sets the spike rate instantaneously, without any ﬁltering [11]. The conversion from a multi-dimensional stimulus, x(t), to a one-dimensional soma current, Ji , is ˜ performed by assigning to the neuron a preferred direction, φix , in the stimulus space and taking the dot-product: ˜ Ji (x(t)) = αi φix · x(t) + Jibias , (3) 3 where αi is a gain or conversion factor, and Jibias is a bias current that accounts for background ˜ activity. For a 1D space, φix is either +1 or −1 (drawn randomly), for ON and OFF neurons, respectively. The resulting tuning curves are illustrated in Figure 1, left. The linear decoding process is characterized by the synapses’ spike response, h(t) (i.e., post-synaptic currents), and the decoding weights, φix , which are obtained by minimizing the mean square error. A single noise term, η, takes into account all sources of noise, which have the effect of introducing uncertainty into the decoding process. Hence, the transmitted ﬁring rate can be written as ai (x(t)) + ηi , where ai (x(t)) represents the noiseless set of tuning curves and ηi is a random variable picked from a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with variance σ 2 . Consequently, the mean square error can be written as [11]: E = 1 ˆ [x(t) − x(t)]2 2 x,η,t = 2 1 2 x(t) − ∑ (ai (x(t)) + ηi ) φix i (4) x,η,t where · x,η denotes integration over the range of x and η, the expected noise. We assume that the noise is independent and has the same variance for each neuron [11], which yields: E= where σ2 1 2 2 x(t) − ∑ ai (x(t))φix i x,t 1 + σ 2 ∑(φix )2 , 2 i (5) is the noise variance ηi η j . This expression is minimized by: N φix = ∑ Γ−1 ϒ j , ij (6) j with Γi j = ai (x)a j (x) x + σ 2 δi j , where δ is the Kronecker delta function matrix, and ϒ j = xa j (x) x [11]. One consequence of modeling noise in the neural representation is that the matrix Γ is invertible despite the use of a highly overcomplete representation. In a noiseless representation, Γ is generally singular because, due to the large number of neurons, there is a high probability of having two neurons with similar tuning curves leading to two similar rows in Γ. 3 Kalman-ﬁlter based cortical decoder In the 1960’s, Kalman described a method that uses linear ﬁltering to track the state of a dynamical system throughout time using a model of the dynamics of the system as well as noisy measurements [15]. The model dynamics gives an estimate of the state of the system at the next time step. This estimate is then corrected using the observations (i.e., measurements) at this time step. The relative weights for these two pieces of information are given by the Kalman gain, K [15, 16]. Whereas the Kalman gain is updated at each iteration, the state and observation matrices (deﬁned below)—and corresponding noise matrices—are supposed constant. In the case of prosthetic applications, the system’s state vector is the cursor’s kinematics, xt = y [veltx , velt , 1], where the constant 1 allows for a ﬁxed offset compensation. The measurement vector, yt , is the neural spike rate (spike counts in each time step) of 192 channels of neural threshold crossings. The system’s dynamics is modeled by: xt yt = Axt−1 + wt , = Cxt + qt , (7) (8) where A is the state matrix, C is the observation matrix, and wt and qt are additive, Gaussian noise sources with wt ∼ N (0, W) and qt ∼ N (0, Q). The model parameters (A, C, W and Q) are ﬁt with training data by correlating the observed hand kinematics with the simultaneously measured neural signals (Figure 2). For an efﬁcient decoding, we derived the steady-state update equation by replacing the adaptive Kalman gain by its steady-state formulation: K = (I + WCQ−1 C)−1 W CT Q−1 . This yields the following estimate of the system’s state: xt = (I − KC)Axt−1 + Kyt = MDT xt−1 + MDT yt , x y 4 (9) a Velocity (cm/s) Neuron 10 c 150 5 100 b 50 20 0 −20 0 0 x−velocity y−velocity 2000 4000 6000 8000 Time (ms) 10000 12000 1cm 14000 Trials: 0034-0049 Figure 2: Neural and kinematic measurements (monkey J, 2011-04-16, 16 continuous trials) used to ﬁt the standard Kalman ﬁlter model. a.

Cursor kinematics of 16 continuous trials under direct hand control. where MDT = (I − KC)A and MDT = K are the discrete time (DT) Kalman matrices. The steadyx y state formulation improves efﬁciency with little loss in accuracy because the optimal Kalman gain rapidly converges (typically less than 100 iterations). Indeed, in neural applications under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions, the difference between the full Kalman ﬁlter and its steadystate implementation falls to within 1% in a few seconds [17]. This simplifying assumption reduces the execution time for decoding a typical neuronal ﬁring rate signal approximately seven-fold [17], a critical speed-up for real-time applications. 4 Kalman ﬁlter with a spiking neural network To implement the Kalman ﬁlter with a SNN by applying the NEF, we ﬁrst convert Equation 9 from DT to continuous time (CT), and then replace the CT matrices with neurally plausible ones, which yields: x(t) = h(t) ∗ A x(t) + B y(t) , (10) where A = τMCT + I, B = τMCT , with MCT = MDT − I /∆t and MCT = MDT /∆t, the CT x y x x y y Kalman matrices, and ∆t = 50ms, the discrete time step; τ is the synaptic time-constant. The jth neuron’s input current (see Equation 3) is computed from the system’s current state, x(t), which is computed from estimates of the system’s previous state (ˆ (t) = ∑i ai (t)φix ) and current x y input (ˆ (t) = ∑k bk (t)φk ) using Equation 10. This yields: y ˜x J j (x(t)) = α j φ j · x(t) + J bias j ˜x ˆ ˆ = α j φ j · h(t) ∗ A x(t) + B y(t) ˜x = α j φ j · h(t) ∗ A + J bias j ∑ ai (t)φix + B ∑ bk (t)φky i + J bias j (11) k This last equation can be written in a neural network form: J j (x(t)) = h(t) ∗ ∑ ω ji ai (t) + ∑ ω jk bk (t) i + J bias j (12) k y ˜x ˜x where ω ji = α j φ j A φix and ω jk = α j φ j B φk are the recurrent and feedforward weights, respectively. 5 Efﬁcient implementation of the SNN In this section, we describe the two distinct steps carried out when implementing the SNN: creating and running the network. The ﬁrst step has no computational constraints whereas the second must be very efﬁcient in order to be successfully deployed in the closed-loop experimental setting. 5 x ( 1000 x ( = 1000 1000 = 1000 x 1000 b 1000 x 1000 1000 a Figure 3: Computing a 1000-neuron pool’s recurrent connections. a. Using connection weights requires multiplying a 1000×1000 matrix by a 1000 ×1 vector. b. Operating in the lower-dimensional state space requires multiplying a 1 × 1000 vector by a 1000 × 1 vector to get the decoded state, multiplying this state by a component of the A matrix to update it, and multiplying the updated state by a 1000 × 1 vector to re-encode it as ﬁring rates, which are then used to update the soma current for every neuron. Network creation: This step generates, for a speciﬁed number of neurons composing the network, x ˜x the gain α j , bias current J bias , preferred direction φ j , and decoding weight φ j for each neuron. The j ˜x preferred directions φ j are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution over the unit sphere. The maximum ﬁring rate, max G(J j (x)), and the normalized x-axis intercept, G(J j (x)) = 0, are drawn randomly from a uniform distribution on [200, 400] Hz and [-1, 1], respectively. From these two speciﬁcations, α j and J bias are computed using Equation 2 and Equation 3. The decoding weights j x φ j are computed by minimizing the mean square error (Equation 6). For efﬁcient implementation, we used two 1D integrators (i.e., two recurrent neuron pools, with each pool representing a scalar) rather than a single 3D integrator (i.e., one recurrent neuron pool, with the pool representing a 3D vector by itself) [13]. The constant 1 is fed to the 1D integrators as an input, rather than continuously integrated as part of the state vector. We also replaced the bk (t) units’ spike rates (Figure 1, middle) with the 192 neural measurements (spike counts in 50ms bins), y which is equivalent to choosing φk from a standard basis (i.e., a unit vector with 1 at the kth position and 0 everywhere else) [7]. Network simulation: This step runs the simulation to update the soma current for every neuron, based on input spikes. The soma voltage is then updated following RC circuit dynamics. Gaussian noise is normally added at this step, the rest of the simulation being noiseless. Neurons with soma voltage above threshold generate a spike and enter their refractory period. The neuron ﬁring rates are decoded using the linear decoding weights to get the updated states values, x and y-velocity. These values are smoothed with a ﬁlter identical to h(t), but with τ set to 5ms instead of 20ms to avoid introducing signiﬁcant delay. Then the simulation step starts over again. In order to ensure rapid execution of the simulation step, neuron interactions are not updated dix rectly using the connection matrix (Equation 12), but rather indirectly with the decoding matrix φ j , ˜x dynamics matrix A , and preferred direction matrix φ j (Equation 11). To see why this is more efﬁcient, suppose we have 1000 neurons in the a population for each of the state vector’s two scalars. Computing the recurrent connections using connection weights requires multiplying a 1000 × 1000 matrix by a 1000-dimensional vector (Figure 3a). This requires 106 multiplications and about 106 sums. Decoding each scalar (i.e., ∑i ai (t)φix ), however, requires only 1000 multiplications and 1000 sums. The decoded state vector is then updated by multiplying it by the (diagonal) A matrix, another 2 products and 1 sum. The updated state vector is then encoded by multiplying it with the neurons’ preferred direction vectors, another 1000 multiplications per scalar (Figure 3b). The resulting total of about 3000 operations is nearly three orders of magnitude fewer than using the connection weights to compute the identical transformation. To measure the speedup, we simulated a 2,000-neuron network on a computer running Matlab 2011a (Intel Core i7, 2.7-GHz, Mac OS X Lion). Although the exact run-times depend on the computing hardware and software, the run-time reduction factor should remain approximately constant across platforms. For each reported result, we ran the simulation 10 times to obtain a reliable estimate of the execution time. The run-time for neuron interactions using the recurrent connection weights was 9.9ms and dropped to 2.7µs in the lower-dimensional space, approximately a 3,500-fold speedup. Only the recurrent interactions beneﬁt from the speedup, the execution time for the rest of the operations remaining constant. The run-time for a 50ms network simulation using the recurrent connec6 Table 1: Model parameters Symbol max G(J j (x)) G(J j (x)) = 0 J bias j αj ˜x φj Range 200-400 Hz −1 to 1 Satisﬁes ﬁrst two Satisﬁes ﬁrst two ˜x φj = 1 Description Maximum ﬁring rate Normalized x-axis intercept Bias current Gain factor Preferred-direction vector σ2 τ RC j τ ref j τ PSC j 0.1 20 ms 1 ms 20 ms Gaussian noise variance RC time constant Refractory period PSC time constant tion weights was 0.94s and dropped to 0.0198s in the lower-dimensional space, a 47-fold speedup. These results demonstrate the efﬁciency the lower-dimensional space offers, which made the closedloop application of SNNs possible. 6 Closed-loop implementation An adult male rhesus macaque (monkey J) was trained to perform a center-out-and-back reaching task for juice rewards to one of eight targets, with a 500ms hold time (Figure 4a) [1]. All animal protocols and procedures were approved by the Stanford Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Hand position was measured using a Polaris optical tracking system at 60Hz (Northern Digital Inc.). Neural data were recorded from two 96-electrode silicon arrays (Blackrock Microsystems) implanted in the dorsal pre-motor and motor cortex. These recordings (-4.5 RMS threshold crossing applied to each electrode’s signal) yielded tuned activity for the direction and speed of arm movements. As detailed in [1], a standard Kalman ﬁlter model was ﬁt by correlating the observed hand kinematics with the simultaneously measured neural signals, while the monkey moved his arm to acquire virtual targets (Figure 2). The resulting model was used in a closed-loop system to control an on-screen cursor in real-time (Figure 4a, Decoder block). A steady-state version of this model serves as the standard against which the SNN implementation’s performance is compared. We built a SNN using the NEF methodology based on derived Kalman ﬁlter parameters mentioned above. This SNN was then simulated on an xPC Target (Mathworks) x86 system (Dell T3400, Intel Core 2 Duo E8600, 3.33GHz). It ran in closed-loop, replacing the standard Kalman ﬁlter as the decoder block in Figure 4a. The parameter values listed in Table 1 were used for the SNN implementation. We ensured that the time constants τiRC ,τiref , and τiPSC were smaller than the implementation’s time step (50ms). Noise was not explicitly added. It arose naturally from the ﬂuctuations produced by representing a scalar with ﬁltered spike trains, which has been shown to have effects similar to Gaussian noise [11]. For the purpose of computing the linear decoding weights (i.e., Γ), we modeled the resulting noise as Gaussian with a variance of 0.1. A 2,000-neuron version of the SNN-based decoder was tested in a closed-loop system, the largest network our embedded MatLab implementation could run in real-time. There were 1206 trials total among which 301 (center-outs only) were performed with the SNN and 302 with the standard (steady-state) Kalman ﬁlter. The block structure was randomized and interleaved, so that there is no behavioral bias present in the ﬁndings. 100 trials under hand control are used as a baseline comparison. Success corresponds to a target acquisition under 1500ms, with 500ms hold time. Success rates were higher than 99% on all blocks for the SNN implementation and 100% for the standard Kalman ﬁlter. The average time to acquire the target was slightly slower for the SNN (Figure 5b)—711ms vs. 661ms, respectively—we believe this could be improved by using more neurons in the SNN.1 The average distance to target (Figure 5a) and the average velocity of the cursor (Figure 5c) are very similar. 1 Off-line, the SNN performed better as we increased the number of neurons [7]. 7 a Neural Spikes b c BMI: Kalman decoder BMI: SNN decoder Decoder Cursor Velocity 1cm 1cm Trials: 2056-2071 Trials: 1748-1763 5 0 0 400 Time after Target Onset (ms) 800 Target acquisition time histogram 40 Mean cursor velocity 50 Standard Kalman filter 40 20 Hand 30 30 Spiking Neural Network 20 10 0 c Cursor Velocity (cm/s) b Mean distance to target 10 Percent of Trials (%) a Distance to Target (cm) Figure 4: Experimental setup and results. a.

The 2,000-neuron network had success rates higher than 99% on all blocks, with mean distance to target, target acquisition time, and mean cursor velocity curves very similar to the ones obtained with the standard implementation. Future work will explore whether these results extend to additional animals. As the Kalman ﬁlter and its variants are the state-of-the-art in cortically-controlled motor prostheses [1]-[5], these simulations provide conﬁdence that similar levels of performance can be attained with a neuromorphic system, which can potentially overcome the power constraints set by clinical applications. Our ultimate goal is to develop an ultra-low-power neuromorphic chip for prosthetic applications on to which control theory algorithms can be mapped using the NEF. As our next step in this direction, we will begin exploring this mapping with Neurogrid, a hardware platform with sixteen programmable neuromorphic chips that can simulate up to a million spiking neurons in real-time [9]. However, bandwidth limitations prevent Neurogrid from realizing random connectivity patterns. It can only connect each neuron to thousands of others if neighboring neurons share common inputs — just as they do in the cortex. Such columnar organization may be possible with NEF-generated networks if preferred directions vectors are assigned topographically rather than randomly. Implementing this constraint effectively is a subject of ongoing research. Acknowledgment This work was supported in part by the Belgian American Education Foundation(J.

Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of many neurons embedded within a recurrentlyconnected cortical network may provide concurrent views into the dynamical processes of that network, and thus its computational function. In principle, these dynamics might be identiﬁed by purely unsupervised, statistical means. Here, we show that a Hidden Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (HSLDS) model— in which multiple linear dynamical laws approximate a nonlinear and potentially non-stationary dynamical process—is able to distinguish different dynamical regimes within single-trial motor cortical activity associated with the preparation and initiation of hand movements. The regimes are identiﬁed without reference to behavioural or experimental epochs, but nonetheless transitions between them correlate strongly with external events whose timing may vary from trial to trial. The HSLDS model also performs better than recent comparable models in predicting the ﬁring rate of an isolated neuron based on the ﬁring rates of others, suggesting that it captures more of the “shared variance” of the data. Thus, the method is able to trace the dynamical processes underlying the coordinated evolution of network activity in a way that appears to reﬂect its computational role. 1</p><p>6 0.67716837 <a title="224-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Information_Rates_and_Optimal_Decoding_in_Large_Neural_Populations.html">135 nips-2011-Information Rates and Optimal Decoding in Large Neural Populations</a></p>

<p>Author: Emin Orhan, Robert A. Jacobs</p><p>Abstract: Extensive evidence suggests that items are not encoded independently in visual short-term memory (VSTM). However, previous research has not quantitatively considered how the encoding of an item inﬂuences the encoding of other items. Here, we model the dependencies among VSTM representations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution with a stimulus-dependent mean and covariance matrix. We report the results of an experiment designed to determine the speciﬁc form of the stimulus-dependence of the mean and the covariance matrix. We ﬁnd that the magnitude of the covariance between the representations of two items is a monotonically decreasing function of the difference between the items’ feature values, similar to a Gaussian process with a distance-dependent, stationary kernel function. We further show that this type of covariance function can be explained as a natural consequence of encoding multiple stimuli in a population of neurons with correlated responses. 1</p><p>2 0.93321908 <a title="224-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Reconstructing_Patterns_of_Information_Diffusion_from_Incomplete_Observations.html">234 nips-2011-Reconstructing Patterns of Information Diffusion from Incomplete Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Flavio Chierichetti, David Liben-nowell, Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by the spread of on-line information in general and on-line petitions in particular, recent research has raised the following combinatorial estimation problem. There is a tree T that we cannot observe directly (representing the structure along which the information has spread), and certain nodes randomly decide to make their copy of the information public. In the case of a petition, the list of names on each public copy of the petition also reveals a path leading back to the root of the tree. What can we conclude about the properties of the tree we observe from these revealed paths, and can we use the structure of the observed tree to estimate the size of the full unobserved tree T ? Here we provide the ﬁrst algorithm for this size estimation task, together with provable guarantees on its performance. We also establish structural properties of the observed tree, providing the ﬁrst rigorous explanation for some of the unusual structural phenomena present in the spread of real chain-letter petitions on the Internet. 1</p><p>3 0.89095986 <a title="224-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Message-Passing_for_Approximate_MAP_Inference_with_Latent_Variables.html">170 nips-2011-Message-Passing for Approximate MAP Inference with Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiarong Jiang, Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: We consider a general inference setting for discrete probabilistic graphical models where we seek maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subset of the random variables (max nodes), marginalizing over the rest (sum nodes). We present a hybrid message-passing algorithm to accomplish this. The hybrid algorithm passes a mix of sum and max messages depending on the type of source node (sum or max). We derive our algorithm by showing that it falls out as the solution of a particular relaxation of a variational framework. We further show that the Expectation Maximization algorithm can be seen as an approximation to our algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets, against several baselines, demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our proposed algorithm. 1</p><p>4 0.87101054 <a title="224-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Gaussian_Process_Training_with_Input_Noise.html">100 nips-2011-Gaussian Process Training with Input Noise</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Mchutchon, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: In standard Gaussian Process regression input locations are assumed to be noise free. We present a simple yet effective GP model for training on input points corrupted by i.i.d. Gaussian noise. To make computations tractable we use a local linear expansion about each input point. This allows the input noise to be recast as output noise proportional to the squared gradient of the GP posterior mean. The input noise variances are inferred from the data as extra hyperparameters. They are trained alongside other hyperparameters by the usual method of maximisation of the marginal likelihood. Training uses an iterative scheme, which alternates between optimising the hyperparameters and calculating the posterior gradient. Analytic predictive moments can then be found for Gaussian distributed test points. We compare our model to others over a range of different regression problems and show that it improves over current methods. 1</p><p>5 0.84861112 <a title="224-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Hashing_Algorithms_for_Large-Scale_Learning.html">111 nips-2011-Hashing Algorithms for Large-Scale Learning</a></p>

In this paper, we demonstrate that b-bit minwise hashing can be naturally integrated with linear learning algorithms such as linear SVM and logistic regression, to solve large-scale and high-dimensional statistical learning tasks, especially when the data do not ﬁt in memory. We compare b-bit minwise hashing with the Count-Min (CM) and Vowpal Wabbit (VW) algorithms, which have essentially the same variances as random projections. Our theoretical and empirical comparisons illustrate that b-bit minwise hashing is signiﬁcantly more accurate (at the same storage cost) than VW (and random projections) for binary data.</p><p>6 0.6952343 <a title="224-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Metric_Learning_with_Multiple_Kernels.html">171 nips-2011-Metric Learning with Multiple Kernels</a></p>

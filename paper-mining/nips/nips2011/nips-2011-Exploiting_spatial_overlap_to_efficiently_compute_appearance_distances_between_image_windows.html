<p>Author: Zhen Li, Huazhong Ning, Liangliang Cao, Tong Zhang, Yihong Gong, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional similarity search in large scale databases becomes an important challenge due to the advent of Internet. For such applications, specialized data structures are required to achieve computational efﬁciency. Traditional approaches relied on algorithmic constructions that are often data independent (such as Locality Sensitive Hashing) or weakly dependent (such as kd-trees, k-means trees). While supervised learning algorithms have been applied to related problems, those proposed in the literature mainly focused on learning hash codes optimized for compact embedding of the data rather than search efﬁciency. Consequently such an embedding has to be used with linear scan or another search algorithm. Hence learning to hash does not directly address the search efﬁciency issue. This paper considers a new framework that applies supervised learning to directly optimize a data structure that supports efﬁcient large scale search. Our approach takes both search quality and computational cost into consideration. Speciﬁcally, we learn a boosted search forest that is optimized using pair-wise similarity labeled examples. The output of this search forest can be efﬁciently converted into an inverted indexing data structure, which can leverage modern text search infrastructure to achieve both scalability and efﬁciency. Experimental results show that our approach signiﬁcantly outperforms the start-of-the-art learning to hash methods (such as spectral hashing), as well as state-of-the-art high dimensional search algorithms (such as LSH and k-means trees).</p><p>3 0.19260351 <a title="91-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>4 0.13888967 <a title="91-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Maximum_Margin_Multi-Instance_Learning.html">168 nips-2011-Maximum Margin Multi-Instance Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua Wang, Heng Huang, Farhad Kamangar, Feiping Nie, Chris H. Ding</p><p>Abstract: Multi-instance learning (MIL) considers input as bags of instances, in which labels are assigned to the bags. MIL is useful in many real-world applications. For example, in image categorization semantic meanings (labels) of an image mostly arise from its regions (instances) instead of the entire image (bag). Existing MIL methods typically build their models using the Bag-to-Bag (B2B) distance, which are often computationally expensive and may not truly reﬂect the semantic similarities. To tackle this, in this paper we approach MIL problems from a new perspective using the Class-to-Bag (C2B) distance, which directly assesses the relationships between the classes and the bags. Taking into account the two major challenges in MIL, high heterogeneity on data and weak label association, we propose a novel Maximum Margin Multi-Instance Learning (M3 I) approach to parameterize the C2B distance by introducing the class speciﬁc distance metrics and the locally adaptive signiﬁcance coefﬁcients. We apply our new approach to the automatic image categorization tasks on three (one single-label and two multilabel) benchmark data sets. Extensive experiments have demonstrated promising results that validate the proposed method.</p><p>5 0.12004635 <a title="91-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Heavy-tailed_Distances_for_Gradient_Based_Image_Descriptors.html">112 nips-2011-Heavy-tailed Distances for Gradient Based Image Descriptors</a></p>
<p>Author: Yangqing Jia, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Many applications in computer vision measure the similarity between images or image patches based on some statistics such as oriented gradients. These are often modeled implicitly or explicitly with a Gaussian noise assumption, leading to the use of the Euclidean distance when comparing image descriptors. In this paper, we show that the statistics of gradient based image descriptors often follow a heavy-tailed distribution, which undermines any principled motivation for the use of Euclidean distances. We advocate for the use of a distance measure based on the likelihood ratio test with appropriate probabilistic models that ﬁt the empirical data distribution. We instantiate this similarity measure with the Gammacompound-Laplace distribution, and show signiﬁcant improvement over existing distance measures in the application of SIFT feature matching, at relatively low computational cost. 1</p><p>6 0.11978561 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Im2Text%3A_Describing_Images_Using_1_Million_Captioned_Photographs.html">126 nips-2011-Im2Text: Describing Images Using 1 Million Captioned Photographs</a></p>

We derive an upper bound on appearance distance given the spatial overlap of two windows in an image, and use it to bound the distances of many pairs between two images. We propose algorithms that build on these basic operations to efﬁciently solve tasks relevant to many computer vision applications, such as ﬁnding all pairs of windows between two images with distance smaller than a threshold, or ﬁnding the single pair with the smallest distance. In experiments on the PASCAL VOC 07 dataset, our algorithms accurately solve these problems while greatly reducing the number of appearance distances computed, and achieve larger speedups than approximate nearest neighbour algorithms based on trees [18] and on hashing [21]. For example, our algorithm ﬁnds the most similar pair of windows between two images while computing only 1% of all distances on average. 1</p><p>3 0.85945487 <a title="91-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Selecting_the_State-Representation_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">245 nips-2011-Selecting the State-Representation in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Odalric-ambrym Maillard, Daniil Ryabko, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of selecting the right state-representation in a reinforcement learning problem is considered. Several models (functions mapping past observations to a ﬁnite set) of the observations are given, and it is known that for at least one of these models the resulting state dynamics are indeed Markovian. Without knowing neither which of the models is the correct one, nor what are the probabilistic characteristics of the resulting MDP, it is required to obtain as much reward as the optimal policy for the correct model (or for the best of the correct models, if there are several). We propose an algorithm that achieves that, with a regret of order T 2/3 where T is the horizon time. 1</p><p>4 0.85921621 <a title="91-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons.html">22 nips-2011-Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects). In general, the ranking of n objects can be identiﬁed by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reﬂect their relative distances from a common reference point in Rd . We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis. 1</p><p>5 0.8546766 <a title="91-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Matrix_Completion_for_Multi-label_Image_Classification.html">165 nips-2011-Matrix Completion for Multi-label Image Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo S. Cabral, Fernando Torre, Joao P. Costeira, Alexandre Bernardino</p><p>Abstract: Recently, image categorization has been an active research topic due to the urgent need to retrieve and browse digital images via semantic keywords. This paper formulates image categorization as a multi-label classiﬁcation problem using recent advances in matrix completion. Under this setting, classiﬁcation of testing data is posed as a problem of completing unknown label entries on a data matrix that concatenates training and testing features with training labels. We propose two convex algorithms for matrix completion based on a Rank Minimization criterion speciﬁcally tailored to visual data, and prove its convergence properties. A major advantage of our approach w.r.t. standard discriminative classiﬁcation methods for image categorization is its robustness to outliers, background noise and partial occlusions both in the feature and label space. Experimental validation on several datasets shows how our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, while effectively capturing semantic concepts of classes. 1</p><p>6 0.85275221 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_a_Network.html">150 nips-2011-Learning a Distance Metric from a Network</a></p>

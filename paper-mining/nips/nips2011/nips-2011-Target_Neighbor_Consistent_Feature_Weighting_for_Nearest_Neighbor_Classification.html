<p>Author: Dominique Tschopp, Suhas Diggavi, Payam Delgosha, Soheil Mohajer</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of ﬁnding the nearest neighbor (or one of the R-nearest neighbors) of a query object q in a database of n objects, when we can only use a comparison oracle. The comparison oracle, given two reference objects and a query object, returns the reference object most similar to the query object. The main problem we study is how to search the database for the nearest neighbor (NN) of a query, while minimizing the questions. The difﬁculty of this problem depends on properties of the underlying database. We show the importance of a characterization: combinatorial disorder D which deﬁnes approximate triangle n inequalities on ranks. We present a lower bound of Ω(D log D + D2 ) average number of questions in the search phase for any randomized algorithm, which demonstrates the fundamental role of D for worst case behavior. We develop 3 a randomized scheme for NN retrieval in O(D3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) 3 questions. The learning requires asking O(nD3 log2 n + D log2 n log log nD ) questions and O(n log2 n/ log(2D)) bits to store.</p><p>3 0.1369637 <a title="279-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Crowdclustering.html">66 nips-2011-Crowdclustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan G. Gomes, Peter Welinder, Andreas Krause, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Is it possible to crowdsource categorization? Amongst the challenges: (a) each worker has only a partial view of the data, (b) different workers may have different clustering criteria and may produce different numbers of categories, (c) the underlying category structure may be hierarchical. We propose a Bayesian model of how workers may approach clustering and show how one may infer clusters / categories, as well as worker parameters, using this model. Our experiments, carried out on large collections of images, suggest that Bayesian crowdclustering works well and may be superior to single-expert annotations. 1</p><p>4 0.12855271 <a title="279-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Variational_Gaussian_Process_Dynamical_Systems.html">301 nips-2011-Variational Gaussian Process Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Michalis K. Titsias, Andreas Damianou</p><p>Abstract: High dimensional time series are endemic in applications of machine learning such as robotics (sensor data), computational biology (gene expression data), vision (video sequences) and graphics (motion capture data). Practical nonlinear probabilistic approaches to this data are required. In this paper we introduce the variational Gaussian process dynamical system. Our work builds on recent variational approximations for Gaussian process latent variable models to allow for nonlinear dimensionality reduction simultaneously with learning a dynamical prior in the latent space. The approach also allows for the appropriate dimensionality of the latent space to be automatically determined. We demonstrate the model on a human motion capture data set and a series of high resolution video sequences. 1</p><p>5 0.081812441 <a title="279-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">53 nips-2011-Co-Training for Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Minmin Chen, Kilian Q. Weinberger, John Blitzer</p><p>Abstract: Domain adaptation algorithms seek to generalize a model trained in a source domain to a new target domain. In many practical cases, the source and target distributions can differ substantially, and in some cases crucial target features may not have support in the source domain. In this paper we introduce an algorithm that bridges the gap between source and target domains by slowly adding to the training set both the target features and instances in which the current algorithm is the most conﬁdent. Our algorithm is a variant of co-training [7], and we name it CODA (Co-training for domain adaptation). Unlike the original co-training work, we do not assume a particular feature split. Instead, for each iteration of cotraining, we formulate a single optimization problem which simultaneously learns a target predictor, a split of the feature space into views, and a subset of source and target features to include in the predictor. CODA signiﬁcantly out-performs the state-of-the-art on the 12-domain benchmark data set of Blitzer et al. [4]. Indeed, over a wide range (65 of 84 comparisons) of target supervision CODA achieves the best performance. 1</p><p>6 0.074498177 <a title="279-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Tree_of_Metrics_with_Disjoint_Visual_Features.html">151 nips-2011-Learning a Tree of Metrics with Disjoint Visual Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoonho Hwang, Hee-kap Ahn</p><p>Abstract: Given a set V of n vectors in d-dimensional space, we provide an efﬁcient method for computing quality upper and lower bounds of the Euclidean distances between a pair of vectors in V . For this purpose, we deﬁne a distance measure, called the MS-distance, by using the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V . Once we compute the mean and the standard deviation values of vectors in V in O(dn) time, the MS-distance provides upper and lower bounds of Euclidean distance between any pair of vectors in V in constant time. Furthermore, these bounds can be reﬁned further in such a way to converge monotonically to the exact Euclidean distance within d reﬁnement steps. An analysis on a random sequence of reﬁnement steps shows that the MS-distance provides very tight bounds in only a few reﬁnement steps. The MS-distance can be used to various applications where the Euclidean distance is used to measure the proximity or similarity between objects. We provide experimental results on the nearest and the farthest neighbor searches. 1</p><p>3 0.51457691 <a title="279-lsi-3" href="./nips-2011-Co-Training_for_Domain_Adaptation.html">53 nips-2011-Co-Training for Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Modern classiﬁcation tasks usually involve many class labels and can be informed by a broad range of features. Many of these tasks are tackled by constructing a set of classiﬁers, which are then applied at test time and then pieced together in a ﬁxed procedure determined in advance or at training time. We present an active classiﬁcation process at the test time, where each classiﬁer in a large ensemble is viewed as a potential observation that might inform our classiﬁcation process. Observations are then selected dynamically based on previous observations, using a value-theoretic computation that balances an estimate of the expected classiﬁcation gain from each observation as well as its computational cost. The expected classiﬁcation gain is computed using a probabilistic model that uses the outcome from previous observations. This active classiﬁcation process is applied at test time for each individual test instance, resulting in an efﬁcient instance-speciﬁc decision path. We demonstrate the beneﬁt of the active scheme on various real-world datasets, and show that it can achieve comparable or even higher classiﬁcation accuracy at a fraction of the computational costs of traditional methods.</p><p>5 0.50134593 <a title="279-lsi-5" href="./nips-2011-Scalable_Training_of_Mixture_Models_via_Coresets.html">241 nips-2011-Scalable Training of Mixture Models via Coresets</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Feldman, Matthew Faulkner, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: How can we train a statistical mixture model on a massive data set? In this paper, we show how to construct coresets for mixtures of Gaussians and natural generalizations. A coreset is a weighted subset of the data, which guarantees that models ﬁtting the coreset will also provide a good ﬁt for the original data set. We show that, perhaps surprisingly, Gaussian mixtures admit coresets of size independent of the size of the data set. More precisely, we prove that a weighted set of O(dk3 /ε2 ) data points sufﬁces for computing a (1 + ε)-approximation for the optimal model on the original n data points. Moreover, such coresets can be efﬁciently constructed in a map-reduce style computation, as well as in a streaming setting. Our results rely on a novel reduction of statistical estimation to problems in computational geometry, as well as new complexity results about mixtures of Gaussians. We empirically evaluate our algorithms on several real data sets, including a density estimation problem in the context of earthquake detection using accelerometers in mobile phones. 1</p><p>6 0.47027183 <a title="279-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Learning_a_Tree_of_Metrics_with_Disjoint_Visual_Features.html">151 nips-2011-Learning a Tree of Metrics with Disjoint Visual Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Joseph Keshet, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: We consider latent structural versions of probit loss and ramp loss. We show that these surrogate loss functions are consistent in the strong sense that for any feature map (ﬁnite or inﬁnite dimensional) they yield predictors approaching the inﬁmum task loss achievable by any linear predictor over the given features. We also give ﬁnite sample generalization bounds (convergence rates) for these loss functions. These bounds suggest that probit loss converges more rapidly. However, ramp loss is more easily optimized on a given sample. 1</p><p>2 0.72280502 <a title="279-lda-2" href="./nips-2011-Multi-armed_bandits_on_implicit_metric_spaces.html">177 nips-2011-Multi-armed bandits on implicit metric spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Aleksandrs Slivkins</p><p>Abstract: The multi-armed bandit (MAB) setting is a useful abstraction of many online learning tasks which focuses on the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. In this setting, an online algorithm has a ﬁxed set of alternatives (“arms”), and in each round it selects one arm and then observes the corresponding reward. While the case of small number of arms is by now well-understood, a lot of recent work has focused on multi-armed bandits with (inﬁnitely) many arms, where one needs to assume extra structure in order to make the problem tractable. In particular, in the Lipschitz MAB problem there is an underlying similarity metric space, known to the algorithm, such that any two arms that are close in this metric space have similar payoffs. In this paper we consider the more realistic scenario in which the metric space is implicit – it is deﬁned by the available structure but not revealed to the algorithm directly. Speciﬁcally, we assume that an algorithm is given a tree-based classiﬁcation of arms. For any given problem instance such a classiﬁcation implicitly deﬁnes a similarity metric space, but the numerical similarity information is not available to the algorithm. We provide an algorithm for this setting, whose performance guarantees (almost) match the best known guarantees for the corresponding instance of the Lipschitz MAB problem. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71306384 <a title="279-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Target_Neighbor_Consistent_Feature_Weighting_for_Nearest_Neighbor_Classification.html">279 nips-2011-Target Neighbor Consistent Feature Weighting for Nearest Neighbor Classification</a></p>

This issue, called the target neighbor change, was not properly addressed in the existing feature weighting and metric learning literature. In this paper, we propose a novel feature weighting algorithm that can exactly and efﬁciently keep track of the correct target neighbors via sequential quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst algorithm that guarantees the consistency between target neighbors and the feature space metric. We further show that the proposed algorithm can be naturally combined with regularization path tracking, allowing computationally efﬁcient selection of the regularization parameter. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm through experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.66882282 <a title="279-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Dynamical_segmentation_of_single_trials_from_population_neural_data.html">75 nips-2011-Dynamical segmentation of single trials from population neural data</a></p>

Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Simultaneous recordings of many neurons embedded within a recurrentlyconnected cortical network may provide concurrent views into the dynamical processes of that network, and thus its computational function. In principle, these dynamics might be identiﬁed by purely unsupervised, statistical means. Here, we show that a Hidden Switching Linear Dynamical Systems (HSLDS) model— in which multiple linear dynamical laws approximate a nonlinear and potentially non-stationary dynamical process—is able to distinguish different dynamical regimes within single-trial motor cortical activity associated with the preparation and initiation of hand movements. The regimes are identiﬁed without reference to behavioural or experimental epochs, but nonetheless transitions between them correlate strongly with external events whose timing may vary from trial to trial. The HSLDS model also performs better than recent comparable models in predicting the ﬁring rate of an isolated neuron based on the ﬁring rates of others, suggesting that it captures more of the “shared variance” of the data. Thus, the method is able to trace the dynamical processes underlying the coordinated evolution of network activity in a way that appears to reﬂect its computational role. 1</p><p>5 0.60893232 <a title="279-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Active_Ranking_using_Pairwise_Comparisons.html">22 nips-2011-Active Ranking using Pairwise Comparisons</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin G. Jamieson, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the problem of ranking a collection of objects using pairwise comparisons (rankings of two objects). In general, the ranking of n objects can be identiﬁed by standard sorting methods using n log2 n pairwise comparisons. We are interested in natural situations in which relationships among the objects may allow for ranking using far fewer pairwise comparisons. Speciﬁcally, we assume that the objects can be embedded into a d-dimensional Euclidean space and that the rankings reﬂect their relative distances from a common reference point in Rd . We show that under this assumption the number of possible rankings grows like n2d and demonstrate an algorithm that can identify a randomly selected ranking using just slightly more than d log n adaptively selected pairwise comparisons, on average. If instead the comparisons are chosen at random, then almost all pairwise comparisons must be made in order to identify any ranking. In addition, we propose a robust, error-tolerant algorithm that only requires that the pairwise comparisons are probably correct. Experimental studies with synthetic and real datasets support the conclusions of our theoretical analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.60853845 <a title="279-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Multiple_Instance_Filtering.html">180 nips-2011-Multiple Instance Filtering</a></p>

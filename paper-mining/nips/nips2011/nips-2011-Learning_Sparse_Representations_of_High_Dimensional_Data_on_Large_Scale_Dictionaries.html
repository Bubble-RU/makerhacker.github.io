<p>Author: Mohammad J. Saberian, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multi-class boosting is considered. A new framework, based on multi-dimensional codewords and predictors is introduced. The optimal set of codewords is derived, and a margin enforcing loss proposed. The resulting risk is minimized by gradient descent on a multidimensional functional space. Two algorithms are proposed: 1) CD-MCBoost, based on coordinate descent, updates one predictor component at a time, 2) GD-MCBoost, based on gradient descent, updates all components jointly. The algorithms differ in the weak learners that they support but are both shown to be 1) Bayes consistent, 2) margin enforcing, and 3) convergent to the global minimum of the risk. They also reduce to AdaBoost when there are only two classes. Experiments show that both methods outperform previous multiclass boosting approaches on a number of datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.20720872 <a title="149-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Estimation_with_Structured_Dictionaries.html">259 nips-2011-Sparse Estimation with Structured Dictionaries</a></p>
<p>Author: David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: In the vast majority of recent work on sparse estimation algorithms, performance has been evaluated using ideal or quasi-ideal dictionaries (e.g., random Gaussian or Fourier) characterized by unit ℓ2 norm, incoherent columns or features. But in reality, these types of dictionaries represent only a subset of the dictionaries that are actually used in practice (largely restricted to idealized compressive sensing applications). In contrast, herein sparse estimation is considered in the context of structured dictionaries possibly exhibiting high coherence between arbitrary groups of columns and/or rows. Sparse penalized regression models are analyzed with the purpose of ﬁnding, to the extent possible, regimes of dictionary invariant performance. In particular, a Type II Bayesian estimator with a dictionarydependent sparsity penalty is shown to have a number of desirable invariance properties leading to provable advantages over more conventional penalties such as the ℓ1 norm, especially in areas where existing theoretical recovery guarantees no longer hold. This can translate into improved performance in applications such as model selection with correlated features, source localization, and compressive sensing with constrained measurement directions. 1</p><p>4 0.20558801 <a title="149-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ioannis A. Gkioulekas, Todd Zickler</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach for linear unsupervised dimensionality reduction, based on the sparse linear model that has been used to probabilistically interpret sparse coding. We formulate an optimization problem for learning a linear projection from the original signal domain to a lower-dimensional one in a way that approximately preserves, in expectation, pairwise inner products in the sparse domain. We derive solutions to the problem, present nonlinear extensions, and discuss relations to compressed sensing. Our experiments using facial images, texture patches, and images of object categories suggest that the approach can improve our ability to recover meaningful structure in many classes of signals. 1</p><p>5 0.14707074 <a title="149-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur D. Szlam, Karol Gregor, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: This work describes a conceptually simple method for structured sparse coding and dictionary design. Supposing a dictionary with K atoms, we introduce a structure as a set of penalties or interactions between every pair of atoms. We describe modiﬁcations of standard sparse coding algorithms for inference in this setting, and describe experiments showing that these algorithms are efﬁcient. We show that interesting dictionaries can be learned for interactions that encode tree structures or locally connected structures. Finally, we show that our framework allows us to learn the values of the interactions from the data, rather than having them pre-speciﬁed. 1</p><p>6 0.14632045 <a title="149-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Hierarchical_Matching_Pursuit_for_Image_Classification%3A_Architecture_and_Fast_Algorithms.html">113 nips-2011-Hierarchical Matching Pursuit for Image Classification: Architecture and Fast Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Xiaofeng Ren, Dieter Fox</p><p>Abstract: Extracting good representations from images is essential for many computer vision tasks. In this paper, we propose hierarchical matching pursuit (HMP), which builds a feature hierarchy layer-by-layer using an efﬁcient matching pursuit encoder. It includes three modules: batch (tree) orthogonal matching pursuit, spatial pyramid max pooling, and contrast normalization. We investigate the architecture of HMP, and show that all three components are critical for good performance. To speed up the orthogonal matching pursuit, we propose a batch tree orthogonal matching pursuit that is particularly suitable to encode a large number of observations that share the same large dictionary. HMP is scalable and can efﬁciently handle full-size images. In addition, HMP enables linear support vector machines (SVM) to match the performance of nonlinear SVM while being scalable to large datasets. We compare HMP with many state-of-the-art algorithms including convolutional deep belief networks, SIFT based single layer sparse coding, and kernel based feature learning. HMP consistently yields superior accuracy on three types of image classiﬁcation problems: object recognition (Caltech-101), scene recognition (MIT-Scene), and static event recognition (UIUC-Sports). 1</p><p>4 0.57530981 <a title="149-lsi-4" href="./nips-2011-Dimensionality_Reduction_Using_the_Sparse_Linear_Model.html">70 nips-2011-Dimensionality Reduction Using the Sparse Linear Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Nobuyuki Morioka, Shin'ichi Satoh</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding, a method of explaining sensory data with as few dictionary bases as possible, has attracted much attention in computer vision. For visual object category recognition, 1 regularized sparse coding is combined with the spatial pyramid representation to obtain state-of-the-art performance. However, because of its iterative optimization, applying sparse coding onto every local feature descriptor extracted from an image database can become a major bottleneck. To overcome this computational challenge, this paper presents “Generalized Lasso based Approximation of Sparse coding” (GLAS). By representing the distribution of sparse coefﬁcients with slice transform, we ﬁt a piece-wise linear mapping function with the generalized lasso. We also propose an efﬁcient post-reﬁnement procedure to perform mutual inhibition between bases which is essential for an overcomplete setting. The experiments show that GLAS obtains a comparable performance to 1 regularized sparse coding, yet achieves a signiﬁcant speed up demonstrating its effectiveness for large-scale visual recognition problems. 1</p><p>6 0.55912292 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-Structured_sparse_coding_via_lateral_inhibition.html">276 nips-2011-Structured sparse coding via lateral inhibition</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Dubout, Francois Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: Classical Boosting algorithms, such as AdaBoost, build a strong classiﬁer without concern about the computational cost. Some applications, in particular in computer vision, may involve up to millions of training examples and features. In such contexts, the training time may become prohibitive. Several methods exist to accelerate training, typically either by sampling the features, or the examples, used to train the weak learners. Even if those methods can precisely quantify the speed improvement they deliver, they offer no guarantee of being more efﬁcient than any other, given the same amount of time. This paper aims at shading some light on this problem, i.e. given a ﬁxed amount of time, for a particular problem, which strategy is optimal in order to reduce the training loss the most. We apply this analysis to the design of new algorithms which estimate on the ﬂy at every iteration the optimal trade-off between the number of samples and the number of features to look at in order to maximize the expected loss reduction. Experiments in object recognition with two standard computer vision data-sets show that the adaptive methods we propose outperform basic sampling and state-of-the-art bandit methods. 1</p><p>3 0.88904452 <a title="149-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-Trace_Lasso%3A_a_trace_norm_regularization_for_correlated_designs.html">289 nips-2011-Trace Lasso: a trace norm regularization for correlated designs</a></p>
<p>Author: Edouard Grave, Guillaume R. Obozinski, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Using the 1 -norm to regularize the estimation of the parameter vector of a linear model leads to an unstable estimator when covariates are highly correlated. In this paper, we introduce a new penalty function which takes into account the correlation of the design matrix to stabilize the estimation. This norm, called the trace Lasso, uses the trace norm of the selected covariates, which is a convex surrogate of their rank, as the criterion of model complexity. We analyze the properties of our norm, describe an optimization algorithm based on reweighted least-squares, and illustrate the behavior of this norm on synthetic data, showing that it is more adapted to strong correlations than competing methods such as the elastic net. 1</p><p>4 0.88349873 <a title="149-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Estimation_with_Structured_Dictionaries.html">259 nips-2011-Sparse Estimation with Structured Dictionaries</a></p>

In contrast, herein sparse estimation is considered in the context of structured dictionaries possibly exhibiting high coherence between arbitrary groups of columns and/or rows. Sparse penalized regression models are analyzed with the purpose of ﬁnding, to the extent possible, regimes of dictionary invariant performance. In particular, a Type II Bayesian estimator with a dictionarydependent sparsity penalty is shown to have a number of desirable invariance properties leading to provable advantages over more conventional penalties such as the ℓ1 norm, especially in areas where existing theoretical recovery guarantees no longer hold. This can translate into improved performance in applications such as model selection with correlated features, source localization, and compressive sensing with constrained measurement directions. 1</p><p>5 0.88068998 <a title="149-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Convergence_Rates_of_Inexact_Proximal-Gradient_Methods_for_Convex_Optimization.html">63 nips-2011-Convergence Rates of Inexact Proximal-Gradient Methods for Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Schmidt, Nicolas L. Roux, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of optimizing the sum of a smooth convex function and a non-smooth convex function using proximal-gradient methods, where an error is present in the calculation of the gradient of the smooth term or in the proximity operator with respect to the non-smooth term. We show that both the basic proximal-gradient method and the accelerated proximal-gradient method achieve the same convergence rate as in the error-free case, provided that the errors decrease at appropriate rates. Using these rates, we perform as well as or better than a carefully chosen ﬁxed error level on a set of structured sparsity problems. 1</p><p>6 0.88050544 <a title="149-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_Stochastic_Approximation_Algorithms_for_Machine_Learning.html">187 nips-2011-Non-Asymptotic Analysis of Stochastic Approximation Algorithms for Machine Learning</a></p>

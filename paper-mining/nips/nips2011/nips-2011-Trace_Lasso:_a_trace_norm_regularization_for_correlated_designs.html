<p>Author: Feng Yan, Yuan Qi</p><p>Abstract: For many real-world applications, we often need to select correlated variables— such as genetic variations and imaging features associated with Alzheimer’s disease—in a high dimensional space. The correlation between variables presents a challenge to classical variable selection methods. To address this challenge, the elastic net has been developed and successfully applied to many applications. Despite its great success, the elastic net does not exploit the correlation information embedded in the data to select correlated variables. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel hybrid model, EigenNet, that uses the eigenstructures of data to guide variable selection. Speciﬁcally, it integrates a sparse conditional classiﬁcation model with a generative model capturing variable correlations in a principled Bayesian framework. We develop an efﬁcient active-set algorithm to estimate the model via evidence maximization. Experimental results on synthetic data and imaging genetics data demonstrate the superior predictive performance of the EigenNet over the lasso, the elastic net, and the automatic relevance determination. 1</p><p>3 0.30203068 <a title="289-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2011-Robust_Lasso_with_missing_and_grossly_corrupted_observations.html">239 nips-2011-Robust Lasso with missing and grossly corrupted observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Trac D. Tran, Nam Nguyen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of accurately recovering a sparse vector β from highly corrupted linear measurements y = Xβ + e + w where e is a sparse error vector whose nonzero entries may be unbounded and w is a bounded noise. We propose a so-called extended Lasso optimization which takes into consideration sparse prior information of both β and e . Our ﬁrst result shows that the extended Lasso can faithfully recover both the regression and the corruption vectors. Our analysis is relied on a notion of extended restricted eigenvalue for the design matrix X. Our second set of results applies to a general class of Gaussian design matrix X with i.i.d rows N (0, Σ), for which we provide a surprising phenomenon: the extended Lasso can recover exact signed supports of both β and e from only Ω(k log p log n) observations, even the fraction of corruption is arbitrarily close to one. Our analysis also shows that this amount of observations required to achieve exact signed support is optimal. 1</p><p>4 0.19099356 <a title="289-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2011-Efficient_Methods_for_Overlapping_Group_Lasso.html">78 nips-2011-Efficient Methods for Overlapping Group Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Yuan, Jun Liu, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: The group Lasso is an extension of the Lasso for feature selection on (predeﬁned) non-overlapping groups of features. The non-overlapping group structure limits its applicability in practice. There have been several recent attempts to study a more general formulation, where groups of features are given, potentially with overlaps between the groups. The resulting optimization is, however, much more challenging to solve due to the group overlaps. In this paper, we consider the efﬁcient optimization of the overlapping group Lasso penalized problem. We reveal several key properties of the proximal operator associated with the overlapping group Lasso, and compute the proximal operator by solving the smooth and convex dual problem, which allows the use of the gradient descent type of algorithms for the optimization. We have performed empirical evaluations using both synthetic and the breast cancer gene expression data set, which consists of 8,141 genes organized into (overlapping) gene sets. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm is more efﬁcient than existing state-of-the-art algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.16874892 <a title="289-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2011-High-dimensional_regression_with_noisy_and_missing_data%3A_Provable_guarantees_with_non-convexity.html">118 nips-2011-High-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data: Provable guarantees with non-convexity</a></p>
<p>Author: Po-ling Loh, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Although the standard formulations of prediction problems involve fully-observed and noiseless data drawn in an i.i.d. manner, many applications involve noisy and/or missing data, possibly involving dependencies. We study these issues in the context of high-dimensional sparse linear regression, and propose novel estimators for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. Many standard approaches to noisy or missing data, such as those using the EM algorithm, lead to optimization problems that are inherently non-convex, and it is difﬁcult to establish theoretical guarantees on practical algorithms. While our approach also involves optimizing non-convex programs, we are able to both analyze the statistical error associated with any global optimum, and prove that a simple projected gradient descent algorithm will converge in polynomial time to a small neighborhood of the set of global minimizers. On the statistical side, we provide non-asymptotic bounds that hold with high probability for the cases of noisy, missing, and/or dependent data. On the computational side, we prove that under the same types of conditions required for statistical consistency, the projected gradient descent algorithm will converge at geometric rates to a near-global minimizer. We illustrate these theoretical predictions with simulations, showing agreement with the predicted scalings. 1</p><p>6 0.15892647 <a title="289-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2011-Sparse_Bayesian_Multi-Task_Learning.html">258 nips-2011-Sparse Bayesian Multi-Task Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Slawski, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Non-negative data are commonly encountered in numerous ﬁelds, making nonnegative least squares regression (NNLS) a frequently used tool. At least relative to its simplicity, it often performs rather well in practice. Serious doubts about its usefulness arise for modern high-dimensional linear models. Even in this setting − unlike ﬁrst intuition may suggest − we show that for a broad class of designs, NNLS is resistant to overﬁtting and works excellently for sparse recovery when combined with thresholding, experimentally even outperforming 1 regularization. Since NNLS also circumvents the delicate choice of a regularization parameter, our ﬁndings suggest that NNLS may be the method of choice. 1</p><p>6 0.4924145 <a title="289-lsi-6" href="./nips-2011-High-dimensional_regression_with_noisy_and_missing_data%3A_Provable_guarantees_with_non-convexity.html">118 nips-2011-High-dimensional regression with noisy and missing data: Provable guarantees with non-convexity</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Taiji Suzuki, Kohei Hayashi, Hisashi Kashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze the statistical performance of a recently proposed convex tensor decomposition algorithm. Conventionally tensor decomposition has been formulated as non-convex optimization problems, which hindered the analysis of their performance. We show under some conditions that the mean squared error of the convex method scales linearly with the quantity we call the normalized rank of the true tensor. The current analysis naturally extends the analysis of convex low-rank matrix estimation to tensors. Furthermore, we show through numerical experiments that our theory can precisely predict the scaling behaviour in practice.</p><p>3 0.86544788 <a title="289-lda-3" href="./nips-2011-The_Manifold_Tangent_Classifier.html">287 nips-2011-The Manifold Tangent Classifier</a></p>
<p>Author: Salah Rifai, Yann N.

We exploit a novel algorithm for capturing manifold structure (high-order contractive auto-encoders) and we show how it builds a topological atlas of charts, each chart being characterized by the principal singular vectors of the Jacobian of a representation mapping. This representation learning algorithm can be stacked to yield a deep architecture, and we combine it with a domain knowledge-free version of the TangentProp algorithm to encourage the classiﬁer to be insensitive to local directions changes along the manifold. Record-breaking classiﬁcation results are obtained. 1</p><p>4 0.86419427 <a title="289-lda-4" href="./nips-2011-Greedy_Algorithms_for_Structurally_Constrained_High_Dimensional_Problems.html">108 nips-2011-Greedy Algorithms for Structurally Constrained High Dimensional Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Ambuj Tewari, Pradeep K. Ravikumar, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: A hallmark of modern machine learning is its ability to deal with high dimensional problems by exploiting structural assumptions that limit the degrees of freedom in the underlying model. A deep understanding of the capabilities and limits of high dimensional learning methods under specific assumptions such as sparsity, group sparsity, and low rank has been attsined. Efforts [1,2] are now underway to distill this valuable experience by proposing general unified frameworks that can achieve the twio goals of summarizing previous analyses and enabling their application to notions of structure hitherto unexplored. Inspired by these developments, we propose and analyze a general computational scheme based on a greedy strategy to solve convex optimization problems that arise when dealing with structurally constrained high-dimensional problems. Our framework not only unifies existing greedy algorithms by recovering them as special cases but also yields novel ones. Finally, we extend our results to infinite dimensional settings by using interesting connections between smoothness of norms and behavior of martingales in Banach spaces.</p><p>5 0.85549212 <a title="289-lda-5" href="./nips-2011-Group_Anomaly_Detection_using_Flexible_Genre_Models.html">110 nips-2011-Group Anomaly Detection using Flexible Genre Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Xiong, Barnabás Póczos, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: An important task in exploring and analyzing real-world data sets is to detect unusual and interesting phenomena. In this paper, we study the group anomaly detection problem. Unlike traditional anomaly detection research that focuses on data points, our goal is to discover anomalous aggregated behaviors of groups of points. For this purpose, we propose the Flexible Genre Model (FGM). FGM is designed to characterize data groups at both the point level and the group level so as to detect various types of group anomalies. We evaluate the effectiveness of FGM on both synthetic and real data sets including images and turbulence data, and show that it is superior to existing approaches in detecting group anomalies. 1</p><p>6 0.84564483 <a title="289-lda-6" href="./nips-2011-ICA_with_Reconstruction_Cost_for_Efficient_Overcomplete_Feature_Learning.html">124 nips-2011-ICA with Reconstruction Cost for Efficient Overcomplete Feature Learning</a></p>

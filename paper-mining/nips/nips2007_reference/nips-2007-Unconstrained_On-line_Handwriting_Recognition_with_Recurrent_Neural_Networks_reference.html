<h1>210 nips-2007-Unconstrained On-line Handwriting Recognition with Recurrent Neural Networks</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2007-210-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3213-unconstrained-on-line-handwriting-recognition-with-recurrent-neural-networks.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Alex Graves, Marcus Liwicki, Horst Bunke, Jürgen Schmidhuber, Santiago Fernández</p><p>Abstract: In online handwriting recognition the trajectory of the pen is recorded during writing. Although the trajectory provides a compact and complete representation of the written output, it is hard to transcribe directly, because each letter is spread over many pen locations. Most recognition systems therefore employ sophisticated preprocessing techniques to put the inputs into a more localised form. However these techniques require considerable human effort, and are speciﬁc to particular languages and alphabets. This paper describes a system capable of directly transcribing raw online handwriting data. The system consists of an advanced recurrent neural network with an output layer designed for sequence labelling, combined with a probabilistic language model. In experiments on an unconstrained online database, we record excellent results using either raw or preprocessed data, well outperforming a state-of-the-art HMM based system in both cases. 1</p><br/>

For ease of visualisation, only the derivative with highest absolute value is plotted at each time step. The reconstructed image was created by plotting the pen coordinates recorded by the sensor. The individual strokes are alternately coloured red and black. For both representations, the Jacobian is plotted for the output corresponding to the label ‘i’ at the point when ‘i’ is emitted (indicated by the vertical dashed lines). Because bidirectional networks were used, the range of sensitivity extends in both directions from the dashed line. For the preprocessed data, the Jacobian is sharply peaked around the time when the output is emitted. For the raw data it is more spread out, suggesting that the network makes more use of long-range context. Note the spike in sensitivity to the very end of the raw input sequence: this corresponds to the delayed dot of the ‘i’.</p>

Journal of Optical Society of America A, 14(7):1393–1411, July 1997. 2 An example that is directly analogous to the perceptual experiment in [4] is documented in [18]: Subjects initially rated kitchen appliances for attractiveness, and then were allowed to select one as a gift from amongst two that they had rated equally. They were subsequently asked to rate the appliances again. The data show a repulsive bias of the post-decision ratings compared with the pre-decision ratings, such that the rating of the selected appliance increased, and the rating of the rejected appliance decreased.  p(H)  trial  p(θ|H)  mean  40 20  θ  0.2  A −β  β  −α  −β  β  α  1/3 1/3  B  1/3  0  0  -20  -20  -40  -40  40  40  20  20  0  0 -20  α  θ  estimated direction [deg]  0.8  20  -20  −α  40  -40  -40 -20  -10  0  10  20  -20  -10  0  10  20  true direction [deg]  Figure 6: Model predictions for two modiﬁcations of the original experiment. A: We change the prior probability p(H) to be asymmetric (0.8 vs. 0.2). However, we keep the prior distribution of motion directions given a particular side p(θ|H) constant within the range [0, ±α]. The model makes two predictions (trials shown for an intermediate coherence level): First, although tested with an equal number of trials for each motion direction, there is a strong bias induced by the asymmetric prior. And second, the direction estimates on the left are more veridical than on the right. B: We present two reference marks instead of one, asking the subjects to make a choice between three equally likely regions of motion direction. Again, we assume uniform prior distributions of motion directions within each area. The model predicts bilateral repulsion of the estimates in the central area, leading to a strong bias that is almost independent of coherence level.</p>

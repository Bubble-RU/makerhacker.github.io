<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a highdimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efﬁcient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efﬁcient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4]. 1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover compact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that manifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coherent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree. Roweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inefﬁcient (although [2] describes an improved training algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization). In this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is efﬁcient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules. 2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm H 9¥ EI¡ CD66B9 ©9B 766 % G F 5 #</p><p>3 0.10045356 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Feature_Selection_in_Mixture-Based_Clustering.html">90 nips-2002-Feature Selection in Mixture-Based Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin H. Law, Anil K. Jain, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: There exist many approaches to clustering, but the important issue of feature selection, i.e., selecting the data attributes that are relevant for clustering, is rarely addressed. Feature selection for clustering is difﬁcult due to the absence of class labels. We propose two approaches to feature selection in the context of Gaussian mixture-based clustering. In the ﬁrst one, instead of making hard selections, we estimate feature saliencies. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for this task. The second approach extends Koller and Sahami’s mutual-informationbased feature relevance criterion to the unsupervised case. Feature selection is then carried out by a backward search scheme. This scheme can be classiﬁed as a “wrapper”, since it wraps mixture estimation in an outer layer that performs feature selection. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that both methods have promising performance.</p><p>4 0.085813336 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods.html">64 nips-2002-Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixture Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Meir, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider Bayesian mixture approaches, where a predictor is constructed by forming a weighted average of hypotheses from some space of functions. While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where suﬃciently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The ﬁnite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. 1 Introduction and Motivation The standard approach to Computational Learning Theory is usually formulated within the so-called frequentist approach to Statistics. Within this paradigm one is interested in constructing an estimator, based on a ﬁnite sample, which possesses a small loss (generalization error). While many algorithms have been constructed and analyzed within this context, it is not clear how these approaches relate to standard optimality criteria within the frequentist framework. Two classic optimality criteria within the latter approach are the minimax and admissibility criteria, which characterize optimality of estimators in a rigorous and precise fashion [9]. Except in some special cases [12], it is not known whether any of the approaches used within the Learning community lead to optimality in either of the above senses of the word. On the other hand, it is known that under certain regularity conditions, Bayesian estimators lead to either minimax or admissible estimators, and thus to well-deﬁned optimality in the classical (frequentist) sense. In fact, it can be shown that Bayes estimators are essentially the only estimators which can achieve optimality in the above senses [9]. This optimality feature provides strong motivation for the study of Bayesian approaches in a frequentist setting. While Bayesian approaches have been widely studied, there have not been generally applicable bounds in the frequentist framework. Recently, several approaches have attempted to address this problem. In this paper we establish ﬁnite sample datadependent bounds for Bayesian mixture methods, which together with the above optimality properties suggest that these approaches should become more widely used. Consider the problem of supervised learning where we attempt to construct an estimator based on a ﬁnite sample of pairs of examples S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )}, each drawn independently according to an unknown distribution µ(x, y). Let A be a learning algorithm which, based on the sample S, constructs a hypothesis (estimator) h from some set of hypotheses H. Denoting by (y, h(x)) the instantaneous loss of the hypothesis h, we wish to assess the true loss L(h) = Eµ (y, h(x)) where the expectation is taken with respect to µ. In particular, the objective is to provide data-dependent bounds of the following form. For any h ∈ H and δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1 − δ, L(h) ≤ Λ(h, S) + ∆(h, S, δ), (1) where Λ(h, S) is some empirical assessment of the true loss, and ∆(h, S, δ) is a complexity term. For example, in the classic Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework, Λ(h, S) n is the empirical error (1/n) i=1 (yi , h(xi )) and ∆(h, S, δ) depends on the VCdimension of H but is independent of both the hypothesis h and the sample S. By algorithm and data-dependent bounds we mean bounds where the complexity term depends on both the hypothesis (chosen by the algorithm A) and the sample S. 2 A Decision Theoretic Bayesian Framework Consider a decision theoretic setting where we deﬁne the sample dependent loss of an algorithm A by R(µ, A, S) = Eµ (y, A(x, S)). Let θµ be the optimal predictor for y, namely the function minimizing Eµ { (y, φ(x))} over φ. It is clear that the best algorithm A (Bayes algorithm) is the one that always return θµ , assuming µ is known. We are interested in the expected loss of an algorithm averaged over samples S: R(µ, A) = ES R(µ, A, S) = R(µ, A, S)dµ(S), where the expectation is taken with respect to the sample S drawn i.i.d. from the probability measure µ. If we consider a family of measures µ, which possesses some underlying prior distribution π(µ), then we can construct the averaged risk function with respect to the prior as, r(π, A) = Eπ R(µ, A) = where dπ(µ|S) = dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) R(µ, A, S)dπ(µ|S), is the posterior distribution on the µ family, which µ induces a posterior distribution on the sample space as πS = Eπ(µ|S) µ. An algorithm minimizing the Bayes risk r(π, A) is referred to as a Bayes algorithm. In fact, for a given prior, and a given sample S, the optimal algorithm should return the Bayes optimal predictor with respect to the posterior measure πS . For many important practical problems, the optimal Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the underlying probability measure. For example, if the loss function is quadratic, namely (y, A(x)) = (y −A(x))2 , then the optimal Bayes predictor θµ (x) is the conditional mean of y, namely Eµ [y|x]. For binary classiﬁcation problems, we can let the predictor be the conditional probability θµ (x) = µ(y = 1|x) (the optimal classiﬁcation decision rule then corresponds to a test of whether θµ (x) > 0.5), which is also a linear functional of µ. Clearly if the Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the probability measure, then the optimal Bayes algorithm with respect to the prior π is given by AB (x, S) = θµ (x)dπ(µ|S) = µ θ (x)dµ(S)dπ(µ) µ µ µ dµ(S)dπ(µ) . (2) In this case, an optimal Bayesian algorithm can be regarded as the predictor constructed by averaging over all predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior π(µ|S). We refer to such methods as Bayesian mixture methods. While the Bayes estimator AB (x, S) is optimal with respect to the Bayes risk r(π, A), it can be shown, that under appropriate conditions (and an appropriate prior) it is also a minimax and admissible estimator [9]. In general, θµ is unknown. Rather we may have some prior information about possible models for θµ . In view of (2) we consider a hypothesis space H, and an algorithm based on a mixture of hypotheses h ∈ H. This should be contrasted with classical approaches where an algorithm selects a single hypothesis h form H. For simplicity, we consider a countable hypothesis space H = {h1 , h2 , . . .}; the general case will be deferred to the full paper. Let q = {qj }∞ be a probability j=1 vector, namely qj ≥ 0 and j qj = 1, and construct the composite predictor by fq (x) = j qj hj (x). Observe that in general fq (x) may be a great deal more complex that any single hypothesis hj . For example, if hj (x) are non-polynomial ridge functions, the composite predictor f corresponds to a two-layer neural network with universal approximation power. We denote by Q the probability distribution deﬁned by q, namely j qj hj = Eh∼Q h. A main feature of this work is the establishment of data-dependent bounds on L(Eh∼Q h), the loss of the Bayes mixture algorithm. There has been a ﬂurry of recent activity concerning data-dependent bounds (a non-exhaustive list includes [2, 3, 5, 11, 13]). In a related vein, McAllester [7] provided a data-dependent bound for the so-called Gibbs algorithm, which selects a hypothesis at random from H based on the posterior distribution π(h|S). Essentially, this result provides a bound on the average error Eh∼Q L(h) rather than a bound on the error of the averaged hypothesis. Later, Langford et al. [6] extended this result to a mixture of classiﬁers using a margin-based loss function. A more general result can also be obtained using the covering number approach described in [14]. Finally, Herbrich and Graepel [4] showed that under certain conditions the bounds for the Gibbs classiﬁer can be extended to a Bayesian mixture classiﬁer. However, their bound contained an explicit dependence on the dimension (see Thm. 3 in [4]). Although the approach pioneered by McAllester came to be known as PAC-Bayes, this term is somewhat misleading since an optimal Bayesian method (in the decision theoretic framework outline above) does not average over loss functions but rather over hypotheses. In this regard, the learning behavior of a true Bayesian method is not addressed in the PAC-Bayes analysis. In this paper, we would like to narrow the discrepancy by analyzing Bayesian mixture methods, where we consider a predictor that is the average of a family of predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior distribution. Bayesian mixtures can often be regarded as a good approximation to a true optimal Bayesian method. In fact, we have shown above that they are equivalent for many important practical problems. Therefore the main contribution of the present work is the extension of the above mentioned results in PAC-Bayes analysis to a rather uniﬁed setting for Bayesian mixture methods, where diﬀerent regularization criteria may be incorporated, and their eﬀect on the performance easily assessed. Furthermore, it is also essential that the bounds obtained are dimension-independent, since otherwise they yield useless results when applied to kernel-based methods, which often map the input space into a space of very high dimensionality. Similar results can also be obtained using the covering number analysis in [14]. However the approach presented in the current paper, which relies on the direct computation of the Rademacher complexity, is more direct and gives better bounds. The analysis is also easier to generalize than the corresponding covering number approach. Moreover, our analysis applies directly to other non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. Before moving to the derivation of our bounds, we formalize our approach. Consider a countable hypothesis space H = {hj }∞ , and a probability distribution {qj } over j=1 ∞ H. Introduce the vector notation k=1 qk hk (x) = q h(x). A learning algorithm within the Bayesian mixture framework uses the sample S to select a distribution Q over H and then constructs a mixture hypothesis fq (x) = q h(x). In order to constrain the class of mixtures used in constructing the mixture q h we impose constraints on the mixture vector q. Let g(q) be a non-negative convex function of q and deﬁne for any positive A, ΩA = {q ∈ S : g(q) ≤ A} ; FA = fq : fq (x) = q h(x) : q ∈ ΩA , (3) where S denotes the probability simplex. In subsequent sections we will consider diﬀerent choices for g(q), which essentially acts as a regularization term. Finally, for any mixture q h we deﬁne the loss by L(q h) = Eµ (y, (q h)(x)) and the n ˆ empirical loss incurred on the sample by L(q h) = (1/n) i=1 (yi , (q h)(xi )). 3 A Mixture Algorithm with an Entropic Constraint In this section we consider an entropic constraint, which penalizes weights deviating signiﬁcantly from some prior probability distribution ν = {νj }∞ , which may j=1 incorporate our prior information about he problem. The weights q themselves are chosen by the algorithm based on the data. In particular, in this section we set g(q) to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence of q from ν, g(q) = D(q ν) ; qj log(qj /νj ). D(q ν) = j Let F be a class of real-valued functions, and denote by σi independent Bernoulli random variables assuming the values ±1 with equal probability. We deﬁne the data-dependent Rademacher complexity of F as 1 ˆ Rn (F) = Eσ sup n f ∈F n σi f (xi ) |S . i=1 ˆ The expectation of Rn (F) with respect to S will be denoted by Rn (F). We note ˆ n (F) is concentrated around its mean value Rn (F) (e.g., Thm. 8 in [1]). We that R quote a slightly adapted result from [5]. Theorem 1 (Adapted from Theorem 1 in [5]) Let {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } ∈ X be a sequence of points generated independently at random according to a probability distribution P , and let F be a class of measurable functions from X to R. Furthermore, let φ be a non-negative Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant κ, such that φ◦f is uniformly bounded by a constant M . Then for all f ∈ F with probability at least 1 − δ Eφ(f (x)) − 1 n n φ(f (xi )) ≤ 4κRn (F) + M i=1 log(1/δ) . 2n An immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is the following. Lemma 3.1 Let the loss function be bounded by M , and assume that it is Lipschitz with constant κ. Then for all q ∈ ΩA with probability at least 1 − δ log(1/δ) . 2n ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κRn (FA ) + M Next, we bound the empirical Rademacher average of FA using g(q) = D(q ν). Lemma 3.2 The empirical Rademacher complexity of FA is upper bounded as follows: 2A n ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ 1 n sup j n hj (xi )2 . i=1 Proof: We ﬁrst recall a few facts from the theory of convex duality [10]. Let p(u) be a convex function over a domain U , and set its dual s(z) = supu∈U u z − p(u) . It is known that s(z) is also convex. Setting u = q and p(q) = j qj log(qj /νj ) we ﬁnd that s(v) = log j νj ezj . From the deﬁnition of s(z) it follows that for any q ∈ S, q z≤ qj log(qj /νj ) + log ν j ez j . j j Since z is arbitrary, we set z = (λ/n) i σi h(xi ) and conclude that for q ∈ ΩA and any λ > 0   n   1 λ 1 sup A + log νj exp σi q h(xi ) ≤ σi hj (xi ) .  n i=1 λ n i q∈ΩA j Taking the expectation with respect to σ, and using 2 Eσ {exp ( i σi ai )} ≤ exp i ai /2 , we have that  λ 1 ˆ νj exp A + Eσ log σi hj (xi ) Rn (FA ) ≤ λ n j ≤ ≤ = i 1 λ A + sup log Eσ exp 1 λ A + sup log exp j j A λ + 2 sup λ 2n j λ2 n2 λ n i σi hj (xi ) the Chernoﬀ bound    (Jensen) i hj (xi )2 2 (Chernoﬀ) hj (xi )2 . i Minimizing the r.h.s. with respect to λ, we obtain the desired result. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 yields our basic bound, where κ and M are deﬁned in Lemma 3.1. Theorem 2 Let S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )} be a sample of i.i.d. points each drawn according to a distribution µ(x, y). Let H be a countable hypothesis class, and set FA to be the class deﬁned in (3) with g(q) = D(q ν). Set ∆H = (1/n)Eµ supj 1−δ n i=1 hj (xi )2 1/2 . Then for any q ∈ ΩA with probability at least ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2A +M n log(1/δ) . 2n Note that if hj are uniformly bounded, hj ≤ c, then ∆H ≤ c. Theorem 2 holds for a ﬁxed value of A. Using the so-called multiple testing Lemma (e.g. [11]) we obtain: Corollary 3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold, and let {Ai , pi } be a set of positive numbers such that i pi = 1. Then for all Ai and q ∈ ΩAi with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2Ai +M n log(1/pi δ) . 2n Note that the only distinction with Theorem 2 is the extra factor of log pi which is the price paid for the uniformity of the bound. Finally, we present a data-dependent bound of the form (1). Theorem 3 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold. Then for all q ∈ S with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H , M ) × 130D(q ν) + log(1/δ) . n (4) Proof sketch Pick Ai = 2i and pi = 1/i(i + 1), i = 1, 2, . . . (note that i pi = 1). For each q, let i(q) be the smallest index for which Ai(q) ≥ D(q ν) implying that log(1/pi(q) ) ≤ 2 log log2 (4D(q ν)). A few lines of algebra, to be presented in the full paper, yield the desired result. The results of Theorem 3 can be compared to those derived by McAllester [8] for the randomized Gibbs procedure. In the latter case, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is ˆ Eh∼Q L(h), namely the average empirical error of the base classiﬁers h. In our case ˆ the corresponding term is L(Eh∼Q h), namely the empirical error of the average hypothesis. Since Eh∼Q h is potentially much more complex than any single h ∈ H, we expect that the empirical term in (4) is much smaller than the corresponding term in [8]. Moreover, the complexity term we obtain is in fact tighter than the corresponding term in [8] by a logarithmic factor in n (although the logarithmic factor in [8] could probably be eliminated). We thus expect that Bayesian mixture approach advocated here leads to better performance guarantees. Finally, we comment that Theorem 3 can be used to obtain so-called oracle inequalities. In particular, let q∗ be the optimal distribution minimizing L(q h), which can only be computed if the underlying distribution µ(x, y) is known. Consider an ˆ algorithm which, based only on the data, selects a distribution q by minimizing the r.h.s. of (4), with the implicit constants appropriately speciﬁed. Then, using standard approaches (e.g. [2]) we can obtain a bound on L(ˆ h) − L(q∗ h). For q lack of space, we defer the derivation of the precise bound to the full paper. 4 General Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixtures The Kullback-Leibler divergence is but one way to incorporate prior information. In this section we extend the results to general convex regularization functions g(q). Some possible choices for g(q) besides the Kullback-Leibler divergence are the standard Lp norms q p . In order to proceed along the lines of Section 3, we let s(z) be the convex function associated with g(q), namely s(z) = supq∈ΩA q z − g(q) . Repeating n 1 the arguments of Section 3 we have for any λ > 0 that n i=1 σi q h(xi ) ≤ 1 λ i σi h(xi ) , which implies that λ A+s n 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ λ n A + Eσ s σi h(xi ) . (5) i n Assume that s(z) is second order diﬀerentiable, and that for any h = i=1 σi h(xi ) 1 2 (s(h + ∆h) + s(h − ∆h)) − s(h) ≤ u(∆h). Then, assuming that s(0) = 0, it is easy to show by induction that n n Eσ s (λ/n) i=1 σi h(xi ) ≤ u((λ/n)h(xi )). (6) i=1 In the remainder of the section we focus on the the case of regularization based on the Lp norm. Consider p and q such that 1/q + 1/p = 1, p ∈ (1, ∞), and let p = max(p, 2) and q = min(q, 2). Note that if p ≤ 2 then q ≥ 2, q = p = 2 and if p > 2 1 then q < 2, q = q, p = p. Consider p-norm regularization g(q) = p q p , in which p 1 case s(z) = q z q . The Rademacher averaging result for p-norm regularization q is known in the Geometric theory of Banach spaces (type structure of the Banach space), and it also follows from Khinchtine’s inequality. We show that it can be easily obtained in our framework. In this case, it is easy to see that s(z) = Substituting in (5) we have 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ A+ λ n q−1 q where Cq = ((q − 1)/q ) 1/q q 1 q z q q n h(xi ) q q = i=1 implies u(h(x)) ≤ Cq A1/p n1/p 1 n q−1 q h(x) q q . 1/q n h(xi ) q q i=1 . Combining this result with the methods described in Section 3, we establish a bound for regularization based on the Lp norm. Assume that h(xi ) q is ﬁnite for all i, and set ∆H,q = E (1/n) n i=1 h(xi ) q q 1/q . Theorem 4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3 hold and set g(q) = (1, ∞). Then for all q ∈ S, with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H,q , M ) × O q p + n1/p log log( q p 1 p q p p , p ∈ + 3) + log(1/δ) n where O(·) hides a universal constant that depends only on p. 5 Discussion We have introduced and analyzed a class of regularized Bayesian mixture approaches, which construct complex composite estimators by combining hypotheses from some underlying hypothesis class using data-dependent weights. Such weighted averaging approaches have been used extensively within the Bayesian framework, as well as in more recent approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. While Bayesian methods are known, under favorable conditions, to lead to optimal estimators in a frequentist setting, their performance in agnostic settings, where no reliable assumptions can be made concerning the data generating mechanism, has not been well understood. Our data-dependent bounds allow the utilization of Bayesian mixture models in general settings, while at the same time taking advantage of the beneﬁts of the Bayesian approach in terms of incorporation of prior knowledge. The bounds established, being independent of the cardinality of the underlying hypothesis space, can be directly applied to kernel based methods.

<p>Author: Bernd Fischer, Johann Schumann, Wray Buntine, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning has reached a point where many probabilistic methods can be understood as variations, extensions and combinations of a much smaller set of abstract themes, e.g., as different instances of the EM algorithm. This enables the systematic derivation of algorithms customized for different models. Here, we describe the AUTO BAYES system which takes a high-level statistical model speciﬁcation, uses powerful symbolic techniques based on schema-based program synthesis and computer algebra to derive an efﬁcient specialized algorithm for learning that model, and generates executable code implementing that algorithm. This capability is far beyond that of code collections such as Matlab toolboxes or even tools for model-independent optimization such as BUGS for Gibbs sampling: complex new algorithms can be generated without new programming, algorithms can be highly specialized and tightly crafted for the exact structure of the model and data, and efﬁcient and commented code can be generated for different languages or systems. We present automatically-derived algorithms ranging from closed-form solutions of Bayesian textbook problems to recently-proposed EM algorithms for clustering, regression, and a multinomial form of PCA. 1 Automatic Derivation of Statistical Algorithms Overview. We describe a symbolic program synthesis system which works as a “statistical algorithm compiler:” it compiles a statistical model speciﬁcation into a custom algorithm design and from that further down into a working program implementing the algorithm design. This system, AUTO BAYES, can be loosely thought of as “part theorem prover, part Mathematica, part learning textbook, and part Numerical Recipes.” It provides much more ﬂexibility than a ﬁxed code repository such as a Matlab toolbox, and allows the creation of efﬁcient algorithms which have never before been implemented, or even written down. AUTO BAYES is intended to automate the more routine application of complex methods in novel contexts. For example, recent multinomial extensions to PCA [2, 4] can be derived in this way. The algorithm design problem. Given a dataset and a task, creating a learning method can be characterized by two main questions: 1. What is the model? 2. What algorithm will optimize the model parameters? The statistical algorithm (i.e., a parameter optimization algorithm for the statistical model) can then be implemented manually. The system in this paper answers the algorithm question given that the user has chosen a model for the data,and continues through to implementation. Performing this task at the state-of-the-art level requires an intertwined meld of probability theory, computational mathematics, and software engineering. However, a number of factors unite to allow us to solve the algorithm design problem computationally: 1. The existence of fundamental building blocks (e.g., standardized probability distributions, standard optimization procedures, and generic data structures). 2. The existence of common representations (i.e., graphical models [3, 13] and program schemas). 3. The formalization of schema applicability constraints as guards. 1 The challenges of algorithm design. The design problem has an inherently combinatorial nature, since subparts of a function may be optimized recursively and in different ways. It also involves the use of new data structures or approximations to gain performance. As the research in statistical algorithms advances, its creative focus should move beyond the ultimately mechanical aspects and towards extending the abstract applicability of already existing schemas (algorithmic principles like EM), improving schemas in ways that generalize across anything they can be applied to, and inventing radically new schemas. 2 Combining Schema-based Synthesis and Bayesian Networks Statistical Models. Externally, AUTO BAYES has the look and feel of 2 const int n_points as ’nr. of data points’ a compiler. Users specify their model 3 with 0 < n_points; 4 const int n_classes := 3 as ’nr. classes’ of interest in a high-level speciﬁcation 5 with 0 < n_classes language (as opposed to a program6 with n_classes << n_points; ming language). The ﬁgure shows the 7 double phi(1..n_classes) as ’weights’ speciﬁcation of the mixture of Gaus8 with 1 = sum(I := 1..n_classes, phi(I)); 9 double mu(1..n_classes); sians example used throughout this 9 double sigma(1..n_classes); paper.2 Note the constraint that the 10 int c(1..n_points) as ’class labels’; sum of the class probabilities must 11 c ˜ disc(vec(I := 1..n_classes, phi(I))); equal one (line 8) along with others 12 data double x(1..n_points) as ’data’; (lines 3 and 5) that make optimization 13 x(I) ˜ gauss(mu(c(I)), sigma(c(I))); of the model well-deﬁned. Also note 14 max pr(x| phi,mu,sigma ) wrt phi,mu,sigma ; the ability to specify assumptions of the kind in line 6, which may be used by some algorithms. The last line speciﬁes the goal inference task: maximize the conditional probability pr with respect to the parameters , , and . Note that moving the parameters across to the left of the conditioning bar converts this from a maximum likelihood to a maximum a posteriori problem. 1 model mog as ’Mixture of Gaussians’; ¡   £  £  £ §¤¢ £ © ¨ ¦ ¥ ©   ¡     ¡ £ £ £ ¨ Computational logic and theorem proving. Internally, AUTO BAYES uses a class of techniques known as computational logic which has its roots in automated theorem proving. AUTO BAYES begins with an initial goal and a set of initial assertions, or axioms, and adds new assertions, or theorems, by repeated application of the axioms, until the goal is proven. In our context, the goal is given by the input model; the derived algorithms are side effects of constructive theorems proving the existence of algorithms for the goal. 1 Schema guards vary widely; for example, compare Nead-Melder simplex or simulated annealing (which require only function evaluation), conjugate gradient (which require both Jacobian and Hessian), EM and its variational extension [6] (which require a latent-variable structure model). 2 Here, keywords have been underlined and line numbers have been added for reference in the text. The as-keyword allows annotations to variables which end up in the generated code’s comments. Also, n classes has been set to three (line 4), while n points is left unspeciﬁed. The class variable and single data variable are vectors, which deﬁnes them as i.i.d. Computer algebra. The ﬁrst core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can mechanize the required symbol manipulation, using computer algebra methods. General symbolic differentiation and expression simpliﬁcation are capabilities fundamental to our approach. AUTO BAYES contains a computer algebra engine using term rewrite rules which are an efﬁcient mechanism for substitution of equal quantities or expressions and thus well-suited for this task.3 Schema-based synthesis. The computational cost of full-blown theorem proving grinds simple tasks to a halt while elementary and intermediate facts are reinvented from scratch. To achieve the scale of deduction required by algorithm derivation, we thus follow a schema-based synthesis technique which breaks away from strict theorem proving. Instead, we formalize high-level domain knowledge, such as the general EM strategy, as schemas. A schema combines a generic code fragment with explicitly speciﬁed preconditions which describe the applicability of the code fragment. The second core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can use Bayesian networks to efﬁciently encode the preconditions of complex algorithms such as EM. First-order logic representation of Bayesian netNclasses works. A ﬁrst-order logic representation of Bayesian µ σ networks was developed by Haddawy [7]. In this framework, random variables are represented by functor symbols and indexes (i.e., speciﬁc instances φ x c of i.i.d. vectors) are represented as functor arguments. discrete gauss Nclasses Since unknown index values can be represented by Npoints implicitly universally quantiﬁed Prolog variables, this approach allows a compact encoding of networks involving i.i.d. variables or plates [3]; the ﬁgure shows the initial network for our running example. Moreover, such networks correspond to backtrack-free datalog programs, allowing the dependencies to be efﬁciently computed. We have extended the framework to work with non-ground probability queries since we seek to determine probabilities over entire i.i.d. vectors and matrices. Tests for independence on these indexed Bayesian networks are easily developed in Lauritzen’s framework which uses ancestral sets and set separation [9] and is more amenable to a theorem prover than the double negatives of the more widely known d-separation criteria.

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a highdimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efﬁcient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efﬁcient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4]. 1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover compact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that manifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coherent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree. Roweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inefﬁcient (although [2] describes an improved training algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization). In this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is efﬁcient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules. 2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm H 9¥ EI¡ CD66B9 ©9B 766 % G F 5 #</p><p>4 0.51951069 <a title="63-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Maximum_Likelihood_and_the_Information_Bottleneck.html">142 nips-2002-Maximum Likelihood and the Information Bottleneck</a></p>
<p>Author: Noam Slonim, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is an information-theoretic formulation for clustering problems. Given a joint distribution , this method constructs a new variable that deﬁnes partitions over the values of that are informative about . Maximum likelihood (ML) of mixture models is a standard statistical approach to clustering problems. In this paper, we ask: how are the two methods related ? We deﬁne a simple mapping between the IB problem and the ML problem for the multinomial mixture model. We show that under this mapping the or problems are strongly related. In fact, for uniform input distribution over for large sample size, the problems are mathematically equivalent. Speciﬁcally, in these cases, every ﬁxed point of the IB-functional deﬁnes a ﬁxed point of the (log) likelihood and vice versa. Moreover, the values of the functionals at the ﬁxed points are equal under simple transformations. As a result, in these cases, every algorithm that solves one of the problems, induces a solution for the other.   ©§ ¥£ ¨¦¤¢   </p><p>5 0.48149541 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Parametric_Mixture_Models_for_Multi-Labeled_Text.html">162 nips-2002-Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text</a></p>

In contrast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive eﬃcient learning and prediction algorithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signiﬁcantly outperform the conventional binary methods when applied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages. 1</p><p>6 0.46101993 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Classify_Galaxy_Shapes_Using_the_EM_Algorithm.html">131 nips-2002-Learning to Classify Galaxy Shapes Using the EM Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Shotaro Akaho, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: We show the existence of critical points as lines for the likelihood function of mixture-type models. They are given by embedding of a critical point for models with less components. A sufﬁcient condition that the critical line gives local maxima or saddle points is also derived. Based on this fact, a component-split method is proposed for a mixture of Gaussian components, and its effectiveness is veriﬁed through experiments. 1</p><p>3 0.65505743 <a title="63-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Differential_Semantics_for_Jointree_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2002-A Differential Semantics for Jointree Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: James D. Park, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: A new approach to inference in belief networks has been recently proposed, which is based on an algebraic representation of belief networks using multi–linear functions. According to this approach, the key computational question is that of representing multi–linear functions compactly, since inference reduces to a simple process of ev aluating and diﬀerentiating such functions. W e show here that mainstream inference algorithms based on jointrees are a special case of this approach in a v ery precise sense. W e use this result to prov e new properties of jointree algorithms, and then discuss some of its practical and theoretical implications. 1</p><p>4 0.62986511 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Note_on_the_Representational_Incompatibility_of_Function_Approximation_and_Factored_Dynamics.html">13 nips-2002-A Note on the Representational Incompatibility of Function Approximation and Factored Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric Allender, Sanjeev Arora, Michael Kearns, Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell</p><p>Abstract: We establish a new hardness result that shows that the difﬁculty of planning in factored Markov decision processes is representational rather than just computational. More precisely, we give a ﬁxed family of factored MDPs with linear rewards whose optimal policies and value functions simply cannot be represented succinctly in any standard parametric form. Previous hardness results indicated that computing good policies from the MDP parameters was difﬁcult, but left open the possibility of succinct function approximation for any ﬁxed factored MDP. Our result applies even to policies which yield a polynomially poor approximation to the optimal value, and highlights interesting connections with the complexity class of Arthur-Merlin games.</p><p>5 0.42555436 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Complexity_of_Learning_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">156 nips-2002-On the Complexity of Learning the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Daniel Herrmann</p><p>Abstract: We investigate data based procedures for selecting the kernel when learning with Support Vector Machines. We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors ﬁx. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overﬁtting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.</p><p>6 0.41905305 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Distance_Metric_Learning_with_Application_to_Clustering_with_Side-Information.html">70 nips-2002-Distance Metric Learning with Application to Clustering with Side-Information</a></p>

</p><p>3 A sufﬁcient condition that the critical line gives local maxima or saddle points is also derived. [sent-11, score-0.576]
</p><p>4 Based on this fact, a component-split method is proposed for a mixture of Gaussian components, and its effectiveness is veriﬁed through experiments. [sent-12, score-0.224]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  The likelihood function of a mixture model often has a complex shape so that calculation of an estimator can be difﬁcult, whether the maximum likelihood or Bayesian approach is used. [sent-13, score-0.428]
</p><p>6 In the maximum likelihood estimation, convergence of the EM algorithm to the global maximum is not guaranteed, while it is a standard method. [sent-14, score-0.148]
</p><p>7 Investigation of the likelihood function for mixture models is important to develop effective methods for learning. [sent-15, score-0.326]
</p><p>8 This paper discusses the critical points of the likelihood function for mixture-type models by analyzing their hierarchical symmetric structure. [sent-16, score-0.474]
</p><p>9 As generalization of [1], we show that, given a critical point of the likelihood for the model with (H − 1) components, duplication of any of the components gives critical points as lines for the model with H components. [sent-17, score-0.957]
</p><p>10 We derive also a sufﬁcient condition that the critical lines give maxima or saddle points of the larger model, and show that given a maximum of the likelihood for a mixture of Gaussian components, an appropriate split of any component always gives an ascending direction of the likelihood. [sent-19, score-1.19]
</p><p>11 Based on this theory, we propose a stable method of splitting a component, which works effectively with the EM optimization for avoiding the dependency on the initial condition and improving the optimization. [sent-20, score-0.234]
</p><p>12 The key of our discussion is the following two symmetric properties, which are satisﬁed by mixture models; (S-1) fH (x | α(H) ; β (H−2) , βH−1 , βH−1 ) = fH−1 (x | α(H−2) , αH−1 + αH ; β (H−1) ). [sent-31, score-0.257]
</p><p>13 ∂βj A(α) ∂βH−1 In mixture models, the function A(α) is simply given by A(α) = α1 + · · · + αH . [sent-33, score-0.224]
</p><p>14 While in mixture models similar conditions are satisﬁed with any choices of two components, we describe only the case of H − 1 and H just for simplicity. [sent-38, score-0.256]
</p><p>15 We write ΘH for the space of the parameter θ (H) . [sent-39, score-0.044]
</p><p>16 , xM ), LDA with H components is deﬁned by fH (x | θ (H) ) =  DH (u (H) |α(H) ) ∆H−1  where DH (u (H) |α(H) ) =  Γ( j  j αj ) Γ(αj )  H j=1  α −1  uj j  M ν=1  H j=1 uj p(xν |βj )  du (H) ,  (2)  is the Dirichlet distribution over the (H −  1)-dimensional simplex ∆H−1 . [sent-46, score-0.271]
</p><p>17 In mixture models/LDA, this corresponds to duplication of the (H − 1)-th component with partitioning the mixing/Dirichlet parameter in the ratio λ : (1 − λ). [sent-51, score-0.43]
</p><p>18 Since λ is arbitrary, a point in the smaller model is embedded into the larger model as a line in the parameter space ΘH . [sent-52, score-0.113]
</p><p>19 This implies that the parameter to realize fH−1 (x | θ (H−1) ) lacks identiﬁability in ΘH . [sent-53, score-0.044]
</p><p>20 If Ωn (f ) = log f for all n, maximization of LH (θ (H) ) is equal to the maximum likelihood estimation. [sent-61, score-0.109]
</p><p>21 , ηH−1 ) is a critical point of LH−1 (θ (H−1) ), (H−1) ∂LH−1 (θ∗ ) = 0. [sent-68, score-0.309]
</p><p>22 Embedding of this point into ΘH gives a critical line; ∂θ (H−1)  Suppose θ∗ that is,  1 The results do not require that p(x | β) is a density function. [sent-69, score-0.353]
</p><p>23 Thus, they can be easily extended to function ﬁtting in regression, which gives the results on multilayer neural networks in [1]. [sent-70, score-0.102]
</p><p>24 Let θ ∗ ∗ be a critical point of LH−1 with γH−1 = 0, and θλ be a parameter given by eq. [sent-73, score-0.353]
</p><p>25 Then, θλ is a critical point of LH (θ (H) ) for all λ. [sent-75, score-0.309]
</p><p>26 Although this is essentially the same as Theorem 1 in [1], the following proof gives better intuition. [sent-77, score-0.044]
</p><p>27 (4) under this parametrization, and ωλ be the parameter corresponding to θλ . [sent-82, score-0.044]
</p><p>28 (6) Then, it is clear that the ﬁrst derivatives of H at ωλ with respect to α(H−2) , s, β (H−2) , (H−1) and ζ are equal to those of LH−1 (θ (H−1) ) at θ∗ , and they are zero. [sent-84, score-0.045]
</p><p>29 Given that a maximum of LH is larger than that of LH−1 , Theorem 1 implies that the function LH always has critical points which are not global maximum. [sent-92, score-0.351]
</p><p>30 Those points lie on lines in the parameter space. [sent-93, score-0.163]
</p><p>31 Further embedding of the critical lines into larger models gives high-dimensional critical planes in the parameter space. [sent-94, score-0.883]
</p><p>32 This property is very general, and in LDA and mixture models we do not need any assumptions on p(x | β). [sent-95, score-0.256]
</p><p>33 In these models, by the permutation symmetry of components, there are many choices for embedding, which induces many critical lines and planes for LH . [sent-96, score-0.457]
</p><p>34 3  Embedding of a Maximum Point in LDA and Mixture Models  The next question is whether or not the critical lines from a maximum of LH−1 gives maxima of LH . [sent-98, score-0.513]
</p><p>35 We show a general result on LDA, and that on mixture models as its corollary. [sent-100, score-0.256]
</p><p>36 Let θ∗ be an isolated maximum point of LH−1 , and θλ be its embedding given by eq. [sent-104, score-0.136]
</p><p>37 Deﬁne a symmetric matrix R of the size dimβ by R=  N (n) n=1 Ωn (fH−1 (X  +  1 H−1 j=1  (H−1)  | θ∗  ∗ γj +1  M µ=1  ))  M (n) ∂ µ=1 Iµ  2  (n)  ∗ p(Xµ | ηH−1 ) ∂β∂β  (n) ∗ M (n) ∂p(Xµ | ηH−1 ) Jµ,τ τ =1 ∂β τ =µ  (n)  ∂p(Xτ  ∗ | ηH−1 ) , ∂β  where Ω (f ) denotes the derivative of Ω(f ) w.

</p><p>40 Then, we have (i) If R is negative deﬁnite, the parameter θλ is a maximum of LH for all λ ∈ (0, 1). [sent-116, score-0.083]
</p><p>41 (ii) If R has a positive eigenvalue, the parameter θλ is a saddle point for all λ ∈ (0, 1). [sent-117, score-0.158]
</p><p>42 For each t, let Ht be a hyperplane ˜ with t ﬁxed, and LH,t be the function LH restricted on Ht . [sent-122, score-0.063]
</p><p>43 The hyperplane Ht is a slice transversal to the critical line, along which LH has the same value. [sent-123, score-0.315]
</p><p>44 Therefore, if the Hessian ˜ matrix of LH,t on Ht is negative deﬁnite at the intersection ωλ (λ = (t + 1)/2), the point is a maximum of LH , and if the Hessian has a positive eigenvalue, ωλ is a saddle point. [sent-124, score-0.189]
</p><p>45 By setting M = 1 in LDA model, we have the sufﬁcient conditions for mixture models. [sent-129, score-0.224]
</p><p>46 For a mixture model, the same assertions as Theorem 3 hold for ˜ R=  N (n) n=1 Ωn (fH−1 (X  (n)  (H−1)  | θ∗  ∗ Proof. [sent-131, score-0.224]
</p><p>47 Critical Lines in Various Models  We further investigate the critical lines for speciﬁc models. [sent-136, score-0.373]
</p><p>48 Hereafter, we consider the maximum likelihood estimation, setting Ωn (f ) = log f for all n. [sent-137, score-0.109]
</p><p>49 Gaussian Mixture, Mixture of Factor Analyzers, and Mixture of PCA Assume that each component is the D-dimensional Gaussian density with mean µ and variance-covariance matrix V as parameters, which is denoted by φ(x ; µ, V ). [sent-138, score-0.15]
</p><p>50 (9) has a form R = S T S3 , where S2 , S3 , and S4 correspond to the second 4 3 derivatives with respect to (µ, µ), (µ, V ), and (V, V ), respectively. [sent-140, score-0.045]
</p><p>51 It is well known that the second derivative ∂ 2 φ/∂µ∂µ of a Gaussian density is equal to the ﬁrst derivative ∂φ/∂V . [sent-141, score-0.076]
</p><p>52 Then, S2 is equal to zero by the condition of a critical point. [sent-142, score-0.315]
</p><p>53 It is not difﬁcult to extend this discussion to models with scalar or diagonal variance-covariance matrices as variable parameters. [sent-145, score-0.098]
</p><p>54 Similar arguments hold for mixture of factor analyzers (MFA, [4]) and mixture of probabilistic PCA (MPCA, [5]). [sent-146, score-0.521]
</p><p>55 In factor analyzers or probabilistic PCA, the variancecovariance matrix is restricted to the form V = F F T + S,  where F is a factor loading of rank k and S is a diagonal or scalar matrix. [sent-147, score-0.3]
</p><p>56 Because the T ﬁrst derivative of φ(x ; µ, F F T + S) with respect to F is ∂φ(x;µ,F F +S) F , the block in ∂V ˜ R corresponding to the second derivatives on µ is not of full rank. [sent-148, score-0.112]
</p><p>57 If R is of full rank, every point θλ on the critical line is a saddle point of LH . [sent-152, score-0.466]
</p><p>58 This theorem means that if we have the maximum likelihood estimator for H − 1 components, we can ﬁnd an ascending direction of likelihood by splitting a component and modifying their means and variance-covariance matrices in the direction of the positive eigenvector. [sent-153, score-0.665]
</p><p>59 This leads a component splitting method, which will be shown in Section 3. [sent-154, score-0.316]
</p><p>60 Let p be the frequency vector of the D elements, which is the maximum (n) likelihood estimator for the one multinomial model. [sent-170, score-0.172]
</p><p>61 (n)  First, suppose we have a data set with Xν = eν for all n and 1 ≤ ν ≤ D = M , where ej is the D-dimensional vector with the j-th component 1 and others zero. [sent-172, score-0.235]
</p><p>62 The critical line gives maxima for LDA with H = 2. [sent-177, score-0.427]
</p><p>63 Next, suppose the data consists of D groups, and every (n) data in the j-th group is given by Xν = ej . [sent-178, score-0.121]
</p><p>64 Thus, all the points on the critical lines are saddle points. [sent-183, score-0.49]
</p><p>65 These examples explain two extreme cases; in the former we have no advantage in using two components because all the data X (n) are the same, while in the latter the multiple components ﬁts better to the variety of X (n) . [sent-184, score-0.168]

</p><p>70 In (b) and (c), the lines represent the factor loading vectors F h and −Fh at the mean values, and the radius of a sphere is the scalar part of the variance. [sent-209, score-0.189]
</p><p>71 Sequential split of components can give a solution to these problems. [sent-211, score-0.141]
</p><p>72 From Theorem 5, a stable and effective way of splitting a Gaussian component is derived to increase the likelihood. [sent-212, score-0.316]
</p><p>73 We propose EM with component splitting, which adds a component one by one after maximizing the likelihood at each size. [sent-213, score-0.298]
</p><p>74 Ueda et al ([6]) proposes Split and Merge EM, in which the components repeat split and merge in a triplet, keeping the total number ﬁxed. [sent-214, score-0.172]
</p><p>75 While their method works well, it requires a large number of trials of EM for candidate triplets, and the splitting method is heuristic. [sent-215, score-0.202]
</p><p>76 Our splitting method is well based on theory, and EM with splitting gives a series of estimators for all model sizes in a single run. [sent-216, score-0.472]
</p><p>77 The exact algorithm for the mixture of PCA/FA will be shown in a forthcoming paper. [sent-219, score-0.224]
</p><p>78 It is noteworthy that in splitting a component, not only the means but also the variancecovariance matrices must be modiﬁed. [sent-220, score-0.28]
</p><p>79 To solve this problem, we use Lie algebra expression to add a vector of ascending direction. [sent-222, score-0.063]
</p><p>80 Let V = U ΛU T be the diagonalization of V , and consider V (W ) = U eW ΛeW U T for a symmetric matrix  W . [sent-223, score-0.069]
</p><p>81 This gives a local coordinate of the positive deﬁnite matrices around V = V (0). [sent-224, score-0.104]

</p><p>89 However, we should note that some famous methods such as AIC and MDL, which are based on statistical asymptotic theory, cannot be applied to mixture models because of the unidentiﬁability of the parameter. [sent-262, score-0.256]
</p><p>90 Further studies are necessary on model selection for mixture models. [sent-263, score-0.224]
</p><p>91 Although the computation to calculate the matrix R is not cheap in a mixture of Gaussian components, the full variance-covariance matrices are not always necessary in practical problems. [sent-264, score-0.322]
</p><p>92 In selecting a component to split, we try line search for all the components and choose the one giving the largest likelihood. [sent-267, score-0.241]
</p><p>93 While this works well in our experiments, the proposed method of component splitting can be combined with other criterions to select a component. [sent-268, score-0.316]

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a highdimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efﬁcient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efﬁcient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4]. 1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover compact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that manifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coherent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree. Roweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inefﬁcient (although [2] describes an improved training algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization). In this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is efﬁcient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules. 2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm H 9¥ EI¡ CD66B9 ©9B 766 % G F 5 #</p><p>3 0.087737866 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Feature_Selection_in_Mixture-Based_Clustering.html">90 nips-2002-Feature Selection in Mixture-Based Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin H. Law, Anil K. Jain, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: There exist many approaches to clustering, but the important issue of feature selection, i.e., selecting the data attributes that are relevant for clustering, is rarely addressed. Feature selection for clustering is difﬁcult due to the absence of class labels. We propose two approaches to feature selection in the context of Gaussian mixture-based clustering. In the ﬁrst one, instead of making hard selections, we estimate feature saliencies. An expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm is derived for this task. The second approach extends Koller and Sahami’s mutual-informationbased feature relevance criterion to the unsupervised case. Feature selection is then carried out by a backward search scheme. This scheme can be classiﬁed as a “wrapper”, since it wraps mixture estimation in an outer layer that performs feature selection. Experimental results on synthetic and real data show that both methods have promising performance.</p><p>4 0.081079736 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods.html">64 nips-2002-Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixture Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Meir, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider Bayesian mixture approaches, where a predictor is constructed by forming a weighted average of hypotheses from some space of functions. While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where suﬃciently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The ﬁnite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. 1 Introduction and Motivation The standard approach to Computational Learning Theory is usually formulated within the so-called frequentist approach to Statistics. Within this paradigm one is interested in constructing an estimator, based on a ﬁnite sample, which possesses a small loss (generalization error). While many algorithms have been constructed and analyzed within this context, it is not clear how these approaches relate to standard optimality criteria within the frequentist framework. Two classic optimality criteria within the latter approach are the minimax and admissibility criteria, which characterize optimality of estimators in a rigorous and precise fashion [9]. Except in some special cases [12], it is not known whether any of the approaches used within the Learning community lead to optimality in either of the above senses of the word. On the other hand, it is known that under certain regularity conditions, Bayesian estimators lead to either minimax or admissible estimators, and thus to well-deﬁned optimality in the classical (frequentist) sense. In fact, it can be shown that Bayes estimators are essentially the only estimators which can achieve optimality in the above senses [9]. This optimality feature provides strong motivation for the study of Bayesian approaches in a frequentist setting. While Bayesian approaches have been widely studied, there have not been generally applicable bounds in the frequentist framework. Recently, several approaches have attempted to address this problem. In this paper we establish ﬁnite sample datadependent bounds for Bayesian mixture methods, which together with the above optimality properties suggest that these approaches should become more widely used. Consider the problem of supervised learning where we attempt to construct an estimator based on a ﬁnite sample of pairs of examples S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )}, each drawn independently according to an unknown distribution µ(x, y). Let A be a learning algorithm which, based on the sample S, constructs a hypothesis (estimator) h from some set of hypotheses H. Denoting by (y, h(x)) the instantaneous loss of the hypothesis h, we wish to assess the true loss L(h) = Eµ (y, h(x)) where the expectation is taken with respect to µ. In particular, the objective is to provide data-dependent bounds of the following form. For any h ∈ H and δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1 − δ, L(h) ≤ Λ(h, S) + ∆(h, S, δ), (1) where Λ(h, S) is some empirical assessment of the true loss, and ∆(h, S, δ) is a complexity term. For example, in the classic Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework, Λ(h, S) n is the empirical error (1/n) i=1 (yi , h(xi )) and ∆(h, S, δ) depends on the VCdimension of H but is independent of both the hypothesis h and the sample S. By algorithm and data-dependent bounds we mean bounds where the complexity term depends on both the hypothesis (chosen by the algorithm A) and the sample S. 2 A Decision Theoretic Bayesian Framework Consider a decision theoretic setting where we deﬁne the sample dependent loss of an algorithm A by R(µ, A, S) = Eµ (y, A(x, S)). Let θµ be the optimal predictor for y, namely the function minimizing Eµ { (y, φ(x))} over φ. It is clear that the best algorithm A (Bayes algorithm) is the one that always return θµ , assuming µ is known. We are interested in the expected loss of an algorithm averaged over samples S: R(µ, A) = ES R(µ, A, S) = R(µ, A, S)dµ(S), where the expectation is taken with respect to the sample S drawn i.i.d. from the probability measure µ. If we consider a family of measures µ, which possesses some underlying prior distribution π(µ), then we can construct the averaged risk function with respect to the prior as, r(π, A) = Eπ R(µ, A) = where dπ(µ|S) = dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) R(µ, A, S)dπ(µ|S), is the posterior distribution on the µ family, which µ induces a posterior distribution on the sample space as πS = Eπ(µ|S) µ. An algorithm minimizing the Bayes risk r(π, A) is referred to as a Bayes algorithm. In fact, for a given prior, and a given sample S, the optimal algorithm should return the Bayes optimal predictor with respect to the posterior measure πS . For many important practical problems, the optimal Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the underlying probability measure. For example, if the loss function is quadratic, namely (y, A(x)) = (y −A(x))2 , then the optimal Bayes predictor θµ (x) is the conditional mean of y, namely Eµ [y|x]. For binary classiﬁcation problems, we can let the predictor be the conditional probability θµ (x) = µ(y = 1|x) (the optimal classiﬁcation decision rule then corresponds to a test of whether θµ (x) > 0.5), which is also a linear functional of µ. Clearly if the Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the probability measure, then the optimal Bayes algorithm with respect to the prior π is given by AB (x, S) = θµ (x)dπ(µ|S) = µ θ (x)dµ(S)dπ(µ) µ µ µ dµ(S)dπ(µ) . (2) In this case, an optimal Bayesian algorithm can be regarded as the predictor constructed by averaging over all predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior π(µ|S). We refer to such methods as Bayesian mixture methods. While the Bayes estimator AB (x, S) is optimal with respect to the Bayes risk r(π, A), it can be shown, that under appropriate conditions (and an appropriate prior) it is also a minimax and admissible estimator [9]. In general, θµ is unknown. Rather we may have some prior information about possible models for θµ . In view of (2) we consider a hypothesis space H, and an algorithm based on a mixture of hypotheses h ∈ H. This should be contrasted with classical approaches where an algorithm selects a single hypothesis h form H. For simplicity, we consider a countable hypothesis space H = {h1 , h2 , . . .}; the general case will be deferred to the full paper. Let q = {qj }∞ be a probability j=1 vector, namely qj ≥ 0 and j qj = 1, and construct the composite predictor by fq (x) = j qj hj (x). Observe that in general fq (x) may be a great deal more complex that any single hypothesis hj . For example, if hj (x) are non-polynomial ridge functions, the composite predictor f corresponds to a two-layer neural network with universal approximation power. We denote by Q the probability distribution deﬁned by q, namely j qj hj = Eh∼Q h. A main feature of this work is the establishment of data-dependent bounds on L(Eh∼Q h), the loss of the Bayes mixture algorithm. There has been a ﬂurry of recent activity concerning data-dependent bounds (a non-exhaustive list includes [2, 3, 5, 11, 13]). In a related vein, McAllester [7] provided a data-dependent bound for the so-called Gibbs algorithm, which selects a hypothesis at random from H based on the posterior distribution π(h|S). Essentially, this result provides a bound on the average error Eh∼Q L(h) rather than a bound on the error of the averaged hypothesis. Later, Langford et al. [6] extended this result to a mixture of classiﬁers using a margin-based loss function. A more general result can also be obtained using the covering number approach described in [14]. Finally, Herbrich and Graepel [4] showed that under certain conditions the bounds for the Gibbs classiﬁer can be extended to a Bayesian mixture classiﬁer. However, their bound contained an explicit dependence on the dimension (see Thm. 3 in [4]). Although the approach pioneered by McAllester came to be known as PAC-Bayes, this term is somewhat misleading since an optimal Bayesian method (in the decision theoretic framework outline above) does not average over loss functions but rather over hypotheses. In this regard, the learning behavior of a true Bayesian method is not addressed in the PAC-Bayes analysis. In this paper, we would like to narrow the discrepancy by analyzing Bayesian mixture methods, where we consider a predictor that is the average of a family of predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior distribution. Bayesian mixtures can often be regarded as a good approximation to a true optimal Bayesian method. In fact, we have shown above that they are equivalent for many important practical problems. Therefore the main contribution of the present work is the extension of the above mentioned results in PAC-Bayes analysis to a rather uniﬁed setting for Bayesian mixture methods, where diﬀerent regularization criteria may be incorporated, and their eﬀect on the performance easily assessed. Furthermore, it is also essential that the bounds obtained are dimension-independent, since otherwise they yield useless results when applied to kernel-based methods, which often map the input space into a space of very high dimensionality. Similar results can also be obtained using the covering number analysis in [14]. However the approach presented in the current paper, which relies on the direct computation of the Rademacher complexity, is more direct and gives better bounds. The analysis is also easier to generalize than the corresponding covering number approach. Moreover, our analysis applies directly to other non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. Before moving to the derivation of our bounds, we formalize our approach. Consider a countable hypothesis space H = {hj }∞ , and a probability distribution {qj } over j=1 ∞ H. Introduce the vector notation k=1 qk hk (x) = q h(x). A learning algorithm within the Bayesian mixture framework uses the sample S to select a distribution Q over H and then constructs a mixture hypothesis fq (x) = q h(x). In order to constrain the class of mixtures used in constructing the mixture q h we impose constraints on the mixture vector q. Let g(q) be a non-negative convex function of q and deﬁne for any positive A, ΩA = {q ∈ S : g(q) ≤ A} ; FA = fq : fq (x) = q h(x) : q ∈ ΩA , (3) where S denotes the probability simplex. In subsequent sections we will consider diﬀerent choices for g(q), which essentially acts as a regularization term. Finally, for any mixture q h we deﬁne the loss by L(q h) = Eµ (y, (q h)(x)) and the n ˆ empirical loss incurred on the sample by L(q h) = (1/n) i=1 (yi , (q h)(xi )). 3 A Mixture Algorithm with an Entropic Constraint In this section we consider an entropic constraint, which penalizes weights deviating signiﬁcantly from some prior probability distribution ν = {νj }∞ , which may j=1 incorporate our prior information about he problem. The weights q themselves are chosen by the algorithm based on the data. In particular, in this section we set g(q) to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence of q from ν, g(q) = D(q ν) ; qj log(qj /νj ). D(q ν) = j Let F be a class of real-valued functions, and denote by σi independent Bernoulli random variables assuming the values ±1 with equal probability. We deﬁne the data-dependent Rademacher complexity of F as 1 ˆ Rn (F) = Eσ sup n f ∈F n σi f (xi ) |S . i=1 ˆ The expectation of Rn (F) with respect to S will be denoted by Rn (F). We note ˆ n (F) is concentrated around its mean value Rn (F) (e.g., Thm. 8 in [1]). We that R quote a slightly adapted result from [5]. Theorem 1 (Adapted from Theorem 1 in [5]) Let {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } ∈ X be a sequence of points generated independently at random according to a probability distribution P , and let F be a class of measurable functions from X to R. Furthermore, let φ be a non-negative Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant κ, such that φ◦f is uniformly bounded by a constant M . Then for all f ∈ F with probability at least 1 − δ Eφ(f (x)) − 1 n n φ(f (xi )) ≤ 4κRn (F) + M i=1 log(1/δ) . 2n An immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is the following. Lemma 3.1 Let the loss function be bounded by M , and assume that it is Lipschitz with constant κ. Then for all q ∈ ΩA with probability at least 1 − δ log(1/δ) . 2n ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κRn (FA ) + M Next, we bound the empirical Rademacher average of FA using g(q) = D(q ν). Lemma 3.2 The empirical Rademacher complexity of FA is upper bounded as follows: 2A n ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ 1 n sup j n hj (xi )2 . i=1 Proof: We ﬁrst recall a few facts from the theory of convex duality [10]. Let p(u) be a convex function over a domain U , and set its dual s(z) = supu∈U u z − p(u) . It is known that s(z) is also convex. Setting u = q and p(q) = j qj log(qj /νj ) we ﬁnd that s(v) = log j νj ezj . From the deﬁnition of s(z) it follows that for any q ∈ S, q z≤ qj log(qj /νj ) + log ν j ez j . j j Since z is arbitrary, we set z = (λ/n) i σi h(xi ) and conclude that for q ∈ ΩA and any λ > 0   n   1 λ 1 sup A + log νj exp σi q h(xi ) ≤ σi hj (xi ) .  n i=1 λ n i q∈ΩA j Taking the expectation with respect to σ, and using 2 Eσ {exp ( i σi ai )} ≤ exp i ai /2 , we have that  λ 1 ˆ νj exp A + Eσ log σi hj (xi ) Rn (FA ) ≤ λ n j ≤ ≤ = i 1 λ A + sup log Eσ exp 1 λ A + sup log exp j j A λ + 2 sup λ 2n j λ2 n2 λ n i σi hj (xi ) the Chernoﬀ bound    (Jensen) i hj (xi )2 2 (Chernoﬀ) hj (xi )2 . i Minimizing the r.h.s. with respect to λ, we obtain the desired result. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 yields our basic bound, where κ and M are deﬁned in Lemma 3.1. Theorem 2 Let S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )} be a sample of i.i.d. points each drawn according to a distribution µ(x, y). Let H be a countable hypothesis class, and set FA to be the class deﬁned in (3) with g(q) = D(q ν). Set ∆H = (1/n)Eµ supj 1−δ n i=1 hj (xi )2 1/2 . Then for any q ∈ ΩA with probability at least ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2A +M n log(1/δ) . 2n Note that if hj are uniformly bounded, hj ≤ c, then ∆H ≤ c. Theorem 2 holds for a ﬁxed value of A. Using the so-called multiple testing Lemma (e.g. [11]) we obtain: Corollary 3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold, and let {Ai , pi } be a set of positive numbers such that i pi = 1. Then for all Ai and q ∈ ΩAi with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2Ai +M n log(1/pi δ) . 2n Note that the only distinction with Theorem 2 is the extra factor of log pi which is the price paid for the uniformity of the bound. Finally, we present a data-dependent bound of the form (1). Theorem 3 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold. Then for all q ∈ S with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H , M ) × 130D(q ν) + log(1/δ) . n (4) Proof sketch Pick Ai = 2i and pi = 1/i(i + 1), i = 1, 2, . . . (note that i pi = 1). For each q, let i(q) be the smallest index for which Ai(q) ≥ D(q ν) implying that log(1/pi(q) ) ≤ 2 log log2 (4D(q ν)). A few lines of algebra, to be presented in the full paper, yield the desired result. The results of Theorem 3 can be compared to those derived by McAllester [8] for the randomized Gibbs procedure. In the latter case, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is ˆ Eh∼Q L(h), namely the average empirical error of the base classiﬁers h. In our case ˆ the corresponding term is L(Eh∼Q h), namely the empirical error of the average hypothesis. Since Eh∼Q h is potentially much more complex than any single h ∈ H, we expect that the empirical term in (4) is much smaller than the corresponding term in [8]. Moreover, the complexity term we obtain is in fact tighter than the corresponding term in [8] by a logarithmic factor in n (although the logarithmic factor in [8] could probably be eliminated). We thus expect that Bayesian mixture approach advocated here leads to better performance guarantees. Finally, we comment that Theorem 3 can be used to obtain so-called oracle inequalities. In particular, let q∗ be the optimal distribution minimizing L(q h), which can only be computed if the underlying distribution µ(x, y) is known. Consider an ˆ algorithm which, based only on the data, selects a distribution q by minimizing the r.h.s. of (4), with the implicit constants appropriately speciﬁed. Then, using standard approaches (e.g. [2]) we can obtain a bound on L(ˆ h) − L(q∗ h). For q lack of space, we defer the derivation of the precise bound to the full paper. 4 General Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixtures The Kullback-Leibler divergence is but one way to incorporate prior information. In this section we extend the results to general convex regularization functions g(q). Some possible choices for g(q) besides the Kullback-Leibler divergence are the standard Lp norms q p . In order to proceed along the lines of Section 3, we let s(z) be the convex function associated with g(q), namely s(z) = supq∈ΩA q z − g(q) . Repeating n 1 the arguments of Section 3 we have for any λ > 0 that n i=1 σi q h(xi ) ≤ 1 λ i σi h(xi ) , which implies that λ A+s n 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ λ n A + Eσ s σi h(xi ) . (5) i n Assume that s(z) is second order diﬀerentiable, and that for any h = i=1 σi h(xi ) 1 2 (s(h + ∆h) + s(h − ∆h)) − s(h) ≤ u(∆h). Then, assuming that s(0) = 0, it is easy to show by induction that n n Eσ s (λ/n) i=1 σi h(xi ) ≤ u((λ/n)h(xi )). (6) i=1 In the remainder of the section we focus on the the case of regularization based on the Lp norm. Consider p and q such that 1/q + 1/p = 1, p ∈ (1, ∞), and let p = max(p, 2) and q = min(q, 2). Note that if p ≤ 2 then q ≥ 2, q = p = 2 and if p > 2 1 then q < 2, q = q, p = p. Consider p-norm regularization g(q) = p q p , in which p 1 case s(z) = q z q . The Rademacher averaging result for p-norm regularization q is known in the Geometric theory of Banach spaces (type structure of the Banach space), and it also follows from Khinchtine’s inequality. We show that it can be easily obtained in our framework. In this case, it is easy to see that s(z) = Substituting in (5) we have 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ A+ λ n q−1 q where Cq = ((q − 1)/q ) 1/q q 1 q z q q n h(xi ) q q = i=1 implies u(h(x)) ≤ Cq A1/p n1/p 1 n q−1 q h(x) q q . 1/q n h(xi ) q q i=1 . Combining this result with the methods described in Section 3, we establish a bound for regularization based on the Lp norm. Assume that h(xi ) q is ﬁnite for all i, and set ∆H,q = E (1/n) n i=1 h(xi ) q q 1/q . Theorem 4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3 hold and set g(q) = (1, ∞). Then for all q ∈ S, with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H,q , M ) × O q p + n1/p log log( q p 1 p q p p , p ∈ + 3) + log(1/δ) n where O(·) hides a universal constant that depends only on p. 5 Discussion We have introduced and analyzed a class of regularized Bayesian mixture approaches, which construct complex composite estimators by combining hypotheses from some underlying hypothesis class using data-dependent weights. Such weighted averaging approaches have been used extensively within the Bayesian framework, as well as in more recent approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. While Bayesian methods are known, under favorable conditions, to lead to optimal estimators in a frequentist setting, their performance in agnostic settings, where no reliable assumptions can be made concerning the data generating mechanism, has not been well understood. Our data-dependent bounds allow the utilization of Bayesian mixture models in general settings, while at the same time taking advantage of the beneﬁts of the Bayesian approach in terms of incorporation of prior knowledge. The bounds established, being independent of the cardinality of the underlying hypothesis space, can be directly applied to kernel based methods.

<p>Author: Bernd Fischer, Johann Schumann, Wray Buntine, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning has reached a point where many probabilistic methods can be understood as variations, extensions and combinations of a much smaller set of abstract themes, e.g., as different instances of the EM algorithm. This enables the systematic derivation of algorithms customized for different models. Here, we describe the AUTO BAYES system which takes a high-level statistical model speciﬁcation, uses powerful symbolic techniques based on schema-based program synthesis and computer algebra to derive an efﬁcient specialized algorithm for learning that model, and generates executable code implementing that algorithm. This capability is far beyond that of code collections such as Matlab toolboxes or even tools for model-independent optimization such as BUGS for Gibbs sampling: complex new algorithms can be generated without new programming, algorithms can be highly specialized and tightly crafted for the exact structure of the model and data, and efﬁcient and commented code can be generated for different languages or systems. We present automatically-derived algorithms ranging from closed-form solutions of Bayesian textbook problems to recently-proposed EM algorithms for clustering, regression, and a multinomial form of PCA. 1 Automatic Derivation of Statistical Algorithms Overview. We describe a symbolic program synthesis system which works as a “statistical algorithm compiler:” it compiles a statistical model speciﬁcation into a custom algorithm design and from that further down into a working program implementing the algorithm design. This system, AUTO BAYES, can be loosely thought of as “part theorem prover, part Mathematica, part learning textbook, and part Numerical Recipes.” It provides much more ﬂexibility than a ﬁxed code repository such as a Matlab toolbox, and allows the creation of efﬁcient algorithms which have never before been implemented, or even written down. AUTO BAYES is intended to automate the more routine application of complex methods in novel contexts. For example, recent multinomial extensions to PCA [2, 4] can be derived in this way. The algorithm design problem. Given a dataset and a task, creating a learning method can be characterized by two main questions: 1. What is the model? 2. What algorithm will optimize the model parameters? The statistical algorithm (i.e., a parameter optimization algorithm for the statistical model) can then be implemented manually. The system in this paper answers the algorithm question given that the user has chosen a model for the data,and continues through to implementation. Performing this task at the state-of-the-art level requires an intertwined meld of probability theory, computational mathematics, and software engineering. However, a number of factors unite to allow us to solve the algorithm design problem computationally: 1. The existence of fundamental building blocks (e.g., standardized probability distributions, standard optimization procedures, and generic data structures). 2. The existence of common representations (i.e., graphical models [3, 13] and program schemas). 3. The formalization of schema applicability constraints as guards. 1 The challenges of algorithm design. The design problem has an inherently combinatorial nature, since subparts of a function may be optimized recursively and in different ways. It also involves the use of new data structures or approximations to gain performance. As the research in statistical algorithms advances, its creative focus should move beyond the ultimately mechanical aspects and towards extending the abstract applicability of already existing schemas (algorithmic principles like EM), improving schemas in ways that generalize across anything they can be applied to, and inventing radically new schemas. 2 Combining Schema-based Synthesis and Bayesian Networks Statistical Models.

Internally, AUTO BAYES uses a class of techniques known as computational logic which has its roots in automated theorem proving. AUTO BAYES begins with an initial goal and a set of initial assertions, or axioms, and adds new assertions, or theorems, by repeated application of the axioms, until the goal is proven. In our context, the goal is given by the input model; the derived algorithms are side effects of constructive theorems proving the existence of algorithms for the goal. 1 Schema guards vary widely; for example, compare Nead-Melder simplex or simulated annealing (which require only function evaluation), conjugate gradient (which require both Jacobian and Hessian), EM and its variational extension [6] (which require a latent-variable structure model). 2 Here, keywords have been underlined and line numbers have been added for reference in the text. The as-keyword allows annotations to variables which end up in the generated code’s comments. Also, n classes has been set to three (line 4), while n points is left unspeciﬁed. The class variable and single data variable are vectors, which deﬁnes them as i.i.d. Computer algebra. The ﬁrst core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can mechanize the required symbol manipulation, using computer algebra methods. General symbolic differentiation and expression simpliﬁcation are capabilities fundamental to our approach. AUTO BAYES contains a computer algebra engine using term rewrite rules which are an efﬁcient mechanism for substitution of equal quantities or expressions and thus well-suited for this task.3 Schema-based synthesis. The computational cost of full-blown theorem proving grinds simple tasks to a halt while elementary and intermediate facts are reinvented from scratch. To achieve the scale of deduction required by algorithm derivation, we thus follow a schema-based synthesis technique which breaks away from strict theorem proving. Instead, we formalize high-level domain knowledge, such as the general EM strategy, as schemas. A schema combines a generic code fragment with explicitly speciﬁed preconditions which describe the applicability of the code fragment. The second core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can use Bayesian networks to efﬁciently encode the preconditions of complex algorithms such as EM. First-order logic representation of Bayesian netNclasses works. A ﬁrst-order logic representation of Bayesian µ σ networks was developed by Haddawy [7]. In this framework, random variables are represented by functor symbols and indexes (i.e., speciﬁc instances φ x c of i.i.d. vectors) are represented as functor arguments. discrete gauss Nclasses Since unknown index values can be represented by Npoints implicitly universally quantiﬁed Prolog variables, this approach allows a compact encoding of networks involving i.i.d. variables or plates [3]; the ﬁgure shows the initial network for our running example. Moreover, such networks correspond to backtrack-free datalog programs, allowing the dependencies to be efﬁciently computed. We have extended the framework to work with non-ground probability queries since we seek to determine probabilities over entire i.i.d. vectors and matrices. Tests for independence on these indexed Bayesian networks are easily developed in Lauritzen’s framework which uses ancestral sets and set separation [9] and is more amenable to a theorem prover than the double negatives of the more widely known d-separation criteria.

They are given by embedding of a critical point for models with less components. A sufﬁcient condition that the critical line gives local maxima or saddle points is also derived.

<p>Author: Bernd Fischer, Johann Schumann, Wray Buntine, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning has reached a point where many probabilistic methods can be understood as variations, extensions and combinations of a much smaller set of abstract themes, e.g., as different instances of the EM algorithm. This enables the systematic derivation of algorithms customized for different models. Here, we describe the AUTO BAYES system which takes a high-level statistical model speciﬁcation, uses powerful symbolic techniques based on schema-based program synthesis and computer algebra to derive an efﬁcient specialized algorithm for learning that model, and generates executable code implementing that algorithm. This capability is far beyond that of code collections such as Matlab toolboxes or even tools for model-independent optimization such as BUGS for Gibbs sampling: complex new algorithms can be generated without new programming, algorithms can be highly specialized and tightly crafted for the exact structure of the model and data, and efﬁcient and commented code can be generated for different languages or systems. We present automatically-derived algorithms ranging from closed-form solutions of Bayesian textbook problems to recently-proposed EM algorithms for clustering, regression, and a multinomial form of PCA. 1 Automatic Derivation of Statistical Algorithms Overview. We describe a symbolic program synthesis system which works as a “statistical algorithm compiler:” it compiles a statistical model speciﬁcation into a custom algorithm design and from that further down into a working program implementing the algorithm design. This system, AUTO BAYES, can be loosely thought of as “part theorem prover, part Mathematica, part learning textbook, and part Numerical Recipes.” It provides much more ﬂexibility than a ﬁxed code repository such as a Matlab toolbox, and allows the creation of efﬁcient algorithms which have never before been implemented, or even written down. AUTO BAYES is intended to automate the more routine application of complex methods in novel contexts. For example, recent multinomial extensions to PCA [2, 4] can be derived in this way. The algorithm design problem. Given a dataset and a task, creating a learning method can be characterized by two main questions: 1. What is the model? 2. What algorithm will optimize the model parameters? The statistical algorithm (i.e., a parameter optimization algorithm for the statistical model) can then be implemented manually. The system in this paper answers the algorithm question given that the user has chosen a model for the data,and continues through to implementation. Performing this task at the state-of-the-art level requires an intertwined meld of probability theory, computational mathematics, and software engineering. However, a number of factors unite to allow us to solve the algorithm design problem computationally: 1. The existence of fundamental building blocks (e.g., standardized probability distributions, standard optimization procedures, and generic data structures). 2. The existence of common representations (i.e., graphical models [3, 13] and program schemas). 3. The formalization of schema applicability constraints as guards. 1 The challenges of algorithm design. The design problem has an inherently combinatorial nature, since subparts of a function may be optimized recursively and in different ways. It also involves the use of new data structures or approximations to gain performance. As the research in statistical algorithms advances, its creative focus should move beyond the ultimately mechanical aspects and towards extending the abstract applicability of already existing schemas (algorithmic principles like EM), improving schemas in ways that generalize across anything they can be applied to, and inventing radically new schemas. 2 Combining Schema-based Synthesis and Bayesian Networks Statistical Models.

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a highdimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efﬁcient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efﬁcient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4]. 1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover compact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that manifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coherent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree. Roweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inefﬁcient (although [2] describes an improved training algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization). In this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is efﬁcient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules. 2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm H 9¥ EI¡ CD66B9 ©9B 766 % G F 5 #</p><p>4 0.50797331 <a title="63-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Maximum_Likelihood_and_the_Information_Bottleneck.html">142 nips-2002-Maximum Likelihood and the Information Bottleneck</a></p>
<p>Author: Noam Slonim, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is an information-theoretic formulation for clustering problems. Given a joint distribution , this method constructs a new variable that deﬁnes partitions over the values of that are informative about . Maximum likelihood (ML) of mixture models is a standard statistical approach to clustering problems. In this paper, we ask: how are the two methods related ? We deﬁne a simple mapping between the IB problem and the ML problem for the multinomial mixture model. We show that under this mapping the or problems are strongly related. In fact, for uniform input distribution over for large sample size, the problems are mathematically equivalent. Speciﬁcally, in these cases, every ﬁxed point of the IB-functional deﬁnes a ﬁxed point of the (log) likelihood and vice versa. Moreover, the values of the functionals at the ﬁxed points are equal under simple transformations. As a result, in these cases, every algorithm that solves one of the problems, induces a solution for the other.   ©§ ¥£ ¨¦¤¢   </p><p>5 0.50336426 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-The_Effect_of_Singularities_in_a_Learning_Machine_when_the_True_Parameters_Do_Not_Lie_on_such_Singularities.html">195 nips-2002-The Effect of Singularities in a Learning Machine when the True Parameters Do Not Lie on such Singularities</a></p>
<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: A lot of learning machines with hidden variables used in information science have singularities in their parameter spaces. At singularities, the Fisher information matrix becomes degenerate, resulting that the learning theory of regular statistical models does not hold. Recently, it was proven that, if the true parameter is contained in singularities, then the coeﬃcient of the Bayes generalization error is equal to the pole of the zeta function of the Kullback information. In this paper, under the condition that the true parameter is almost but not contained in singularities, we show two results. (1) If the dimension of the parameter from inputs to hidden units is not larger than three, then there exits a region of true parameters where the generalization error is larger than those of regular models, however, if otherwise, then for any true parameter, the generalization error is smaller than those of regular models. (2) The symmetry of the generalization error and the training error does not hold in singular models in general. 1</p><p>6 0.49486098 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Parametric_Mixture_Models_for_Multi-Labeled_Text.html">162 nips-2002-Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: A distance-based conditional model on the ranking poset is presented for use in classiﬁcation and ranking. The model is an extension of the Mallows model, and generalizes the classiﬁer combination methods used by several ensemble learning algorithms, including error correcting output codes, discrete AdaBoost, logistic regression and cranking. The algebraic structure of the ranking poset leads to a simple Bayesian interpretation of the conditional model and its special cases. In addition to a unifying view, the framework suggests a probabilistic interpretation for error correcting output codes and an extension beyond the binary coding scheme.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86490393 <a title="63-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Critical_Lines_in_Symmetry_of_Mixture_Models_and_its_Application_to_Component_Splitting.html">63 nips-2002-Critical Lines in Symmetry of Mixture Models and its Application to Component Splitting</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Shotaro Akaho, Shun-ichi Amari</p><p>Abstract: We show the existence of critical points as lines for the likelihood function of mixture-type models. They are given by embedding of a critical point for models with less components. A sufﬁcient condition that the critical line gives local maxima or saddle points is also derived. Based on this fact, a component-split method is proposed for a mixture of Gaussian components, and its effectiveness is veriﬁed through experiments. 1</p><p>3 0.82309878 <a title="63-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Multiclass_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Embeddings.html">149 nips-2002-Multiclass Learning by Probabilistic Embeddings</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new algorithmic framework for learning multiclass categorization problems. In this framework a multiclass predictor is composed of a pair of embeddings that map both instances and labels into a common space. In this space each instance is assigned the label it is nearest to. We outline and analyze an algorithm, termed Bunching, for learning the pair of embeddings from labeled data. A key construction in the analysis of the algorithm is the notion of probabilistic output codes, a generalization of error correcting output codes (ECOC). Furthermore, the method of multiclass categorization using ECOC is shown to be an instance of Bunching. We demonstrate the advantage of Bunching over ECOC by comparing their performance on numerous categorization problems.</p><p>4 0.79198945 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Scaling_for_Feature_Selection_in_SVMs.html">24 nips-2002-Adaptive Scaling for Feature Selection in SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm for the automatic relevance determination of input variables in kernelized Support Vector Machines. Relevance is measured by scale factors deﬁning the input space metric, and feature selection is performed by assigning zero weights to irrelevant variables. The metric is automatically tuned by the minimization of the standard SVM empirical risk, where scale factors are added to the usual set of parameters deﬁning the classiﬁer. Feature selection is achieved by constraints encouraging the sparsity of scale factors. The resulting algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art feature selection procedures and demonstrates its effectiveness on a demanding facial expression recognition problem.</p><p>5 0.72921264 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Clustering_with_the_Fisher_Score.html">53 nips-2002-Clustering with the Fisher Score</a></p>
<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Recently the Fisher score (or the Fisher kernel) is increasingly used as a feature extractor for classiﬁcation problems. The Fisher score is a vector of parameter derivatives of loglikelihood of a probabilistic model. This paper gives a theoretical analysis about how class information is preserved in the space of the Fisher score, which turns out that the Fisher score consists of a few important dimensions with class information and many nuisance dimensions. When we perform clustering with the Fisher score, K-Means type methods are obviously inappropriate because they make use of all dimensions. So we will develop a novel but simple clustering algorithm specialized for the Fisher score, which can exploit important dimensions. This algorithm is successfully tested in experiments with artiﬁcial data and real data (amino acid sequences).</p><p>6 0.72779888 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-An_Impossibility_Theorem_for_Clustering.html">27 nips-2002-An Impossibility Theorem for Clustering</a></p>

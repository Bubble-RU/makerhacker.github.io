<p>Author: Volker Roth, Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise data in empirical sciences typically violate metricity, either due to noise or due to fallible estimates, and therefore are hard to analyze by conventional machine learning technology. In this paper we therefore study ways to work around this problem. First, we present an alternative embedding to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that allows us to apply a variety of classical machine learning and signal processing algorithms. The class of pairwise grouping algorithms which share the shift-invariance property is statistically invariant under this embedding procedure, leading to identical assignments of objects to clusters. Based on this new vectorial representation, denoising methods are applied in a second step. Both steps provide a theoretically well controlled setup to translate from pairwise data to the respective denoised metric representation. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our theoretical reasoning by discovering structure in protein sequence data bases, visibly improving performance upon existing automatic methods. 1</p><p>3 0.091194198 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Feature_Selection_and_Classification_on_Matrix_Data%3A_From_Large_Margins_to_Small_Covering_Numbers.html">88 nips-2002-Feature Selection and Classification on Matrix Data: From Large Margins to Small Covering Numbers</a></p>
<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a classiﬁcation task for datasets which are described by matrices. Rows and columns of these matrices correspond to objects, where row and column objects may belong to diﬀerent sets, and the entries in the matrix express the relationships between them. We interpret the matrix elements as being produced by an unknown kernel which operates on object pairs and we show that - under mild assumptions - these kernels correspond to dot products in some (unknown) feature space. Minimizing a bound for the generalization error of a linear classiﬁer which has been obtained using covering numbers we derive an objective function for model selection according to the principle of structural risk minimization. The new objective function has the advantage that it allows the analysis of matrices which are not positive deﬁnite, and not even symmetric or square. We then consider the case that row objects are interpreted as features. We suggest an additional constraint, which imposes sparseness on the row objects and show, that the method can then be used for feature selection. Finally, we apply this method to data obtained from DNA microarrays, where “column” objects correspond to samples, “row” objects correspond to genes and matrix elements correspond to expression levels. Benchmarks are conducted using standard one-gene classiﬁcation and support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors after standard feature selection. Our new method extracts a sparse set of genes and provides superior classiﬁcation results. 1</p><p>4 0.066794753 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Distance_Metric_Learning_with_Application_to_Clustering_with_Side-Information.html">70 nips-2002-Distance Metric Learning with Application to Clustering with Side-Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Stuart Russell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to ﬁnd one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufﬁciently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, , learns a distance metric over if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efﬁcient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to signiﬁcantly improve clustering performance. £ ¤¢ £ ¥¢</p><p>5 0.065511309 <a title="158-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Artefactual_Structure_from_Least-Squares_Multidimensional_Scaling.html">34 nips-2002-Artefactual Structure from Least-Squares Multidimensional Scaling</a></p>

<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of placing objects, described by high-dimensional vectors or by pairwise dissimilarities, in a low-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbor identities. A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to deﬁne a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional “images” of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word “bank”, to have versions close to the images of both “river” and “ﬁnance” without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts.</p><p>4 0.49985993 <a title="158-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Multiplicative_Updates_for_Nonnegative_Quadratic_Programming_in_Support_Vector_Machines.html">151 nips-2002-Multiplicative Updates for Nonnegative Quadratic Programming in Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Sha, Lawrence K. Saul, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: We derive multiplicative updates for solving the nonnegative quadratic programming problem in support vector machines (SVMs). The updates have a simple closed form, and we prove that they converge monotonically to the solution of the maximum margin hyperplane. The updates optimize the traditionally proposed objective function for SVMs. They do not involve any heuristics such as choosing a learning rate or deciding which variables to update at each iteration. They can be used to adjust all the quadratic programming variables in parallel with a guarantee of improvement at each iteration. We analyze the asymptotic convergence of the updates and show that the coefﬁcients of non-support vectors decay geometrically to zero at a rate that depends on their margins. In practice, the updates converge very rapidly to good classiﬁers.</p><p>5 0.49887753 <a title="158-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Coulomb_Classifiers%3A_Generalizing_Support_Vector_Machines_via_an_Analogy_to_Electrostatic_Systems.html">62 nips-2002-Coulomb Classifiers: Generalizing Support Vector Machines via an Analogy to Electrostatic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael C. Mozer, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of classiﬁers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classiﬁers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the ν–SVM and the C–SVM. In the electrostatics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classiﬁcation function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algorithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-deﬁnite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classiﬁer in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and perform simulation studies to show that they are comparable or superior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classiﬁcation tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise proximities, where a Coulomb Classiﬁer outperformed standard SVMs. 1</p><p>6 0.49813673 <a title="158-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Going_Metric%3A_Denoising_Pairwise_Data.html">98 nips-2002-Going Metric: Denoising Pairwise Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Jakob Heinzle, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: We report a system that classiﬁes and can learn to classify patterns of visual motion on-line. The complete system is described by the dynamics of its physical network architectures. The combination of the following properties makes the system novel: Firstly, the front-end of the system consists of an aVLSI optical ﬂow chip that collectively computes 2-D global visual motion in real-time [1]. Secondly, the complexity of the classiﬁcation task is signiﬁcantly reduced by mapping the continuous motion trajectories to sequences of ’motion events’. And thirdly, all the network structures are simple and with the exception of the optical ﬂow chip based on a Winner-Take-All (WTA) architecture. We demonstrate the application of the proposed generic system for a contactless man-machine interface that allows to write letters by visual motion. Regarding the low complexity of the system, its robustness and the already existing front-end, a complete aVLSI system-on-chip implementation is realistic, allowing various applications in mobile electronic devices.</p><p>3 0.56532687 <a title="158-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Stability-Based_Model_Selection.html">188 nips-2002-Stability-Based Model Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Mikio L. Braun, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Model selection is linked to model assessment, which is the problem of comparing different models, or model parameters, for a speciﬁc learning task. For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>4 0.55943036 <a title="158-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Sparse_Gaussian_Process_Methods%3A_The_Informative_Vector_Machine.html">86 nips-2002-Fast Sparse Gaussian Process Methods: The Informative Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Neil D. Lawrence, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We present a framework for sparse Gaussian process (GP) methods which uses forward selection with criteria based on informationtheoretic principles, previously suggested for active learning. Our goal is not only to learn d–sparse predictors (which can be evaluated in O(d) rather than O(n), d n, n the number of training points), but also to perform training under strong restrictions on time and memory requirements. The scaling of our method is at most O(n · d2 ), and in large real-world classiﬁcation experiments we show that it can match prediction performance of the popular support vector machine (SVM), yet can be signiﬁcantly faster in training. In contrast to the SVM, our approximation produces estimates of predictive probabilities (‘error bars’), allows for Bayesian model selection and is less complex in implementation. 1</p><p>5 0.55877882 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Parametric_Mixture_Models_for_Multi-Labeled_Text.html">162 nips-2002-Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Naonori Ueda, Kazumi Saito</p><p>Abstract: We propose probabilistic generative models, called parametric mixture models (PMMs), for multiclass, multi-labeled text categorization problem. Conventionally, the binary classiﬁcation approach has been employed, in which whether or not text belongs to a category is judged by the binary classiﬁer for every category. In contrast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive eﬃcient learning and prediction algorithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signiﬁcantly outperform the conventional binary methods when applied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages. 1</p><p>6 0.55875081 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

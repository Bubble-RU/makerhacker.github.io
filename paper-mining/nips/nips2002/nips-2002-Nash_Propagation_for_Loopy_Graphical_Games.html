<p>Author: Xiaofeng Wang, Tuomas Sandholm</p><p>Abstract: Multiagent learning is a key problem in AI. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conﬂicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm’s parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.</p><p>3 0.4198474 <a title="152-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Efficient_Learning_Equilibrium.html">78 nips-2002-Efficient Learning Equilibrium</a></p>
<p>Author: Ronen I. Brafman, Moshe Tennenholtz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce efficient learning equilibrium (ELE), a normative approach to learning in non cooperative settings. In ELE, the learning algorithms themselves are required to be in equilibrium. In addition, the learning algorithms arrive at a desired value after polynomial time, and deviations from a prescribed ELE become irrational after polynomial time. We prove the existence of an ELE in the perfect monitoring setting, where the desired value is the expected payoff in a Nash equilibrium. We also show that an ELE does not always exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Yet, it exists in the special case of common-interest games. Finally, we extend our results to general stochastic games. 1</p><p>4 0.11577883 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Learning_in_Zero-Sum_Team_Markov_Games_Using_Factored_Value_Functions.html">130 nips-2002-Learning in Zero-Sum Team Markov Games Using Factored Value Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Michail G. Lagoudakis, Ronald Parr</p><p>Abstract: We present a new method for learning good strategies in zero-sum Markov games in which each side is composed of multiple agents collaborating against an opposing team of agents. Our method requires full observability and communication during learning, but the learned policies can be executed in a distributed manner. The value function is represented as a factored linear architecture and its structure determines the necessary computational resources and communication bandwidth. This approach permits a tradeoff between simple representations with little or no communication between agents and complex, computationally intensive representations with extensive coordination between agents. Thus, we provide a principled means of using approximation to combat the exponential blowup in the joint action space of the participants. The approach is demonstrated with an example that shows the efﬁciency gains over naive enumeration.</p><p>5 0.11087165 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Fractional_Belief_Propagation.html">94 nips-2002-Fractional Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wim Wiegerinck, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-ﬁeld free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.</p><p>6 0.10410501 <a title="152-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Note_on_the_Representational_Incompatibility_of_Function_Approximation_and_Factored_Dynamics.html">13 nips-2002-A Note on the Representational Incompatibility of Function Approximation and Factored Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Allender, Sanjeev Arora, Michael Kearns, Cristopher Moore, Alexander Russell</p><p>Abstract: We establish a new hardness result that shows that the difﬁculty of planning in factored Markov decision processes is representational rather than just computational. More precisely, we give a ﬁxed family of factored MDPs with linear rewards whose optimal policies and value functions simply cannot be represented succinctly in any standard parametric form. Previous hardness results indicated that computing good policies from the MDP parameters was difﬁcult, but left open the possibility of succinct function approximation for any ﬁxed factored MDP. Our result applies even to policies which yield a polynomially poor approximation to the optimal value, and highlights interesting connections with the complexity class of Arthur-Merlin games.</p><p>6 0.2609697 <a title="152-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Stable_Fixed_Points_of_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_Are_Local_Minima_of_the_Bethe_Free_Energy.html">189 nips-2002-Stable Fixed Points of Loopy Belief Propagation Are Local Minima of the Bethe Free Energy</a></p>

<p>Author: David A. Ross, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model that can learn parts-based representations of highdimensional data. Our key assumption is that the dimensions of the data can be separated into several disjoint subsets, or factors, which take on values independently of each other. We assume each factor has a small number of discrete states, and model it using a vector quantizer. The selected states of each factor represent the multiple causes of the input. Given a set of training examples, our model learns the association of data dimensions with factors, as well as the states of each VQ. Inference and learning are carried out efﬁciently via variational algorithms. We present applications of this model to problems in image decomposition, collaborative ﬁltering, and text classiﬁcation.</p><p>3 0.83307505 <a title="152-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>4 0.82758355 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Inferring_a_Semantic_Representation_of_Text_via_Cross-Language_Correlation_Analysis.html">112 nips-2002-Inferring a Semantic Representation of Text via Cross-Language Correlation Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexei Vinokourov, Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short English document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the ﬁrst and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are completely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reﬂect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a speciﬁc meaning should correlate with certain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we ﬁrst demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are signiﬁcantly higher than random, and hence that a representation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should reﬂect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and signiﬁcantly superior to LSI on the same data.</p><p>5 0.82707357 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Learning_for_Label_Sequences_via_Boosting.html">69 nips-2002-Discriminative Learning for Label Sequences via Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Yasemin Altun, Thomas Hofmann, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a boosting approach to discriminative learning of label sequences based on a sequence rank loss function. The proposed method combines many of the advantages of boosting schemes with the efficiency of dynamic programming methods and is attractive both, conceptually and computationally. In addition, we also discuss alternative approaches based on the Hamming loss for label sequences. The sequence boosting algorithm offers an interesting alternative to methods based on HMMs and the more recently proposed Conditional Random Fields. Applications areas for the presented technique range from natural language processing and information extraction to computational biology. We include experiments on named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging which demonstrate the validity and competitiveness of our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.81510609 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Efficient_Learning_Equilibrium.html">78 nips-2002-Efficient Learning Equilibrium</a></p>

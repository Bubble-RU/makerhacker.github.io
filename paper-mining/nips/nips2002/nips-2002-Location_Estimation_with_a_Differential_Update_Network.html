<p>Author: Samy Bengio</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel Hidden Markov Model architecture to model the joint probability of pairs of asynchronous sequences describing the same event. It is based on two other Markovian models, namely Asynchronous Input/ Output Hidden Markov Models and Pair Hidden Markov Models. An EM algorithm to train the model is presented, as well as a Viterbi decoder that can be used to obtain the optimal state sequence as well as the alignment between the two sequences. The model has been tested on an audio-visual speech recognition task using the M2VTS database and yielded robust performances under various noise conditions. 1</p><p>3 0.20590897 <a title="137-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Nonparametric_Representation_of_Policies_and_Value_Functions%3A_A_Trajectory-Based_Approach.html">155 nips-2002-Nonparametric Representation of Policies and Value Functions: A Trajectory-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher G. Atkeson, Jun Morimoto</p><p>Abstract: A longstanding goal of reinforcement learning is to develop nonparametric representations of policies and value functions that support rapid learning without suffering from interference or the curse of dimensionality. We have developed a trajectory-based approach, in which policies and value functions are represented nonparametrically along trajectories. These trajectories, policies, and value functions are updated as the value function becomes more accurate or as a model of the task is updated. We have applied this approach to periodic tasks such as hopping and walking, which required handling discount factors and discontinuities in the task dynamics, and using function approximation to represent value functions at discontinuities. We also describe extensions of the approach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.</p><p>4 0.17987418 <a title="137-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Margin_Analysis_of_the_LVQ_Algorithm.html">140 nips-2002-Margin Analysis of the LVQ Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Prototypes based algorithms are commonly used to reduce the computational complexity of Nearest-Neighbour (NN) classiﬁers. In this paper we discuss theoretical and algorithmical aspects of such algorithms. On the theory side, we present margin based generalization bounds that suggest that these kinds of classiﬁers can be more accurate then the 1-NN rule. Furthermore, we derived a training algorithm that selects a good set of prototypes using large margin principles.

<p>Author: Alex Holub, Gilles Laurent, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Re-mapping patterns in order to equalize their distribution may greatly simplify both the structure and the training of classifiers. Here, the properties of one such map obtained by running a few steps of discrete-time dynamical system are explored. The system is called 'Digital Antennal Lobe' (DAL) because it is inspired by recent studies of the antennallobe, a structure in the olfactory system of the grasshopper. The pattern-spreading properties of the DAL as well as its average behavior as a function of its (few) design parameters are analyzed by extending previous results of Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky. Furthermore, a technique for adapting the parameters of the initial design in order to obtain opportune noise-rejection behavior is suggested. Our results are demonstrated with a number of simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.12751865 <a title="137-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Attractor_Landscapes_for_Learning_Motor_Primitives.html">123 nips-2002-Learning Attractor Landscapes for Learning Motor Primitives</a></p>

<p>Author: Shinji Watanabe, Yasuhiro Minami, Atsushi Nakamura, Naonori Ueda</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework, which constructs shared-state triphone HMMs based on a variational Bayesian approach, and recognizes speech based on the Bayesian prediction classiﬁcation; variational Bayesian estimation and clustering for speech recognition (VBEC). An appropriate model structure with high recognition performance can be found within a VBEC framework. Unlike conventional methods, including BIC or MDL criterion based on the maximum likelihood approach, the proposed model selection is valid in principle, even when there are insufﬁcient amounts of data, because it does not use an asymptotic assumption. In isolated word recognition experiments, we show the advantage of VBEC over conventional methods, especially when dealing with small amounts of data.</p><p>5 0.40929037 <a title="137-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Nonparametric_Representation_of_Policies_and_Value_Functions%3A_A_Trajectory-Based_Approach.html">155 nips-2002-Nonparametric Representation of Policies and Value Functions: A Trajectory-Based Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of placing objects, described by high-dimensional vectors or by pairwise dissimilarities, in a low-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbor identities. A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to deﬁne a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional “images” of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word “bank”, to have versions close to the images of both “river” and “ﬁnance” without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts.</p><p>3 0.6237638 <a title="137-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Hyperkernels.html">106 nips-2002-Hyperkernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng S. Ong, Robert C. Williamson, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation using a Gaussian Process estimator or a Support Vector Machine. A novel solution is presented which involves deﬁning a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space on the space of kernels itself. By utilizing an analog of the classical representer theorem, the problem of choosing a kernel from a parameterized family of kernels (e.g. of varying width) is reduced to a statistical estimation problem akin to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional. Various classical settings for model or kernel selection are special cases of our framework.</p><p>4 0.5739395 <a title="137-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the generalization performance of some learning problems in Hilbert function Spaces. We introduce a concept of scalesensitive effective data dimension, and show that it characterizes the convergence rate of the underlying learning problem. Using this concept, we can naturally extend results for parametric estimation problems in ﬁnite dimensional spaces to non-parametric kernel learning methods. We derive upper bounds on the generalization performance and show that the resulting convergent rates are optimal under various circumstances.</p><p>5 0.55144924 <a title="137-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.54226816 <a title="137-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Monaural_Speech_Separation.html">147 nips-2002-Monaural Speech Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathaniel D. Daw, Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: According to a series of inﬂuential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been conﬁned to more abstract psychological models.</p><p>3 0.16780917 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Selectivity_and_Metaplasticity_in_a_Unified_Calcium-Dependent_Model.html">180 nips-2002-Selectivity and Metaplasticity in a Unified Calcium-Dependent Model</a></p>

Here, we investigate the properties of this model for a multi-synapse neuron that receives inputs with diﬀerent spike-train statistics. In addition, we present a physiological form of metaplasticity, an activity-driven regulation mechanism, that is essential for the robustness of the model.

<p>Author: Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: We present analog neuromorphic circuits for implementing bistable synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) properties. In these types of synapses, the short-term dynamics of the synaptic efﬁcacies are governed by the relative timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes, while on long time scales the efﬁcacies tend asymptotically to either a potentiated state or to a depressed one. We fabricated a prototype VLSI chip containing a network of integrate and ﬁre neurons interconnected via bistable STDP synapses.

<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Malte Boegershausen, Pascal Suter</p><p>Abstract: We describe a model of short-term synaptic depression that is derived from a silicon circuit implementation. The dynamics of this circuit model are similar to the dynamics of some present theoretical models of shortterm depression except that the recovery dynamics of the variable describing the depression is nonlinear and it also depends on the presynaptic frequency. The equations describing the steady-state and transient responses of this synaptic model ﬁt the experimental results obtained from a fabricated silicon network consisting of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and different types of synapses. We also show experimental data demonstrating the possible computational roles of depression. One possible role of a depressing synapse is that the input can quickly bring the neuron up to threshold when the membrane potential is close to the resting potential.</p><p>5 0.46375954 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Neuromorphic_Bisable_VLSI_Synapses_with_Spike-Timing-Dependent_Plasticity.html">154 nips-2002-Neuromorphic Bisable VLSI Synapses with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Joaquin Quiñonero-candela, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Tipping’s relevance vector machine (RVM) [1] and formalize an incremental training strategy as a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that we call Subspace EM (SSEM). Working with a subset of active basis functions, the sparsity of the RVM solution will ensure that the number of basis functions and thereby the computational complexity is kept low. We also introduce a mean ﬁeld approach to the intractable classiﬁcation model that is expected to give a very good approximation to exact Bayesian inference and contains the Laplace approximation as a special case. We test the algorithms on two large data sets with O(103 − 104 ) examples. The results indicate that Bayesian learning of large data sets, e.g. the MNIST database is realistic.</p><p>4 0.4705365 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Semantic_Similarity.html">125 nips-2002-Learning Semantic Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaz Kandola, Nello Cristianini, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: The standard representation of text documents as bags of words suffers from well known limitations, mostly due to its inability to exploit semantic similarity between terms. Attempts to incorporate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic indexing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such similarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain positive results. 1</p><p>5 0.45720682 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Gaussian_Process_Priors_with_Uncertain_Inputs_Application_to_Multiple-Step_Ahead_Time_Series_Forecasting.html">95 nips-2002-Gaussian Process Priors with Uncertain Inputs Application to Multiple-Step Ahead Time Series Forecasting</a></p>
<p>Author: Agathe Girard, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Roderick Murray-Smith</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-step ahead prediction in time series analysis using the non-parametric Gaussian process model. -step ahead forecasting of a discrete-time non-linear dynamic system can be performed by doing repeated one-step ahead predictions. For a state-space model of the form , the prediction of at time is based on the point estimates of the previous outputs. In this paper, we show how, using an analytical Gaussian approximation, we can formally incorporate the uncertainty about intermediate regressor values, thus updating the uncertainty on the current prediction.   ¡ % # ¢ ¡     ¢ ¡¨ ¦ ¤ ¢ $</p><p>6 0.44019181 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Classifying_Patterns_of_Visual_Motion_-_a_Neuromorphic_Approach.html">51 nips-2002-Classifying Patterns of Visual Motion - a Neuromorphic Approach</a></p>

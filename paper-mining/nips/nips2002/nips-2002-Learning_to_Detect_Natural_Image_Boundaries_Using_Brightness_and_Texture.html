<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><p>3 0.24493265 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Learning_Variance_Components_of_Natural_Images.html">10 nips-2002-A Model for Learning Variance Components of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>4 0.20416456 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Intrinsic_Images_from_a_Single_Image.html">173 nips-2002-Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Marshall F. Tappen, William T. Freeman, Edward H. Adelson</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reﬂectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classiﬁer trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, each image derivative is classiﬁed as being caused by shading or a change in the surface’s reﬂectance. Generalized Belief Propagation is then used to propagate information from areas where the correct classiﬁcation is clear to areas where it is ambiguous. We also show results on real images.</p><p>5 0.19994956 <a title="132-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Bayesian_Image_Super-Resolution.html">39 nips-2002-Bayesian Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: The extraction of a single high-quality image from a set of lowresolution images is an important problem which arises in fields such as remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging and the extraction of still images from video. Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high resolution image to the observed low resolution images, using regularization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registration parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-resolution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images. Results indicate a significant improvement over techniques based on MAP (maximum a-posteriori) point optimization of the high resolution image and associated registration parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.19148596 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Sparse_Topographic_Representations_with_Products_of_Student-t_Distributions.html">127 nips-2002-Learning Sparse Topographic Representations with Products of Student-t Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>4 0.68829679 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Dynamic_Structure_Super-Resolution.html">74 nips-2002-Dynamic Structure Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: The problem of super-resolution involves generating feasible higher resolution images, which are pleasing to the eye and realistic, from a given low resolution image. This might be attempted by using simple ﬁlters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean ﬁeld approach. 1</p><p>5 0.67196459 <a title="132-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Perceive_Transparency_from_the_Statistics_of_Natural_Scenes.html">133 nips-2002-Learning to Perceive Transparency from the Statistics of Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Anat Levin, Assaf Zomet, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Certain simple images are known to trigger a percept of transparency: the input image I is perceived as the sum of two images I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + I2 (x, y). This percept is puzzling. First, why do we choose the “more complicated” description with two images rather than the “simpler” explanation I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + 0 ? Second, given the inﬁnite number of ways to express I as a sum of two images, how do we compute the “best” decomposition ? Here we suggest that transparency is the rational percept of a system that is adapted to the statistics of natural scenes. We present a probabilistic model of images based on the qualitative statistics of derivative ﬁlters and “corner detectors” in natural scenes and use this model to ﬁnd the most probable decomposition of a novel image. The optimization is performed using loopy belief propagation. We show that our model computes perceptually “correct” decompositions on synthetic images and discuss its application to real images. 1</p><p>6 0.66501611 <a title="132-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Intrinsic_Images_from_a_Single_Image.html">173 nips-2002-Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: J. L. Shapiro</p><p>Abstract: Population-based Incremental Learning is shown require very sensitive scaling of its learning rate. The learning rate must scale with the system size in a problem-dependent way. This is shown in two problems: the needle-in-a haystack, in which the learning rate must vanish exponentially in the system size, and in a smooth function in which the learning rate must vanish like the square root of the system size. Two methods are proposed for removing this sensitivity. A learning dynamics which obeys detailed balance is shown to give consistent performance over the entire range of learning rates. An analog of mutation is shown to require a learning rate which scales as the inverse system size, but is problem independent. 1</p><p>4 0.87383223 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Kernel-Based_Extraction_of_Slow_Features%3A_Complex_Cells_Learn_Disparity_and_Translation_Invariance_from_Natural_Images.html">118 nips-2002-Kernel-Based Extraction of Slow Features: Complex Cells Learn Disparity and Translation Invariance from Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Alistair Bray, Dominique Martinez</p><p>Abstract: In Slow Feature Analysis (SFA [1]), it has been demonstrated that high-order invariant properties can be extracted by projecting inputs into a nonlinear space and computing the slowest changing features in this space; this has been proposed as a simple general model for learning nonlinear invariances in the visual system. However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features ([2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image. The notion of maximising an objective function based upon the temporal predictability of output has been progressively applied in modelling the development of invariances in the visual system. F6ldiak used it indirectly via a Hebbian trace rule for modelling the development of translation invariance in complex cells [4] (closely related to many other models [5,6,7]); this rule has been used to maximise invariance as one component of a hierarchical system for object and face recognition [8]. On the other hand, similar functions have been maximised directly in networks for extracting linear [2] and nonlinear [9, 1] visual invariances. Direct maximisation of such functions have recently been used to model complex cells [10] and as an alternative to maximising sparseness/independence in modelling simple cells [11]. Slow Feature Analysis [1] combines many of the best properties of these methods to provide a good general nonlinear model. That is, it uses an objective function that minimises the first-order temporal derivative of the outputs; it provides a closedform solution which maximises this function by projecting inputs into a nonlinear http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cortex/ space; it exploits sphering (or PCA-whitening) of the data to ensure that all outputs have unit variance and are uncorrelated. However, the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality in that the nonlinear feature space soon becomes very large as the input dimension grows, and yet this feature space must be represented explicitly in order for the essential sphering to occur. The alternative that we propose here is to use the objective function of Stone [2, 9], that maximises output variance over a long period whilst minimising variance over a shorter period; in the linear case, this can be implemented by a biologically plausible mixture of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on the same synapses [2]. In recent work, Stone has proposed a closed-form solution for maximising this function in the linear domain of blind source separation that does not involve data-sphering. This paper describes how this method can be kernelised.

<p>Author: Cody Kwok, Dieter Fox, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: Particle ﬁlters estimate the state of dynamical systems from sensor information. In many real time applications of particle ﬁlters, however, sensor information arrives at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than the update rate of the ﬁlter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle ﬁlter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle ﬁlters, which make use of all sensor information even when the ﬁlter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by representing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a ﬁlter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources (samples) on valuable sensor information. Experiments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.</p><p>6 0.87011528 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Exponential_Family_PCA_for_Belief_Compression_in_POMDPs.html">82 nips-2002-Exponential Family PCA for Belief Compression in POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Alistair Bray, Dominique Martinez</p><p>Abstract: In Slow Feature Analysis (SFA [1]), it has been demonstrated that high-order invariant properties can be extracted by projecting inputs into a nonlinear space and computing the slowest changing features in this space; this has been proposed as a simple general model for learning nonlinear invariances in the visual system. However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features ([2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image. The notion of maximising an objective function based upon the temporal predictability of output has been progressively applied in modelling the development of invariances in the visual system. F6ldiak used it indirectly via a Hebbian trace rule for modelling the development of translation invariance in complex cells [4] (closely related to many other models [5,6,7]); this rule has been used to maximise invariance as one component of a hierarchical system for object and face recognition [8]. On the other hand, similar functions have been maximised directly in networks for extracting linear [2] and nonlinear [9, 1] visual invariances. Direct maximisation of such functions have recently been used to model complex cells [10] and as an alternative to maximising sparseness/independence in modelling simple cells [11]. Slow Feature Analysis [1] combines many of the best properties of these methods to provide a good general nonlinear model. That is, it uses an objective function that minimises the first-order temporal derivative of the outputs; it provides a closedform solution which maximises this function by projecting inputs into a nonlinear http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cortex/ space; it exploits sphering (or PCA-whitening) of the data to ensure that all outputs have unit variance and are uncorrelated. However, the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality in that the nonlinear feature space soon becomes very large as the input dimension grows, and yet this feature space must be represented explicitly in order for the essential sphering to occur. The alternative that we propose here is to use the objective function of Stone [2, 9], that maximises output variance over a long period whilst minimising variance over a shorter period; in the linear case, this can be implemented by a biologically plausible mixture of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on the same synapses [2]. In recent work, Stone has proposed a closed-form solution for maximising this function in the linear domain of blind source separation that does not involve data-sphering.

<p>Author: Robert A. Jacobs, Melissa Dominguez</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that systems learning aspects of visual perception may beneﬁt from the use of suitably designed developmental progressions during training. Four models were trained to estimate motion velocities in sequences of visual images. Three of the models were “developmental models” in the sense that the nature of their input changed during the course of training. They received a relatively impoverished visual input early in training, and the quality of this input improved as training progressed. One model used a coarse-to-multiscale developmental progression (i.e. it received coarse-scale motion features early in training and ﬁner-scale features were added to its input as training progressed), another model used a ﬁne-to-multiscale progression, and the third model used a random progression. The ﬁnal model was nondevelopmental in the sense that the nature of its input remained the same throughout the training period. The simulation results show that the coarse-to-multiscale model performed best. Hypotheses are offered to account for this model’s superior performance. We conclude that suitably designed developmental sequences can be useful to systems learning to estimate motion velocities. The idea that visual development can aid visual learning is a viable hypothesis in need of further study.</p><p>4 0.15716617 <a title="66-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>5 0.13131179 <a title="66-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Maximally_Informative_Dimensions%3A_Analyzing_Neural_Responses_to_Natural_Signals.html">141 nips-2002-Maximally Informative Dimensions: Analyzing Neural Responses to Natural Signals</a></p>

<p>Author: Jarmo Hurri, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We show that two important properties of the primary visual cortex emerge when the principle of temporal coherence is applied to natural image sequences. The properties are simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs, which emerge when we apply two different approaches to temporal coherence. In the ﬁrst approach we extract receptive ﬁelds whose outputs are as temporally coherent as possible. This approach yields simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds (oriented, localized, multiscale). Thus, temporal coherence is an alternative to sparse coding in modeling the emergence of simple cell receptive ﬁelds. The second approach is based on a two-layer statistical generative model of natural image sequences. In addition to modeling the temporal coherence of individual simple cells, this model includes inter-cell temporal dependencies. Estimation of this model from natural data yields both simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds, and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs. In this completely unsupervised learning, both layers of the generative model are estimated simultaneously from scratch. This is a signiﬁcant improvement on earlier statistical models of early vision, where only one layer has been learned, and others have been ﬁxed a priori.</p><p>6 0.57778335 <a title="66-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Retinal_Processing_Emulation_in_a_Programmable_2-Layer_Analog_Array_Processor_CMOS_Chip.html">177 nips-2002-Retinal Processing Emulation in a Programmable 2-Layer Analog Array Processor CMOS Chip</a></p>

<p>Author: Terry Elliott, Jörg Kramer</p><p>Abstract: A neurotrophic model for the co-development of topography and ocular dominance columns in the primary visual cortex has recently been proposed. In the present work, we test this model by driving it with the output of a pair of neuronal vision sensors stimulated by disparate moving patterns. We show that the temporal correlations in the spike trains generated by the two sensors elicit the development of reﬁned topography and ocular dominance columns, even in the presence of signiﬁcant amounts of spontaneous activity and ﬁxed-pattern noise in the sensors.</p><p>2 0.57781863 <a title="66-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Rational_Kernels.html">167 nips-2002-Rational Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Patrick Haffner, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a general family of kernels based on weighted transducers or rational relations, rational kernels, that can be used for analysis of variable-length sequences or more generally weighted automata, in applications such as computational biology or speech recognition. We show that rational kernels can be computed efﬁciently using a general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers and a general single-source shortest-distance algorithm. We also describe several general families of positive deﬁnite symmetric rational kernels. These general kernels can be combined with Support Vector Machines to form efﬁcient and powerful techniques for spoken-dialog classiﬁcation: highly complex kernels become easy to design and implement and lead to substantial improvements in the classiﬁcation accuracy. We also show that the string kernels considered in applications to computational biology are all speciﬁc instances of rational kernels.</p><p>3 0.47726583 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>4 0.47155344 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Morton-Style_Factorial_Coding_of_Color_in_Primary_Visual_Cortex.html">148 nips-2002-Morton-Style Factorial Coding of Color in Primary Visual Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Thomas Wachtler, Thomas D. Albright, Terrence Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help understand information integration and perceptual coding in the brain. We show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. We show evidence suggesting that the classical/non-classical receptive ﬁeld organization in the cortex effectively enforces the development of Morton-style factorial codes. This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual coding in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms. While methods like ICA (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997) develop independent codes, in Morton-style coding the goal is to make two or more external aspects of the world become independent when conditioning on internal representations. In this paper we introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help analyze information integration and perceptual organization in the brain. In the neurosciences factorial codes are often studied in the context of mean tuning curves. A tuning curve is called separable if it can be expressed as the product of terms selectively inﬂuenced by different stimulus dimensions. Separable tuning curves are taken as evidence of factorial coding mechanisms. In this paper we show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. Morton (1969) analyzed a wide variety of psychophysical experiments on word perception and showed that they could be explained using a model in which stimulus and context have separable effects on perception. More precisely, in Mortons’ model the joint effect of stimulus and context on a perceptual representation can be obtained by multiplying terms selectively controlled by stimulus and by context, i.e.,  £ © # #</p><p>5 0.46877047 <a title="66-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Adaptation_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">18 nips-2002-Adaptation and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Maneesh Sahani, Gregoire Deback</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation is a ubiquitous neural and psychological phenomenon, with a wealth of instantiations and implications. Although a basic form of plasticity, it has, bar some notable exceptions, attracted computational theory of only one main variety. In this paper, we study adaptation from the perspective of factor analysis, a paradigmatic technique of unsupervised learning. We use factor analysis to re-interpret a standard view of adaptation, and apply our new model to some recent data on adaptation in the domain of face discrimination.</p><p>6 0.46303809 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Expected_and_Unexpected_Uncertainty%3A_ACh_and_NE_in_the_Neocortex.html">81 nips-2002-Expected and Unexpected Uncertainty: ACh and NE in the Neocortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Pelleg, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: We focus on the problem of efﬁcient learning of dependency trees. It is well-known that given the pairwise mutual information coefﬁcients, a minimum-weight spanning tree algorithm solves this problem exactly and in polynomial time. However, for large data-sets it is the construction of the correlation matrix that dominates the running time. We have developed a new spanning-tree algorithm which is capable of exploiting partial knowledge about edge weights. The partial knowledge we maintain is a probabilistic conﬁdence interval on the coefﬁcients, which we derive by examining just a small sample of the data. The algorithm is able to ﬂag the need to shrink an interval, which translates to inspection of more data for the particular attribute pair. Experimental results show running time that is near-constant in the number of records, without signiﬁcant loss in accuracy of the generated trees. Interestingly, our spanning-tree algorithm is based solely on Tarjan’s red-edge rule, which is generally considered a guaranteed recipe for bad performance. 1</p><p>3 0.085850649 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Kernels_for_String_and_Tree_Matching.html">85 nips-2002-Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new algorithm suitable for matching discrete objects such as strings and trees in linear time, thus obviating dynarrtic programming with quadratic time complexity. Furthermore, prediction cost in many cases can be reduced to linear cost in the length of the sequence to be classified, regardless of the number of support vectors. This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner.</p><p>4 0.07721889 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Automatic_Acquisition_and_Efficient_Representation_of_Syntactic_Structures.html">35 nips-2002-Automatic Acquisition and Efficient Representation of Syntactic Structures</a></p>
<p>Author: Zach Solan, Eytan Ruppin, David Horn, Shimon Edelman</p><p>Abstract: The distributional principle according to which morphemes that occur in identical contexts belong, in some sense, to the same category [1] has been advanced as a means for extracting syntactic structures from corpus data. We extend this principle by applying it recursively, and by using mutual information for estimating category coherence. The resulting model learns, in an unsupervised fashion, highly structured, distributed representations of syntactic knowledge from corpora. It also exhibits promising behavior in tasks usually thought to require representations anchored in a grammar, such as systematicity. 1 Motivation Models dealing with the acquisition of syntactic knowledge are sharply divided into two classes, depending on whether they subscribe to some variant of the classical generative theory of syntax, or operate within the framework of “general-purpose” statistical or distributional learning. An example of the former is the model of [2], which attempts to learn syntactic structures such as Functional Category, as stipulated by the Government and Binding theory. An example of the latter model is Elman’s widely used Simple Recursive Network (SRN) [3]. We believe that polarization between statistical and classical (generative, rule-based) approaches to syntax is counterproductive, because it hampers the integration of the stronger aspects of each method into a common powerful framework. Indeed, on the one hand, the statistical approach is geared to take advantage of the considerable progress made to date in the areas of distributed representation, probabilistic learning, and “connectionist” modeling. Yet, generic connectionist architectures are ill-suited to the abstraction and processing of symbolic information. On the other hand, classical rule-based systems excel in just those tasks, yet are brittle and difﬁcult to train. We present a scheme that acquires “raw” syntactic information construed in a distributional sense, yet also supports the distillation of rule-like regularities out of the accrued statistical knowledge. Our research is motivated by linguistic theories that postulate syntactic structures (and transformations) rooted in distributional data, as exempliﬁed by the work of Zellig Harris [1]. 2 The ADIOS model The ADIOS (Automatic DIstillation Of Structure) model constructs syntactic representations of a sample of language from unlabeled corpus data. The model consists of two elements: (1) a Representational Data Structure (RDS) graph, and (2) a Pattern Acquisition (PA) algorithm that learns the RDS in an unsupervised fashion. The PA algorithm aims to detect patterns — repetitive sequences of “signiﬁcant” strings of primitives occurring in the corpus (Figure 1). In that, it is related to prior work on alignment-based learning [4] and regular expression (“local grammar”) extraction [5] from corpora. We stress, however, that our algorithm requires no pre-judging either of the scope of the primitives or of their classiﬁcation, say, into syntactic categories: all the information needed for its operation is extracted from the corpus in an unsupervised fashion. In the initial phase of the PA algorithm the text is segmented down to the smallest possible morphological constituents (e.g., ed is split off both walked and bed; the algorithm later discovers that bed should be left whole, on statistical grounds).1 This initial set of unique constituents is the vertex set of the newly formed RDS (multi-)graph. A directed edge is inserted between two vertices whenever the corresponding transition exists in the corpus (Figure 2(a)); the edge is labeled by the sentence number and by its within-sentence index. Thus, corpus sentences initially correspond to paths in the graph, a path being a sequence of edges that share the same sentence number. (a) mh mi mk mj (b) ci{j,k}l ml mn mi ck ... cj ml cu cv . Figure 1: (a) Two sequences mi , mj , ml and mi , mk , ml form a pattern ci{j,k}l = mi , {mj , mk }, ml , which allows mj and mk to be attributed to the same equivalence class, following the principle of complementary distributions [1]. Both the length of the shared context and the cohesiveness of the equivalence class need to be taken into account in estimating the goodness of the candidate pattern (see eq. 1). (b) Patterns can serve as constituents in their own right; recursively abstracting patterns from a corpus allows us to capture the syntactic regularities concisely, yet expressively. Abstraction also supports generalization: in this schematic illustration, two new paths (dashed lines) emerge from the formation of equivalence classes associated with cu and cv . In the second phase, the PA algorithm repeatedly scans the RDS graph for Signiﬁcant P atterns (sequences of constituents) ( SP), which are then used to modify the graph (Algorithm 1). For each path pi , the algorithm constructs a list of candidate constituents, ci1 , . . . , cik . Each of these consists of a “preﬁx” (sequence of graph edges), an equivalence class of vertices, and a “sufﬁx” (another sequence of edges; cf. Figure 2(b)). The criterion I for judging pattern signiﬁcance combines a syntagmatic consideration (the pattern must be long enough) with a paradigmatic one (its constituents c1 , . . . , ck must have high mutual information): I (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) = 2 e−(L/k) P (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) log P (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) Πk P (cj ) j=1 (1) where L is the typical context length and k is the length of the candidate pattern; the probabilities associated with a cj are estimated from frequencies that are immediately available 1 We remark that the algorithm can work in any language, with any set of tokens, including individual characters – or phonemes, if applied to speech. Algorithm 1 PA (pattern acquisition), phase 2 1: while patterns exist do 2: for all path ∈ graph do {path=sentence; graph=corpus} 3: for all source node ∈ path do 4: for all sink node ∈ path do {source and sink can be equivalence classes} 5: degree of separation = path index(sink) − path index(source); 6: pattern table ⇐ detect patterns(source, sink, degree of separation, equivalence table); 7: end for 8: end for 9: winner ⇐ get most signiﬁcant pattern(pattern table); 10: equivalence table ⇐ detect equivalences(graph, winner); 11: graph ⇐ rewire graph(graph, winner); 12: end for 13: end while in the graph (e.g., the out-degree of a node is related to the marginal probability of the corresponding cj ). Equation 1 balances two opposing “forces” in pattern formation: (1) the length of the pattern, and (2) the number and the cohesiveness of the set of examples that support it. On the one hand, shorter patterns are likely to be supported by more examples; on the other hand, they are also more likely to lead to over-generalization, because shorter patterns mean less context. A pattern tagged as signiﬁcant is added as a new vertex to the RDS graph, replacing the constituents and edges it subsumes (Figure 2). Note that only those edges of the multigraph that belong to the detected pattern are rewired; edges that belong to sequences not subsumed by the pattern are untouched. This highly context-sensitive approach to pattern abstraction, which is unique to our model, allows ADIOS to achieve a high degree of representational parsimony without sacriﬁcing generalization power. During the pass over the corpus the list of equivalence sets is updated continuously; the identiﬁcation of new signiﬁcant patterns is done using thecurrent equivalence sets (Figure 3(d)). Thus, as the algorithm processes more and more text, it “bootstraps” itself and enriches the RDS graph structure with new SPs and their accompanying equivalence sets. The recursive nature of this process enables the algorithm to form more and more complex patterns, in a hierarchical manner. The relationships among these can be visualized recursively in a tree format, with tree depth corresponding to the level of recursion (e.g., Figure 3(c)). The PA algorithm halts if it processes a given amount of text without ﬁnding a new SP or equivalence set (in real-life language acquisition this process may never stop). Generalization. A collection of patterns distilled from a corpus can be seen as an empirical grammar of sorts; cf. [6], p.63: “the grammar of a language is simply an inventory of linguistic units.” The patterns can eventually become highly abstract, thus endowing the model with an ability to generalize to unseen inputs. Generalization is possible, for example, when two equivalence classes are placed next to each other in a pattern, creating new paths among the members of the equivalence classes (dashed lines in Figure 1(b)). Generalization can also ensue from partial activation of existing patterns by novel inputs. This function is supported by the input module, designed to process a novel sentence by forming its distributed representation in terms of activities of existing patterns (Figure 6). These are computed by propagating activation from bottom (the terminals) to top (the patterns) of the RDS. The initial activities wj of the terminals cj are calculated given the novel input s1 , . . . , sk as follows: wj = max {I(sk , cj )} m=1..k (2) 102: do you see the cat? 101: the cat is eating 103: are you sure?

(c) The abstracted pattern, and the equivalence class associated with it (edges that belong to sequences not subsumed by this pattern, e.g., #131, are untouched). (d) The identiﬁcation of new signiﬁcant patterns is done using the acquired equivalence classes (e.g., #230). In this manner, the system “bootstraps” itself, recursively distilling more and more complex patterns. where I(sk , cj ) is the mutual information between sk and cj . For an equivalence class, the value propagated upwards is the strongest non-zero activation of its members; for a pattern, it is the average weight of the children nodes, on the condition that all the children were activated by adjacent inputs. Activity propagation continues until it reaches the top nodes of the pattern lattice. When the algorithm encounters a novel word, all the members of the terminal equivalence class contribute a value of , which is then propagated upwards as usual. This enables the model to make an educated guess as to the meaning of the unfamiliar word, by considering the patterns that become active (Figure 6(b)). 3 Results We now brieﬂy describe the results of several studies designed to evaluate the viability of the ADIOS model, in which it was exposed to corpora of varying size and complexity.

<p>Author: Willem H. Zuidema</p><p>Abstract: Language acquisition is a special kind of learning problem because the outcome of learning of one generation is the input for the next. That makes it possible for languages to adapt to the particularities of the learner. In this paper, I show that this type of language change has important consequences for models of the evolution and acquisition of syntax. 1 The Language Acquisition Problem For both artificial systems and non-human animals, learning the syntax of natural languages is a notoriously hard problem. All healthy human infants, in contrast, learn any of the approximately 6000 human languages rapidly, accurately and spontaneously. Any explanation of how they accomplish this difficult task must specify the (innate) inductive bias that human infants bring to bear, and the input data that is available to them.

Figure 1: (a) Two sequences mi , mj , ml and mi , mk , ml form a pattern ci{j,k}l = mi , {mj , mk }, ml , which allows mj and mk to be attributed to the same equivalence class, following the principle of complementary distributions [1]. Both the length of the shared context and the cohesiveness of the equivalence class need to be taken into account in estimating the goodness of the candidate pattern (see eq. 1). (b) Patterns can serve as constituents in their own right; recursively abstracting patterns from a corpus allows us to capture the syntactic regularities concisely, yet expressively. Abstraction also supports generalization: in this schematic illustration, two new paths (dashed lines) emerge from the formation of equivalence classes associated with cu and cv . In the second phase, the PA algorithm repeatedly scans the RDS graph for Signiﬁcant P atterns (sequences of constituents) ( SP), which are then used to modify the graph (Algorithm 1). For each path pi , the algorithm constructs a list of candidate constituents, ci1 , . . . , cik . Each of these consists of a “preﬁx” (sequence of graph edges), an equivalence class of vertices, and a “sufﬁx” (another sequence of edges; cf. Figure 2(b)). The criterion I for judging pattern signiﬁcance combines a syntagmatic consideration (the pattern must be long enough) with a paradigmatic one (its constituents c1 , . . . , ck must have high mutual information): I (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) = 2 e−(L/k) P (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) log P (c1 , c2 , . . . , ck ) Πk P (cj ) j=1 (1) where L is the typical context length and k is the length of the candidate pattern; the probabilities associated with a cj are estimated from frequencies that are immediately available 1 We remark that the algorithm can work in any language, with any set of tokens, including individual characters – or phonemes, if applied to speech. Algorithm 1 PA (pattern acquisition), phase 2 1: while patterns exist do 2: for all path ∈ graph do {path=sentence; graph=corpus} 3: for all source node ∈ path do 4: for all sink node ∈ path do {source and sink can be equivalence classes} 5: degree of separation = path index(sink) − path index(source); 6: pattern table ⇐ detect patterns(source, sink, degree of separation, equivalence table); 7: end for 8: end for 9: winner ⇐ get most signiﬁcant pattern(pattern table); 10: equivalence table ⇐ detect equivalences(graph, winner); 11: graph ⇐ rewire graph(graph, winner); 12: end for 13: end while in the graph (e.g., the out-degree of a node is related to the marginal probability of the corresponding cj ). Equation 1 balances two opposing “forces” in pattern formation: (1) the length of the pattern, and (2) the number and the cohesiveness of the set of examples that support it. On the one hand, shorter patterns are likely to be supported by more examples; on the other hand, they are also more likely to lead to over-generalization, because shorter patterns mean less context. A pattern tagged as signiﬁcant is added as a new vertex to the RDS graph, replacing the constituents and edges it subsumes (Figure 2). Note that only those edges of the multigraph that belong to the detected pattern are rewired; edges that belong to sequences not subsumed by the pattern are untouched. This highly context-sensitive approach to pattern abstraction, which is unique to our model, allows ADIOS to achieve a high degree of representational parsimony without sacriﬁcing generalization power. During the pass over the corpus the list of equivalence sets is updated continuously; the identiﬁcation of new signiﬁcant patterns is done using thecurrent equivalence sets (Figure 3(d)). Thus, as the algorithm processes more and more text, it “bootstraps” itself and enriches the RDS graph structure with new SPs and their accompanying equivalence sets. The recursive nature of this process enables the algorithm to form more and more complex patterns, in a hierarchical manner. The relationships among these can be visualized recursively in a tree format, with tree depth corresponding to the level of recursion (e.g., Figure 3(c)). The PA algorithm halts if it processes a given amount of text without ﬁnding a new SP or equivalence set (in real-life language acquisition this process may never stop). Generalization. A collection of patterns distilled from a corpus can be seen as an empirical grammar of sorts; cf. [6], p.63: “the grammar of a language is simply an inventory of linguistic units.” The patterns can eventually become highly abstract, thus endowing the model with an ability to generalize to unseen inputs. Generalization is possible, for example, when two equivalence classes are placed next to each other in a pattern, creating new paths among the members of the equivalence classes (dashed lines in Figure 1(b)). Generalization can also ensue from partial activation of existing patterns by novel inputs. This function is supported by the input module, designed to process a novel sentence by forming its distributed representation in terms of activities of existing patterns (Figure 6). These are computed by propagating activation from bottom (the terminals) to top (the patterns) of the RDS. The initial activities wj of the terminals cj are calculated given the novel input s1 , . . . , sk as follows: wj = max {I(sk , cj )} m=1..k (2) 102: do you see the cat? 101: the cat is eating 103: are you sure?

(d) The identiﬁcation of new signiﬁcant patterns is done using the acquired equivalence classes (e.g., #230). In this manner, the system “bootstraps” itself, recursively distilling more and more complex patterns. where I(sk , cj ) is the mutual information between sk and cj . For an equivalence class, the value propagated upwards is the strongest non-zero activation of its members; for a pattern, it is the average weight of the children nodes, on the condition that all the children were activated by adjacent inputs. Activity propagation continues until it reaches the top nodes of the pattern lattice. When the algorithm encounters a novel word, all the members of the terminal equivalence class contribute a value of , which is then propagated upwards as usual. This enables the model to make an educated guess as to the meaning of the unfamiliar word, by considering the patterns that become active (Figure 6(b)). 3 Results We now brieﬂy describe the results of several studies designed to evaluate the viability of the ADIOS model, in which it was exposed to corpora of varying size and complexity.

<p>Author: Willem H. Zuidema</p><p>Abstract: Language acquisition is a special kind of learning problem because the outcome of learning of one generation is the input for the next. That makes it possible for languages to adapt to the particularities of the learner. In this paper, I show that this type of language change has important consequences for models of the evolution and acquisition of syntax. 1 The Language Acquisition Problem For both artificial systems and non-human animals, learning the syntax of natural languages is a notoriously hard problem. All healthy human infants, in contrast, learn any of the approximately 6000 human languages rapidly, accurately and spontaneously. Any explanation of how they accomplish this difficult task must specify the (innate) inductive bias that human infants bring to bear, and the input data that is available to them. Traditionally, the inductive bias is termed - somewhat unfortunately -</p><p>5 0.54182303 <a title="84-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Kernels_for_String_and_Tree_Matching.html">85 nips-2002-Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Szabolcs Káli, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: A standard view of memory consolidation is that episodes are stored temporarily in the hippocampus, and are transferred to the neocortex through replay. Various recent experimental challenges to the idea of transfer, particularly for human memory, are forcing its re-evaluation. However, although there is independent neurophysiological evidence for replay, short of transfer, there are few theoretical ideas for what it might be doing. We suggest and demonstrate two important computational roles associated with neocortical indices.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.69084942 <a title="84-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Exact_Inference_with_a_Factored_Model_for_Natural_Language_Parsing.html">84 nips-2002-Fast Exact Inference with a Factored Model for Natural Language Parsing</a></p>

Most importantly, unlike other modern parsing models, the factored model admits an extremely effective A* parsing algorithm, which enables efﬁcient, exact inference.</p><p>3 0.60333824 <a title="84-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Optimality_of_Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithms_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">159 nips-2002-Optimality of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Schoknecht</p><p>Abstract: There are several reinforcement learning algorithms that yield approximate solutions for the problem of policy evaluation when the value function is represented with a linear function approximator. In this paper we show that each of the solutions is optimal with respect to a specific objective function. Moreover, we characterise the different solutions as images of the optimal exact value function under different projection operations. The results presented here will be useful for comparing the algorithms in terms of the error they achieve relative to the error of the optimal approximate solution. 1</p><p>4 0.57133788 <a title="84-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Densities_from_Maximum_Contrast_Estimation.html">68 nips-2002-Discriminative Densities from Maximum Contrast Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Meinicke, Thorsten Twellmann, Helge Ritter</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for classiﬁer design based on discriminative densities for representation of the differences of the class-conditional distributions in a way that is optimal for classiﬁcation. The densities are selected from a parametrized set by constrained maximization of some objective function which measures the average (bounded) difference, i.e. the contrast between discriminative densities. We show that maximization of the contrast is equivalent to minimization of an approximation of the Bayes risk. Therefore using suitable classes of probability density functions, the resulting maximum contrast classiﬁers (MCCs) can approximate the Bayes rule for the general multiclass case. In particular for a certain parametrization of the density functions we obtain MCCs which have the same functional form as the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We show that MCC-training in general requires some nonlinear optimization but under certain conditions the problem is concave and can be tackled by a single linear program. We indicate the close relation between SVM- and MCC-training and in particular we show that Linear Programming Machines can be viewed as an approximate realization of MCCs. In the experiments on benchmark data sets, the MCC shows a competitive classiﬁcation performance.</p><p>5 0.49768919 <a title="84-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Convergent_Combinations_of_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">61 nips-2002-Convergent Combinations of Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Schoknecht, Artur Merke</p><p>Abstract: Convergence for iterative reinforcement learning algorithms like TD(O) depends on the sampling strategy for the transitions. However, in practical applications it is convenient to take transition data from arbitrary sources without losing convergence. In this paper we investigate the problem of repeated synchronous updates based on a fixed set of transitions. Our main theorem yields sufficient conditions of convergence for combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms and linear function approximation. This allows to analyse if a certain reinforcement learning algorithm and a certain function approximator are compatible. For the combination of the residual gradient algorithm with grid-based linear interpolation we show that there exists a universal constant learning rate such that the iteration converges independently of the concrete transition data. 1</p><p>6 0.44285613 <a title="84-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Adapting_Codes_and_Embeddings_for_Polychotomies.html">19 nips-2002-Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies</a></p>

<p>Author: Ralf Schoknecht</p><p>Abstract: There are several reinforcement learning algorithms that yield approximate solutions for the problem of policy evaluation when the value function is represented with a linear function approximator. In this paper we show that each of the solutions is optimal with respect to a specific objective function. Moreover, we characterise the different solutions as images of the optimal exact value function under different projection operations. The results presented here will be useful for comparing the algorithms in terms of the error they achieve relative to the error of the optimal approximate solution. 1</p><p>3 0.28452584 <a title="199-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Convergent_Combinations_of_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">61 nips-2002-Convergent Combinations of Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Schoknecht, Artur Merke</p><p>Abstract: Convergence for iterative reinforcement learning algorithms like TD(O) depends on the sampling strategy for the transitions. However, in practical applications it is convenient to take transition data from arbitrary sources without losing convergence. In this paper we investigate the problem of repeated synchronous updates based on a fixed set of transitions. Our main theorem yields sufficient conditions of convergence for combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms and linear function approximation. This allows to analyse if a certain reinforcement learning algorithm and a certain function approximator are compatible. For the combination of the residual gradient algorithm with grid-based linear interpolation we show that there exists a universal constant learning rate such that the iteration converges independently of the concrete transition data. 1</p><p>4 0.22162755 <a title="199-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Dopamine_Induced_Bistability_Enhances_Signal_Processing_in_Spiny_Neurons.html">71 nips-2002-Dopamine Induced Bistability Enhances Signal Processing in Spiny Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron J. Gruber, Sara A. Solla, James C. Houk</p><p>Abstract: Single unit activity in the striatum of awake monkeys shows a marked dependence on the expected reward that a behavior will elicit. We present a computational model of spiny neurons, the principal neurons of the striatum, to assess the hypothesis that direct neuromodulatory effects of dopamine through the activation of D 1 receptors mediate the reward dependency of spiny neuron activity. Dopamine release results in the amplification of key ion currents, leading to the emergence of bistability, which not only modulates the peak firing rate but also introduces a temporal and state dependence of the model's response, thus improving the detectability of temporally correlated inputs. 1</p><p>5 0.17845987 <a title="199-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Reconstructing_Stimulus-Driven_Neural_Networks_from_Spike_Times.html">171 nips-2002-Reconstructing Stimulus-Driven Neural Networks from Spike Times</a></p>
<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>6 0.15600699 <a title="199-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Note_on_the_Representational_Incompatibility_of_Function_Approximation_and_Factored_Dynamics.html">13 nips-2002-A Note on the Representational Incompatibility of Function Approximation and Factored Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Inference and adaptation in noisy and changing, rich sensory environments are rife with a variety of speciﬁc sorts of variability. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that these different forms of variability play different behavioral, neural and computational roles, and may be reported by different (notably neuromodulatory) systems. Here, we reﬁne our previous theory of acetylcholine’s role in cortical inference in the (oxymoronic) terms of expected uncertainty, and advocate a theory for norepinephrine in terms of unexpected uncertainty. We suggest that norepinephrine reports the radical divergence of bottom-up inputs from prevailing top-down interpretations, to inﬂuence inference and plasticity. We illustrate this proposal using an adaptive factor analysis model.</p><p>6 0.4092086 <a title="199-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Value-Directed_Compression_of_POMDPs.html">205 nips-2002-Value-Directed Compression of POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Yoram Singer, Rony Paz, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Inner-product operators, often referred to as kernels in statistical learning, deﬁne a mapping from some input space into a feature space. The focus of this paper is the construction of biologically-motivated kernels for cortical activities. The kernels we derive, termed Spikernels, map spike count sequences into an abstract vector space in which we can perform various prediction tasks. We discuss in detail the derivation of Spikernels and describe an efﬁcient algorithm for computing their value on any two sequences of neural population spike counts. We demonstrate the merits of our modeling approach using the Spikernel and various standard kernels for the task of predicting hand movement velocities from cortical recordings. In all of our experiments all the kernels we tested outperform the standard scalar product used in regression with the Spikernel consistently achieving the best performance. 1</p><p>4 0.72029638 <a title="199-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Unsupervised_Color_Constancy.html">202 nips-2002-Unsupervised Color Constancy</a></p>

Miller</p><p>Abstract: In [1] we introduced a linear statistical model of joint color changes in images due to variation in lighting and certain non-geometric camera parameters. We did this by measuring the mappings of colors in one image of a scene to colors in another image of the same scene under different lighting conditions. Here we increase the ﬂexibility of this color ﬂow model by allowing ﬂow coefﬁcients to vary according to a low order polynomial over the image. This allows us to better ﬁt smoothly varying lighting conditions as well as curved surfaces without endowing our model with too much capacity. We show results on image matching and shadow removal and detection.</p><p>5 0.68909037 <a title="199-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Reconstructing_Stimulus-Driven_Neural_Networks_from_Spike_Times.html">171 nips-2002-Reconstructing Stimulus-Driven Neural Networks from Spike Times</a></p>
<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>6 0.6800766 <a title="199-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Morton-Style_Factorial_Coding_of_Color_in_Primary_Visual_Cortex.html">148 nips-2002-Morton-Style Factorial Coding of Color in Primary Visual Cortex</a></p>

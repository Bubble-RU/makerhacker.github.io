<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Side-chain prediction is an important subtask in the protein-folding problem. We show that finding a minimal energy side-chain configuration is equivalent to performing inference in an undirected graphical model. The graphical model is relatively sparse yet has many cycles. We used this equivalence to assess the performance of approximate inference algorithms in a real-world setting. Specifically we compared belief propagation (BP), generalized BP (GBP) and naive mean field (MF). In cases where exact inference was possible, max-product BP always found the global minimum of the energy (except in few cases where it failed to converge), while other approximation algorithms of similar complexity did not. In the full protein data set, maxproduct BP always found a lower energy configuration than the other algorithms, including a widely used protein-folding software (SCWRL). 1</p><p>3 0.063040547 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Application_of_Variational_Bayesian_Approach_to_Speech_Recognition.html">31 nips-2002-Application of Variational Bayesian Approach to Speech Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Shinji Watanabe, Yasuhiro Minami, Atsushi Nakamura, Naonori Ueda</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework, which constructs shared-state triphone HMMs based on a variational Bayesian approach, and recognizes speech based on the Bayesian prediction classiﬁcation; variational Bayesian estimation and clustering for speech recognition (VBEC). An appropriate model structure with high recognition performance can be found within a VBEC framework. Unlike conventional methods, including BIC or MDL criterion based on the maximum likelihood approach, the proposed model selection is valid in principle, even when there are insufﬁcient amounts of data, because it does not use an asymptotic assumption. In isolated word recognition experiments, we show the advantage of VBEC over conventional methods, especially when dealing with small amounts of data.</p><p>4 0.057475001 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Location_Estimation_with_a_Differential_Update_Network.html">137 nips-2002-Location Estimation with a Differential Update Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of hidden variables with an a-priori Markov structure, we derive an online algorithm which approximately updates the posterior as pairwise measurements between the hidden variables become available. The update is performed using Assumed Density Filtering: to incorporate each pairwise measurement, we compute the optimal Markov structure which represents the true posterior and use it as a prior for incorporating the next measurement. We demonstrate the resulting algorithm by calculating globally consistent trajectories of a robot as it navigates along a 2D trajectory. To update a trajectory of length t, the update takes O(t). When all conditional distributions are linear-Gaussian, the algorithm can be thought of as a Kalman Filter which simpliﬁes the state covariance matrix after incorporating each measurement.</p><p>5 0.054155041 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-The_Decision_List_Machine.html">194 nips-2002-The Decision List Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwokleung Chan, Te-Won Lee, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: Missing data is common in real-world datasets and is a problem for many estimation techniques. We have developed a variational Bayesian method to perform Independent Component Analysis (ICA) on high-dimensional data containing missing entries. Missing data are handled naturally in the Bayesian framework by integrating the generative density model. Modeling the distributions of the independent sources with mixture of Gaussians allows sources to be estimated with different kurtosis and skewness. The variational Bayesian method automatically determines the dimensionality of the data and yields an accurate density model for the observed data without overﬁtting problems. This allows direct probability estimation of missing values in the high dimensional space and avoids dimension reduction preprocessing which is not feasible with missing data.</p><p>3 0.37284073 <a title="54-lsi-3" href="./nips-2002-Application_of_Variational_Bayesian_Approach_to_Speech_Recognition.html">31 nips-2002-Application of Variational Bayesian Approach to Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: David Fass, Jacob Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We present an account of human concept learning-that is, learning of categories from examples-based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL). In support of this theory, we tested a wide range of two-dimensional concept types, including both regular (simple) and highly irregular (complex) structures, and found the MDL theory to give a good account of subjects' performance. This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description -length) systematically influences its leamability. 1- The Structure of Categories A number of different principles have been advanced to explain the manner in which humans learn to categorize objects. It has been variously suggested that the underlying principle might be the similarity structure of objects [1], the manipulability of decision bound~ aries [2], or Bayesian inference [3][4]. While many of these theories are mathematically well-grounded and have been successful in explaining a range of experimental findings, they have commonly only been tested on a narrow collection of concept types similar to the simple unimodal categories of Figure 1(a-e). (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 1: Categories similar to those previously studied. Lines represent contours of equal probability. All except (e) are unimodal. ~http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~jacob/feldman.html Moreover, in the scarce research that has ventured to look beyond simple category types, the goal has largely been to investigate categorization performance for isolated irregular distributions, rather than to present a survey of performance across a range of interesting distributions.

<p>Author: Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We extend recent work on the connection between loopy belief propagation and the Bethe free energy. Constrained minimization of the Bethe free energy can be turned into an unconstrained saddle-point problem. Both converging double-loop algorithms and standard loopy belief propagation can be interpreted as attempts to solve this saddle-point problem. Stability analysis then leads us to conclude that stable ﬁxed points of loopy belief propagation must be (local) minima of the Bethe free energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the converse need not be the case: minima can be unstable ﬁxed points. We illustrate this with an example and discuss implications. 1</p><p>5 0.01885685 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_with_Multiple_Labels.html">135 nips-2002-Learning with Multiple Labels</a></p>
<p>Author: Rong Jin, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically. We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label. In contrast, naIve methods degrade rapidly as more ambiguity is introduced into the labels. 1</p><p>6 0.018432997 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Binary_Tuning_is_Optimal_for_Neural_Rate_Coding_with_High_Temporal_Resolution.html">44 nips-2002-Binary Tuning is Optimal for Neural Rate Coding with High Temporal Resolution</a></p>

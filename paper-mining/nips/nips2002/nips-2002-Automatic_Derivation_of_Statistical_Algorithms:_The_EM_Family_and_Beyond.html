Gray</p><p>Abstract: Machine learning has reached a point where many probabilistic methods can be understood as variations, extensions and combinations of a much smaller set of abstract themes, e.g., as different instances of the EM algorithm. This enables the systematic derivation of algorithms customized for different models. Here, we describe the AUTO BAYES system which takes a high-level statistical model speciﬁcation, uses powerful symbolic techniques based on schema-based program synthesis and computer algebra to derive an efﬁcient specialized algorithm for learning that model, and generates executable code implementing that algorithm. This capability is far beyond that of code collections such as Matlab toolboxes or even tools for model-independent optimization such as BUGS for Gibbs sampling: complex new algorithms can be generated without new programming, algorithms can be highly specialized and tightly crafted for the exact structure of the model and data, and efﬁcient and commented code can be generated for different languages or systems. We present automatically-derived algorithms ranging from closed-form solutions of Bayesian textbook problems to recently-proposed EM algorithms for clustering, regression, and a multinomial form of PCA. 1 Automatic Derivation of Statistical Algorithms Overview. We describe a symbolic program synthesis system which works as a “statistical algorithm compiler:” it compiles a statistical model speciﬁcation into a custom algorithm design and from that further down into a working program implementing the algorithm design. This system, AUTO BAYES, can be loosely thought of as “part theorem prover, part Mathematica, part learning textbook, and part Numerical Recipes.” It provides much more ﬂexibility than a ﬁxed code repository such as a Matlab toolbox, and allows the creation of efﬁcient algorithms which have never before been implemented, or even written down. AUTO BAYES is intended to automate the more routine application of complex methods in novel contexts. For example, recent multinomial extensions to PCA [2, 4] can be derived in this way. The algorithm design problem. Given a dataset and a task, creating a learning method can be characterized by two main questions: 1. What is the model? 2. What algorithm will optimize the model parameters? The statistical algorithm (i.e., a parameter optimization algorithm for the statistical model) can then be implemented manually. The system in this paper answers the algorithm question given that the user has chosen a model for the data,and continues through to implementation. Performing this task at the state-of-the-art level requires an intertwined meld of probability theory, computational mathematics, and software engineering. However, a number of factors unite to allow us to solve the algorithm design problem computationally: 1. The existence of fundamental building blocks (e.g., standardized probability distributions, standard optimization procedures, and generic data structures). 2. The existence of common representations (i.e., graphical models [3, 13] and program schemas). 3. The formalization of schema applicability constraints as guards. 1 The challenges of algorithm design. The design problem has an inherently combinatorial nature, since subparts of a function may be optimized recursively and in different ways. It also involves the use of new data structures or approximations to gain performance. As the research in statistical algorithms advances, its creative focus should move beyond the ultimately mechanical aspects and towards extending the abstract applicability of already existing schemas (algorithmic principles like EM), improving schemas in ways that generalize across anything they can be applied to, and inventing radically new schemas. 2 Combining Schema-based Synthesis and Bayesian Networks Statistical Models. Externally, AUTO BAYES has the look and feel of 2 const int n_points as ’nr. of data points’ a compiler. Users specify their model 3 with 0 < n_points; 4 const int n_classes := 3 as ’nr. classes’ of interest in a high-level speciﬁcation 5 with 0 < n_classes language (as opposed to a program6 with n_classes << n_points; ming language). The ﬁgure shows the 7 double phi(1..n_classes) as ’weights’ speciﬁcation of the mixture of Gaus8 with 1 = sum(I := 1..n_classes, phi(I)); 9 double mu(1..n_classes); sians example used throughout this 9 double sigma(1..n_classes); paper.2 Note the constraint that the 10 int c(1..n_points) as ’class labels’; sum of the class probabilities must 11 c ˜ disc(vec(I := 1..n_classes, phi(I))); equal one (line 8) along with others 12 data double x(1..n_points) as ’data’; (lines 3 and 5) that make optimization 13 x(I) ˜ gauss(mu(c(I)), sigma(c(I))); of the model well-deﬁned. Also note 14 max pr(x| phi,mu,sigma ) wrt phi,mu,sigma ; the ability to specify assumptions of the kind in line 6, which may be used by some algorithms. The last line speciﬁes the goal inference task: maximize the conditional probability pr with respect to the parameters , , and . Note that moving the parameters across to the left of the conditioning bar converts this from a maximum likelihood to a maximum a posteriori problem. 1 model mog as ’Mixture of Gaussians’; ¡   £  £  £ §¤¢ £ © ¨ ¦ ¥ ©   ¡     ¡ £ £ £ ¨ Computational logic and theorem proving. Internally, AUTO BAYES uses a class of techniques known as computational logic which has its roots in automated theorem proving. AUTO BAYES begins with an initial goal and a set of initial assertions, or axioms, and adds new assertions, or theorems, by repeated application of the axioms, until the goal is proven. In our context, the goal is given by the input model; the derived algorithms are side effects of constructive theorems proving the existence of algorithms for the goal. 1 Schema guards vary widely; for example, compare Nead-Melder simplex or simulated annealing (which require only function evaluation), conjugate gradient (which require both Jacobian and Hessian), EM and its variational extension [6] (which require a latent-variable structure model). 2 Here, keywords have been underlined and line numbers have been added for reference in the text. The as-keyword allows annotations to variables which end up in the generated code’s comments. Also, n classes has been set to three (line 4), while n points is left unspeciﬁed. The class variable and single data variable are vectors, which deﬁnes them as i.i.d. Computer algebra. The ﬁrst core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can mechanize the required symbol manipulation, using computer algebra methods. General symbolic differentiation and expression simpliﬁcation are capabilities fundamental to our approach. AUTO BAYES contains a computer algebra engine using term rewrite rules which are an efﬁcient mechanism for substitution of equal quantities or expressions and thus well-suited for this task.3 Schema-based synthesis. The computational cost of full-blown theorem proving grinds simple tasks to a halt while elementary and intermediate facts are reinvented from scratch. To achieve the scale of deduction required by algorithm derivation, we thus follow a schema-based synthesis technique which breaks away from strict theorem proving. Instead, we formalize high-level domain knowledge, such as the general EM strategy, as schemas. A schema combines a generic code fragment with explicitly speciﬁed preconditions which describe the applicability of the code fragment. The second core element which makes automatic algorithm derivation feasible is the fact that we can use Bayesian networks to efﬁciently encode the preconditions of complex algorithms such as EM. First-order logic representation of Bayesian netNclasses works. A ﬁrst-order logic representation of Bayesian µ σ networks was developed by Haddawy [7]. In this framework, random variables are represented by functor symbols and indexes (i.e., speciﬁc instances φ x c of i.i.d. vectors) are represented as functor arguments. discrete gauss Nclasses Since unknown index values can be represented by Npoints implicitly universally quantiﬁed Prolog variables, this approach allows a compact encoding of networks involving i.i.d. variables or plates [3]; the ﬁgure shows the initial network for our running example. Moreover, such networks correspond to backtrack-free datalog programs, allowing the dependencies to be efﬁciently computed. We have extended the framework to work with non-ground probability queries since we seek to determine probabilities over entire i.i.d. vectors and matrices. Tests for independence on these indexed Bayesian networks are easily developed in Lauritzen’s framework which uses ancestral sets and set separation [9] and is more amenable to a theorem prover than the double negatives of the more widely known d-separation criteria. Given a Bayesian network, some probabilities can easily be extracted by enumerating the component probabilities at each node: § ¥ ¨¦¡ ¡ ¢© Lemma 1.

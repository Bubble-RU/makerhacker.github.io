<p>Author: Christopher G. Atkeson, Jun Morimoto</p><p>Abstract: A longstanding goal of reinforcement learning is to develop nonparametric representations of policies and value functions that support rapid learning without suffering from interference or the curse of dimensionality. We have developed a trajectory-based approach, in which policies and value functions are represented nonparametrically along trajectories. These trajectories, policies, and value functions are updated as the value function becomes more accurate or as a model of the task is updated. We have applied this approach to periodic tasks such as hopping and walking, which required handling discount factors and discontinuities in the task dynamics, and using function approximation to represent value functions at discontinuities. We also describe extensions of the approach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.</p><p>3 0.12961005 <a title="144-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Attractor_Landscapes_for_Learning_Motor_Primitives.html">123 nips-2002-Learning Attractor Landscapes for Learning Motor Primitives</a></p>
<p>Author: Auke J. Ijspeert, Jun Nakanishi, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: Many control problems take place in continuous state-action spaces, e.g., as in manipulator robotics, where the control objective is often deﬁned as ﬁnding a desired trajectory that reaches a particular goal state. While reinforcement learning oﬀers a theoretical framework to learn such control policies from scratch, its applicability to higher dimensional continuous state-action spaces remains rather limited to date. Instead of learning from scratch, in this paper we suggest to learn a desired complex control policy by transforming an existing simple canonical control policy. For this purpose, we represent canonical policies in terms of diﬀerential equations with well-deﬁned attractor properties. By nonlinearly transforming the canonical attractor dynamics using techniques from nonparametric regression, almost arbitrary new nonlinear policies can be generated without losing the stability properties of the canonical system. We demonstrate our techniques in the context of learning a set of movement skills for a humanoid robot from demonstrations of a human teacher. Policies are acquired rapidly, and, due to the properties of well formulated diﬀerential equations, can be re-used and modiﬁed on-line under dynamic changes of the environment. The linear parameterization of nonparametric regression moreover lends itself to recognize and classify previously learned movement skills. Evaluations in simulations and on an actual 30 degree-offreedom humanoid robot exemplify the feasibility and robustness of our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.11720476 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: We develop a systems theoretical treatment of a behavioural system that interacts with its environment in a closed loop situation such that its motor actions inﬂuence its sensor inputs. The simplest form of a feedback is a reﬂex. Reﬂexes occur always “too late”; i.e., only after a (unpleasant, painful, dangerous) reﬂex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This deﬁnes an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary reﬂex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algorithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feedforward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.</p><p>5 0.1014189 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.0995401 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Speeding_up_the_Parti-Game_Algorithm.html">185 nips-2002-Speeding up the Parti-Game Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Given is a problem sequence and a probability distribution (the bias) on programs computing solution candidates. We present an optimally fast way of incrementally solving each task in the sequence. Bias shifts are computed by program preﬁxes that modify the distribution on their sufﬁxes by reusing successful code for previous tasks (stored in non-modiﬁable memory). No tested program gets more runtime than its probability times the total search time. In illustrative experiments, ours becomes the ﬁrst general system to learn a universal solver for arbitrary disk Towers of Hanoi tasks (minimal solution size ). It demonstrates the advantages of incremental learning by proﬁting from previously solved, simpler tasks involving samples of a simple context free language.   ¦ ¤ ¢ §¥£¡ 1 Brief Introduction to Optimal Universal Search Consider an asymptotically optimal method for tasks with quickly veriﬁable solutions: ¦ ¦  ©  £ £¨ © © ©  © ¦ ¦ ¦   Method 1.1 (L SEARCH ) View the -th binary string as a potential program for a universal Turing machine.

We also describe extensions of the approach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.</p><p>4 0.29216158 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>5 0.28656426 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Adaptation_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">18 nips-2002-Adaptation and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Maneesh Sahani, Gregoire Deback</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation is a ubiquitous neural and psychological phenomenon, with a wealth of instantiations and implications. Although a basic form of plasticity, it has, bar some notable exceptions, attracted computational theory of only one main variety. In this paper, we study adaptation from the perspective of factor analysis, a paradigmatic technique of unsupervised learning. We use factor analysis to re-interpret a standard view of adaptation, and apply our new model to some recent data on adaptation in the domain of face discrimination.</p><p>6 0.27682549 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Prototype_for_Automatic_Recognition_of_Spontaneous_Facial_Actions.html">16 nips-2002-A Prototype for Automatic Recognition of Spontaneous Facial Actions</a></p>

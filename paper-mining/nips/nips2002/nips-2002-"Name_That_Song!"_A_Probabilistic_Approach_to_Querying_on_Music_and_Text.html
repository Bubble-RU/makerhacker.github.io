<p>Author: Gil-jin Jang, Te-Won Lee</p><p>Abstract: We present a new technique for achieving source separation when given only a single channel recording. The main idea is based on exploiting the inherent time structure of sound sources by learning a priori sets of basis ﬁlters in time domain that encode the sources in a statistically efﬁcient manner. We derive a learning algorithm using a maximum likelihood approach given the observed single channel data and sets of basis ﬁlters. For each time point we infer the source signals and their contribution factors. This inference is possible due to the prior knowledge of the basis ﬁlters and the associated coefﬁcient densities. A ﬂexible model for density estimation allows accurate modeling of the observation and our experimental results exhibit a high level of separation performance for mixtures of two music signals as well as the separation of two voice signals.</p><p>4 0.18750699 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Maximum_Entropy_Approach_to_Collaborative_Filtering_in_Dynamic%2C_Sparse%2C_High-Dimensional_Domains.html">8 nips-2002-A Maximum Entropy Approach to Collaborative Filtering in Dynamic, Sparse, High-Dimensional Domains</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Y. Pavlov, David M. Pennock</p><p>Abstract: We develop a maximum entropy (maxent) approach to generating recommendations in the context of a user’s current navigation stream, suitable for environments where data is sparse, high-dimensional, and dynamic— conditions typical of many recommendation applications. We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by ﬁrst clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probability that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recommending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity ﬁts naturally into a maxent framework. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popular online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algorithms in ofﬂine tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.</p><p>5 0.18226308 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Inferring_a_Semantic_Representation_of_Text_via_Cross-Language_Correlation_Analysis.html">112 nips-2002-Inferring a Semantic Representation of Text via Cross-Language Correlation Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexei Vinokourov, Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short English document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the ﬁrst and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are completely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reﬂect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a speciﬁc meaning should correlate with certain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we ﬁrst demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are signiﬁcantly higher than random, and hence that a representation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should reﬂect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and signiﬁcantly superior to LSI on the same data.</p><p>6 0.15747978 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Low rank approximation techniques are widespread in pattern recognition research — they include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic LSA, Principal Components Analysus (PCA), the Generative Aspect Model, and many forms of bibliometric analysis. All make use of a low-dimensional manifold onto which data are projected. Such techniques are generally “unsupervised,” which allows them to model data in the absence of labels or categories. With many practical problems, however, some prior knowledge is available in the form of context. In this paper, I describe a principled approach to incorporating such information, and demonstrate its application to PCA-based approximations of several data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.5213483 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Extracting_Relevant_Structures_with_Side_Information.html">83 nips-2002-Extracting Relevant Structures with Side Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Hanna Pasula, Bhaskara Marthi, Brian Milch, Stuart Russell, Ilya Shpitser</p><p>Abstract: Identity uncertainty is a pervasive problem in real-world data analysis. It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identiﬁers or when those identiﬁers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two observations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching—the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to deﬁne a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with speciﬁc methods for generating efﬁcient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers. 1 INTRODUCTION Citation matching is the problem currently handled by systems such as Citeseer [1]. 1 Such systems process a large number of scientiﬁc publications to extract their citation lists. By grouping together all co-referring citations (and, if possible, linking to the actual cited paper), the system constructs a database of “paper” entities linked by the “cites(p 1 , p2 )” relation. This is an example of the general problem of determining the existence of a set of objects, and their properties and relations, given a collection of “raw” perceptual data; this problem is faced by intelligence analysts and intelligent agents as well as by citation systems. A key aspect of this problem is determining when two observations describe the same object; only then can evidence be combined to develop a more complete description of the object. Objects seldom carry unique identiﬁers around with them, so identity uncertainty is ubiquitous. For example, Figure 1 shows two citations that probably refer to the same paper, despite many superﬁcial differences. Citations appear in many formats and are rife with errors of all kinds. As a result, Citeseer—which is speciﬁcally designed to overcome such problems—currently lists more than 100 distinct AI textbooks published by Russell 1 See citeseer.nj.nec.com. Citeseer is now known as ResearchIndex.

Record linkage [2] is a method for matching up the records in two ﬁles, as might be required when merging two databases. For each pair of records, a comparison vector is computed that encodes the ways in which the records do and do not match up. EM is used to learn a naive-Bayes distribution over this vector for both matched and unmatched record pairs, so that the pairwise match probability can then be calculated using Bayes’ rule. Linkage decisions are typically made in a greedy fashion based on closest match and/or a probability threshold, so the overall process is order-dependent and may be inconsistent. The model does not provide for a principled way to combine matched records. A richer probability model is developed by Cohen et al [3], who model the database as a combination of some “original” records that are correct and some number of erroneous versions. They give an efﬁcient greedy algorithm for ﬁnding a single locally optimal assignment of records into groups. Data association [4] is the problem of assigning new observations to existing trajectories when multiple objects are being tracked; it also arises in robot mapping when deciding if an observed landmark is the same as one previously mapped. While early data association systems used greedy methods similar to record linkage, recent systems have tried to ﬁnd high-probability global solutions [5] or to approximate the true posterior over assignments [6]. The latter method has also been applied to the problem of stereo correspondence, in which a computer vision system must determine how to match up features observed in two or more cameras [7]. Data association systems usually have simple observation models (e.g., Gaussian noise) and assume that observations at each time step are all distinct. More general patterns of identity occur in natural language text, where the problem of anaphora resolution involves determining whether phrases (especially pronouns) co-refer; some recent work [8] has used an early form of relational probability model, although with a somewhat counterintuitive semantics. Citeseer is the best-known example of work on citation matching [1]. The system groups citations using a form of greedy agglomerative clustering based on a text similarity metric (see Section 6). McCallum et al [9] use a similar technique, but also develop clustering algorithms designed to work well with large numbers of small clusters (see Section 5). With the exception of [8], all of the preceding systems have used domain-speciﬁc algorithms and data structures; the probabilistic approaches are based on a ﬁxed probability model. In previous work [10], we have suggested a declarative approach to identity uncertainty using a formal language—an extension of relational probability models [11]. Here, we describe the ﬁrst substantial application of the approach. Section 2 explains how to specify a generative probability model of the domain. The key technical point (Section 3) is that the possible worlds include not only objects and relations but also mappings from terms in the language to objects in the domain, and the probability model must include a prior over such mappings. Once the extended model has been deﬁned, Section 4 details the probability distributions used. A general-purpose inference method is applied to the model. We have found Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to be effective for this and other applications (see Section 5); here, we include a method for generating effective proposals based on ideas from [9]. The system also incorporates an EM algorithm for learning the local probability models, such as the model of how author names are abbreviated, reordered, and misspelt in citations. Section 6 evaluates the performance of four datasets originally used to test the Citeseer algorithms [1]. As well as providing signiﬁcantly better performance, our system is able to reason simultaneously about papers, authors, titles, and publication types, and does a good job of extracting this information from the grouped citations. For example, an author’s name can be identiﬁed more accurately by combining information from multiple citations of several different papers. The errors made by our system point to some interesting unmodeled aspects of the citation process. 2 RPMs Reasoning about identity requires reasoning about objects, which requires at least some of the expressive power of a ﬁrst-order logical language. Our approach builds on relational probability models (RPMs) [11], which let us specify probability models over possible worlds deﬁned by objects, properties, classes, and relations. 2.1 Basic RPMs At its most basic, an RPM, as deﬁned by Koller et al [12], consists of • A set C of classes denoting sets of objects, related by subclass/superclass relations. • A set I of named instances denoting objects, each an instance of one class. • A set A of complex attributes denoting functional relations. Each complex attribute A has a domain type Dom[A] ∈ C and a range type Range[A] ∈ C. • A set B of simple attributes denoting functions. Each simple attribute B has a domain type Dom[B] ∈ C and a range V al[B]. • A set of conditional probability models P (B|P a[B]) for the simple attributes. P a[B] is the set of B’s parents, each of which is a nonempty chain of (appropriately typed) attributes σ = A1 . · · · .An .B , where B is a simple attribute. Probability models may be attached to instances or inherited from classes. The parent links should be such that no cyclic dependencies are formed. • A set of instance statements, which set the value of a complex attribute to an instance of the appropriate class. We also use a slight variant of an additional concept from [11]: number uncertainty, which allows for multi-valued complex attributes of uncertain cardinality. We deﬁne each such attribute A as a relation rather than a function, and we associate with it a simple attribute #[A] (i.e., the number of values of A) with a domain type Dom[A] and a range {0, 1, . . . , max #[A]}. 2.2 RPMs for citations Figure 2 outlines an RPM for the example citations of Figure 1. There are four classes, the self-explanatory Author, Paper, and Citation, as well as AuthorAsCited, which represents not actual authors, but author names as they appear when cited. Each citation we wish to match leads to the creation of a Citation instance; instances of the remaining three classes are then added as needed to ﬁll all the complex attributes. E.g., for the ﬁrst citation of Figure 1, we would create a Citation instance C1 , set its text attribute to the string “Metral M. ...August 1994.”, and set its paper attribute to a newly created Paper instance, which we will call P1 . We would then introduce max(#[author]) (here only 3, for simplicity) AuthorAsCited instances (D11 , D12 , and D13 ) to ﬁll the P1 .obsAuthors (i.e., observed authors) attribute, and an equal number of Author instances (A 11 , A12 , and A13 ) to ﬁll both the P1 .authors[i] and the D1i .author attributes. (The complex attributes would be set using instance statements, which would then also constrain the cited authors to be equal to the authors of the actual paper. 2 ) Assuming (for now) that the value of C1 .parse 2 Thus, uncertainty over whether the authors are ordered correctly can be modeled using probabilistic instance statements. A11 Author A12 surname #(fnames) fnames A13 A21 D11 AuthorAsCited surname #(fnames) fnames author A22 A23 D12 D13 D21 D22 Paper D23 Citation #(authors) authors title publication type P1 P2 #(obsAuthors) obsAuthors obsTitle parse C1 C2 text paper Figure 2: An RPM for our Citeseer example. The large rectangles represent classes: the dark arrows indicate the ranges of their complex attributes, and the light arrows lay out all the probabilistic dependencies of their basic attributes. The small rectangles represent instances, linked to their classes with thick grey arrows. We omit the instance statements which set many of the complex attributes. is observed, we can set the values of all the basic attributes of the Citation and AuthorAsCited instances. (E.g., given the correct parse, D11 .surname would be set to Lashkari, and D12 .fnames would be set to (Max)). The remaining basic attributes — those of the Paper and Author instances — represent the “true” attributes of those objects, and their values are unobserved. The standard semantics of RPMs includes the unique names assumption, which precludes identity uncertainty. Under this assumption, any two papers are assumed to be different unless we know for a fact that they are the same. In other words, although there are many ways in which the terms of the language can map to the objects in a possible world, only one of these identity mappings is legal: the one with the fewest co-referring terms. It is then possible to express the RPM as an equivalent Bayesian network: each of the basic attributes of each of the objects becomes a node, with the appropriate parents and probability model. RPM inference usually involves the construction of such a network. The Bayesian network equivalent to our RPM is shown in Figure 3. 3 IDENTITY UNCERTAINTY In our application, any two citations may or may not refer to the same paper. Thus, for citations C1 and C2 , there is uncertainty as to whether the corresponding papers P 1 and P2 are in fact the same object. If they are the same, they will share one set of basic attributes; A11. surname D12. #(fnames) D12. surname A11. fnames D11. #(fnames) D12. fnames A21. #(fnames) A13. surname A12. fnames A21. fnames A13. fnames A13. #(fnames) D13. surname D11. fnames D11. surname D13. #(fnames) C1. #(authors) P1. title C1. text P1. pubtype C1. obsTitle A21. surname A23. surname A22. fnames D22. #(fnames) D12. surname D21. #(fnames) D22. fnames A23. fnames A23. #(fnames) D23. surname D21. fnames D13. fnames C1. parse A22. #(fnames) A22. surname A12. #(fnames) A12. surname A11. #(fnames) D23. fnames D21. surname D23. #(fnames) C2. #(authors) P2. title C2. parse C2. text C2. obsTitle P2. pubtype Figure 3: The Bayesian network equivalent to our RPM, assuming C 1 = C2 . if they are distinct, there will be two sets. Thus, the possible worlds of our probability model may differ in the number of random variables, and there will be no single equivalent Bayesian network. The approach we have taken to this problem [10] is to extend the representation of a possible world so that it includes not only the basic attributes of a set of objects, but also the number of objects n and an identity clustering ι, that is, a mapping from terms in the language (such as P1 ) to objects in the world. We are interested only in whether terms co-refer or not, so ι can be represented by a set of equivalence classes of terms. For example, if P1 and P2 are the only terms, and they co-refer, then ι is {{P1 , P2 }}; if they do not co-refer, then ι is {{P1 }, {P2 }}. We deﬁne a probability model for the space of extended possible worlds by specifying the prior P (n) and the conditional distribution P (ι|n). As in standard RPMs, we assume that the class of every instance is known. Hence, we can simplify these distributions further by factoring them by class, so that, e.g., P (ι) = C∈C P (ιC ). We then distinguish two cases: • For some classes (such as the citations themselves), the unique names assumptions remains appropriate. Thus, we deﬁne P (ιCitation ) to assign a probability of 1.0 to the one assignment where each citation object is unique. • For classes such as Paper and Author, whose elements are subject to identity uncertainty, we specify P (n) using a high-variance log-normal distribution. 3 Then we make appropriate uniformity assumptions to construct P (ιC ). Speciﬁcally, we assume that each paper is a priori equally likely to be cited, and that each author is a priori equally likely to write a paper. Here, “a priori” means prior to obtaining any information about the object in question, so the uniformity assumption is entirely reasonable. With these assumptions, the probability of an assignment ι C,k,m that maps k named instances to m distinct objects, when C contains n objects, is given by 1 n! P (ιC,k,m ) = (n − m)! nk When n > m, the world contains objects unreferenced by any of the terms. However, these ﬁller objects are obviously irrelevant (if they affected the attributes of some named term, they would have been named as functions of that term.) Therefore, we never have to create them, or worry about their attribute values. Our model assumes that the cardinalities and identity clusterings of the classes are independent of each other, as well as of the attribute values. We could remove these assumptions. For one, it would be straightforward to specify a class-wise dependency model for n or ι using standard Bayesian network semantics, where the network nodes correspond to the cardinality attributes of the classes. E.g., it would be reasonable to let the total number of papers depend on the total number of authors. Similarly, we could allow ι to depend on the attribute values—e.g., the frequency of citations to a given paper might depend on the fame of the authors—provided we did not introduce cyclic dependencies. 4 The Probability Model We will now ﬁll in the details of the conditional probability models. Our priors over the “true” attributes are constructed off-line, using the following resources: the 1990 Census data on US names, a large A.I. BibTeX bibliography, and a hand-parsed collection of 500 citations. We learn several bigram models (actually, linear combinations of a bigram model and a unigram model): letter-based models of ﬁrst names, surnames, and title words, as well as higher-level models of various parts of the citation string. More speciﬁcally, the values of Author.fnames and Author.surname are modeled as having a a 0.9 chance of being 3 Other models are possible; for example, in situations where objects appear and disappear, P (ι) can be modeled implicitly by specifying the arrival, transition, and departure rates [6]. drawn from the relevant US census ﬁle, and a 0.1 chance of being generated using a bigram model learned from that ﬁle. The prior over Paper.titles is deﬁned using a two-tier bigram model constructed using the bibliography, while the distributions over Author.#(fnames), Paper.#(authors), and Paper.pubType 4 are derived from our hand-parsed ﬁle. The conditional distributions of the “observed” variables given their true values (i.e., the corruption models of Citation.obsTitle, AuthorAsCited.surname, and AuthorAsCited.fnames) are modeled as noisy channels where each letter, or word, has a small probability of being deleted, or, alternatively, changed, and there is also a small probability of insertion. AuthorAsCited.fnames may also be abbreviated as an initial. The parameters of the corruption models are learnt online, using stochastic EM. Let us now return to Citation.parse, which cannot be an observed variable, since citation parsing, or even citation subﬁeld extraction, is an unsolved problem. It is therefore fortunate that our approach lets us handle uncertainty over parses so naturally. The state space of Citation.parse has two different components. First of all, it keeps track of the citation style, deﬁned as the ordering of the author and title subﬁelds, as well as the format in which the author names are written. The prior over styles is learned using our hand-segmented ﬁle. Secondly, it keeps track of the segmentation of Citation.text, which is divided into an author segment, a title segment, and three ﬁller segments (one before, one after, and one in between.) We assume a uniform distribution over segmentations. Citation.parse greatly constrains Citation.text: the title segment of Citation.text must match the value of Citation.obsTitle, while its author segment must match the combined values of the simple attributes of Citation.obsAuthors. The distributions over the remaining three segments of Citation.text are deﬁned using bigram models, with the model used for the ﬁnal segment chosen depending on the publication type. These models were, once more, learned using our pre-segmented ﬁle. 5 INFERENCE With the introduction of identity uncertainty, our model grows from a single Bayesian network to a collection of networks, one for each possible value of ι. This collection can be rather large, since the number of ways in which a set can be partitioned grows very quickly with the size of the set. 5 Exact inference is, therefore, impractical. We use an approximate method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. 5.1 MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO MCMC [13] is a well-known method for approximating an expectation over some distribution π(x), commonly used when the state space of x is too large to sum over. The weighted sum over the values of x is replaced by a sum over samples from π(x), which are generated using a Markov chain constructed to have π(x) as a stationary distribution. There are several ways of building up an appropriate Markov chain. In the Metropolis– Hastings method (M-H), transitions in the chain are constructed in two steps. First, a candidate next state x is generated from the current state x, using the (more or less arbitrary) proposal distribution q(x |x). The probability that the move to x is actually made is the acceptance probability, deﬁned as α(x |x) = min 1, π(x )q(x|x ) . π(x)q(x |x) Such a Markov chain will have the right stationary distribution π(x) as long as q is deﬁned in such a way that the chain is ergodic. It is even possible to factor q into separate proposals for various subsets of variables. In those situations, the variables that are not changed by the transition cancel in the ratio π(x )/π(x), so the required calculation can be quite simple. 4 Publication types range over {article, conference paper, book, thesis, and tech report} This sequence is described by the Bell numbers, whose asymptotic behaviour is more than exponential. 5 5.2 THE CITATION-MATCHING ALGORITHM The state space of our MCMC algorithm is the space of all the possible worlds, where each possible world contains an identity clustering ι, a set of class cardinalities n, and the values of all the basic attributes of all the objects. Since the ι is given in each world, the distribution over the attributes can be represented using a Bayesian network as described in Section 3. Therefore, the probability of a state is simply the product pf P (n), P (ι), and the probability of the hidden attributes of the network. Our algorithm uses a factored q function. One of our proposals attempts to change n using a simple random walk. The other suggests, ﬁrst, a change to ι, and then, values for all the hidden attributes of all the objects (or clusters in ι) affected by that change. The algorithm for proposing a change in ιC works as follows: Select two clusters a1 , a2 ∈ ιC 6 Create two empty clusters b1 and b2 place each instance i ∈ a1 ∪ a2 u.a.r. into b1 or b2 Propose ιC = ιC − {a1, a2} ∪ {b1, b2} Given a proposed ιC , suggesting values for the hidden attributes boils down to recovering their true values from (possibly) corrupt observations, e.g., guessing the true surname of the author currently known both as “Simth” and “Smith”. Since our title and name noise models are symmetric, our basic strategy is to apply these noise models to one of the observed values. In the case of surnames, we have the additional resource of a dictionary of common names, so, some of the time, we instead pick one of the set of dictionary entries that are within a few corruptions of our observed names. (One must, of course, careful to account for this hybrid approach in our acceptance probability calculations.) Parses are handled differently: we preprocess each citation, organizing its plausible segmentations into a list ordered in terms of descending probability. At runtime, we simply sample from these discrete distributions. Since we assume that boundaries occur only at punctuation marks, and discard segmentations of probability < 10−6 , the lists are usually quite short. 7 The publication type variables, meanwhile, are not sampled at all. Since their range is so small, we sum them out. 5.3 SCALING UP One of the acknowledged ﬂaws of the MCMC algorithm is that it often fails to scale. In this application, as the number of papers increases, the simplest approach — one where the two clusters a1 and a2 are picked u.a.r — is likely to lead to many rejected proposals, as most pairs of clusters will have little in common. The resulting Markov chain will mix slowly. Clearly, we would prefer to focus our proposals on those pairs of clusters which are actually likely to exchange their instances. We have implemented an approach based on the efﬁcient clustering algorithm of McCallum et al [9], where a cheap distance metric is used to preprocess a large dataset and fragment it into many canopies, or smaller, overlapping sets of elements that have a non-zero probability of matching. We do the same, using word-matching as our metric, and setting the thresholds to 0.5 and 0.2. Then, at runtime, our q(x |x) function proposes ﬁrst a canopy c, and then a pair of clusters u.a.r. from c. (q(x|x ) is calculated by summing over all the canopies which contain any of the elements of the two clusters.) 6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have applied the MCMC-based algorithm to the hand-matched datasets used in [1]. (Each of these datasets contains several hundred citations of machine learning papers, about half of them in clusters ranging in size from two to twenty-one citations.) We have also 6 7 Note that if the same cluster is picked twice, it will probably be split. It would also be possible to sample directly from a model such as a hierarchical HMM Face Reinforcement Reasoning Constraint 349 citations, 242 papers 406 citations, 148 papers 514 citations, 296 papers 295 citations, 199 papers Phrase matching 94% 79% 86% 89% RPM + MCMC 97% 94% 96% 93% Table 1: Results on four Citeseer data sets, for the text matching and MCMC algorithms.

(They obtain their “phrases” by segmenting each citation at all punctuation marks, and then taking all the bigrams of all the segments longer than two words.) The results of our comparison are displayed in Figure 1, in terms of the Citeseer error metric. Clearly, the algorithm we have developed easily beats our implementation of phrase matching. We have also applied our algorithm to a large set of citations referring to the textbook Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. It clusters most of them correctly, but there are a couple of notable exceptions. Whenever several citations share the same set of unlikely errors, they are placed together in a separate cluster. This occurs because we do not currently model the fact that erroneous citations are often copied from reference list to reference list, which could be handled by extending the model to include a copiedFrom attribute. Another possible extension would be the addition of a topic attribute to both papers and authors: tracking the authors’ research topics might enable the system to distinguish between similarly-named authors working in different ﬁelds. Generally speaking, we expect that relational probabilistic languages with identity uncertainty will be a useful tool for creating knowledge from raw data.

<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><p>3 0.1157729 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Linear_Combinations_of_Optic_Flow_Vectors_for_Estimating_Self-Motion_-_a_Real-World_Test_of_a_Neural_Model.html">136 nips-2002-Linear Combinations of Optic Flow Vectors for Estimating Self-Motion - a Real-World Test of a Neural Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias O. Franz, Javaan S. Chahl</p><p>Abstract: The tangential neurons in the ﬂy brain are sensitive to the typical optic ﬂow patterns generated during self-motion. In this study, we examine whether a simpliﬁed linear model of these neurons can be used to estimate self-motion from the optic ﬂow. We present a theory for the construction of an estimator consisting of a linear combination of optic ﬂow vectors that incorporates prior knowledge both about the distance distribution of the environment, and about the noise and self-motion statistics of the sensor. The estimator is tested on a gantry carrying an omnidirectional vision sensor. The experiments show that the proposed approach leads to accurate and robust estimates of rotation rates, whereas translation estimates turn out to be less reliable. 1</p><p>4 0.10024882 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Transformation-Invariant_Factor_Analysis.html">87 nips-2002-Fast Transformation-Invariant Factor Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, Nebojsa Jojic, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to discover a linear mapping between high dimensional data samples and points in a lower dimensional subspace. In [6], Jojic and Frey introduced mixture of transformation-invariant component analyzers (MTCA) that can account for global transformations such as translations and rotations, perform clustering and learn local appearance deformations by dimensionality reduction. However, due to enormous computational requirements of the EM algorithm for learning the model, O( ) where is the dimensionality of a data sample, MTCA was not practical for most applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how fast Fourier transforms can reduce the computation to the order of log . With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of MTCA in various applications - tracking, video textures, clustering video sequences, object recognition, and object detection in images. ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤</p><p>5 0.093883753 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Prototype_for_Automatic_Recognition_of_Spontaneous_Facial_Actions.html">16 nips-2002-A Prototype for Automatic Recognition of Spontaneous Facial Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: M.S. Bartlett, G.C. Littlewort, T.J. Sejnowski, J.R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: We present ongoing work on a project for automatic recognition of spontaneous facial actions. Spontaneous facial expressions differ substantially from posed expressions, similar to how continuous, spontaneous speech differs from isolated words produced on command. Previous methods for automatic facial expression recognition assumed images were collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately faced the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. Here we explore an approach based on 3-D warping of images into canonical views. We evaluated the performance of the approach as a front-end for a spontaneous expression recognition system using support vector machines and hidden Markov models. This system employed general purpose learning mechanisms that can be applied to recognition of any facial movement. The system was tested for recognition of a set of facial actions deﬁned by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We showed that 3D tracking and warping followed by machine learning techniques directly applied to the warped images, is a viable and promising technology for automatic facial expression recognition. One exciting aspect of the approach presented here is that information about movement dynamics emerged out of ﬁlters which were derived from the statistics of images.</p><p>6 0.093225211 <a title="172-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Location_Estimation_with_a_Differential_Update_Network.html">137 nips-2002-Location Estimation with a Differential Update Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Chakra Chennubhotla, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: Using a Markov chain perspective of spectral clustering we present an algorithm to automatically ﬁnd the number of stable clusters in a dataset. The Markov chain’s behaviour is characterized by the spectral properties of the matrix of transition probabilities, from which we derive eigenﬂows along with their halﬂives. An eigenﬂow describes the ﬂow of probability mass due to the Markov chain, and it is characterized by its eigenvalue, or equivalently, by the halﬂife of its decay as the Markov chain is iterated. A ideal stable cluster is one with zero eigenﬂow and inﬁnite half-life. The key insight in this paper is that bottlenecks between weakly coupled clusters can be identiﬁed by computing the sensitivity of the eigenﬂow’s halﬂife to variations in the edge weights. We propose a novel E IGEN C UTS algorithm to perform clustering that removes these identiﬁed bottlenecks in an iterative fashion.</p><p>4 0.45061621 <a title="172-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Linear_Combinations_of_Optic_Flow_Vectors_for_Estimating_Self-Motion_-_a_Real-World_Test_of_a_Neural_Model.html">136 nips-2002-Linear Combinations of Optic Flow Vectors for Estimating Self-Motion - a Real-World Test of a Neural Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Richard M. Karp, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: We propose a dynamic Bayesian model for motifs in biopolymer sequences which captures rich biological prior knowledge and positional dependencies in motif structure in a principled way. Our model posits that the position-speciﬁc multinomial parameters for monomer distribution are distributed as a latent Dirichlet-mixture random variable, and the position-speciﬁc Dirichlet component is determined by a hidden Markov process. Model parameters can be ﬁt on training motifs using a variational EM algorithm within an empirical Bayesian framework. Variational inference is also used for detecting hidden motifs. Our model improves over previous models that ignore biological priors and positional dependence. It has much higher sensitivity to motifs during detection and a notable ability to distinguish genuine motifs from false recurring patterns.</p><p>6 0.41527694 <a title="172-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Automatic_Acquisition_and_Efficient_Representation_of_Syntactic_Structures.html">35 nips-2002-Automatic Acquisition and Efficient Representation of Syntactic Structures</a></p>

<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>3 0.44206125 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>

Although a basic form of plasticity, it has, bar some notable exceptions, attracted computational theory of only one main variety.

Jacobs, Melissa Dominguez</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that systems learning aspects of visual perception may beneﬁt from the use of suitably designed developmental progressions during training. Four models were trained to estimate motion velocities in sequences of visual images. Three of the models were “developmental models” in the sense that the nature of their input changed during the course of training. They received a relatively impoverished visual input early in training, and the quality of this input improved as training progressed. One model used a coarse-to-multiscale developmental progression (i.e. it received coarse-scale motion features early in training and ﬁner-scale features were added to its input as training progressed), another model used a ﬁne-to-multiscale progression, and the third model used a random progression. The ﬁnal model was nondevelopmental in the sense that the nature of its input remained the same throughout the training period. The simulation results show that the coarse-to-multiscale model performed best. Hypotheses are offered to account for this model’s superior performance. We conclude that suitably designed developmental sequences can be useful to systems learning to estimate motion velocities. The idea that visual development can aid visual learning is a viable hypothesis in need of further study.</p><p>6 0.44091439 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>

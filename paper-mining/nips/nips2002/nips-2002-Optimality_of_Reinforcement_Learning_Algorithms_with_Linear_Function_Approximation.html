<p>Author: Nathaniel D. Daw, Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: According to a series of inﬂuential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been conﬁned to more abstract psychological models.</p><p>4 0.27294016 <a title="159-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Convergent_Form_of_Approximate_Policy_Iteration.html">3 nips-2002-A Convergent Form of Approximate Policy Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Theodore J.

We prove that if the policy improvement operator produces -soft policies and is Lipschitz continuous in the action values, with a constant that is not too large, then the approximate policy iteration algorithm converges to a unique solution from any initial policy. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst convergence result for any form of approximate policy iteration under similar computational-resource assumptions.</p><p>5 0.15841928 <a title="159-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Nonparametric_Representation_of_Policies_and_Value_Functions%3A_A_Trajectory-Based_Approach.html">155 nips-2002-Nonparametric Representation of Policies and Value Functions: A Trajectory-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher G. Atkeson, Jun Morimoto</p><p>Abstract: A longstanding goal of reinforcement learning is to develop nonparametric representations of policies and value functions that support rapid learning without suffering from interference or the curse of dimensionality. We have developed a trajectory-based approach, in which policies and value functions are represented nonparametrically along trajectories. These trajectories, policies, and value functions are updated as the value function becomes more accurate or as a model of the task is updated. We have applied this approach to periodic tasks such as hopping and walking, which required handling discount factors and discontinuities in the task dynamics, and using function approximation to represent value functions at discontinuities. We also describe extensions of the approach to make the policies more robust to modeling error and sensor noise.</p><p>6 0.14387119 <a title="159-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-The_Stability_of_Kernel_Principal_Components_Analysis_and_its_Relation_to_the_Process_Eigenspectrum.html">197 nips-2002-The Stability of Kernel Principal Components Analysis and its Relation to the Process Eigenspectrum</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy, Daniela D. Farias</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends our earlier analysis on approximate linear programming as an approach to approximating the cost-to-go function in a discounted-cost dynamic program [6]. In this paper, we consider the average-cost criterion and a version of approximate linear programming that generates approximations to the optimal average cost and differential cost function. We demonstrate that a naive version of approximate linear programming prioritizes approximation of the optimal average cost and that this may not be well-aligned with the objective of deriving a policy with low average cost. For that, the algorithm should aim at producing a good approximation of the differential cost function. We propose a twophase variant of approximate linear programming that allows for external control of the relative accuracy of the approximation of the differential cost function over different portions of the state space via state-relevance weights. Performance bounds suggest that the new algorithm is compatible with the objective of optimizing performance and provide guidance on appropriate choices for state-relevance weights.</p><p>6 0.3576172 <a title="159-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-The_Stability_of_Kernel_Principal_Components_Analysis_and_its_Relation_to_the_Process_Eigenspectrum.html">197 nips-2002-The Stability of Kernel Principal Components Analysis and its Relation to the Process Eigenspectrum</a></p>

<p>Author: Szabolcs Káli, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: A standard view of memory consolidation is that episodes are stored temporarily in the hippocampus, and are transferred to the neocortex through replay. Various recent experimental challenges to the idea of transfer, particularly for human memory, are forcing its re-evaluation. However, although there is independent neurophysiological evidence for replay, short of transfer, there are few theoretical ideas for what it might be doing. We suggest and demonstrate two important computational roles associated with neocortical indices.</p><p>2 0.8071422 <a title="159-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Exact_Inference_with_a_Factored_Model_for_Natural_Language_Parsing.html">84 nips-2002-Fast Exact Inference with a Factored Model for Natural Language Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Meinicke, Thorsten Twellmann, Helge Ritter</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for classiﬁer design based on discriminative densities for representation of the differences of the class-conditional distributions in a way that is optimal for classiﬁcation. The densities are selected from a parametrized set by constrained maximization of some objective function which measures the average (bounded) difference, i.e. the contrast between discriminative densities. We show that maximization of the contrast is equivalent to minimization of an approximation of the Bayes risk. Therefore using suitable classes of probability density functions, the resulting maximum contrast classiﬁers (MCCs) can approximate the Bayes rule for the general multiclass case. In particular for a certain parametrization of the density functions we obtain MCCs which have the same functional form as the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We show that MCC-training in general requires some nonlinear optimization but under certain conditions the problem is concave and can be tackled by a single linear program. We indicate the close relation between SVM- and MCC-training and in particular we show that Linear Programming Machines can be viewed as an approximate realization of MCCs. In the experiments on benchmark data sets, the MCC shows a competitive classiﬁcation performance.</p><p>5 0.68447345 <a title="159-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Convergent_Combinations_of_Reinforcement_Learning_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">61 nips-2002-Convergent Combinations of Reinforcement Learning with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>

Our main theorem yields sufficient conditions of convergence for combinations of reinforcement learning algorithms and linear function approximation. This allows to analyse if a certain reinforcement learning algorithm and a certain function approximator are compatible. For the combination of the residual gradient algorithm with grid-based linear interpolation we show that there exists a universal constant learning rate such that the iteration converges independently of the concrete transition data. 1</p><p>6 0.59371942 <a title="159-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Approximate_Linear_Programming_for_Average-Cost_Dynamic_Programming.html">33 nips-2002-Approximate Linear Programming for Average-Cost Dynamic Programming</a></p>

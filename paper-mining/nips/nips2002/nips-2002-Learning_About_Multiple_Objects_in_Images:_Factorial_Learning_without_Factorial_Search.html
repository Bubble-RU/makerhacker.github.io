</p><p>6 1 Introduction In this paper we consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. [sent-18, score-0.25]
</p><p>7 Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. [sent-19, score-0.351]
</p><p>8 Previous approaches (discussed in more detail below) have approached this as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. [sent-20, score-0.784]
</p><p>9 A serious concern with the factorial learning problem is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. [sent-21, score-0.555]
</p><p>10 Suppose there are possible objects, and that there are possible values that the instantiation parameters of any one object can take on; we will need to consider combinations to explain any image. [sent-22, score-0.326]
</p><p>11 In contrast, in our approach we ﬁnd one object at a time, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion. [sent-23, score-0.3]
</p><p>12 One fairly simple unsupervised learning model is clustering, which can be viewed as a mixture model where there are a ﬁnite number of types of object, and data is produced by choosing one of these objects and then generating the data conditional on this choice. [sent-25, score-0.405]
</p><p>13 As a model of objects in images standard clustering approaches are limited as they do not take into account the variability that can arise due to the transformations that can take place, described by instantiation parameters such as translation, rotation etc of the object. [sent-26, score-0.706]
</p><p>14 Suppose that there are different instantiation parameters, then a single object will sweep out a -dimensional manifold in the image space. [sent-27, score-0.426]
</p><p>15 Learning about objects taking this regularity into account has      http://anc. [sent-28, score-0.323]
</p><p>16 However, this work is still limited to ﬁnding a single object in each image. [sent-32, score-0.235]
</p><p>17 The approach of Frey and Jojic (1999, 2002) can be extended to this case by explicitly considering the simultaneous instantiation of all objects (Jojic and Frey, 2001). [sent-34, score-0.414]
</p><p>18 However, this gives rise to a large search problem over the instantiation parameters of all objects simultaneously, and approximations such as variational methods are needed to carry out the inference. [sent-35, score-0.464]
</p><p>19 In our method, by contrast, we discover the objects one at a time using a robust statistical method. [sent-36, score-0.401]
</p><p>20 Sequential object discovery is possible because multiple objects combine by occluding each other. [sent-37, score-0.592]
</p><p>21 However, Frey and Jojic made the important step for image analysis problems of using explicit transformations of object models, which allows the incorporation of prior knowledge about these transformations and leads to good interpretability of the results. [sent-39, score-0.521]
</p><p>22 In section 2 we describe the model, ﬁrst for images containing only a single object ( 2. [sent-44, score-0.424]
</p><p>23 1) and then for images containing multiple objects ( 2. [sent-45, score-0.546]
</p><p>24 In section 3 we present experimental results for up to ﬁve objects appearing against stationary and non-stationary backgrounds. [sent-47, score-0.39]
</p><p>25 1 Learning one object In this section we consider the problem of learning about one object which can appear at various locations in an image. [sent-50, score-0.47]
</p><p>26 The object is in the foreground, with a background behind it. [sent-51, score-0.46]
</p><p>27 This background can either be ﬁxed for all training images, or vary from image to image. [sent-52, score-0.356]
</p><p>28 The two key issues that we must deal with are (i) the notion of a pixel being modelled as foreground or background, and (ii) the problem of transformations of the object. [sent-53, score-0.786]
</p><p>29 Our aim is to learn appearance-based representations of the foreground and the pixels, we will need to specify background . [sent-56, score-0.708]
</p><p>30 As the object will be smaller than which pixels belong to the background and which to the foreground; this is achieved by a vector of binary latent variables , one for each pixel. [sent-57, score-0.606]
</p><p>31 For pixel , if , then the pixel will be ascribed to the background with high probability, and if , it will be ascribed to the foreground with high probability. [sent-59, score-1.05]

</p><p>34 The semantics of foreground and background mean that the mask must also be transformed, so that we obtain     "  "  (2)  ((©    ! [sent-72, score-1.191]

</p><p>36 The model developed in this section is similar to Jojic and Frey (2001), except that our mask has probabilistic semantics, which means that an exact M-step can be used as opposed to the generalized M-step used by Jojic and Frey. [sent-80, score-0.439]
</p><p>37 2 Coping with multiple objects  ¡  ¡  If there are foreground objects, one natural approach is to consider models with latent variables, each taking on the values of the possible transformations. [sent-82, score-0.84]
</p><p>38 By assuming that the objects can arbitrarily occlude one another (and this occlusion ordering can change in different images), there are possible arrangements. [sent-84, score-0.425]
</p><p>39 A model that accounts for multiple objects is described in Jojic and Frey (2001) where the occlusion ordering of the objects is taken as being ﬁxed since they assume that each object is ascribed to a global layer. [sent-85, score-1.088]
</p><p>40 ¡  P Q¡  ¢  P R¡ § ¢  ¡  Our goal is to ﬁnd one object at a time in the images. [sent-88, score-0.235]
</p><p>41 The second method (denoted GREEDY) removes objects found in earlier iterations and looks for as-yet-undiscovered objects in what remains. [sent-91, score-0.686]
</p><p>42 The problem is that occlusion can occur of both the foreground and the background. [sent-94, score-0.531]
</p><p>43 For a foreground pixel, a different object to the one being modelled may be interposed between the camera and our object, thus perturbing the pixel value. [sent-95, score-0.935]
</p><p>44 Such robust models have been used for image matching tasks by a number of authors, notably Black and colleagues (Black and Jepson, 1996). [sent-97, score-0.167]
</p><p>45 Similarly for the background, a different object from the one being modelled may be interposed between the background and the camera, so that we again have a mixture model , with similar semantics for the parameter . [sent-98, score-0.661]
</p><p>46 (If the background has high variability then this robustness may not be required, but it will be in the case that the background is ﬁxed while the objects move. [sent-99, score-0.773]
</p><p>47 1 Finding the ﬁrst object With this robust model we can now apply the RANDOM STARTS algorithm by maximizing the likelihood of a set of images with respect to the model using the EM algorithm. [sent-102, score-0.445]

</p><p>49 Note that the latter responsibilities do not depend on the transformation since the background is not transformed. [sent-118, score-0.378]
</p><p>50 For pixels which are ascribed to the foreground (i. [sent-129, score-0.62]
</p><p>51 ), the values in are transformed by (which is as the transformations are permutation matrices). [sent-131, score-0.169]
</p><p>52 This removes the effect of the transformation and thus allows the foreground pixels found in each training image to be averaged to produce . [sent-132, score-0.808]
</p><p>53 However, this is rather inefﬁcient as the basins of attraction for the different objects may be very different in size given the initialization. [sent-134, score-0.323]
</p><p>54 2 The GREEDY algorithm We assume that we have run the RANDOM STARTS algorithm and have learned a foreground model and mask . [sent-138, score-0.962]
</p><p>55 We wish to remove from consideration the pixels of the learned object (in each training image) in order to ﬁnd a new object by applying the same algorithm. [sent-139, score-0.627]
</p><p>56 For each example image we can use the responsibilities to ﬁnd the obtains values most likely transformation . [sent-140, score-0.253]
</p><p>57 1 Now note that the transformed mask close to 1 for all object pixels, however some of these pixels might be occluded by other not-yet-discovered objects and we do not wish to remove them from consideration. [sent-141, score-1.233]
</p><p>58 According to the semantics of the robust  ¦  " w7 ¢ ¡ © ¨¡ #  ¦ &¤ #  ¡  7  1  w7    ¡  ¥  ©  ©¦  ¦  "   ¦    " w7 ¡  ¦  '¤  w7  ¡    ¦  £  , will roughly give close to values only for the nonforeground responsibilities occluded object pixels. [sent-143, score-0.492]
</p><p>59 Thus, the search for a new object involves only the pixels that are not accounted for by model 1 (i. [sent-147, score-0.354]
</p><p>60 £ % © ¦ ¦¤  % 3    ¤  £ ) ' % © ¦ ¤¤ %©H "  '¤ % © ¦  £  This process can be continued, so that after ﬁnding a second model, the remaining background is searched for a third model, and so on. [sent-150, score-0.225]
</p><p>61 We always deal with only one object at a time and thus with one transformation latent variable. [sent-154, score-0.383]
</p><p>62 This approach can be viewed as approximating the full factorial model by sequentially learning each factor (object). [sent-155, score-0.199]
</p><p>63 1    ¡  Space limitations do not permit us to show the function and updates for the parameters, but these are very similar to the RANDOM STARTS, since we also learn only the parameters of one object plus the background while keeping ﬁxed all the parameters of previously discovered objects.

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>2 0.1809126 <a title="122-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2002-Concurrent_Object_Recognition_and_Segmentation_by_Graph_Partitioning.html">57 nips-2002-Concurrent Object Recognition and Segmentation by Graph Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><p>3 0.15527566 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Monaural_Speech_Separation.html">147 nips-2002-Monaural Speech Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Guoning Hu, Deliang Wang</p><p>Abstract: Monaural speech separation has been studied in previous systems that incorporate auditory scene analysis principles. A major problem for these systems is their inability to deal with speech in the highfrequency range. Psychoacoustic evidence suggests that different perceptual mechanisms are involved in handling resolved and unresolved harmonics. Motivated by this, we propose a model for monaural separation that deals with low-frequency and highfrequency signals differently. For resolved harmonics, our model generates segments based on temporal continuity and cross-channel correlation, and groups them according to periodicity. For unresolved harmonics, the model generates segments based on amplitude modulation (AM) in addition to temporal continuity and groups them according to AM repetition rates derived from sinusoidal modeling. Underlying the separation process is a pitch contour obtained according to psychoacoustic constraints. Our model is systematically evaluated, and it yields substantially better performance than previous systems, especially in the high-frequency range. 1 In t rod u ct i on In a natural environment, speech usually occurs simultaneously with acoustic interference. An effective system for attenuating acoustic interference would greatly facilitate many applications, including automatic speech recognition (ASR) and speaker identification. Blind source separation using independent component analysis [10] or sensor arrays for spatial filtering require multiple sensors. In many situations, such as telecommunication and audio retrieval, a monaural (one microphone) solution is required, in which intrinsic properties of speech or interference must be considered. Various algorithms have been proposed for monaural speech enhancement [14]. These methods assume certain properties of interference and have difficulty in dealing with general acoustic interference. Monaural separation has also been studied using phasebased decomposition [3] and statistical learning [17], but with only limited evaluation. While speech enhancement remains a challenge, the auditory system shows a remarkable capacity for monaural speech separation. According to Bregman [1], the auditory system separates the acoustic signal into streams, corresponding to different sources, based on auditory scene analysis (ASA) principles. Research in ASA has inspired considerable work to build computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) systems for sound separation [19] [4] [7] [18]. Such systems generally approach speech separation in two main stages: segmentation (analysis) and grouping (synthesis). In segmentation, the acoustic input is decomposed into sensory segments, each of which is likely to originate from a single source. In grouping, those segments that likely come from the same source are grouped together, based mostly on periodicity. In a recent CASA model by Wang and Brown [18], segments are formed on the basis of similarity between adjacent filter responses (cross-channel correlation) and temporal continuity, while grouping among segments is performed according to the global pitch extracted within each time frame. In most situations, the model is able to remove intrusions and recover low-frequency (below 1 kHz) energy of target speech. However, this model cannot handle high-frequency (above 1 kHz) signals well, and it loses much of target speech in the high-frequency range. In fact, the inability to deal with speech in the high-frequency range is a common problem for CASA systems. We study monaural speech separation with particular emphasis on the high-frequency problem in CASA. For voiced speech, we note that the auditory system can resolve the first few harmonics in the low-frequency range [16]. It has been suggested that different perceptual mechanisms are used to handle resolved and unresolved harmonics [2]. Consequently, our model employs different methods to segregate resolved and unresolved harmonics of target speech. More specifically, our model generates segments for resolved harmonics based on temporal continuity and cross-channel correlation, and these segments are grouped according to common periodicity. For unresolved harmonics, it is well known that the corresponding filter responses are strongly amplitude-modulated and the response envelopes fluctuate at the fundamental frequency (F0) of target speech [8]. Therefore, our model generates segments for unresolved harmonics based on common AM in addition to temporal continuity. The segments are grouped according to AM repetition rates. We calculate AM repetition rates via sinusoidal modeling, which is guided by target pitch estimated according to characteristics of natural speech. Section 2 describes the overall system. In section 3, systematic results and a comparison with the Wang-Brown system are given. Section 4 concludes the paper. 2 M od el d escri p t i on Our model is a multistage system, as shown in Fig. 1. Description for each stage is given below. 2.1 I n i t i a l p r oc e s s i n g First, an acoustic input is analyzed by a standard cochlear filtering model with a bank of 128 gammatone filters [15] and subsequent hair cell transduction [12]. This peripheral processing is done in time frames of 20 ms long with 10 ms overlap between consecutive frames. As a result, the input signal is decomposed into a group of timefrequency (T-F) units. Each T-F unit contains the response from a certain channel at a certain frame. The envelope of the response is obtained by a lowpass filter with Segregated Speech Mixture Peripheral and Initial Pitch mid-level segregation tracking processing Unit Final Resynthesis labeling segregation Figure 1. Schematic diagram of the proposed multistage system. passband [0, 1 kHz] and a Kaiser window of 18.25 ms. Mid-level processing is performed by computing a correlogram (autocorrelation function) of the individual responses and their envelopes. These autocorrelation functions reveal response periodicities as well as AM repetition rates. The global pitch is obtained from the summary correlogram. For clean speech, the autocorrelations generally have peaks consistent with the pitch and their summation shows a dominant peak corresponding to the pitch period. With acoustic interference, a global pitch may not be an accurate description of the target pitch, but it is reasonably close. Because a harmonic extends for a period of time and its frequency changes smoothly, target speech likely activates contiguous T-F units. This is an instance of the temporal continuity principle. In addition, since the passbands of adjacent channels overlap, a resolved harmonic usually activates adjacent channels, which leads to high crosschannel correlations. Hence, in initial segregation, the model first forms segments by merging T-F units based on temporal continuity and cross-channel correlation. Then the segments are grouped into a foreground stream and a background stream by comparing the periodicities of unit responses with global pitch. A similar process is described in [18]. Fig. 2(a) and Fig. 2(b) illustrate the segments and the foreground stream. The input is a mixture of a voiced utterance and a cocktail party noise (see Sect. 3). Since the intrusion is not strongly structured, most segments correspond to target speech. In addition, most segments are in the low-frequency range. The initial foreground stream successfully groups most of the major segments. 2.2 P i t c h tr a c k i n g In the presence of acoustic interference, the global pitch estimated in mid-level processing is generally not an accurate description of target pitch. To obtain accurate pitch information, target pitch is first estimated from the foreground stream. At each frame, the autocorrelation functions of T-F units in the foreground stream are summated. The pitch period is the lag corresponding to the maximum of the summation in the plausible pitch range: [2 ms, 12.5 ms]. Then we employ the following two constraints to check its reliability. First, an accurate pitch period at a frame should be consistent with the periodicity of the T-F units at this frame in the foreground stream. At frame j, let τ ( j) represent the estimated pitch period, and A(i, j,τ ) the autocorrelation function of uij, the unit in channel i. uij agrees with τ ( j) if A(i , j , τ ( j )) / A(i, j ,τ m ) > θ d (1) (a) (b) Frequency (Hz) 5000 5000 2335 2335 1028 1028 387 387 80 0 0.5 1 Time (Sec) 1.5 80 0 0.5 1 Time (Sec) 1.5 Figure 2. Results of initial segregation for a speech and cocktail-party mixture. (a) Segments formed. Each segment corresponds to a contiguous black region. (b) Foreground stream. Here, θd = 0.95, the same threshold used in [18], and τ m is the lag corresponding to the maximum of A(i, j,τ ) within [2 ms, 12.5 ms]. τ ( j) is considered reliable if more than half of the units in the foreground stream at frame j agree with it. Second, pitch periods in natural speech vary smoothly in time [11]. We stipulate the difference between reliable pitch periods at consecutive frames be smaller than 20% of the pitch period, justified from pitch statistics. Unreliable pitch periods are replaced by new values extrapolated from reliable pitch points using temporal continuity. As an example, suppose at two consecutive frames j and j+1 that τ ( j) is reliable while τ ( j+1) is not. All the channels corresponding to the T-F units agreeing with τ ( j) are selected. τ ( j+1) is then obtained from the summation of the autocorrelations for the units at frame j+1 in those selected channels. Then the re-estimated pitch is further verified with the second constraint. For more details, see [9]. Fig. 3 illustrates the estimated pitch periods from the speech and cocktail-party mixture, which match the pitch periods obtained from clean speech very well. 2.3 U n i t l a be l i n g With estimated pitch periods, (1) provides a criterion to label T-F units according to whether target speech dominates the unit responses or not. This criterion compares an estimated pitch period with the periodicity of the unit response. It is referred as the periodicity criterion. It works well for resolved harmonics, and is used to label the units of the segments generated in initial segregation. However, the periodicity criterion is not suitable for units responding to multiple harmonics because unit responses are amplitude-modulated. As shown in Fig. 4, for a filter response that is strongly amplitude-modulated (Fig. 4(a)), the target pitch corresponds to a local maximum, indicated by the vertical line, in the autocorrelation instead of the global maximum (Fig. 4(b)). Observe that for a filter responding to multiple harmonics of a harmonic source, the response envelope fluctuates at the rate of F0 [8]. Hence, we propose a new criterion for labeling the T-F units corresponding to unresolved harmonics by comparing AM repetition rates with estimated pitch. This criterion is referred as the AM criterion. To obtain an AM repetition rate, the entire response of a gammatone filter is half-wave rectified and then band-pass filtered to remove the DC component and other possible 14 Pitch Period (ms) 12 (a) 10 180 185 190 195 200 Time (ms) 2 4 6 8 Lag (ms) 205 210 8 6 4 0 (b) 0.5 1 Time (Sec) Figure 3.

The vertical line marks the position corresponding to the pitch period of target speech. harmonics except for the F0 component. The rectified and filtered signal is then normalized by its envelope to remove the intensity fluctuations of the original signal, where the envelope is obtained via the Hilbert Transform. Because the pitch of natural speech does not change noticeably within a single frame, we model the corresponding normalized signal within a T-F unit by a single sinusoid to obtain the AM repetition rate. Specifically, f ,φ   f ij , φ ij = arg min M ˆ [r (i, jT − k ) − sin(2π k f / f S + φ )]2 , for f ∈[80 Hz, 500 Hz], (2) k =1 ˆ where a square error measure is used. r (i , t ) is the normalized filter response, fS is the sampling frequency, M spans a frame, and T= 10 ms is the progressing period from one frame to the next. In the above equation, fij gives the AM repetition rate for unit uij. Note that in the discrete case, a single sinusoid with a sufficiently high frequency can always match these samples perfectly. However, we are interested in finding a frequency within the plausible pitch range. Hence, the solution does not reduce to a degenerate case. With appropriately chosen initial values, this optimization problem can be solved effectively using iterative gradient descent (see [9]). The AM criterion is used to label T-F units that do not belong to any segments generated in initial segregation; such segments, as discussed earlier, tend to miss unresolved harmonics. Specifically, unit uij is labeled as target speech if the final square error is less than half of the total energy of the corresponding signal and the AM repetition rate is close to the estimated target pitch: | f ijτ ( j ) − 1 | < θ f . (3) Psychoacoustic evidence suggests that to separate sounds with overlapping spectra requires 6-12% difference in F0 [6]. Accordingly, we choose θf to be 0.12. 2.4 F i n a l s e gr e g a t i on a n d r e s y n t he s i s For adjacent channels responding to unresolved harmonics, although their responses may be quite different, they exhibit similar AM patterns and their response envelopes are highly correlated. Therefore, for T-F units labeled as target speech, segments are generated based on cross-channel envelope correlation in addition to temporal continuity. The spectra of target speech and intrusion often overlap and, as a result, some segments generated in initial segregation contain both units where target speech dominates and those where intrusion dominates. Given unit labels generated in the last stage, we further divide the segments in the foreground stream, SF, so that all the units in a segment have the same label. Then the streams are adjusted as follows. First, since segments for speech usually are at least 50 ms long, segments with the target label are retained in SF only if they are no shorter than 50 ms. Second, segments with the intrusion label are added to the background stream, SB, if they are no shorter than 50 ms. The remaining segments are removed from SF, becoming undecided. Finally, other units are grouped into the two streams by temporal and spectral continuity. First, SB expands iteratively to include undecided segments in its neighborhood. Then, all the remaining undecided segments are added back to SF. For individual units that do not belong to either stream, they are grouped into SF iteratively if the units are labeled as target speech as well as in the neighborhood of SF. The resulting SF is the final segregated stream of target speech. Fig. 5(a) shows the new segments generated in this process for the speech and cocktailparty mixture. Fig. 5(b) illustrates the segregated stream from the same mixture. Fig. 5(c) shows all the units where target speech is stronger than intrusion. The foreground stream generated by our algorithm contains most of the units where target speech is stronger. In addition, only a small number of units where intrusion is stronger are incorrectly grouped into it. A speech waveform is resynthesized from the final foreground stream. Here, the foreground stream works as a binary mask. It is used to retain the acoustic energy from the mixture that corresponds to 1’s and reject the mixture energy corresponding to 0’s. For more details, see [19]. 3 Evalu at i on an d comp ari son Our model is evaluated with a corpus of 100 mixtures composed of 10 voiced utterances mixed with 10 intrusions collected by Cooke [4]. The intrusions have a considerable variety. Specifically, they are: N0 - 1 kHz pure tone, N1 - white noise, N2 - noise bursts, N3 - “cocktail party” noise, N4 - rock music, N5 - siren, N6 - trill telephone, N7 - female speech, N8 - male speech, and N9 - female speech. Given our decomposition of an input signal into T-F units, we suggest the use of an ideal binary mask as the ground truth for target speech. The ideal binary mask is constructed as follows: a T-F unit is assigned one if the target energy in the corresponding unit is greater than the intrusion energy and zero otherwise. Theoretically speaking, an ideal binary mask gives a performance ceiling for all binary masks. Figure 5(c) illustrates the ideal mask for the speech and cocktail-party mixture. Ideal masks also suit well the situations where more than one target need to be segregated or the target changes dynamically. The use of ideal masks is supported by the auditory masking phenomenon: within a critical band, a weaker signal is masked by a stronger one [13]. In addition, an ideal mask gives excellent resynthesis for a variety of sounds and is similar to a prior mask used in a recent ASR study that yields excellent recognition performance [5]. The speech waveform resynthesized from the final foreground stream is used for evaluation, and it is denoted by S(t). The speech waveform resynthesized from the ideal binary mask is denoted by I(t). Furthermore, let e1(t) denote the signal present in I(t) but missing from S(t), and e2(t) the signal present in S(t) but missing from I(t). Then, the relative energy loss, REL, and the relative noise residue, RNR, are calculated as follows:     R EL = e12 (t ) t I 2 (t ) , S 2 (t ) .

SNR results for segregated speech. White bars show the results from the proposed model, gray bars those from the Wang-Brown system, and black bars those of the mixtures. The results from our model are shown in Table 1. Each value represents the average of one intrusion with 10 voiced utterances. A further average across all intrusions is also shown in the table. On average, our system retains 96.60% of target speech energy, and the relative residual noise is kept at 3.32%. As a comparison, Table 1 also shows the results from the Wang-Brown model [18], whose performance is representative of current CASA systems. As shown in the table, our model reduces REL significantly. In addition, REL and RNR are balanced in our system. Finally, to compare waveforms directly we measure a form of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in decibels using the resynthesized signal from the ideal binary mask as ground truth: ( I (t ) − S (t )) 2 ] . I 2 (t )     SNR = 10 log10 [ t (5) t The SNR for each intrusion averaged across 10 target utterances is shown in Fig. 6, together with the results from the Wang-Brown system and the SNR of the original mixtures. Our model achieves an average SNR gain of around 12 dB and 5 dB improvement over the Wang-Brown model. 4 Di scu ssi on The main feature of our model lies in using different mechanisms to deal with resolved and unresolved harmonics. As a result, our model is able to recover target speech and reduce noise interference in the high-frequency range where harmonics of target speech are unresolved. The proposed system considers the pitch contour of the target source only. However, it is possible to track the pitch contour of the intrusion if it has a harmonic structure. With two pitch contours, one could label a T-F unit more accurately by comparing whether its periodicity is more consistent with one or the other. Such a method is expected to lead to better performance for the two-speaker situation, e.g. N7 through N9. As indicated in Fig. 6, the performance gain of our system for such intrusions is relatively limited. Our model is limited to separation of voiced speech. In our view, unvoiced speech poses the biggest challenge for monaural speech separation. Other grouping cues, such as onset, offset, and timbre, have been demonstrated to be effective for human ASA [1], and may play a role in grouping unvoiced speech. In addition, one should consider the acoustic and phonetic characteristics of individual unvoiced consonants. We plan to investigate these issues in future study.

<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the problem of learning a classiﬁcation task for datasets which are described by matrices. Rows and columns of these matrices correspond to objects, where row and column objects may belong to diﬀerent sets, and the entries in the matrix express the relationships between them. We interpret the matrix elements as being produced by an unknown kernel which operates on object pairs and we show that - under mild assumptions - these kernels correspond to dot products in some (unknown) feature space. Minimizing a bound for the generalization error of a linear classiﬁer which has been obtained using covering numbers we derive an objective function for model selection according to the principle of structural risk minimization. The new objective function has the advantage that it allows the analysis of matrices which are not positive deﬁnite, and not even symmetric or square. We then consider the case that row objects are interpreted as features. We suggest an additional constraint, which imposes sparseness on the row objects and show, that the method can then be used for feature selection. Finally, we apply this method to data obtained from DNA microarrays, where “column” objects correspond to samples, “row” objects correspond to genes and matrix elements correspond to expression levels. Benchmarks are conducted using standard one-gene classiﬁcation and support vector machines and K-nearest neighbors after standard feature selection. Our new method extracts a sparse set of genes and provides superior classiﬁcation results. 1</p><p>5 0.14362626 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Transformation-Invariant_Factor_Analysis.html">87 nips-2002-Fast Transformation-Invariant Factor Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, Nebojsa Jojic, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to discover a linear mapping between high dimensional data samples and points in a lower dimensional subspace. In [6], Jojic and Frey introduced mixture of transformation-invariant component analyzers (MTCA) that can account for global transformations such as translations and rotations, perform clustering and learn local appearance deformations by dimensionality reduction. However, due to enormous computational requirements of the EM algorithm for learning the model, O( ) where is the dimensionality of a data sample, MTCA was not practical for most applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how fast Fourier transforms can reduce the computation to the order of log . With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of MTCA in various applications - tracking, video textures, clustering video sequences, object recognition, and object detection in images. ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤</p><p>6 0.12379298 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Classify_Galaxy_Shapes_Using_the_EM_Algorithm.html">131 nips-2002-Learning to Classify Galaxy Shapes Using the EM Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>2 0.68396759 <a title="122-lsi-2" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Classify_Galaxy_Shapes_Using_the_EM_Algorithm.html">131 nips-2002-Learning to Classify Galaxy Shapes Using the EM Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Sergey Kirshner, Igor V. Cadez, Padhraic Smyth, Chandrika Kamath</p><p>Abstract: We describe the application of probabilistic model-based learning to the problem of automatically identifying classes of galaxies, based on both morphological and pixel intensity characteristics. The EM algorithm can be used to learn how to spatially orient a set of galaxies so that they are geometrically aligned. We augment this “ordering-model” with a mixture model on objects, and demonstrate how classes of galaxies can be learned in an unsupervised manner using a two-level EM algorithm. The resulting models provide highly accurate classi£cation of galaxies in cross-validation experiments. 1 Introduction and Background The £eld of astronomy is increasingly data-driven as new observing instruments permit the rapid collection of massive archives of sky image data. In this paper we investigate the problem of identifying bent-double radio galaxies in the FIRST (Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-cm) Survey data set [1]. FIRST produces large numbers of radio images of the deep sky using the Very Large Array at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. It is scheduled to cover more that 10,000 square degrees of the northern and southern caps (skies). Of particular scienti£c interest to astronomers is the identi£cation and cataloging of sky objects with a “bent-double” morphology, indicating clusters of galaxies ([8], see Figure 1). Due to the very large number of observed deep-sky radio sources, (on the order of 106 so far) it is infeasible for the astronomers to label all of them manually. The data from the FIRST Survey (http://sundog.stsci.edu/) is available in both raw image format and in the form of a catalog of features that have been automatically derived from the raw images by an image analysis program [8]. Each entry corresponds to a single detectable “blob” of bright intensity relative to the sky background: these entries are called Figure 1: 4 examples of radio-source galaxy images. The two on the left are labelled as “bent-doubles” and the two on the right are not. The con£gurations on the left have more “bend” and symmetry than the two non-bent-doubles on the right. components. The “blob” of intensities for each component is £tted with an ellipse. The ellipses and intensities for each component are described by a set of estimated features such as sky position of the centers (RA (right ascension) and Dec (declination)), peak density ¤ux and integrated ¤ux, root mean square noise in pixel intensities, lengths of the major and minor axes, and the position angle of the major axis of the ellipse counterclockwise from the north. The goal is to £nd sets of components that are spatially close and that resemble a bent-double. In the results in this paper we focus on candidate sets of components that have been detected by an existing spatial clustering algorithm [3] where each set consists of three components from the catalog (three ellipses). As of the year 2000, the catalog contained over 15,000 three-component con£gurations and over 600,000 con£gurations total. The set which we use to build and evaluate our models consists of a total of 128 examples of bent-double galaxies and 22 examples of non-bent-double con£gurations. A con£guration is labelled as a bent-double if two out of three astronomers agree to label it as such. Note that the visual identi£cation process is the bottleneck in the process since it requires signi£cant time and effort from the scientists, and is subjective and error-prone, motivating the creation of automated methods for identifying bent-doubles. Three-component bent-double con£gurations typically consist of a center or “core” component and two other side components called “lobes”. Previous work on automated classi£cation of three-component candidate sets has focused on the use of decision-tree classi£ers using a variety of geometric and image intensity features [3]. One of the limitations of the decision-tree approach is its relative in¤exibility in handling uncertainty about the object being classi£ed, e.g., the identi£cation of which of the three components should be treated as the core of a candidate object. A bigger limitation is the £xed size of the feature vector. A primary motivation for the development of a probabilistic approach is to provide a framework that can handle uncertainties in a ¤exible coherent manner. 2 Learning to Match Orderings using the EM Algorithm We denote a three-component con£guration by C = (c 1 , c2 , c3 ), where the ci ’s are the components (or “blobs”) described in the previous section. Each component c x is represented as a feature vector, where the speci£c features will be de£ned later. Our approach focuses on building a probabilistic model for bent-doubles: p (C) = p (c1 , c2 , c3 ), the likelihood of the observed ci under a bent-double model where we implicitly condition (for now) on the class “bent-double.” By looking at examples of bent-double galaxies and by talking to the scientists studying them, we have been able to establish a number of potentially useful characteristics of the components, the primary one being geometric symmetry. In bent-doubles, two of the components will look close to being mirror images of one another with respect to a line through the third component. We will call mirror-image components lobe compo- core core 1 lobe 2 2 3 lobe 2 lobe 1 lobe 1 component 2 lobe 1 component 3 lobe 2 lobe 1 4 core lobe 1 5 lobe 2 lobe 2 6 core core component 1 core lobe 2 lobe 1 Figure 2: Possible orderings for a hypothetical bent-double. A good choice of ordering would be either 1 or 2. nents, and the other one the core component. It also appears that non-bent-doubles either don’t exhibit such symmetry, or the angle formed at the core component is too straight— the con£guration is not “bent” enough. Once the core component is identi£ed, we can calculate symmetry-based features. However, identifying the most plausible core component requires either an additional algorithm or human expertise. In our approach we use a probabilistic framework that averages over different possible orderings weighted by their probability given the data. In order to de£ne the features, we £rst need to determine the mapping of the components to labels “core”, “lobe 1”, and “lobe 2” (c, l1 , and l2 for short). We will call such a mapping an ordering. Figure 2 shows an example of possible orderings for a con£guration. We can number the orderings 1, . . . , 6. We can then write 6 p (C) = p (cc , cl1 , cl2 |Ω = k) p (Ω = k) , (1) k=1 i.e., a mixture over all possible orientations. Each ordering is assumed a priori to be equally 1 likely, i.e., p(Ω = k) = 6 . Intuitively, for a con£guration that clearly looks like a bentdouble the terms in the mixture corresponding to the correct ordering would dominate, while the other orderings would have much lower probability. We represent each component cx by M features (we used M = 3). Note that the features can only be calculated conditioned on a particular mapping since they rely on properties of the (assumed) core and lobe components. We denote by fmk (C) the values corresponding to the mth feature for con£guration C under the ordering Ω = k, and by f mkj (C) we denote the feature value of component j: fmk (C) = (fmk1 (C) , . . . , fmkBm (C)) (in our case, Bm = 3 is the number of components). Conditioned on a particular mapping Ω = k, where x ∈ {c, l1 , l2 } and c,l1 ,l2 are de£ned in a cyclical order, our features are de£ned as: • f1k (C) : Log-transformed angle, the angle formed at the center of the component (a vertex of the con£guration) mapped to label x; |center of x to center of next(x)| • f2k (C) : Logarithms of side ratios, center of x to center of prev(x) ; | | peak ¤ux of next(x) • f3k (C) : Logarithms of intensity ratios, peak ¤ux of prev(x) , and so (C|Ω = k) = (f1k (C) , f2k (C) f3k (C)) for a 9-dimensional feature vector in total. Other features are of course also possible. For our purposes in this paper this particular set appears to capture the more obvious visual properties of bent-double galaxies. For a set D = {d1 , . . . , dN } of con£gurations, under an i.i.d. assumption for con£gurations, we can write the likelihood as N K P (D) = P (Ωi = k) P (f1k (di ) , . . . , fM k (di )) , i=1 k=1 where Ωi is the ordering for con£guration d i . While in the general case one can model P (f1k (di ) , . . . , fM k (di )) as a full joint distribution, for the results reported in this paper we make a number of simplifying assumptions, motivated by the fact that we have relatively little labelled training data available for model building. First, we assume that the fmk (di ) are conditionally independent. Second, we are also able to reduce the number of components for each fmk (di ) by noting functional dependencies. For example, given two angles of a triangle, we can uniquely determine the third one. We also assume that the remaining components for each feature are conditionally independent. Under these assumptions the multivariate joint distribution P (f1k (di ) , . . . , fM k (di )) is factored into a product of simple distributions, which (for the purposes of this paper) we model using Gaussians. If we know for every training example which component should be mapped to label c, we can then unambiguously estimate the parameters for each of these distributions. In practice, however, the identity of the core component is unknown for each object. Thus, we use the EM algorithm to automatically estimate the parameters of the above model. We begin by randomly assigning an ordering to each object. For each subsequent iteration the E-step consists of estimating a probability distribution over possible orderings for each object, and the M-step estimates the parameters of the feature-distributions using the probabilistic ordering information from the E-step. In practice we have found that the algorithm converges relatively quickly (in 20 to 30 iterations) on both simulated and real data. It is somewhat surprising that this algorithm can reliably “learn” how to align a set of objects, without using any explicit objective function for alignment, but instead based on the fact that feature values for certain orderings exhibit a certain self-consistency relative to the model. Intuitively it is this self-consistency that leads to higher-likelihood solutions and that allows EM to effectively align the objects by maximizing the likelihood. After the model has been estimated, the likelihood of new objects can also be calculated under the model, where the likelihood now averages over all possible orderings weighted by their probability given the observed features. The problem described above is a speci£c instance of a more general feature unscrambling problem. In our case, we assume that con£gurations of three 3-dimensional components (i.e. 3 features) each are generated by some distribution. Once the objects are generated, the orders of their components are permuted or scrambled. The task is then to simultaneously learn the parameters of the original distributions and the scrambling for each object. In the more general form, each con£guration consists of L M -dimensional con£gurations. Since there are L! possible orderings of L components, the problem becomes computationally intractable if L is large. One solution is to restrict the types of possible scrambles (to cyclic shifts for example). 3 Automatic Galaxy Classi£cation We used the algorithm described in the previous section to estimate the parameters of features and orderings of the bent-double class from labelled training data and then to rank candidate objects according to their likelihood under the model. We used leave-one-out cross-validation to test the classi£cation ability of this supervised model, where for each of the 150 examples we build a model using the positive examples from the set of 149 “other” examples, and then score the “left-out” example with this model. The examples are then sorted in decreasing order by their likelihood score (averaging over different possi- 1 0.9 True positive rate 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 False positive rate Figure 3: ROC plot for a model using angle, ratio of sides, and ratio of intensities, as features, and learned using ordering-EM with labelled data. ble orderings) and the results are analyzed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) methodology. We use AROC , the area under the curve, as a measure of goodness of the model, where a perfect model would have AROC = 1 and random performance corresponds to AROC = 0.5. The supervised model, using EM for learning ordering models, has a cross-validated AROC score of 0.9336 (Figure 3) and appears to be quite useful at detecting bent-double galaxies. 4 Model-Based Galaxy Clustering A useful technique in understanding astronomical image data is to cluster image objects based on their morphological and intensity properties. For example, consider how one might cluster the image objects in Figure 1 into clusters, where we have features on angles, intensities, and so forth. Just as with classi£cation, clustering of the objects is impeded by not knowing which of the “blobs” corresponds to the true “core” component. From a probabilistic viewpoint, clustering can be treated as introducing another level of hidden variables, namely the unknown class (or cluster) identity of each object. We can generalize the EM algorithm for orderings (Section 2) to handle this additional hidden level. The model is now a mixture of clusters where each cluster is modelled as a mixture of orderings. This leads to a more complex two-level EM algorithm than that presented in Section 2, where at the inner-level the algorithm is learning how to orient the objects, and at the outer level the algorithm is learning how to group the objects into C classes. Space does not permit a detailed presentation of this algorithm—however, the derivation is straightforward and produces intuitive update rules such as: µcmj = ˆ 1 ˆ N P (cl = c|Θ) N K P (cli = c|Ωi = k, D, Θ) P (Ωi = k|D, Θ) fmkj (di ) i=1 k=1 where µcmj is the mean for the cth cluster (1 ≤ c ≤ C), the mth feature (1 ≤ m ≤ M ), and the jth component of fmk (di ), and Ωi = k corresponds to ordering k for the ith object. We applied this algorithm to the data set of 150 sky objects, where unlike the results in Section 3, the algorithm now had no access to the class labels. We used the Gaussian conditional-independence model as before, and grouped the data into K = 2 clusters. Figures 4 and 5 show the highest likelihood objects, out of 150 total objects, under the Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Bent−double Figure 4: The 8 objects with the highest likelihood conditioned on the model for the larger of the two clusters learned by the unsupervised algorithm.

The larger cluster is clearly a bent-double cluster: 89 of the 150 objects are more likely to belong to this cluster under the model and 88 out of the 89 objects in this cluster have the bent-double label. In other words, the unsupervised algorithm has discovered a cluster that corresponds to “strong examples” of bent-doubles relative to the particular feature-space and model. In fact the non-bentdouble that is assigned to this group may well have been mislabelled (image not shown here). The objects in Figure 5 are clearly inconsistent with the general visual pattern of bent-doubles and this cluster consists of a mixture of non-bent-double and “weaker” bentdouble galaxies. The objects in Figures 5 that are labelled as bent-doubles seem quite atypical compared to the bent-doubles in Figure 4. A natural hypothesis is that cluster 1 (88 bent-doubles) in the unsupervised model is in fact very similar to the supervised model learned using the labelled set of 128 bent-doubles in Section 3. Indeed the parameters of the two Gaussian models agree quite closely and the similarity of the two models is illustrated clearly in Figure 6 where we plot the likelihoodbased ranks of the unsupervised model versus those of the supervised model. Both models are in close agreement and both are clearly performing well in terms of separating the objects in terms of their class labels. 5 Related Work and Future Directions A related earlier paper is Kirshner et al [6] where we presented a heuristic algorithm for solving the orientation problem for galaxies. The generalization to an EM framework in this paper is new, as is the two-level EM algorithm for clustering objects in an unsupervised manner. There is a substantial body of work in computer vision on solving a variety of different object matching problems using probabilistic techniques—see Mjolsness [7] for early ideas and Chui et al. [2] for a recent application in medical imaging. Our work here differs in a number of respects. One important difference is that we use EM to learn a model for the simultaneous correspondence of N objects, using both geometric and intensity-based features, whereas prior work in vision has primarily focused on matching one object to another (essentially the N = 2 case). An exception is the recent work of Frey and Jojic [4, 5] who used a similar EM-based approach to simultaneously cluster images and estimate a variety of local spatial deformations. The work described in this paper can be viewed as an extension and application of this general methodology to a real-world problem in galaxy classi£cation. Earlier work on bent-double galaxy classi£cation used decision tree classi£ers based on a variety of geometric and intensity-based features [3]. In future work we plan to compare the performance of this decision tree approach with the probabilistic model-based approach proposed in this paper. The model-based approach has some inherent advantages over a decision-tree model for these types of problems. For example, it can directly handle objects in the catalog with only 2 blobs or with 4 or more blobs by integrating over missing intensities and over missing correspondence information using mixture models that allow for missing or extra “blobs”. Being able to classify such con£gurations automatically is of signi£cant interest to the astronomers.

<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><p>4 0.58426279 <a title="122-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-One-Class_LP_Classifiers_for_Dissimilarity_Representations.html">158 nips-2002-One-Class LP Classifiers for Dissimilarity Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Elzbieta Pekalska, David Tax, Robert Duin</p><p>Abstract: Problems in which abnormal or novel situations should be detected can be approached by describing the domain of the class of typical examples. These applications come from the areas of machine diagnostics, fault detection, illness identiﬁcation or, in principle, refer to any problem where little knowledge is available outside the typical class. In this paper we explain why proximities are natural representations for domain descriptors and we propose a simple one-class classiﬁer for dissimilarity representations. By the use of linear programming an efﬁcient one-class description can be found, based on a small number of prototype objects. This classiﬁer can be made (1) more robust by transforming the dissimilarities and (2) cheaper to compute by using a reduced representation set. Finally, a comparison to a comparable one-class classiﬁer by Campbell and Bennett is given.</p><p>5 0.56097901 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Stochastic_Neighbor_Embedding.html">190 nips-2002-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a probabilistic approach to the task of placing objects, described by high-dimensional vectors or by pairwise dissimilarities, in a low-dimensional space in a way that preserves neighbor identities. A Gaussian is centered on each object in the high-dimensional space and the densities under this Gaussian (or the given dissimilarities) are used to deﬁne a probability distribution over all the potential neighbors of the object. The aim of the embedding is to approximate this distribution as well as possible when the same operation is performed on the low-dimensional “images” of the objects. A natural cost function is a sum of Kullback-Leibler divergences, one per object, which leads to a simple gradient for adjusting the positions of the low-dimensional images. Unlike other dimensionality reduction methods, this probabilistic framework makes it easy to represent each object by a mixture of widely separated low-dimensional images. This allows ambiguous objects, like the document count vector for the word “bank”, to have versions close to the images of both “river” and “ﬁnance” without forcing the images of outdoor concepts to be located close to those of corporate concepts.</p><p>6 0.53014791 <a title="122-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Identity_Uncertainty_and_Citation_Matching.html">107 nips-2002-Identity Uncertainty and Citation Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>2 0.69835162 <a title="122-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Temporal_Coherence%2C_Natural_Image_Sequences%2C_and_the_Visual_Cortex.html">193 nips-2002-Temporal Coherence, Natural Image Sequences, and the Visual Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Jarmo Hurri, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We show that two important properties of the primary visual cortex emerge when the principle of temporal coherence is applied to natural image sequences. The properties are simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs, which emerge when we apply two different approaches to temporal coherence. In the ﬁrst approach we extract receptive ﬁelds whose outputs are as temporally coherent as possible. This approach yields simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds (oriented, localized, multiscale). Thus, temporal coherence is an alternative to sparse coding in modeling the emergence of simple cell receptive ﬁelds. The second approach is based on a two-layer statistical generative model of natural image sequences. In addition to modeling the temporal coherence of individual simple cells, this model includes inter-cell temporal dependencies. Estimation of this model from natural data yields both simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds, and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs. In this completely unsupervised learning, both layers of the generative model are estimated simultaneously from scratch. This is a signiﬁcant improvement on earlier statistical models of early vision, where only one layer has been learned, and others have been ﬁxed a priori.</p><p>3 0.65648103 <a title="122-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Parametric_Mixture_Models_for_Multi-Labeled_Text.html">162 nips-2002-Parametric Mixture Models for Multi-Labeled Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Naonori Ueda, Kazumi Saito</p><p>Abstract: We propose probabilistic generative models, called parametric mixture models (PMMs), for multiclass, multi-labeled text categorization problem. Conventionally, the binary classiﬁcation approach has been employed, in which whether or not text belongs to a category is judged by the binary classiﬁer for every category. In contrast, our approach can simultaneously detect multiple categories of text using PMMs. We derive eﬃcient learning and prediction algorithms for PMMs. We also empirically show that our method could signiﬁcantly outperform the conventional binary methods when applied to multi-labeled text categorization using real World Wide Web pages. 1</p><p>4 0.65273142 <a title="122-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Reinforcement_Learning_to_Play_an_Optimal_Nash_Equilibrium_in_Team_Markov_Games.html">175 nips-2002-Reinforcement Learning to Play an Optimal Nash Equilibrium in Team Markov Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaofeng Wang, Tuomas Sandholm</p><p>Abstract: Multiagent learning is a key problem in AI. In the presence of multiple Nash equilibria, even agents with non-conﬂicting interests may not be able to learn an optimal coordination policy. The problem is exaccerbated if the agents do not know the game and independently receive noisy payoffs. So, multiagent reinforfcement learning involves two interrelated problems: identifying the game and learning to play. In this paper, we present optimal adaptive learning, the ﬁrst algorithm that converges to an optimal Nash equilibrium with probability 1 in any team Markov game. We provide a convergence proof, and show that the algorithm’s parameters are easy to set to meet the convergence conditions.</p><p>5 0.6508742 <a title="122-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Detect_Natural_Image_Boundaries_Using_Brightness_and_Texture.html">132 nips-2002-Learning to Detect Natural Image Boundaries Using Brightness and Texture</a></p>
<p>Author: David R. Martin, Charless C. Fowlkes, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: The goal of this work is to accurately detect and localize boundaries in natural scenes using local image measurements. We formulate features that respond to characteristic changes in brightness and texture associated with natural boundaries. In order to combine the information from these features in an optimal way, a classiﬁer is trained using human labeled images as ground truth. We present precision-recall curves showing that the resulting detector outperforms existing approaches.</p><p>6 0.64778483 <a title="122-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Bayesian_Image_Super-Resolution.html">39 nips-2002-Bayesian Image Super-Resolution</a></p>

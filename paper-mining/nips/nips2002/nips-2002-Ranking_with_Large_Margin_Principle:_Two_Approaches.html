<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: A distance-based conditional model on the ranking poset is presented for use in classiﬁcation and ranking. The model is an extension of the Mallows model, and generalizes the classiﬁer combination methods used by several ensemble learning algorithms, including error correcting output codes, discrete AdaBoost, logistic regression and cranking. The algebraic structure of the ranking poset leads to a simple Bayesian interpretation of the conditional model and its special cases. In addition to a unifying view, the framework suggests a probabilistic interpretation for error correcting output codes and an extension beyond the binary coding scheme.</p><p>3 0.1786982 <a title="165-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Adapting_Codes_and_Embeddings_for_Polychotomies.html">19 nips-2002-Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Mika, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider formulations of multi-class problems based on a generalized notion of a margin and using output coding. This includes, but is not restricted to, standard multi-class SVM formulations. Differently from many previous approaches we learn the code as well as the embedding function. We illustrate how this can lead to a formulation that allows for solving a wider range of problems with for instance many classes or even “missing classes”. To keep our optimization problems tractable we propose an algorithm capable of solving them using twoclass classiﬁers, similar in spirit to Boosting.</p><p>4 0.17553368 <a title="165-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Convergent_Form_of_Approximate_Policy_Iteration.html">3 nips-2002-A Convergent Form of Approximate Policy Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Theodore J. Perkins, Doina Precup</p><p>Abstract: We study a new, model-free form of approximate policy iteration which uses Sarsa updates with linear state-action value function approximation for policy evaluation, and a “policy improvement operator” to generate a new policy based on the learned state-action values. We prove that if the policy improvement operator produces -soft policies and is Lipschitz continuous in the action values, with a constant that is not too large, then the approximate policy iteration algorithm converges to a unique solution from any initial policy. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst convergence result for any form of approximate policy iteration under similar computational-resource assumptions.</p><p>5 0.16581194 <a title="165-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_in_Zero-Sum_Team_Markov_Games_Using_Factored_Value_Functions.html">130 nips-2002-Learning in Zero-Sum Team Markov Games Using Factored Value Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Ran Gilad-bachrach, Amir Navot, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: Prototypes based algorithms are commonly used to reduce the computational complexity of Nearest-Neighbour (NN) classiﬁers. In this paper we discuss theoretical and algorithmical aspects of such algorithms. On the theory side, we present margin based generalization bounds that suggest that these kinds of classiﬁers can be more accurate then the 1-NN rule. Furthermore, we derived a training algorithm that selects a good set of prototypes using large margin principles. We also show that the 20 years old Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ) algorithm emerges naturally from our framework. 1</p><p>4 0.54604137 <a title="165-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-PAC-Bayes_%26_Margins.html">161 nips-2002-PAC-Bayes & Margins</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicholas Roy, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Standard value function approaches to ﬁnding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is due to a great extent to their generating an optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real POMDP problems most belief states are unlikely, and there is a structured, low-dimensional manifold of plausible beliefs embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by taking advantage of belief space sparsity. We reduce the dimensionality of the belief space by exponential family Principal Components Analysis [1], which allows us to turn the sparse, highdimensional belief space into a compact, low-dimensional representation in terms of learned features of the belief state. We then plan directly on the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in a low-dimensional space, we can ﬁnd policies for POMDPs that are orders of magnitude larger than can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and also on a mobile robot navigation task.</p><p>3 0.63207877 <a title="165-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Prediction_and_Semantic_Association.html">163 nips-2002-Prediction and Semantic Association</a></p>

We argue that the success of existing accounts of semantic representation comes as a result of indirectly addressing this problem, and show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by taking a probabilistic approach that explicitly models the generative structure of language. 1</p><p>4 0.62938547 <a title="165-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Learning_in_Zero-Sum_Team_Markov_Games_Using_Factored_Value_Functions.html">130 nips-2002-Learning in Zero-Sum Team Markov Games Using Factored Value Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathaniel D. Daw, Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: According to a series of inﬂuential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been conﬁned to more abstract psychological models.</p><p>6 0.62857544 <a title="165-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Dirichlet_Prior_and_Bayesian_Regularization.html">157 nips-2002-On the Dirichlet Prior and Bayesian Regularization</a></p>

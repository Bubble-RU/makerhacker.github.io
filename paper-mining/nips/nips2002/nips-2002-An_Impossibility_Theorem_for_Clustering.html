<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Mikio L. Braun, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Model selection is linked to model assessment, which is the problem of comparing different models, or model parameters, for a speciﬁc learning task. For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>3 0.31089032 <a title="27-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Jason Weston, Bernhard SchĂślkopf</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework to incorporate unlabeled data in kernel classifier, based on the idea that two points in the same cluster are more likely to have the same label.

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Stuart Russell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to ﬁnd one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufﬁciently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, , learns a distance metric over if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efﬁcient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to signiﬁcantly improve clustering performance. £ ¤¢ £ ¥¢</p><p>5 0.27394101 <a title="27-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Clustering_with_the_Fisher_Score.html">53 nips-2002-Clustering with the Fisher Score</a></p>
<p>Author: Koji Tsuda, Motoaki Kawanabe, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Recently the Fisher score (or the Fisher kernel) is increasingly used as a feature extractor for classiﬁcation problems. The Fisher score is a vector of parameter derivatives of loglikelihood of a probabilistic model. This paper gives a theoretical analysis about how class information is preserved in the space of the Fisher score, which turns out that the Fisher score consists of a few important dimensions with class information and many nuisance dimensions. When we perform clustering with the Fisher score, K-Means type methods are obviously inappropriate because they make use of all dimensions. So we will develop a novel but simple clustering algorithm specialized for the Fisher score, which can exploit important dimensions. This algorithm is successfully tested in experiments with artiﬁcial data and real data (amino acid sequences).</p><p>6 0.27272528 <a title="27-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Going_Metric%3A_Denoising_Pairwise_Data.html">98 nips-2002-Going Metric: Denoising Pairwise Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Volker Roth, Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise data in empirical sciences typically violate metricity, either due to noise or due to fallible estimates, and therefore are hard to analyze by conventional machine learning technology. In this paper we therefore study ways to work around this problem. First, we present an alternative embedding to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that allows us to apply a variety of classical machine learning and signal processing algorithms. The class of pairwise grouping algorithms which share the shift-invariance property is statistically invariant under this embedding procedure, leading to identical assignments of objects to clusters. Based on this new vectorial representation, denoising methods are applied in a second step. Both steps provide a theoretically well controlled setup to translate from pairwise data to the respective denoised metric representation. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our theoretical reasoning by discovering structure in protein sequence data bases, visibly improving performance upon existing automatic methods. 1</p><p>5 0.69659746 <a title="27-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Clustering_with_the_Fisher_Score.html">53 nips-2002-Clustering with the Fisher Score</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>6 0.54632562 <a title="27-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Distance_Metric_Learning_with_Application_to_Clustering_with_Side-Information.html">70 nips-2002-Distance Metric Learning with Application to Clustering with Side-Information</a></p>

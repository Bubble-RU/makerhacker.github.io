<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: The problem of super-resolution involves generating feasible higher resolution images, which are pleasing to the eye and realistic, from a given low resolution image. This might be attempted by using simple ﬁlters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean ﬁeld approach. 1</p><p>3 0.30945012 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Learning_Variance_Components_of_Natural_Images.html">10 nips-2002-A Model for Learning Variance Components of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>4 0.25350901 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Intrinsic_Images_from_a_Single_Image.html">173 nips-2002-Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Marshall F. Tappen, William T. Freeman, Edward H. Adelson</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reﬂectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classiﬁer trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, each image derivative is classiﬁed as being caused by shading or a change in the surface’s reﬂectance. Generalized Belief Propagation is then used to propagate information from areas where the correct classiﬁcation is clear to areas where it is ambiguous. We also show results on real images.</p><p>5 0.22202511 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Unsupervised_Color_Constancy.html">202 nips-2002-Unsupervised Color Constancy</a></p>
<p>Author: Kinh Tieu, Erik G. Miller</p><p>Abstract: In [1] we introduced a linear statistical model of joint color changes in images due to variation in lighting and certain non-geometric camera parameters. We did this by measuring the mappings of colors in one image of a scene to colors in another image of the same scene under different lighting conditions. Here we increase the ﬂexibility of this color ﬂow model by allowing ﬂow coefﬁcients to vary according to a low order polynomial over the image. This allows us to better ﬁt smoothly varying lighting conditions as well as curved surfaces without endowing our model with too much capacity. We show results on image matching and shadow removal and detection.</p><p>6 0.19994956 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Detect_Natural_Image_Boundaries_Using_Brightness_and_Texture.html">132 nips-2002-Learning to Detect Natural Image Boundaries Using Brightness and Texture</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>4 0.69157642 <a title="39-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Intrinsic_Images_from_a_Single_Image.html">173 nips-2002-Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</a></p>

<p>Author: Anat Levin, Assaf Zomet, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Certain simple images are known to trigger a percept of transparency: the input image I is perceived as the sum of two images I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + I2 (x, y). This percept is puzzling. First, why do we choose the “more complicated” description with two images rather than the “simpler” explanation I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + 0 ? Second, given the inﬁnite number of ways to express I as a sum of two images, how do we compute the “best” decomposition ? Here we suggest that transparency is the rational percept of a system that is adapted to the statistics of natural scenes. We present a probabilistic model of images based on the qualitative statistics of derivative ﬁlters and “corner detectors” in natural scenes and use this model to ﬁnd the most probable decomposition of a novel image. The optimization is performed using loopy belief propagation. We show that our model computes perceptually “correct” decompositions on synthetic images and discuss its application to real images. 1</p><p>6 0.67471939 <a title="39-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Learning_Variance_Components_of_Natural_Images.html">10 nips-2002-A Model for Learning Variance Components of Natural Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: People routinely make sophisticated causal inferences unconsciously, effortlessly, and from very little data – often from just one or a few observations. We argue that these inferences can be explained as Bayesian computations over a hypothesis space of causal graphical models, shaped by strong top-down prior knowledge in the form of intuitive theories. We present two case studies of our approach, including quantitative models of human causal judgments and brief comparisons with traditional bottom-up models of inference.</p><p>3 0.98540944 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Low rank approximation techniques are widespread in pattern recognition research — they include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic LSA, Principal Components Analysus (PCA), the Generative Aspect Model, and many forms of bibliometric analysis. All make use of a low-dimensional manifold onto which data are projected. Such techniques are generally “unsupervised,” which allows them to model data in the absence of labels or categories. With many practical problems, however, some prior knowledge is available in the form of context. In this paper, I describe a principled approach to incorporating such information, and demonstrate its application to PCA-based approximations of several data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.98137373 <a title="39-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Forward-Decoding_Kernel-Based_Phone_Recognition.html">93 nips-2002-Forward-Decoding Kernel-Based Phone Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Shantanu Chakrabartty, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: Forward decoding kernel machines (FDKM) combine large-margin classifiers with hidden Markov models (HMM) for maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptive sequence estimation. State transitions in the sequence are conditioned on observed data using a kernel-based probability model trained with a recursive scheme that deals effectively with noisy and partially labeled data. Training over very large data sets is accomplished using a sparse probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) model based on quadratic entropy, and an on-line stochastic steepest descent algorithm. For speaker-independent continuous phone recognition, FDKM trained over 177 ,080 samples of the TlMIT database achieves 80.6% recognition accuracy over the full test set, without use of a prior phonetic language model.</p><p>5 0.97165102 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Value-Directed_Compression_of_POMDPs.html">205 nips-2002-Value-Directed Compression of POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Pascal Poupart, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: We examine the problem of generating state-space compressions of POMDPs in a way that minimally impacts decision quality. We analyze the impact of compressions on decision quality, observing that compressions that allow accurate policy evaluation (prediction of expected future reward) will not affect decision quality. We derive a set of sufﬁcient conditions that ensure accurate prediction in this respect, illustrate interesting mathematical properties these confer on lossless linear compressions, and use these to derive an iterative procedure for ﬁnding good linear lossy compressions. We also elaborate on how structured representations of a POMDP can be used to ﬁnd such compressions.</p><p>6 0.92653054 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Dynamical_Causal_Learning.html">75 nips-2002-Dynamical Causal Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>4 0.088839054 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Reconstructing_Stimulus-Driven_Neural_Networks_from_Spike_Times.html">171 nips-2002-Reconstructing Stimulus-Driven Neural Networks from Spike Times</a></p>
<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>5 0.076595053 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Concurrent_Object_Recognition_and_Segmentation_by_Graph_Partitioning.html">57 nips-2002-Concurrent Object Recognition and Segmentation by Graph Partitioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><p>6 0.073337339 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Classifying_Patterns_of_Visual_Motion_-_a_Neuromorphic_Approach.html">51 nips-2002-Classifying Patterns of Visual Motion - a Neuromorphic Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Leonid Taycher, John Iii, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Accurate representation of articulated motion is a challenging problem for machine perception. Several successful tracking algorithms have been developed that model human body as an articulated tree. We propose a learning-based method for creating such articulated models from observations of multiple rigid motions. This paper is concerned with recovering topology of the articulated model, when the rigid motion of constituent segments is known. Our approach is based on ﬁnding the Maximum Likelihood tree shaped factorization of the joint probability density function (PDF) of rigid segment motions. The topology of graphical model formed from this factorization corresponds to topology of the underlying articulated body. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on both synthetic and real motion capture data.</p><p>5 0.23769912 <a title="47-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Concurrent_Object_Recognition_and_Segmentation_by_Graph_Partitioning.html">57 nips-2002-Concurrent Object Recognition and Segmentation by Graph Partitioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Craig Saunders, Alexei Vinokourov, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show how the generation of documents can be thought of as a k-stage Markov process, which leads to a Fisher kernel from which the n-gram and string kernels can be re-constructed. The Fisher kernel view gives a more flexible insight into the string kernel and suggests how it can be parametrised in a way that reflects the statistics of the training corpus. Furthermore, the probabilistic modelling approach suggests extending the Markov process to consider sub-sequences of varying length, rather than the standard fixed-length approach used in the string kernel. We give a procedure for determining which sub-sequences are informative features and hence generate a Finite State Machine model, which can again be used to obtain a Fisher kernel. By adjusting the parametrisation we can also influence the weighting received by the features . In this way we are able to obtain a logarithmic weighting in a Fisher kernel. Finally, experiments are reported comparing the different kernels using the standard Bag of Words kernel as a baseline. 1</p><p>3 0.38589489 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Take_Concurrent_Actions.html">134 nips-2002-Learning to Take Concurrent Actions</a></p>

<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Malte Boegershausen, Pascal Suter</p><p>Abstract: We describe a model of short-term synaptic depression that is derived from a silicon circuit implementation. The dynamics of this circuit model are similar to the dynamics of some present theoretical models of shortterm depression except that the recovery dynamics of the variable describing the depression is nonlinear and it also depends on the presynaptic frequency. The equations describing the steady-state and transient responses of this synaptic model ﬁt the experimental results obtained from a fabricated silicon network consisting of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and different types of synapses. We also show experimental data demonstrating the possible computational roles of depression. One possible role of a depressing synapse is that the input can quickly bring the neuron up to threshold when the membrane potential is close to the resting potential.</p><p>5 0.36988214 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

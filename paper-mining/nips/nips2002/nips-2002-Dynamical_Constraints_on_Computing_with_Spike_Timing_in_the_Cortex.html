</p><p>2 1 Introduction Several models of neural computation use the precise timing of spikes to encode information. [sent-5, score-0.613]
</p><p>3 have proposed synchronous volleys of spikes (synfire chains) as a candidate for representing information in the cortex [1]. [sent-7, score-0.541]
</p><p>4 More recently, Maass has demonstrated how spike timing in general, not merely synfire chains, can be utilized to perform nonlinear computations [6]. [sent-8, score-0.775]
</p><p>5 For any of these schemes to function, the timing of the spikes must be robust to small perturbations; i. [sent-9, score-0.523]
</p><p>6 , small perturbations of spike timing should not result in successively larger fluctuations in the timing of subsequent spikes. [sent-11, score-0.906]
</p><p>7 To use the terminology of dynamical systems theory, the network must not exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions. [sent-12, score-0.27]
</p><p>8 Indeed, reliable computation would simply be impossible if the timing of spikes is sensitive to the slightest source of noise, such as synaptic release variability, or thermal fluctuations in the opening and closing of ionic channels. [sent-13, score-0.651]
</p><p>9 They have demonstrated that the propagation of a synfire chain over several layers of integrate-and-fire neurons can be robust to 2 Hz of random background activity and to a small amount of noise in the spike timings. [sent-16, score-0.985]
</p><p>10 The question we investigate here is whether this result generalizes to the propagation of any arbitrary spatiotemporal configuration of spikes through a recurrent network of neurons. [sent-17, score-0.532]
</p><p>11 This question is central to any theory of computation in cortical networks using spike timing since it is well known that the connectivity between neurons in the cortex is highly recurrent. [sent-18, score-1.07]
</p><p>12 Although there have been earlier attempts at resolving like issues, the applicability of the results are limited by the model of the neuron [8] or the pattern of propagated spikes [5] considered. [sent-19, score-0.545]
</p><p>13 Fortunately, our simulations indicate that convergence or divergence of trajectories in cortical networks can occur very rapidly (within 200-300 msec). [sent-24, score-0.309]
</p><p>14 Second, the issues of how a network should be constructed so as to generate a particular spatiotemporal pattern of spikes as well as whether a given spatiotemporal pattern of spikes can be generated in principle, remain unresolved in the general setting. [sent-26, score-0.921]
</p><p>15 It might be argued that without such knowledge, any classification of spike patterns into sensitive and insensitive classes is inherently incomplete. [sent-27, score-0.549]
</p><p>16 In Section 5, we draw conclusions regarding the issue of computation using spike timing in cortical networks based on these results. [sent-34, score-0.733]
</p><p>17 2  Spike dynamics  A detailed exposition of an abstract dynamical system that models recurrent systems of biological neurons was presented in [2]. [sent-35, score-0.406]
</p><p>18 For example, in Figure 1, the present state of the system is described by the positions of the spikes (solid lines) in the shaded region at t= 0 and the state of the system at a future time T is specified by the positions of the spikes (solid lines) in the shaded region at t= T. [sent-38, score-1.208]
</p><p>19 Each internal neuron i in the system is assigned a membrane potential function PJ) that takes as its input the present state and generates the instantaneous potential at the soma of neuron i. [sent-39, score-0.66]
</p><p>20 It is the particular instantiation of the set of functions PJ) that determines the nature of the neurons as well as their connectivity in the network. [sent-40, score-0.301]
</p><p>21 Whenever the integration of the PSP's from all presynaptic spikes to a neuron combined with the hyperpolarizing effects of its own spikes (the precise nature of the union specified by PJ)) brings its membrane potential above threshold, the neuron emits a new spike. [sent-42, score-1.188]
</p><p>22 If the spikes in the shaded region at t= 0 were perturbed in time ( dotted lines), this would result in a perturbation on the new spike. [sent-43, score-0.577]
</p><p>23 The size of the new perturbation would depend upon the positions of the spikes in the shaded region, the nature of PJ) , and the sizes of the old perturbations. [sent-44, score-0.572]
</p><p>24 In essence, any initial set of perturbations would propagate from spike to spike to produce a set of perturbations at any arbitrary future time t= T. [sent-46, score-1.261]

</p><p>26 Input neurons are colored gray and internal neurons black. [sent-48, score-0.632]
</p><p>27 Note that spikes generated by the input neurons are not perturbed. [sent-50, score-0.65]
</p><p>28 The temporal position of all spikes in the boxes specify the state of the system at times t= 0 and t= T. [sent-52, score-0.457]
</p><p>29 y  Let column vectors ~ and denote , respectively, perturbations on the spikes of internal neurons at times t=O and t=T. [sent-56, score-0.974]
</p><p>30 We pad each vector with as many zeroes as there are input spikes in the respective state descriptions. [sent-57, score-0.464]
</p><p>31 Then, the dynamics of the system is sensitive to initial conditions if lim T _ oo liB * AT * ell = 00 . [sent-60, score-0.332]
</p><p>32 Furthermore, the class of trajectories that satisfy either of the above criteria is larger (although not necessarily in measure) than the class of trajectories that have definite exponents. [sent-64, score-0.28]
</p><p>33 Second, input spikes are free parameters that have to be constrained in some manner if the above criteria are to be well-defined. [sent-65, score-0.416]
</p><p>34 By the same token, we do not consider the effects that perturbations of input spikes have on the dynamics of the system. [sent-66, score-0.647]
</p><p>35 Each neuron receives around 10 4 synapses, approximately half of which are from neurons in the same column and the rest from excitatory neurons in other columns and the thalamus. [sent-68, score-0.77]
</p><p>36 1 Hz, a column generates on average 10 spikes every millisecond. [sent-70, score-0.41]
</p><p>37 Since perturbations are propagated from spikes  to generated spikes, divergence and/or convergence of spike trajectories could occur extremely rapidly. [sent-71, score-1.177]
</p><p>38 All experiments reported here were conducted on a system containing 1000 internal neurons (set to model a cortical column) and 800 excitatory input neurons (set to model the input into the column). [sent-73, score-0.978]
</p><p>39 Of the 1000 internal neurons, 80% were chosen to be excitatory and the rest inhibitory. [sent-74, score-0.313]
</p><p>40 Each internal neuron received 100 synapses from other (internal as well as input) neurons in the system. [sent-75, score-0.572]
</p><p>41 The input neurons were set to generate random uncorrelated Poisson spike trains at a fixed rate of 5 Hz. [sent-76, score-0.816]
</p><p>42 The membrane potential function P/) for each internal neuron was modeled as the sum of excitatory and inhibitory PSP ' s triggered by the arrival of spikes at synapses, and afterhyperpolarization potentials triggered by the spikes generated by the neuron. [sent-77, score-1.457]
</p><p>43 OJ was set for excitatory and inhibitory synapses so as to generate a mean spike rate of 5 Hz by excitatory and 15 Hz by inhibitory internal neurons. [sent-80, score-1.044]
</p><p>44 After the generation of a spike, an absolute refractory period of 1 msec was introduced during which the neuron was prohibited from generating a spike. [sent-82, score-0.474]
</p><p>45 However, each spike triggered an afterhyperpolarization potential with a decay constant of 30 msec that led to a relative refractory period. [sent-84, score-0.856]
</p><p>46 1 msec time steps and the time bound on the state description, as related in Section 2, was set at 200 msec. [sent-86, score-0.321]
</p><p>47 On the one extreme was an ordered two layer ring network with input neurons forming the lower layer and internal neurons (with the inhibitory neurons placed evenly among the excitatory neurons) forming the upper layer. [sent-88, score-1.218]
</p><p>48 Each internal neuron received inputs from a sector of internal and input neurons that was centered on that neuron. [sent-89, score-0.778]
</p><p>49 As a result, any two neighboring internal neurons shared 96 of their 100 inputs (albeit with different axonal delays of 0. [sent-90, score-0.6]
</p><p>50 This had the effect of output spike trains from neighboring internal neurons being highly correlated, with sectors of internal neurons producing synchronized bursts of spikes. [sent-93, score-1.564]
</p><p>51 On the other extreme was a network where each internal neuron received inputs from 100 randomly chosen neurons from the entire population of internal and input neurons. [sent-94, score-0.863]
</p><p>52 Several other networks where neighboring internal neurons shared an intermediate percentage of their inputs were also simulated. [sent-95, score-0.548]
</p><p>53 Figure 2(a) displays sample output spike trains from 100 neighboring internal neurons over a period of 450 msec for both architectures. [sent-98, score-1.244]
</p><p>54 In the first set of experiments, pairs of identical systems driven by identical inputs and initialized at identical states except for one randomly chosen spike that was perturbed by 1 msec , were simulated. [sent-99, score-0.82]
</p><p>55 In all cases, the spike trajectories diverged very rapidly. [sent-100, score-0.623]
</p><p>56 Figure 2(b) presents spike trains generated by the same 100 neighboring internal neurons from the two simulations from 200 to 400 msec after initialization, for both architectures. [sent-101, score-1.299]
</p><p>57 To further explore the sensitivity of the spike trajectories, we partitioned each trajectory into segments of 500 spike generations each. [sent-102, score-1.083]
</p><p>58 For each such segment, we then extracted the spectral norm * AT * after every 100 spike generations. [sent-103, score-0.444]
</p><p>59 Although successive segments of 500 spike generations were found to be quite variable in their absolute sensitivity, each such segment was nevertheless found to be sensitive. [sent-105, score-0.584]

</p><p>65 4  Analysis and further simulations  The reasons behind the divergence of the spike trajectories presented in Section 3 can be found by considering how perturbations are propagated from the set of spikes in the current state description to a newly generated spike. [sent-119, score-1.28]
</p><p>66 As shown in [3] , the perturbation in the new spike can be represented as a weighted sum of the perturbations of those spikes in the state description that contribute to the generation of the new spike. [sent-120, score-1.153]
</p><p>67 The weight assigned to a spike Xi is proportional to the slope of the PSP or that of the hyperpolarization triggered by that spike ( apo/aXi in the general case), at the instant of the generation of the new spike. [sent-121, score-1.02]
</p><p>68 Intuitively, the larger the slope is, the greater is the effect that a perturbation of that spike can have on the total potential at the soma, and hence, the larger is the perturbation on the new spike. [sent-122, score-0.606]
</p><p>69 This constraint is reflected in the fact that if all spikes were to be perturbed by a fixed quantity, this would amount to a rigid displacement in time causing the new spike to be perturbed by the same quantity. [sent-124, score-0.939]
</p><p>70 Note that this amounts to an assumed probability distribution on the likelihood of particular spike trajectories rather than one on possible network architectures and synaptic weights. [sent-130, score-0.741]
</p><p>71 It was also shown that the statistic \I;I~l a i2 ) plays a central role in the determination of the sensitivity of the resultant spike trajectories. [sent-132, score-0.576]
</p><p>72 While this merely entails the introduction of additional rows with zero entries to * AT * account for input spikes in each state, this alters the effect that B has on  liB  ell  in a way that allows for a simpler as well as bidirectional bound on the norm. [sent-134, score-0.484]
</p><p>73 \I;~l a 2 ) < ~ -I} then the i  spike trajectories are almost surely sensitive (resp. [sent-137, score-0.703]
</p><p>74 m denotes the number of internal spikes in the state description. [sent-139, score-0.587]
</p><p>75 From our earlier a i2 whenever a spike was generated, and simulations, we extracted the value of  L  computed the sample mean  (I a  2 i )  over all spike generations. [sent-141, score-0.888]
</p><p>76 The criterion for sensitivity is therefore more likely to be met when a substantial portion of the excitatory PSP's are on their falling phase (and inhibitory PSP ' s on their rising phase) at the instant of the generation of each new spike. [sent-147, score-0.417]
</p><p>77 This corresponds to a case where the inputs into the neurons of a system are not strongly synchronized. [sent-148, score-0.325]
</p><p>78 Conversely, if spikes are generated soon after the arrival of a synchronized burst of spikes (all of whose excitatory PSP ' s are presumably on their rising phase), the criterion for sensitivity is less likely to be met. [sent-149, score-1.205]
</p><p>79 We simulated several combinations of the two input scenarios to identify cases where the corresponding spike trajectories in the system were not likely to be sensitive to initial conditions. [sent-150, score-0.805]

</p><p>83 (L:  Next, two sets of experiments simulating the arrival of regularly spaced synfire chains were conducted. [sent-179, score-0.338]
</p><p>84 The synfire chains comprised of spike volleys that arrived every 50 msec. [sent-181, score-0.846]
</p><p>85 Four experiments were conducted within each set: volleys were composed of either 100 or 200 spikes (producing jolts of around 10 and 20 mV respectively) that were either fully synchronized or were dispersed over a Gaussian distribution with a=1 msec. [sent-182, score-0.751]
</p><p>86 16 (200 (100  Finally, two sets of experiments simulating the arrival of randomly spaced synfire chains were conducted. [sent-194, score-0.338]
</p><p>87 The synfire chains comprised of a sequence of spike volleys that arrived randomly at a rate of 20 Hz. [sent-196, score-0.846]
</p><p>88 Two experiments were conducted within each set: volleys were composed of either 100 or 200 synchronized spikes. [sent-197, score-0.279]
</p><p>89 Indeed, our simulations indicate that sensitivity is more the rule than the exception in systems modeling cortical networks operating at low to moderate levels of activity. [sent-206, score-0.269]
</p><p>90 Since perturbations are propagated from spike to spike, trajectories that are sensitive can diverge very rapidly in systems that generate a large number of spikes within a short period of time. [sent-207, score-1.245]
</p><p>91 Sensitivity therefore is an issue, even for schemes based on precise sequences of spike timing with computation occurring over short (hundreds of msec) intervals. [sent-208, score-0.682]
</p><p>92 This severely restricts the possible use of precise spike sequences for reliable computation in cortical networks for at least two reasons. [sent-210, score-0.648]
</p><p>93 First, un synchronized activity can rise well above 2 Hz in the cortex, and second, the highly constrained nature of this dynamics would show in in vivo recordings. [sent-211, score-0.318]
</p><p>94 Although cortical neurons can have vastly more complex responses than that modeled in this paper, our conclusions are based largely on the simplicity and the generality of the constraints identified (the analysis assumes a general membrane potential function PO). [sent-212, score-0.387]
</p><p>95 We are however not arguing that computation with spike timing is impossible in general. [sent-214, score-0.619]
</p><p>96 There are neural structures, such as the nucleus laminaris in the barn owl and the electro sensory array in the electric fish , which have been shown to perform exquisitely precise computations using spike timing. [sent-215, score-0.507]
</p><p>97 Interestingly, these structures have very specialized neurons and network architectures. [sent-216, score-0.319]
</p><p>98 To conclude, computation using precise spike sequences does not appear to be likely in the cortex in the presence of Poisson-like activity at levels typically found there. [sent-217, score-0.669]

<p>Author: Michael R. Deweese, Anthony M. Zador</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are consistent with a model of cortical processing in which synchronous packets of spikes propagate stably from one neuronal population to the next. 1 Binary coding in auditory cortex We recorded responses of neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats to pure-tone pips of different frequencies [1, 2]. Each pip was presented repeatedly, allowing us to assess the variability of the neural response to multiple presentations of each stimulus. We first recorded multi-unit activity with conventional tungsten electrodes (Fig. 1a). The number of spikes in response to each pip fluctuated markedly from one trial to the next (Fig. 1e), as though governed by a random mechanism such as that generating the ticks of a Geiger counter. Highly variable responses such as these, which are at least as variable as a Poisson process, are the norm in the cortex [3-7], and have contributed to the widely held view that cortical spike trains are so noisy that only the average firing rate can be used to encode stimuli. Because we were recording the activity of an unknown number of neurons, we could not be sure whether the strong trial-to-trial fluctuations reflected the underlying variability of the single units.

Darker hash marks indicate spike times within the response period, which were used in the variability analysis. b Spikes recorded in cell-attached mode were easily identified from the raw voltage trace (top) by applying a high-pass filter (bottom) and thresholding (dark gray line). Spike times (black squares) were assigned to the peaks of suprathreshold segments. c Spike rasters from a cell-attached recording of single-unit responses to 25 repetitions of the same tone consisted of exactly one well-timed spike per trial (latency standard deviation = 1.0 msec), unlike the multi-unit responses (Fig. 1a). Under the Poisson assumption, this would have been highly unlikely (P ~ 10 -11). d The same neuron as in Fig. 1c responds with lower probability to repeated presentations of a different tone, but there are still no multi-spike responses. e We quantified response variability for each tone by dividing the variance in spike count by the mean spike count across all trials for that tone. Response variability for multi-unit tungsten recording (open triangles) was high for each of the 29 tones (out of 32) that elicited at least one spike on one trial. All but one point lie above one (horizontal gray line), which is the value produced by a Poisson process with any constant or time varying event rate. Single unit responses recorded in cell-attached mode were far less variable (filled circles). Ninety one percent (10/11) of the tones that elicited at least one spike from this neuron produced no multi-spike responses in 25 trials; the corresponding points fall on the diagonal line between (0,1) and (1,0), which provides a strict lower bound on the variability for any response set with a mean between 0 and 1. No point lies above one. attached recording with a patch pipette [8, 9], in order to ensure single unit isolation (Fig. 1b). This recording mode minimizes both of the main sources of error in spike detection: failure to detect a spike in the unit under observation (false negatives), and contamination by spikes from nearby neurons (false positives). It also differs from conventional extracellular recording methods in its selection bias: With cell- attached recording neurons are selected solely on the basis of the experimenter’s ability to form a seal, rather than on the basis of neuronal activity and responsiveness to stimuli as in conventional methods. Surprisingly, single unit responses were far more orderly than suggested by the multi-unit recordings; responses typically consisted of either 0 or 1 spikes per trial, and not more (Fig. 1c-e). In the most dramatic examples, each presentation of the same tone pip elicited exactly one spike (Fig. 1c). In most cases, however, some presentations failed to elicit a spike (Fig. 1d). Although low-variability responses have recently been observed in the cortex [10, 11] and elsewhere [12, 13], the binary behavior described here has not previously been reported for cortical neurons. a 1.4 N = 3055 response sets b 1.2 1 Poisson 28 kHz - 100 msec 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 ry na bi Response variance/mean (spikes/trial) The majority of the neurons (59%) in our study for which statistical significance could be assessed (at the p<0.001 significance level; see Fig. 2, caption) showed noisy binary behavior—“binary” because neurons produced either 0 or 1 spikes, and “noisy” because some stimuli elicited both single spikes and failures. In a substantial fraction of neurons, however, the responses showed more variability. We found no correlation between neuronal variability and cortical layer (inferred from the depth of the recording electrode), cortical area (inside vs. outside of area A1) or depth of anesthesia. Moreover, the binary mode of spiking was not due to the brevity (25 msec) of the stimuli; responses that were binary for short tones were comparably binary when longer (100 msec) tones were used (Fig. 2b).

All points were jittered slightly so that overlying points could be seen in the figure. 2165 response sets contained no multi-spike responses; the corresponding points fell on the line from [0,1] to [1,0]. b The binary nature of single unit responses was insensitive to tone duration, even for frequencies that elicited the largest responses. Twenty additional spike rasters from the same neuron (and tone frequency) as in Fig. 1c contain no multi-spike responses whether in response to 100 msec tones (above) or 25 msec tones (below). Across the population, binary responses were as prevalent for 100 msec tones as for 25 msec tones (see Identification methods for group statistics). In many neurons, binary responses showed high temporal precision, with latencies sometimes exhibiting standard deviations as low as 1 msec (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 1c), comparable to previous observations in the auditory cortex [14], and only slightly more precise than in monkey visual area MT [5]. High temporal precision was positively correlated with high response probability (Fig. 3). a b N = (44 cells)x(32 tones) 14 N = 32 tones 12 30 Jitter (msec) Jitter (msec) 40 10 8 6 20 10 4 2 0 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Mean response (spikes/trial) 1 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 Mean response (spikes/trial) 2 Figure 3: Trial-to-trial variability in latency of response to repeated presentations of the same tone decreased with increasing response probability. a Scatter plot of standard deviation of latency vs. mean response for 25 presentations each of 32 tones for a different neuron as in Figs. 1 and 2 (gray line is best linear fit). Rasters from 25 repeated presentations of a low response tone (upper left inset, which corresponds to left-most data point) display much more variable latencies than rasters from a high response tone (lower right inset; corresponds to right-most data point). b The negative correlation between latency variability and response size was present on average across the population of 44 neurons described in Identification methods for group statistics (linear fit, gray). The low trial-to-trial variability ruled out the possibility that the firing statistics could be accounted for by a simple rate-modulated Poisson process (Fig. 4a1,a2). In other systems, low variability has sometimes been modeled as a Poisson process followed by a post-spike refractory period [10, 12]. In our system, however, the range in latencies of evoked binary responses was often much greater than the refractory period, which could not have been longer than the 2 msec inter-spike intervals observed during epochs of spontaneous spiking, indicating that binary spiking did not result from any intrinsic property of the spike generating mechanism (Fig. 4a3). Moreover, a single stimulus-evoked spike could suppress subsequent spikes for as long as hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. Figs. 1d,4d), supporting the idea that binary spiking arises through a circuit-level, rather than a single-neuron, mechanism. Indeed, the fact that this suppression is observed even in the cortex of awake animals [15] suggests that binary spiking is not a special property of the anesthetized state. It seems surprising that binary spiking in the cortex has not previously been remarked upon. In the auditory cortex the explanation may be in part technical: Because firing rates in the auditory cortex tend to be low, multi-unit recording is often used to maximize the total amount of data collected. Moreover, our use of cell-attached recording minimizes the usual bias toward responsive or active neurons. Such explanations are not, however, likely to account for the failure to observe binary spiking in the visual cortex, where spike count statistics have been scrutinized more closely [3-7]. One possibility is that this reflects a fundamental difference between the auditory and visual systems.

(a1) Experimentally recorded responses. (a2) Using the smoothed post stimulus time histogram (PSTH; bottom) from the set of responses in Fig. 4a, we generated rasters under the assumption of Poisson firing. In this representative example, four double-spike responses (arrows at left) were produced in 25 trials. (a3) We then generated rasters assuming that the neuron fired according to a Poisson process subject to a hard refractory period of 2 msec. Even with a refractory period, this representative example includes one triple- and three double-spike responses. The minimum interspike-interval during spontaneous firing events was less than two msec for five of our neurons, so 2 msec is a conservative upper bound for the refractory period. b. Spontaneous activity is reduced following high-probability responses. The PSTH (top; 0.25 msec bins) of the combined responses from the 25% (8/32) of tones that elicited the largest responses from the same neuron as in Figs. 3a and 4a illustrates a preclusion of spontaneous and evoked activity for over 200 msec following stimulation. The PSTHs from progressively less responsive groups of tones show progressively less preclusion following stimulation. c Fewer noisy binary neurons need to be pooled to achieve the same “signal-to-noise ratio” (SNR; see ref. [24]) as a collection of Poisson neurons. The ratio of the number of Poisson to binary neurons required to achieve the same SNR is plotted against the mean number of spikes elicited per neuron following stimulation; here we have defined the SNR to be the ratio of the mean spike count to the standard deviation of the spike count. d Spike probability tuning curve for the same neuron as in Figs. 1c-e and 2b fit to a Gaussian in tone frequency. and one that we favor—is that the difference rests not in the sensory modality, but instead in the difference between the stimuli used. In this view, the binary responses may not be limited to the auditory cortex; neurons in visual and other sensory cortices might exhibit similar responses to the appropriate stimuli. For example, the tone pips we used might be the auditory analog of a brief flash of light, rather than the oriented moving edges or gratings usually used to probe the primary visual cortex. Conversely, auditory stimuli analogous to edges or gratings [16, 17] may be more likely to elicit conventional, rate-modulated Poisson responses in the auditory cortex. Indeed, there may be a continuum between binary and Poisson modes. Thus, even in conventional rate-modulated responses, the first spike is often privileged in that it carries most of the information in the spike train [5, 14, 18]. The first spike may be particularly important as a means of rapidly signaling stimulus transients. Binary responses suggest a mode that complements conventional rate coding. In the simplest rate-coding model, a stimulus parameter (such as the frequency of a tone) governs only the rate at which a neuron generates spikes, but not the detailed positions of the spikes; the actual spike train itself is an instantiation of a random process (such as a Poisson process). By contrast, in the binomial model, the stimulus parameter (frequency) is encoded as the probability of firing (Fig. 4d). Binary coding has implications for cortical computation. In the rate coding model, stimulus encoding is “ergodic”: a stimulus parameter can be read out either by observing the activity of one neuron for a long time, or a population for a short time. By contrast, in the binary model the stimulus value can be decoded only by observing a neuronal population, so that there is no benefit to integrating over long time periods (cf. ref. [19]). One advantage of binary encoding is that it allows the population to signal quickly; the most compact message a neuron can send is one spike [20]. Binary coding is also more efficient in the context of population coding, as quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. 4c). The precise organization of both spike number and time we have observed suggests that cortical activity consists, at least under some conditions, of packets of spikes synchronized across populations of neurons. Theoretical work [21-23] has shown how such packets can propagate stably from one population to the next, but only if neurons within each population fire at most one spike per packet; otherwise, the number of spikes per packet—and hence the width of each packet—grows at each propagation step. Interestingly, one prediction of stable propagation models is that spike probability should be related to timing precision, a prediction born out by our observations (Fig. 3). The role of these packets in computation remains an open question. 2 Identification methods for group statistics We recorded responses to 32 different 25 msec tones from each of 175 neurons from the auditory cortices of 16 Sprague-Dawley rats; each tone was repeated between 5 and 75 times (mean = 19). Thus our ensemble consisted of 32x175=5600 response sets, with between 5 and 75 samples in each set. Of these, 3055 response sets contained at least one spike on at least on trial. For each response set, we tested the hypothesis that the observed variability was significantly lower than expected from the null hypothesis of a Poisson process. The ability to assess significance depended on two parameters: the sample size (5-75) and the firing probability. Intuitively, the dependence on firing probability arises because at low firing rates most responses produce only trials with 0 or 1 spikes under both the Poisson and binary models; only at high firing rates do the two models make different predictions, since in that case the Poisson model includes many trials with 2 or even 3 spikes while the binary model generates only solitary spikes (see Fig. 4a1,a2). Using a stringent significance criterion of p<0.001, 467 response sets had a sufficient number of repeats to assess significance, given the observed firing probability. Of these, half (242/467=52%) were significantly less variable than expected by chance, five hundred-fold higher than the 467/1000=0.467 response sets expected, based on the 0.001 significance criterion, to yield a binary response set. Seventy-two neurons had at least one response set for which significance could be assessed, and of these, 49 neurons (49/72=68%) had at least one significantly sub-Poisson response set. Of this population of 49 neurons, five achieved low variability through repeatable bursty behavior (e.g., every spike count was either 0 or 3, but not 1 or 2) and were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 44 neurons formed the basis for the group statistics analyses shown in Figs. 2a and 3b. Nine of these neurons were subjected to an additional protocol consisting of at least 10 presentations each of 100 msec tones and 25 msec tones of all 32 frequencies. Of the 100 msec stimulation response sets, 44 were found to be significantly sub-Poisson at the p<0.05 level, in good agreement with the 43 found to be significant among the responses to 25 msec tones. 3 Bibliography 1.

<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>4 0.32262829 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Hidden_Markov_Model_of_Cortical_Synaptic_Plasticity%3A_Derivation_of_the_Learning_Rule.html">102 nips-2002-Hidden Markov Model of Cortical Synaptic Plasticity: Derivation of the Learning Rule</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael Eisele, Kenneth D. Miller</p><p>Abstract: Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes. We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole ﬁring episodes, and depends only on when these episodes start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to deﬁne what “ﬁring episodes” are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring episodes as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in superﬁcial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).</p><p>5 0.25247934 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Arunava Banerjee, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: If the cortex uses spike timing to compute, the timing of the spikes must be robust to perturbations. Based on a recent framework that provides a simple criterion to determine whether a spike sequence produced by a generic network is sensitive to initial conditions, and numerical simulations of a variety of network architectures, we argue within the limits set by our model of the neuron, that it is unlikely that precise sequences of spike timings are used for computation under conditions typically found in the cortex.</p><p>2 0.87314183 <a title="76-lsi-2" href="./nips-2002-Reconstructing_Stimulus-Driven_Neural_Networks_from_Spike_Times.html">171 nips-2002-Reconstructing Stimulus-Driven Neural Networks from Spike Times</a></p>
<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>3 0.8005774 <a title="76-lsi-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael R. Deweese, Anthony M. Zador</p><p>Abstract: Cortical neurons have been reported to use both rate and temporal codes. Here we describe a novel mode in which each neuron generates exactly 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to a stimulus. We used cell-attached recording, which ensured single-unit isolation, to record responses in rat auditory cortex to brief tone pips. Surprisingly, the majority of neurons exhibited binary behavior with few multi-spike responses; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. Many neurons were tuned to stimulus frequency. Since individual trials yielded at most one spike for most neurons, the information about stimulus frequency was encoded in the population, and would not have been accessible to later stages of processing that only had access to the activity of a single unit. These binary units allow a more efficient population code than is possible with conventional rate coding units, and are consistent with a model of cortical processing in which synchronous packets of spikes propagate stably from one neuronal population to the next. 1 Binary coding in auditory cortex We recorded responses of neurons in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats to pure-tone pips of different frequencies [1, 2]. Each pip was presented repeatedly, allowing us to assess the variability of the neural response to multiple presentations of each stimulus. We first recorded multi-unit activity with conventional tungsten electrodes (Fig. 1a). The number of spikes in response to each pip fluctuated markedly from one trial to the next (Fig. 1e), as though governed by a random mechanism such as that generating the ticks of a Geiger counter. Highly variable responses such as these, which are at least as variable as a Poisson process, are the norm in the cortex [3-7], and have contributed to the widely held view that cortical spike trains are so noisy that only the average firing rate can be used to encode stimuli. Because we were recording the activity of an unknown number of neurons, we could not be sure whether the strong trial-to-trial fluctuations reflected the underlying variability of the single units. We therefore used an alternative technique, cell- a b Single-unit recording method 5mV Multi-unit 1sec Raw cellattached voltage 10 kHz c Single-unit . . . . .. .. ... . . .... . ... .

Darker hash marks indicate spike times within the response period, which were used in the variability analysis. b Spikes recorded in cell-attached mode were easily identified from the raw voltage trace (top) by applying a high-pass filter (bottom) and thresholding (dark gray line). Spike times (black squares) were assigned to the peaks of suprathreshold segments. c Spike rasters from a cell-attached recording of single-unit responses to 25 repetitions of the same tone consisted of exactly one well-timed spike per trial (latency standard deviation = 1.0 msec), unlike the multi-unit responses (Fig. 1a). Under the Poisson assumption, this would have been highly unlikely (P ~ 10 -11). d The same neuron as in Fig. 1c responds with lower probability to repeated presentations of a different tone, but there are still no multi-spike responses. e We quantified response variability for each tone by dividing the variance in spike count by the mean spike count across all trials for that tone. Response variability for multi-unit tungsten recording (open triangles) was high for each of the 29 tones (out of 32) that elicited at least one spike on one trial. All but one point lie above one (horizontal gray line), which is the value produced by a Poisson process with any constant or time varying event rate. Single unit responses recorded in cell-attached mode were far less variable (filled circles). Ninety one percent (10/11) of the tones that elicited at least one spike from this neuron produced no multi-spike responses in 25 trials; the corresponding points fall on the diagonal line between (0,1) and (1,0), which provides a strict lower bound on the variability for any response set with a mean between 0 and 1. No point lies above one. attached recording with a patch pipette [8, 9], in order to ensure single unit isolation (Fig. 1b). This recording mode minimizes both of the main sources of error in spike detection: failure to detect a spike in the unit under observation (false negatives), and contamination by spikes from nearby neurons (false positives). It also differs from conventional extracellular recording methods in its selection bias: With cell- attached recording neurons are selected solely on the basis of the experimenter’s ability to form a seal, rather than on the basis of neuronal activity and responsiveness to stimuli as in conventional methods. Surprisingly, single unit responses were far more orderly than suggested by the multi-unit recordings; responses typically consisted of either 0 or 1 spikes per trial, and not more (Fig. 1c-e). In the most dramatic examples, each presentation of the same tone pip elicited exactly one spike (Fig. 1c). In most cases, however, some presentations failed to elicit a spike (Fig. 1d). Although low-variability responses have recently been observed in the cortex [10, 11] and elsewhere [12, 13], the binary behavior described here has not previously been reported for cortical neurons. a 1.4 N = 3055 response sets b 1.2 1 Poisson 28 kHz - 100 msec 0.8 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 ry na bi Response variance/mean (spikes/trial) The majority of the neurons (59%) in our study for which statistical significance could be assessed (at the p<0.001 significance level; see Fig. 2, caption) showed noisy binary behavior—“binary” because neurons produced either 0 or 1 spikes, and “noisy” because some stimuli elicited both single spikes and failures. In a substantial fraction of neurons, however, the responses showed more variability. We found no correlation between neuronal variability and cortical layer (inferred from the depth of the recording electrode), cortical area (inside vs. outside of area A1) or depth of anesthesia. Moreover, the binary mode of spiking was not due to the brevity (25 msec) of the stimuli; responses that were binary for short tones were comparably binary when longer (100 msec) tones were used (Fig. 2b).

All points were jittered slightly so that overlying points could be seen in the figure. 2165 response sets contained no multi-spike responses; the corresponding points fell on the line from [0,1] to [1,0]. b The binary nature of single unit responses was insensitive to tone duration, even for frequencies that elicited the largest responses. Twenty additional spike rasters from the same neuron (and tone frequency) as in Fig. 1c contain no multi-spike responses whether in response to 100 msec tones (above) or 25 msec tones (below). Across the population, binary responses were as prevalent for 100 msec tones as for 25 msec tones (see Identification methods for group statistics). In many neurons, binary responses showed high temporal precision, with latencies sometimes exhibiting standard deviations as low as 1 msec (Fig. 3; see also Fig. 1c), comparable to previous observations in the auditory cortex [14], and only slightly more precise than in monkey visual area MT [5]. High temporal precision was positively correlated with high response probability (Fig. 3). a b N = (44 cells)x(32 tones) 14 N = 32 tones 12 30 Jitter (msec) Jitter (msec) 40 10 8 6 20 10 4 2 0 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 Mean response (spikes/trial) 1 0 0.4 0.8 1.2 1.6 Mean response (spikes/trial) 2 Figure 3: Trial-to-trial variability in latency of response to repeated presentations of the same tone decreased with increasing response probability. a Scatter plot of standard deviation of latency vs. mean response for 25 presentations each of 32 tones for a different neuron as in Figs. 1 and 2 (gray line is best linear fit). Rasters from 25 repeated presentations of a low response tone (upper left inset, which corresponds to left-most data point) display much more variable latencies than rasters from a high response tone (lower right inset; corresponds to right-most data point). b The negative correlation between latency variability and response size was present on average across the population of 44 neurons described in Identification methods for group statistics (linear fit, gray). The low trial-to-trial variability ruled out the possibility that the firing statistics could be accounted for by a simple rate-modulated Poisson process (Fig. 4a1,a2). In other systems, low variability has sometimes been modeled as a Poisson process followed by a post-spike refractory period [10, 12]. In our system, however, the range in latencies of evoked binary responses was often much greater than the refractory period, which could not have been longer than the 2 msec inter-spike intervals observed during epochs of spontaneous spiking, indicating that binary spiking did not result from any intrinsic property of the spike generating mechanism (Fig. 4a3). Moreover, a single stimulus-evoked spike could suppress subsequent spikes for as long as hundreds of milliseconds (e.g. Figs. 1d,4d), supporting the idea that binary spiking arises through a circuit-level, rather than a single-neuron, mechanism. Indeed, the fact that this suppression is observed even in the cortex of awake animals [15] suggests that binary spiking is not a special property of the anesthetized state. It seems surprising that binary spiking in the cortex has not previously been remarked upon. In the auditory cortex the explanation may be in part technical: Because firing rates in the auditory cortex tend to be low, multi-unit recording is often used to maximize the total amount of data collected. Moreover, our use of cell-attached recording minimizes the usual bias toward responsive or active neurons. Such explanations are not, however, likely to account for the failure to observe binary spiking in the visual cortex, where spike count statistics have been scrutinized more closely [3-7]. One possibility is that this reflects a fundamental difference between the auditory and visual systems.

(a1) Experimentally recorded responses. (a2) Using the smoothed post stimulus time histogram (PSTH; bottom) from the set of responses in Fig. 4a, we generated rasters under the assumption of Poisson firing. In this representative example, four double-spike responses (arrows at left) were produced in 25 trials. (a3) We then generated rasters assuming that the neuron fired according to a Poisson process subject to a hard refractory period of 2 msec. Even with a refractory period, this representative example includes one triple- and three double-spike responses. The minimum interspike-interval during spontaneous firing events was less than two msec for five of our neurons, so 2 msec is a conservative upper bound for the refractory period. b. Spontaneous activity is reduced following high-probability responses. The PSTH (top; 0.25 msec bins) of the combined responses from the 25% (8/32) of tones that elicited the largest responses from the same neuron as in Figs. 3a and 4a illustrates a preclusion of spontaneous and evoked activity for over 200 msec following stimulation. The PSTHs from progressively less responsive groups of tones show progressively less preclusion following stimulation. c Fewer noisy binary neurons need to be pooled to achieve the same “signal-to-noise ratio” (SNR; see ref. [24]) as a collection of Poisson neurons. The ratio of the number of Poisson to binary neurons required to achieve the same SNR is plotted against the mean number of spikes elicited per neuron following stimulation; here we have defined the SNR to be the ratio of the mean spike count to the standard deviation of the spike count. d Spike probability tuning curve for the same neuron as in Figs. 1c-e and 2b fit to a Gaussian in tone frequency. and one that we favor—is that the difference rests not in the sensory modality, but instead in the difference between the stimuli used. In this view, the binary responses may not be limited to the auditory cortex; neurons in visual and other sensory cortices might exhibit similar responses to the appropriate stimuli. For example, the tone pips we used might be the auditory analog of a brief flash of light, rather than the oriented moving edges or gratings usually used to probe the primary visual cortex. Conversely, auditory stimuli analogous to edges or gratings [16, 17] may be more likely to elicit conventional, rate-modulated Poisson responses in the auditory cortex. Indeed, there may be a continuum between binary and Poisson modes. Thus, even in conventional rate-modulated responses, the first spike is often privileged in that it carries most of the information in the spike train [5, 14, 18]. The first spike may be particularly important as a means of rapidly signaling stimulus transients. Binary responses suggest a mode that complements conventional rate coding. In the simplest rate-coding model, a stimulus parameter (such as the frequency of a tone) governs only the rate at which a neuron generates spikes, but not the detailed positions of the spikes; the actual spike train itself is an instantiation of a random process (such as a Poisson process). By contrast, in the binomial model, the stimulus parameter (frequency) is encoded as the probability of firing (Fig. 4d). Binary coding has implications for cortical computation. In the rate coding model, stimulus encoding is “ergodic”: a stimulus parameter can be read out either by observing the activity of one neuron for a long time, or a population for a short time. By contrast, in the binary model the stimulus value can be decoded only by observing a neuronal population, so that there is no benefit to integrating over long time periods (cf. ref. [19]). One advantage of binary encoding is that it allows the population to signal quickly; the most compact message a neuron can send is one spike [20]. Binary coding is also more efficient in the context of population coding, as quantified by the signal-to-noise ratio (Fig. 4c). The precise organization of both spike number and time we have observed suggests that cortical activity consists, at least under some conditions, of packets of spikes synchronized across populations of neurons. Theoretical work [21-23] has shown how such packets can propagate stably from one population to the next, but only if neurons within each population fire at most one spike per packet; otherwise, the number of spikes per packet—and hence the width of each packet—grows at each propagation step. Interestingly, one prediction of stable propagation models is that spike probability should be related to timing precision, a prediction born out by our observations (Fig. 3). The role of these packets in computation remains an open question. 2 Identification methods for group statistics We recorded responses to 32 different 25 msec tones from each of 175 neurons from the auditory cortices of 16 Sprague-Dawley rats; each tone was repeated between 5 and 75 times (mean = 19). Thus our ensemble consisted of 32x175=5600 response sets, with between 5 and 75 samples in each set. Of these, 3055 response sets contained at least one spike on at least on trial. For each response set, we tested the hypothesis that the observed variability was significantly lower than expected from the null hypothesis of a Poisson process. The ability to assess significance depended on two parameters: the sample size (5-75) and the firing probability. Intuitively, the dependence on firing probability arises because at low firing rates most responses produce only trials with 0 or 1 spikes under both the Poisson and binary models; only at high firing rates do the two models make different predictions, since in that case the Poisson model includes many trials with 2 or even 3 spikes while the binary model generates only solitary spikes (see Fig. 4a1,a2). Using a stringent significance criterion of p<0.001, 467 response sets had a sufficient number of repeats to assess significance, given the observed firing probability. Of these, half (242/467=52%) were significantly less variable than expected by chance, five hundred-fold higher than the 467/1000=0.467 response sets expected, based on the 0.001 significance criterion, to yield a binary response set. Seventy-two neurons had at least one response set for which significance could be assessed, and of these, 49 neurons (49/72=68%) had at least one significantly sub-Poisson response set. Of this population of 49 neurons, five achieved low variability through repeatable bursty behavior (e.g., every spike count was either 0 or 3, but not 1 or 2) and were excluded from further analysis. The remaining 44 neurons formed the basis for the group statistics analyses shown in Figs. 2a and 3b. Nine of these neurons were subjected to an additional protocol consisting of at least 10 presentations each of 100 msec tones and 25 msec tones of all 32 frequencies. Of the 100 msec stimulation response sets, 44 were found to be significantly sub-Poisson at the p<0.05 level, in good agreement with the 43 found to be significant among the responses to 25 msec tones. 3 Bibliography 1.

<p>Author: Michael Eisele, Kenneth D. Miller</p><p>Abstract: Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes. We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole ﬁring episodes, and depends only on when these episodes start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to deﬁne what “ﬁring episodes” are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring episodes as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in superﬁcial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).</p><p>6 0.59993142 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Digital_Antennal_Lobe_for_Pattern_Equalization%3A_Analysis_and_Design.html">5 nips-2002-A Digital Antennal Lobe for Pattern Equalization: Analysis and Design</a></p>

<p>Author: Arunava Banerjee, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: If the cortex uses spike timing to compute, the timing of the spikes must be robust to perturbations. Based on a recent framework that provides a simple criterion to determine whether a spike sequence produced by a generic network is sensitive to initial conditions, and numerical simulations of a variety of network architectures, we argue within the limits set by our model of the neuron, that it is unlikely that precise sequences of spike timings are used for computation under conditions typically found in the cortex.</p><p>2 0.74363863 <a title="76-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Coulomb_Classifiers%3A_Generalizing_Support_Vector_Machines_via_an_Analogy_to_Electrostatic_Systems.html">62 nips-2002-Coulomb Classifiers: Generalizing Support Vector Machines via an Analogy to Electrostatic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael C. Mozer, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of classiﬁers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classiﬁers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the ν–SVM and the C–SVM. In the electrostatics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classiﬁcation function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algorithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-deﬁnite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classiﬁer in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and perform simulation studies to show that they are comparable or superior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classiﬁcation tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise proximities, where a Coulomb Classiﬁer outperformed standard SVMs. 1</p><p>3 0.73998469 <a title="76-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks_with_Deterministic_Latent_Tables.html">73 nips-2002-Dynamic Bayesian Networks with Deterministic Latent Tables</a></p>
<p>Author: David Barber</p><p>Abstract: The application of latent/hidden variable Dynamic Bayesian Networks is constrained by the complexity of marginalising over latent variables. For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaussian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisation has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly complex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables. This approach enables the consideration of highly complex latent dynamics whilst retaining the beneﬁts of a tractable probabilistic model. 1</p><p>4 0.71396136 <a title="76-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Reconstructing_Stimulus-Driven_Neural_Networks_from_Spike_Times.html">171 nips-2002-Reconstructing Stimulus-Driven Neural Networks from Spike Times</a></p>
<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>5 0.68625712 <a title="76-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Digital_Antennal_Lobe_for_Pattern_Equalization%3A_Analysis_and_Design.html">5 nips-2002-A Digital Antennal Lobe for Pattern Equalization: Analysis and Design</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex Holub, Gilles Laurent, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Re-mapping patterns in order to equalize their distribution may greatly simplify both the structure and the training of classifiers. Here, the properties of one such map obtained by running a few steps of discrete-time dynamical system are explored. The system is called 'Digital Antennal Lobe' (DAL) because it is inspired by recent studies of the antennallobe, a structure in the olfactory system of the grasshopper. The pattern-spreading properties of the DAL as well as its average behavior as a function of its (few) design parameters are analyzed by extending previous results of Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky. Furthermore, a technique for adapting the parameters of the initial design in order to obtain opportune noise-rejection behavior is suggested. Our results are demonstrated with a number of simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.67453444 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Charting_a_Manifold.html">49 nips-2002-Charting a Manifold</a></p>

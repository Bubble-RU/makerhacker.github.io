<p>Author: Rong Jin, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically. We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label. In contrast, naIve methods degrade rapidly as more ambiguity is introduced into the labels. 1</p><p>3 0.14909936 <a title="114-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We present a class of algorithms for learning the structure of graphical models from data. The algorithms are based on a measure known as the kernel generalized variance (KGV), which essentially allows us to treat all variables on an equal footing as Gaussians in a feature space obtained from Mercer kernels. Thus we are able to learn hybrid graphs involving discrete and continuous variables of arbitrary type. We explore the computational properties of our approach, showing how to use the kernel trick to compute the relevant statistics in linear time. We illustrate our framework with experiments involving discrete and continuous data.</p><p>6 0.10552824 <a title="114-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Densities_from_Maximum_Contrast_Estimation.html">68 nips-2002-Discriminative Densities from Maximum Contrast Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Stuart Andrews, Ioannis Tsochantaridis, Thomas Hofmann</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents two new formulations of multiple-instance learning as a maximum margin problem. The proposed extensions of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) learning approach lead to mixed integer quadratic programs that can be solved heuristically. Our generalization of SVMs makes a state-of-the-art classification technique, including non-linear classification via kernels, available to an area that up to now has been largely dominated by special purpose methods. We present experimental results on a pharmaceutical data set and on applications in automated image indexing and document categorization. 1</p><p>4 0.51019418 <a title="114-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Dirichlet_Prior_and_Bayesian_Regularization.html">157 nips-2002-On the Dirichlet Prior and Bayesian Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Meinicke, Thorsten Twellmann, Helge Ritter</p><p>Abstract: We propose a framework for classiﬁer design based on discriminative densities for representation of the differences of the class-conditional distributions in a way that is optimal for classiﬁcation. The densities are selected from a parametrized set by constrained maximization of some objective function which measures the average (bounded) difference, i.e. the contrast between discriminative densities. We show that maximization of the contrast is equivalent to minimization of an approximation of the Bayes risk. Therefore using suitable classes of probability density functions, the resulting maximum contrast classiﬁers (MCCs) can approximate the Bayes rule for the general multiclass case. In particular for a certain parametrization of the density functions we obtain MCCs which have the same functional form as the well-known Support Vector Machines (SVMs). We show that MCC-training in general requires some nonlinear optimization but under certain conditions the problem is concave and can be tackled by a single linear program. We indicate the close relation between SVM- and MCC-training and in particular we show that Linear Programming Machines can be viewed as an approximate realization of MCCs. In the experiments on benchmark data sets, the MCC shows a competitive classiﬁcation performance.</p><p>6 0.46909058 <a title="114-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Independent_Components_Analysis_through_Product_Density_Estimation.html">111 nips-2002-Independent Components Analysis through Product Density Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: William T. Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The goal of low-level vision is to estimate an underlying scene, given an observed image. Real-world scenes (eg, albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate and store. We propose a low-dimensional representation, called a scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to describe the complex scene conﬁgurations. Shape recipes are an example: these are the regression coefﬁcients that predict the bandpassed shape from image data. We describe the beneﬁts of this representation, and show two uses illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution; (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting and materials and we use them for material segmentation.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78315622 <a title="114-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Information_Regularization_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">114 nips-2002-Information Regularization with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Finnegan Southey, Dale Schuurmans, Ali Ghodsi</p><p>Abstract: Greedy importance sampling is an unbiased estimation technique that reduces the variance of standard importance sampling by explicitly searching for modes in the estimation objective. Previous work has demonstrated the feasibility of implementing this method and proved that the technique is unbiased in both discrete and continuous domains. In this paper we present a reformulation of greedy importance sampling that eliminates the free parameters from the original estimator, and introduces a new regularization strategy that further reduces variance without compromising unbiasedness. The resulting estimator is shown to be effective for difﬁcult estimation problems arising in Markov random ﬁeld inference. In particular, improvements are achieved over standard MCMC estimators when the distribution has multiple peaked modes.</p><p>4 0.66546625 <a title="114-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Fractional_Belief_Propagation.html">94 nips-2002-Fractional Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Wim Wiegerinck, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-ﬁeld free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.</p><p>5 0.65951073 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-VIBES%3A_A_Variational_Inference_Engine_for_Bayesian_Networks.html">204 nips-2002-VIBES: A Variational Inference Engine for Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher M. Bishop, David Spiegelhalter, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of probabilistic models. For each new application, however, it is currently necessary ﬁrst to derive the variational update equations, and then to implement them in application-speciﬁc code. Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. In this paper we describe a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for Bayesian Networks’) which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are speciﬁed either through a simple script or via a graphical interface analogous to a drawing package. VIBES then automatically generates and solves the variational equations. We illustrate the power and ﬂexibility of VIBES using examples from Bayesian mixture modelling. 1</p><p>6 0.65713888 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Dirichlet_Prior_and_Bayesian_Regularization.html">157 nips-2002-On the Dirichlet Prior and Bayesian Regularization</a></p>

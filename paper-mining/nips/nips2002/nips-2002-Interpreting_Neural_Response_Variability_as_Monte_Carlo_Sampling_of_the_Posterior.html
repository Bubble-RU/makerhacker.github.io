<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>3 0.35213777 <a title="116-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Spectro-Temporal_Receptive_Fields_of_Subthreshold_Responses_in_Auditory_Cortex.html">184 nips-2002-Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields of Subthreshold Responses in Auditory Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian K. Machens, Michael Wehr, Anthony M. Zador</p><p>Abstract: How do cortical neurons represent the acoustic environment? This question is often addressed by probing with simple stimuli such as clicks or tone pips. Such stimuli have the advantage of yielding easily interpreted answers, but have the disadvantage that they may fail to uncover complex or higher-order neuronal response properties. Here we adopt an alternative approach, probing neuronal responses with complex acoustic stimuli, including animal vocalizations and music. We have used in vivo whole cell methods in the rat auditory cortex to record subthreshold membrane potential ﬂuctuations elicited by these stimuli. Whole cell recording reveals the total synaptic input to a neuron from all the other neurons in the circuit, instead of just its output—a sparse binary spike train—as in conventional single unit physiological recordings. Whole cell recording thus provides a much richer source of information about the neuron’s response. Many neurons responded robustly and reliably to the complex stimuli in our ensemble. Here we analyze the linear component—the spectrotemporal receptive ﬁeld (STRF)—of the transformation from the sound (as represented by its time-varying spectrogram) to the neuron’s membrane potential. We ﬁnd that the STRF has a rich dynamical structure, including excitatory regions positioned in general accord with the prediction of the simple tuning curve. We also ﬁnd that in many cases, much of the neuron’s response, although deterministically related to the stimulus, cannot be predicted by the linear component, indicating the presence of as-yet-uncharacterized nonlinear response properties.</p><p>4 0.3304798 <a title="116-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Morton-Style_Factorial_Coding_of_Color_in_Primary_Visual_Cortex.html">148 nips-2002-Morton-Style Factorial Coding of Color in Primary Visual Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Thomas Wachtler, Thomas D. Albright, Terrence Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help understand information integration and perceptual coding in the brain. We show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. We show evidence suggesting that the classical/non-classical receptive ﬁeld organization in the cortex effectively enforces the development of Morton-style factorial codes. This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual coding in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms. While methods like ICA (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997) develop independent codes, in Morton-style coding the goal is to make two or more external aspects of the world become independent when conditioning on internal representations. In this paper we introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help analyze information integration and perceptual organization in the brain. In the neurosciences factorial codes are often studied in the context of mean tuning curves. A tuning curve is called separable if it can be expressed as the product of terms selectively inﬂuenced by different stimulus dimensions. Separable tuning curves are taken as evidence of factorial coding mechanisms. In this paper we show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. Morton (1969) analyzed a wide variety of psychophysical experiments on word perception and showed that they could be explained using a model in which stimulus and context have separable effects on perception. More precisely, in Mortons’ model the joint effect of stimulus and context on a perceptual representation can be obtained by multiplying terms selectively controlled by stimulus and by context, i.e.,  £ © # #</p><p>5 0.30365005 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Maximally_Informative_Dimensions%3A_Analyzing_Neural_Responses_to_Natural_Signals.html">141 nips-2002-Maximally Informative Dimensions: Analyzing Neural Responses to Natural Signals</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data, in face of multiple conﬂicting structures, is inherent to modeling of complex data. Extracting structure in one random variable that is relevant for another variable has been principally addressed recently via the information bottleneck method [15]. However, such auxiliary variables often contain more information than is actually required due to structures that are irrelevant for the task. In many other cases it is in fact easier to specify what is irrelevant than what is, for the task at hand. Identifying the relevant structures, however, can thus be considerably improved by also minimizing the information about another, irrelevant, variable. In this paper we give a general formulation of this problem and derive its formal, as well as algorithmic, solution. Its operation is demonstrated in a synthetic example and in two real world problems in the context of text categorization and face images. While the original information bottleneck problem is related to rate distortion theory, with the distortion measure replaced by the relevant information, extracting relevant features while removing irrelevant ones is related to rate distortion with side information.</p><p>4 0.85320061 <a title="116-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Intrinsic_Images_from_a_Single_Image.html">173 nips-2002-Recovering Intrinsic Images from a Single Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Marshall F. Tappen, William T. Freeman, Edward H. Adelson</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that uses multiple cues to recover shading and reﬂectance intrinsic images from a single image. Using both color information and a classiﬁer trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, each image derivative is classiﬁed as being caused by shading or a change in the surface’s reﬂectance. Generalized Belief Propagation is then used to propagate information from areas where the correct classiﬁcation is clear to areas where it is ambiguous. We also show results on real images.</p><p>5 0.7648589 <a title="116-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>6 0.69343257 <a title="116-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Adaptation_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">18 nips-2002-Adaptation and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>

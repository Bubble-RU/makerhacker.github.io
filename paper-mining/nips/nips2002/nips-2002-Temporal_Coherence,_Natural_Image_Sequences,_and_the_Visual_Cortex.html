<p>Author: Alistair Bray, Dominique Martinez</p><p>Abstract: In Slow Feature Analysis (SFA [1]), it has been demonstrated that high-order invariant properties can be extracted by projecting inputs into a nonlinear space and computing the slowest changing features in this space; this has been proposed as a simple general model for learning nonlinear invariances in the visual system. However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features ([2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image. The notion of maximising an objective function based upon the temporal predictability of output has been progressively applied in modelling the development of invariances in the visual system. F6ldiak used it indirectly via a Hebbian trace rule for modelling the development of translation invariance in complex cells [4] (closely related to many other models [5,6,7]); this rule has been used to maximise invariance as one component of a hierarchical system for object and face recognition [8]. On the other hand, similar functions have been maximised directly in networks for extracting linear [2] and nonlinear [9, 1] visual invariances. Direct maximisation of such functions have recently been used to model complex cells [10] and as an alternative to maximising sparseness/independence in modelling simple cells [11]. Slow Feature Analysis [1] combines many of the best properties of these methods to provide a good general nonlinear model. That is, it uses an objective function that minimises the first-order temporal derivative of the outputs; it provides a closedform solution which maximises this function by projecting inputs into a nonlinear http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cortex/ space; it exploits sphering (or PCA-whitening) of the data to ensure that all outputs have unit variance and are uncorrelated. However, the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality in that the nonlinear feature space soon becomes very large as the input dimension grows, and yet this feature space must be represented explicitly in order for the essential sphering to occur. The alternative that we propose here is to use the objective function of Stone [2, 9], that maximises output variance over a long period whilst minimising variance over a shorter period; in the linear case, this can be implemented by a biologically plausible mixture of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on the same synapses [2]. In recent work, Stone has proposed a closed-form solution for maximising this function in the linear domain of blind source separation that does not involve data-sphering. This paper describes how this method can be kernelised.

<p>Author: Robert A. Jacobs, Melissa Dominguez</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that systems learning aspects of visual perception may beneﬁt from the use of suitably designed developmental progressions during training. Four models were trained to estimate motion velocities in sequences of visual images. Three of the models were “developmental models” in the sense that the nature of their input changed during the course of training. They received a relatively impoverished visual input early in training, and the quality of this input improved as training progressed. One model used a coarse-to-multiscale developmental progression (i.e. it received coarse-scale motion features early in training and ﬁner-scale features were added to its input as training progressed), another model used a ﬁne-to-multiscale progression, and the third model used a random progression. The ﬁnal model was nondevelopmental in the sense that the nature of its input remained the same throughout the training period. The simulation results show that the coarse-to-multiscale model performed best. Hypotheses are offered to account for this model’s superior performance. We conclude that suitably designed developmental sequences can be useful to systems learning to estimate motion velocities. The idea that visual development can aid visual learning is a viable hypothesis in need of further study.</p><p>4 0.28658396 <a title="193-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>5 0.22048555 <a title="193-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Learning_Variance_Components_of_Natural_Images.html">10 nips-2002-A Model for Learning Variance Components of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>6 0.18240158 <a title="193-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Spectro-Temporal_Receptive_Fields_of_Subthreshold_Responses_in_Auditory_Cortex.html">184 nips-2002-Spectro-Temporal Receptive Fields of Subthreshold Responses in Auditory Cortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Jarmo Hurri, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: We show that two important properties of the primary visual cortex emerge when the principle of temporal coherence is applied to natural image sequences. The properties are simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs, which emerge when we apply two different approaches to temporal coherence. In the ﬁrst approach we extract receptive ﬁelds whose outputs are as temporally coherent as possible. This approach yields simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds (oriented, localized, multiscale). Thus, temporal coherence is an alternative to sparse coding in modeling the emergence of simple cell receptive ﬁelds. The second approach is based on a two-layer statistical generative model of natural image sequences. In addition to modeling the temporal coherence of individual simple cells, this model includes inter-cell temporal dependencies. Estimation of this model from natural data yields both simple-cell-like receptive ﬁelds, and complex-cell-like pooling of simple cell outputs. In this completely unsupervised learning, both layers of the generative model are estimated simultaneously from scratch. This is a signiﬁcant improvement on earlier statistical models of early vision, where only one layer has been learned, and others have been ﬁxed a priori.</p><p>2 0.78104526 <a title="193-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Perceive_Transparency_from_the_Statistics_of_Natural_Scenes.html">133 nips-2002-Learning to Perceive Transparency from the Statistics of Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Anat Levin, Assaf Zomet, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Certain simple images are known to trigger a percept of transparency: the input image I is perceived as the sum of two images I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + I2 (x, y). This percept is puzzling. First, why do we choose the “more complicated” description with two images rather than the “simpler” explanation I(x, y) = I1 (x, y) + 0 ? Second, given the inﬁnite number of ways to express I as a sum of two images, how do we compute the “best” decomposition ? Here we suggest that transparency is the rational percept of a system that is adapted to the statistics of natural scenes. We present a probabilistic model of images based on the qualitative statistics of derivative ﬁlters and “corner detectors” in natural scenes and use this model to ﬁnd the most probable decomposition of a novel image. The optimization is performed using loopy belief propagation. We show that our model computes perceptually “correct” decompositions on synthetic images and discuss its application to real images. 1</p><p>3 0.66649139 <a title="193-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: We develop a systems theoretical treatment of a behavioural system that interacts with its environment in a closed loop situation such that its motor actions inﬂuence its sensor inputs. The simplest form of a feedback is a reﬂex. Reﬂexes occur always “too late”; i.e., only after a (unpleasant, painful, dangerous) reﬂex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This deﬁnes an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary reﬂex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algorithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feedforward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.</p><p>4 0.66608489 <a title="193-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Adaptation_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">18 nips-2002-Adaptation and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Maneesh Sahani, Gregoire Deback</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation is a ubiquitous neural and psychological phenomenon, with a wealth of instantiations and implications. Although a basic form of plasticity, it has, bar some notable exceptions, attracted computational theory of only one main variety. In this paper, we study adaptation from the perspective of factor analysis, a paradigmatic technique of unsupervised learning. We use factor analysis to re-interpret a standard view of adaptation, and apply our new model to some recent data on adaptation in the domain of face discrimination.</p><p>5 0.66458768 <a title="193-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Kernel-Based_Extraction_of_Slow_Features%3A_Complex_Cells_Learn_Disparity_and_Translation_Invariance_from_Natural_Images.html">118 nips-2002-Kernel-Based Extraction of Slow Features: Complex Cells Learn Disparity and Translation Invariance from Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Alistair Bray, Dominique Martinez</p><p>Abstract: In Slow Feature Analysis (SFA [1]), it has been demonstrated that high-order invariant properties can be extracted by projecting inputs into a nonlinear space and computing the slowest changing features in this space; this has been proposed as a simple general model for learning nonlinear invariances in the visual system. However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features ([2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image. The notion of maximising an objective function based upon the temporal predictability of output has been progressively applied in modelling the development of invariances in the visual system. F6ldiak used it indirectly via a Hebbian trace rule for modelling the development of translation invariance in complex cells [4] (closely related to many other models [5,6,7]); this rule has been used to maximise invariance as one component of a hierarchical system for object and face recognition [8]. On the other hand, similar functions have been maximised directly in networks for extracting linear [2] and nonlinear [9, 1] visual invariances. Direct maximisation of such functions have recently been used to model complex cells [10] and as an alternative to maximising sparseness/independence in modelling simple cells [11]. Slow Feature Analysis [1] combines many of the best properties of these methods to provide a good general nonlinear model. That is, it uses an objective function that minimises the first-order temporal derivative of the outputs; it provides a closedform solution which maximises this function by projecting inputs into a nonlinear http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cortex/ space; it exploits sphering (or PCA-whitening) of the data to ensure that all outputs have unit variance and are uncorrelated. However, the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality in that the nonlinear feature space soon becomes very large as the input dimension grows, and yet this feature space must be represented explicitly in order for the essential sphering to occur. The alternative that we propose here is to use the objective function of Stone [2, 9], that maximises output variance over a long period whilst minimising variance over a shorter period; in the linear case, this can be implemented by a biologically plausible mixture of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on the same synapses [2]. In recent work, Stone has proposed a closed-form solution for maximising this function in the linear domain of blind source separation that does not involve data-sphering. This paper describes how this method can be kernelised.

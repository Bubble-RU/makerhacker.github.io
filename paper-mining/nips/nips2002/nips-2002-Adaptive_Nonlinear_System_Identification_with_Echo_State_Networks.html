<p>Author: Alistair Bray, Dominique Martinez</p><p>Abstract: In Slow Feature Analysis (SFA [1]), it has been demonstrated that high-order invariant properties can be extracted by projecting inputs into a nonlinear space and computing the slowest changing features in this space; this has been proposed as a simple general model for learning nonlinear invariances in the visual system. However, this method is highly constrained by the curse of dimensionality which limits it to simple theoretical simulations. This paper demonstrates that by using a different but closely-related objective function for extracting slowly varying features ([2, 3]), and then exploiting the kernel trick, this curse can be avoided. Using this new method we show that both the complex cell properties of translation invariance and disparity coding can be learnt simultaneously from natural images when complex cells are driven by simple cells also learnt from the image. The notion of maximising an objective function based upon the temporal predictability of output has been progressively applied in modelling the development of invariances in the visual system. F6ldiak used it indirectly via a Hebbian trace rule for modelling the development of translation invariance in complex cells [4] (closely related to many other models [5,6,7]); this rule has been used to maximise invariance as one component of a hierarchical system for object and face recognition [8]. On the other hand, similar functions have been maximised directly in networks for extracting linear [2] and nonlinear [9, 1] visual invariances. Direct maximisation of such functions have recently been used to model complex cells [10] and as an alternative to maximising sparseness/independence in modelling simple cells [11]. Slow Feature Analysis [1] combines many of the best properties of these methods to provide a good general nonlinear model. That is, it uses an objective function that minimises the first-order temporal derivative of the outputs; it provides a closedform solution which maximises this function by projecting inputs into a nonlinear http://www.loria.fr/equipes/cortex/ space; it exploits sphering (or PCA-whitening) of the data to ensure that all outputs have unit variance and are uncorrelated. However, the method suffers from the curse of dimensionality in that the nonlinear feature space soon becomes very large as the input dimension grows, and yet this feature space must be represented explicitly in order for the essential sphering to occur. The alternative that we propose here is to use the objective function of Stone [2, 9], that maximises output variance over a long period whilst minimising variance over a shorter period; in the linear case, this can be implemented by a biologically plausible mixture of Hebbian and anti-Hebbian learning on the same synapses [2]. In recent work, Stone has proposed a closed-form solution for maximising this function in the linear domain of blind source separation that does not involve data-sphering. This paper describes how this method can be kernelised.

<p>Author: David Barber</p><p>Abstract: The application of latent/hidden variable Dynamic Bayesian Networks is constrained by the complexity of marginalising over latent variables. For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaussian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisation has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly complex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables. This approach enables the consideration of highly complex latent dynamics whilst retaining the beneﬁts of a tractable probabilistic model. 1</p><p>4 0.050314028 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Classifying_Patterns_of_Visual_Motion_-_a_Neuromorphic_Approach.html">51 nips-2002-Classifying Patterns of Visual Motion - a Neuromorphic Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob Heinzle, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: We report a system that classiﬁes and can learn to classify patterns of visual motion on-line. The complete system is described by the dynamics of its physical network architectures. The combination of the following properties makes the system novel: Firstly, the front-end of the system consists of an aVLSI optical ﬂow chip that collectively computes 2-D global visual motion in real-time [1]. Secondly, the complexity of the classiﬁcation task is signiﬁcantly reduced by mapping the continuous motion trajectories to sequences of ’motion events’. And thirdly, all the network structures are simple and with the exception of the optical ﬂow chip based on a Winner-Take-All (WTA) architecture. We demonstrate the application of the proposed generic system for a contactless man-machine interface that allows to write letters by visual motion. Regarding the low complexity of the system, its robustness and the already existing front-end, a complete aVLSI system-on-chip implementation is realistic, allowing various applications in mobile electronic devices.</p><p>5 0.046879452 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Visual_Development_Aids_the_Acquisition_of_Motion_Velocity_Sensitivities.html">206 nips-2002-Visual Development Aids the Acquisition of Motion Velocity Sensitivities</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert A. Jacobs, Melissa Dominguez</p><p>Abstract: We consider the hypothesis that systems learning aspects of visual perception may beneﬁt from the use of suitably designed developmental progressions during training. Four models were trained to estimate motion velocities in sequences of visual images. Three of the models were “developmental models” in the sense that the nature of their input changed during the course of training. They received a relatively impoverished visual input early in training, and the quality of this input improved as training progressed. One model used a coarse-to-multiscale developmental progression (i.e. it received coarse-scale motion features early in training and ﬁner-scale features were added to its input as training progressed), another model used a ﬁne-to-multiscale progression, and the third model used a random progression. The ﬁnal model was nondevelopmental in the sense that the nature of its input remained the same throughout the training period. The simulation results show that the coarse-to-multiscale model performed best. Hypotheses are offered to account for this model’s superior performance. We conclude that suitably designed developmental sequences can be useful to systems learning to estimate motion velocities. The idea that visual development can aid visual learning is a viable hypothesis in need of further study.</p><p>6 0.046354719 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Kernel_Dependency_Estimation.html">119 nips-2002-Kernel Dependency Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Holub, Gilles Laurent, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Re-mapping patterns in order to equalize their distribution may greatly simplify both the structure and the training of classifiers. Here, the properties of one such map obtained by running a few steps of discrete-time dynamical system are explored. The system is called 'Digital Antennal Lobe' (DAL) because it is inspired by recent studies of the antennallobe, a structure in the olfactory system of the grasshopper. The pattern-spreading properties of the DAL as well as its average behavior as a function of its (few) design parameters are analyzed by extending previous results of Van Vreeswijk and Sompolinsky. Furthermore, a technique for adapting the parameters of the initial design in order to obtain opportune noise-rejection behavior is suggested. Our results are demonstrated with a number of simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.48141083 <a title="22-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Visual_Development_Aids_the_Acquisition_of_Motion_Velocity_Sensitivities.html">206 nips-2002-Visual Development Aids the Acquisition of Motion Velocity Sensitivities</a></p>

<p>Author: Cody Kwok, Dieter Fox, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: Particle ﬁlters estimate the state of dynamical systems from sensor information. In many real time applications of particle ﬁlters, however, sensor information arrives at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than the update rate of the ﬁlter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle ﬁlter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle ﬁlters, which make use of all sensor information even when the ﬁlter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by representing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a ﬁlter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources (samples) on valuable sensor information. Experiments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.</p><p>5 0.37239122 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Binaural_Sound_Localization.html">67 nips-2002-Discriminative Binaural Sound Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ehud Ben-reuven, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Time difference of arrival (TDOA) is commonly used to estimate the azimuth of a source in a microphone array. The most common methods to estimate TDOA are based on ﬁnding extrema in generalized crosscorrelation waveforms. In this paper we apply microphone array techniques to a manikin head. By considering the entire cross-correlation waveform we achieve azimuth prediction accuracy that exceeds extrema locating methods. We do so by quantizing the azimuthal angle and treating the prediction problem as a multiclass categorization task. We demonstrate the merits of our approach by evaluating the various approaches on Sony’s AIBO robot.</p><p>6 0.37216288 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Digital_Antennal_Lobe_for_Pattern_Equalization%3A_Analysis_and_Design.html">5 nips-2002-A Digital Antennal Lobe for Pattern Equalization: Analysis and Design</a></p>

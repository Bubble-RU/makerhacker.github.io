<p>Author: David Barber</p><p>Abstract: The application of latent/hidden variable Dynamic Bayesian Networks is constrained by the complexity of marginalising over latent variables. For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaussian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisation has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly complex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables. This approach enables the consideration of highly complex latent dynamics whilst retaining the beneﬁts of a tractable probabilistic model. 1</p><p>5 0.10016281 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-An_Asynchronous_Hidden_Markov_Model_for_Audio-Visual_Speech_Recognition.html">25 nips-2002-An Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Gianluca Pollastri, Pierre Baldi, Alessandro Vullo, Paolo Frasconi</p><p>Abstract: We develop and test new machine learning methods for the prediction of topological representations of protein structures in the form of coarse- or ﬁne-grained contact or distance maps that are translation and rotation invariant. The methods are based on generalized input-output hidden Markov models (GIOHMMs) and generalized recursive neural networks (GRNNs). The methods are used to predict topology directly in the ﬁne-grained case and, in the coarsegrained case, indirectly by ﬁrst learning how to score candidate graphs and then using the scoring function to search the space of possible conﬁgurations. Computer simulations show that the predictors achieve state-of-the-art performance. 1 Introduction: Protein Topology Prediction Predicting the 3D structure of protein chains from the linear sequence of amino acids is a fundamental open problem in computational molecular biology [1]. Any approach to the problem must deal with the basic fact that protein structures are translation and rotation invariant. To address this invariance, we have proposed a machine learning approach to protein structure prediction [4] based on the prediction of topological representations of proteins, in the form of contact or distance maps. The contact or distance map is a 2D representation of neighborhood relationships consisting of an adjacency matrix at some distance cutoﬀ (typically in the range of 6 to 12 ˚), or a matrix of pairwise Euclidean distances. Fine-grained maps A are derived at the amino acid or even atomic level. Coarse maps are obtained by looking at secondary structure elements, such as helices, and the distance between their centers of gravity or, as in the simulations below, the minimal distances between their Cα atoms. Reasonable methods for reconstructing 3D coordinates from contact/distance maps have been developed in the NMR literature and elsewhere Oi B Hi F Hi Ii Figure 1: Bayesian network for bidirectional IOHMMs consisting of input units, output units, and both forward and backward Markov chains of hidden states. [14] using distance geometry and stochastic optimization techniques. Thus the main focus here is on the more diﬃcult task of contact map prediction. Various algorithms for the prediction of contact maps have been developed, in particular using feedforward neural networks [6]. The best contact map predictor in the literature and at the last CASP prediction experiment reports an average precision [True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)] of 21% for distant contacts, i.e. with a linear distance of 8 amino acid or more [6] for ﬁne-grained amino acid maps. While this result is encouraging and well above chance level by a factor greater than 6, it is still far from providing suﬃcient accuracy for reliable 3D structure prediction. A key issue in this area is the amount of noise that can be tolerated in a contact map prediction without compromising the 3D-reconstruction step. While systematic tests in this area have not yet been published, preliminary results appear to indicate that recovery of as little as half of the distant contacts may suﬃce for proper reconstruction, at least for proteins up to 150 amino acid long (Rita Casadio and Piero Fariselli, private communication and oral presentation during CASP4 [10]). It is important to realize that the input to a ﬁne-grained contact map predictor need not be conﬁned to the sequence of amino acids only, but may also include evolutionary information in the form of proﬁles derived by multiple alignment of homologue proteins, or structural feature information, such as secondary structure (alpha helices, beta strands, and coils), or solvent accessibility (surface/buried), derived by specialized predictors [12, 13]. In our approach, we use diﬀerent GIOHMM and GRNN strategies to predict both structural features and contact maps. 2 GIOHMM Architectures Loosely speaking, GIOHMMs are Bayesian networks with input, hidden, and output units that can be used to process complex data structures such as sequences, images, trees, chemical compounds and so forth, built on work in, for instance, [5, 3, 7, 2, 11]. In general, the connectivity of the graphs associated with the hidden units matches the structure of the data being processed. Often multiple copies of the same hidden graph, but with diﬀerent edge orientations, are used in the hidden layers to allow direct propagation of information in all relevant directions. Output Plane NE NW 4 Hidden Planes SW SE Input Plane Figure 2: 2D GIOHMM Bayesian network for processing two-dimensional objects such as contact maps, with nodes regularly arranged in one input plane, one output plane, and four hidden planes. In each hidden plane, nodes are arranged on a square lattice, and all edges are oriented towards the corresponding cardinal corner. Additional directed edges run vertically in column from the input plane to each hidden plane, and from each hidden plane to the output plane. To illustrate the general idea, a ﬁrst example of GIOHMM is provided by the bidirectional IOHMMs (Figure 1) introduced in [2] to process sequences and predict protein structural features, such as secondary structure. Unlike standard HMMs or IOHMMS used, for instance in speech recognition, this architecture is based on two hidden markov chains running in opposite directions to leverage the fact that biological sequences are spatial objects rather than temporal sequences. Bidirectional IOHMMs have been used to derive a suite of structural feature predictors [12, 13, 4] available through http://promoter.ics.uci.edu/BRNN-PRED/. These predictors have accuracy rates in the 75-80% range on a per amino acid basis. 2.1 Direct Prediction of Topology To predict contact maps, we use a 2D generalization of the previous 1D Bayesian network. The basic version of this architecture (Figures 2) contains 6 layers of units: input, output, and four hidden layers, one for each cardinal corner. Within each column indexed by i and j, connections run from the input to the four hidden units, and from the four hidden units to the output unit. In addition, the hidden units in each hidden layer are arranged on a square or triangular lattice, with all the edges oriented towards the corresponding cardinal corner. Thus the parameters of this two-dimensional GIOHMMs, in the square lattice case, are the conditional probability distributions:  NE NW SW SE  P (Oi |Ii,j , Hi,j , Hi,j , Hi,j , Hi,j, )   NE NE NE  P (Hi,j |Ii,j , Hi−1,j , Hi,j−1 )  N NW NW P (Hi,jW |Ii,j , Hi+1,j , Hi,j−1 )  SW SW SW  P (Hi,j |Ii,j , Hi+1,j , Hi,j+1 )    SE SE SE P (Hi,j |Ii,j , Hi−1,j , Hi,j+1 ) (1) In a contact map prediction at the amino acid level, for instance, the (i, j) output represents the probability of whether amino acids i and j are in contact or not. This prediction depends directly on the (i, j) input and the four-hidden units in the same column, associated with omni-directional contextual propagation in the hidden planes. In the simulations reported below, we use a more elaborated input consisting of a 20 × 20 probability matrix over amino acid pairs derived from a multiple alignment of the given protein sequence and its homologues, as well as the structural features of the corresponding amino acids, including their secondary structure classiﬁcation and their relative exposure to the solvent, derived from our corresponding predictors. It should be clear how GIOHMM ideas can be generalized to other data structures and problems in many ways. In the case of 3D data, for instance, a standard GIOHMM would have an input cube, an output cube, and up to 8 cubes of hidden units, one for each corner with connections inside each hidden cube oriented towards the corresponding corner. In the case of data with an underlying tree structure, the hidden layers would correspond to copies of the same tree with diﬀerent orientations and so forth. Thus a fundamental advantage of GIOHMMs is that they can process a wide range of data structures of variable sizes and dimensions. 2.2 Indirect Prediction of Topology Although GIOHMMs allow ﬂexible integration of contextual information over ranges that often exceed what can be achieved, for instance, with ﬁxed-input neural networks, the models described above still suﬀer from the fact that the connections remain local and therefore long-ranged propagation of information during learning remains diﬃcult. Introduction of large numbers of long-ranged connections is computationally intractable but in principle not necessary since the number of contacts in proteins is known to grow linearly with the length of the protein, and hence connectivity is inherently sparse. The diﬃculty of course is that the location of the long-ranged contacts is not known. To address this problem, we have developed also a complementary GIOHMM approach described in Figure 3 where a candidate graph structure is proposed in the hidden layers of the GIOHMM, with the two diﬀerent orientations naturally associated with a protein sequence. Thus the hidden graphs change with each protein. In principle the output ought to be a single unit (Figure 3b) which directly computes a global score for the candidate structure presented in the hidden layer. In order to cope with long-ranged dependencies, however, it is preferable to compute a set of local scores (Figure 3c), one for each vertex, and combine the local scores into a global score by averaging. More speciﬁcally, consider a true topology represented by the undirected contact graph G∗ = (V, E ∗ ), and a candidate undirected prediction graph G = (V, E). A global measure of how well E approximates E ∗ is provided by the informationretrieval F1 score deﬁned by the normalized edge-overlap F1 = 2|E ∩ E ∗ |/(|E| + |E ∗ |) = 2P R/(P + R), where P = |E ∩ E ∗ |/|E| is the precision (or speciﬁcity) and R = |E ∩ E ∗ |/|E ∗ | is the recall (or sensitivity) measure. Obviously, 0 ≤ F1 ≤ 1 and F1 = 1 if and only if E = E ∗ . The scoring function F1 has the property of being monotone in the sense that if |E| = |E | then F1 (E) < F1 (E ) if and only if |E ∩ E ∗ | < |E ∩ E ∗ |. Furthermore, if E = E ∪ {e} where e is an edge in E ∗ but not in E, then F1 (E ) > F1 (E). Monotonicity is important to guide the search in the space of possible topologies. It is easy to check that a simple search algorithm based on F1 takes on the order of O(|V |3 ) steps to ﬁnd E ∗ , basically by trying all possible edges one after the other. The problem then is to learn F1 , or rather a good approximation to F1 . To approximate F1 , we ﬁrst consider a similar local measure Fv by considering the O I(v) I(v) F B H (v) H (v) (a) I(v) F B H (v) H (v) (b) O(v) (c) Figure 3: Indirect prediction of contact maps. (a) target contact graph to be predicted. (b) GIOHMM with two hidden layers: the two hidden layers correspond to two copies of the same candidate graph oriented in opposite directions from one end of the protein to the other end. The single output O is the global score of how well the candidate graph approximates the true contact map. (c) Similar to (b) but with a local score O(v) at each vertex. The local scores can be averaged to produce a global score. In (b) and (c) I(v) represents the input for vertex v, and H F (v) and H B (v) are the corresponding hidden variables. ∗ ∗ set Ev of edges adjacent to vertex v and Fv = 2|Ev ∩ Ev |/(|Ev | + |Ev |) with the ¯ global average F = v Fv /|V |. If n and n∗ are the average degrees of G and G∗ , it can be shown that: F1 = 1 |V | v 2|Ev ∩ E ∗ | n + n∗ and 1 ¯ F = |V | v 2|Ev ∩ E ∗ | n + v + n∗ + ∗ v (2) where n + v (resp. n∗ + ∗ ) is the degree of v in G (resp. in G∗ ). In particular, if G v ¯ ¯ and G∗ are regular graphs, then F1 (E) = F (E) so that F is a good approximation to F1 . In the contact map regime where the number of contacts grows linearly with the length of the sequence, we should have in general |E| ≈ |E ∗ | ≈ (1 + α)|V | so that each node on average has n = n∗ = 2(1 + α) edges. The value of α depends of course on the neighborhood cutoﬀ. As in reinforcement learning, to learn the scoring function one is faced with the problem of generating good training sets in a high dimensional space, where the states are the topologies (graphs), and the policies are algorithms for adding a single edge to a given graph. In the simulations we adopt several diﬀerent strategies including static and dynamic generation. Within dynamic generation we use three exploration strategies: random exploration (successor graph chosen at random), pure exploitation (successor graph maximizes the current scoring function), and semi-uniform exploitation to ﬁnd a balance between exploration and exploitation [with probability (resp. 1 − ) we choose random exploration (resp. pure exploitation)]. 3 GRNN Architectures Inference and learning in the protein GIOHMMs we have described is computationally intensive due to the large number of undirected loops they contain. This problem can be addressed using a neural network reparameterization assuming that: (a) all the nodes in the graphs are associated with a deterministic vector (note that in the case of the output nodes this vector can represent a probability distribution so that the overall model remains probabilistic); (b) each vector is a deterministic function of its parents; (c) each function is parameterized using a neural network (or some other class of approximators); and (d) weight-sharing or stationarity is used between similar neural networks in the model. For example, in the 2D GIOHMM contact map predictor, we can use a total of 5 neural networks to recursively compute the four hidden states and the output in each column in the form:  NW NE SW SE  Oij = NO (Iij , Hi,j , Hi,j , Hi,j , Hi,j )   NE NE NE  Hi,j = NN E (Ii,j , Hi−1,j , Hi,j−1 )  N NW NW Hi,jW = NN W (Ii,j , Hi+1,j , Hi,j−1 )  SW SW SW  Hi,j = NSW (Ii,j , Hi+1,j , Hi,j+1 )    SE SE SE Hi,j = NSE (Ii,j , Hi−1,j , Hi,j+1 ) (3) N In the NE plane, for instance, the boundary conditions are set to Hij E = 0 for i = 0 N or j = 0. The activity vector associated with the hidden unit Hij E depends on the NE NE local input Iij , and the activity vectors of the units Hi−1,j and Hi,j−1 . Activity in NE plane can be propagated row by row, West to East, and from the ﬁrst row to the last (from South to North), or column by column South to North, and from the ﬁrst column to the last. These GRNN architectures can be trained by gradient descent by unfolding the structures in space, leveraging the acyclic nature of the underlying GIOHMMs. 4 Data Many data sets are available or can be constructed for training and testing purposes, as described in the references. The data sets used in the present simulations are extracted from the publicly available Protein Data Bank (PDB) and then redundancy reduced, or from the non-homologous subset of PDB Select (ftp://ftp.emblheidelberg.de/pub/databases/). In addition, we typically exclude structures with poor resolution (less than 2.5-3 ˚), sequences containing less than 30 amino acids, A and structures containing multiple sequences or sequences with chain breaks. For coarse contact maps, we use the DSSP program [9] (CMBI version) to assign secondary structures and we remove also sequences for which DSSP crashes. The results we report for ﬁne-grained contact maps are derived using 424 proteins with lengths in the 30-200 range for training and an additional non-homologous set of 48 proteins in the same length range for testing. For the coarse contact map, we use a set of 587 proteins of length less than 300. Because the average length of a secondary structure element is slightly above 7, the size of a coarse map is roughly 2% the size of the corresponding amino acid map. 5 Simulation Results and Conclusions We have trained several 2D GIOHMM/GRNN models on the direct prediction of ﬁne-grained contact maps. Training of a single model typically takes on the order of a week on a fast workstation. A sample of validation results is reported in Table 1 for four diﬀerent distance cutoﬀs. Overall percentages of correctly predicted contacts Table 1: Direct prediction of amino acid contact maps. Column 1: four distance cutoﬀs. Column 2, 3, and 4: overall percentages of amino acids correctly classiﬁed as contacts, non-contacts, and in total. Column 5: Precision percentage for distant contacts (|i − j| ≥ 8) with a threshold of 0.5. Single model results except for last line corresponding to an ensemble of 5 models.

The model has k = 14 hidden units in the hidden and output layers of the four hidden networks, as well as in the hidden layer of the output network. In the last row, we also report as an example the results obtained at 12˚ by an ensemble of 5 networks A with k = 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15. Note that precision for distant contacts exceeds all previously reported results and is well above 50%. For the prediction of coarse-grained contact maps, we use the indirect GIOHMM/GRNN strategy and compare diﬀerent exploration/exploitation strategies: random exploration, pure exploitation, and their convex combination (semiuniform exploitation). In the semi-uniform case we set the probability of random uniform exploration to = 0.4. In addition, we also try a fourth hybrid strategy in which the search proceeds greedily (i.e. the best successor is chosen at each step, as in pure exploitation), but the network is trained by randomly sub-sampling the successors of the current state. Eight numerical features encode the input label of each node: one-hot encoding of secondary structure classes; normalized linear distances from the N to C terminus; average, maximum and minimum hydrophobic character of the segment (based on the Kyte-Doolittle scale with a moving window of length 7). A sample of results obtained with 5-fold cross-validation is shown in Table 2. Hidden state vectors have dimension k = 5 with no hidden layers. For each strategy we measure performances by means of several indices: micro and macroaveraged precision (mP , M P ), recall (mR, M R) and F1 measure (mF1 , M F1 ). Micro-averages are derived based on each pair of secondary structure elements in each protein, whereas macro-averages are obtained on a per-protein basis, by ﬁrst computing precision and recall for each protein, and then averaging over the set of all proteins. In addition, we also measure the micro and macro averages for speciﬁcity in the sense of percentage of correct prediction for non-contacts (mP (nc), M P (nc)). Note the tradeoﬀs between precision and recall across the training methods, the hybrid method achieving the best F 1 results.

In principle both methods can be applied to both resolution levels, although the indirect prediction is computationally too demanding for ﬁne-grained prediction of large proteins. Several extensions are currently under development, including the integration of these methods into complete 3D structure predictors. While these systems require long training periods, once trained they can rapidly sift through large proteomic data sets.

<p>Author: David Barber</p><p>Abstract: The application of latent/hidden variable Dynamic Bayesian Networks is constrained by the complexity of marginalising over latent variables. For this reason either small latent dimensions or Gaussian latent conditional tables linearly dependent on past states are typically considered in order that inference is tractable. We suggest an alternative approach in which the latent variables are modelled using deterministic conditional probability tables. This specialisation has the advantage of tractable inference even for highly complex non-linear/non-Gaussian visible conditional probability tables. This approach enables the consideration of highly complex latent dynamics whilst retaining the beneﬁts of a tractable probabilistic model. 1</p><p>6 0.48952231 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-An_Asynchronous_Hidden_Markov_Model_for_Audio-Visual_Speech_Recognition.html">25 nips-2002-An Asynchronous Hidden Markov Model for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Richard M. Karp, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: We propose a dynamic Bayesian model for motifs in biopolymer sequences which captures rich biological prior knowledge and positional dependencies in motif structure in a principled way. Our model posits that the position-speciﬁc multinomial parameters for monomer distribution are distributed as a latent Dirichlet-mixture random variable, and the position-speciﬁc Dirichlet component is determined by a hidden Markov process. Model parameters can be ﬁt on training motifs using a variational EM algorithm within an empirical Bayesian framework. Variational inference is also used for detecting hidden motifs. Our model improves over previous models that ignore biological priors and positional dependence. It has much higher sensitivity to motifs during detection and a notable ability to distinguish genuine motifs from false recurring patterns.</p><p>2 0.58594763 <a title="7-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Dayan, Maneesh Sahani, Gregoire Deback</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation is a ubiquitous neural and psychological phenomenon, with a wealth of instantiations and implications. Although a basic form of plasticity, it has, bar some notable exceptions, attracted computational theory of only one main variety. In this paper, we study adaptation from the perspective of factor analysis, a paradigmatic technique of unsupervised learning. We use factor analysis to re-interpret a standard view of adaptation, and apply our new model to some recent data on adaptation in the domain of face discrimination.</p><p>4 0.58362627 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Neural_Decoding_of_Cursor_Motion_Using_a_Kalman_Filter.html">153 nips-2002-Neural Decoding of Cursor Motion Using a Kalman Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: W Wu, M. J. Black, Y. Gao, M. Serruya, A. Shaikhouni, J. P. Donoghue, Elie Bienenstock</p><p>Abstract: The direct neural control of external devices such as computer displays or prosthetic limbs requires the accurate decoding of neural activity representing continuous movement. We develop a real-time control system using the spiking activity of approximately 40 neurons recorded with an electrode array implanted in the arm area of primary motor cortex. In contrast to previous work, we develop a control-theoretic approach that explicitly models the motion of the hand and the probabilistic relationship between this motion and the mean ﬁring rates of the cells in 70 bins. We focus on a realistic cursor control task in which the subject must move a cursor to “hit” randomly placed targets on a computer monitor. Encoding and decoding of the neural data is achieved with a Kalman ﬁlter which has a number of advantages over previous linear ﬁltering techniques. In particular, the Kalman ﬁlter reconstructions of hand trajectories in off-line experiments are more accurate than previously reported results and the model provides insights into the nature of the neural coding of movement. ¨ ©§</p><p>5 0.58222759 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.58145845 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Maximally_Informative_Dimensions%3A_Analyzing_Neural_Responses_to_Natural_Signals.html">141 nips-2002-Maximally Informative Dimensions: Analyzing Neural Responses to Natural Signals</a></p>

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new algorithmic framework for learning multiclass categorization problems. In this framework a multiclass predictor is composed of a pair of embeddings that map both instances and labels into a common space. In this space each instance is assigned the label it is nearest to. We outline and analyze an algorithm, termed Bunching, for learning the pair of embeddings from labeled data. A key construction in the analysis of the algorithm is the notion of probabilistic output codes, a generalization of error correcting output codes (ECOC). Furthermore, the method of multiclass categorization using ECOC is shown to be an instance of Bunching. We demonstrate the advantage of Bunching over ECOC by comparing their performance on numerous categorization problems.</p><p>3 0.26489788 <a title="19-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Constraint_Classification_for_Multiclass_Classification_and_Ranking.html">59 nips-2002-Constraint Classification for Multiclass Classification and Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>5 0.21800821 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Conditional_Models_on_the_Ranking_Poset.html">58 nips-2002-Conditional Models on the Ranking Poset</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: A distance-based conditional model on the ranking poset is presented for use in classiﬁcation and ranking. The model is an extension of the Mallows model, and generalizes the classiﬁer combination methods used by several ensemble learning algorithms, including error correcting output codes, discrete AdaBoost, logistic regression and cranking. The algebraic structure of the ranking poset leads to a simple Bayesian interpretation of the conditional model and its special cases. In addition to a unifying view, the framework suggests a probabilistic interpretation for error correcting output codes and an extension beyond the binary coding scheme.</p><p>6 0.1786982 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Ranking_with_Large_Margin_Principle%3A_Two_Approaches.html">165 nips-2002-Ranking with Large Margin Principle: Two Approaches</a></p>

<p>Author: Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Given is a problem sequence and a probability distribution (the bias) on programs computing solution candidates. We present an optimally fast way of incrementally solving each task in the sequence. Bias shifts are computed by program preﬁxes that modify the distribution on their sufﬁxes by reusing successful code for previous tasks (stored in non-modiﬁable memory). No tested program gets more runtime than its probability times the total search time. In illustrative experiments, ours becomes the ﬁrst general system to learn a universal solver for arbitrary disk Towers of Hanoi tasks (minimal solution size ). It demonstrates the advantages of incremental learning by proﬁting from previously solved, simpler tasks involving samples of a simple context free language.   ¦ ¤ ¢ §¥£¡ 1 Brief Introduction to Optimal Universal Search Consider an asymptotically optimal method for tasks with quickly veriﬁable solutions: ¦ ¦  ©  £ £¨ © © ©  © ¦ ¦ ¦   Method 1.1 (L SEARCH ) View the -th binary string as a potential program for a universal Turing machine.

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi S. Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for computing provably exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subclass of problems on graphs with cycles. The basic idea is to represent the original problem on the graph with cycles as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. A convexity argument then guarantees that the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) is upper bounded by the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is met with equality if and only if the tree problems share an optimal conﬁguration in common. An important implication is that any such shared conﬁguration must also be the MAP conﬁguration for the original problem. Next we develop a tree-reweighted max-product algorithm for attempting to ﬁnd convex combinations of tree-structured problems that share a common optimum. We give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a ﬁxed point to yield the exact MAP estimate. An attractive feature of our analysis is that it generalizes naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.91638315 <a title="19-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Adapting_Codes_and_Embeddings_for_Polychotomies.html">19 nips-2002-Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies</a></p>

Rodriguez-vázquez</p><p>Abstract: A bio-inspired model for an analog programmable array processor (APAP), based on studies on the vertebrate retina, has permitted the realization of complex programmable spatio-temporal dynamics in VLSI. This model mimics the way in which images are processed in the visual pathway, rendering a feasible alternative for the implementation of early vision applications in standard technologies. A prototype chip has been designed and fabricated in a 0.5µm standard CMOS process. Computing power per area and power consumption is amongst the highest reported for a single chip. Design challenges, trade-oﬀs and some experimental results are presented in this paper. 1</p><p>4 0.90262622 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Transformation-Invariant_Factor_Analysis.html">87 nips-2002-Fast Transformation-Invariant Factor Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, Nebojsa Jojic, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to discover a linear mapping between high dimensional data samples and points in a lower dimensional subspace. In [6], Jojic and Frey introduced mixture of transformation-invariant component analyzers (MTCA) that can account for global transformations such as translations and rotations, perform clustering and learn local appearance deformations by dimensionality reduction. However, due to enormous computational requirements of the EM algorithm for learning the model, O( ) where is the dimensionality of a data sample, MTCA was not practical for most applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how fast Fourier transforms can reduce the computation to the order of log . With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of MTCA in various applications - tracking, video textures, clustering video sequences, object recognition, and object detection in images. ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤</p><p>5 0.9020099 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Kernels_for_String_and_Tree_Matching.html">85 nips-2002-Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching</a></p>

Furthermore, prediction cost in many cases can be reduced to linear cost in the length of the sequence to be classified, regardless of the number of support vectors. This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner.</p><p>6 0.88867551 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Multiclass_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Embeddings.html">149 nips-2002-Multiclass Learning by Probabilistic Embeddings</a></p>

Goldberg, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: Address-event representation (AER), originally proposed as a means to communicate sparse neural events between neuromorphic chips, has proven efﬁcient in implementing large-scale networks with arbitrary, conﬁgurable synaptic connectivity. In this work, we further extend the functionality of AER to implement arbitrary, conﬁgurable synaptic plasticity in the address domain. As proof of concept, we implement a biologically inspired form of spike timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) based on relative timing of events in an AER framework.

<p>Author: Michael Eisele, Kenneth D. Miller</p><p>Abstract: Cortical synaptic plasticity depends on the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes and also on the temporal pattern of presynaptic spikes and of postsynaptic spikes. We study the hypothesis that cortical synaptic plasticity does not associate individual spikes, but rather whole ﬁring episodes, and depends only on when these episodes start and how long they last, but as little as possible on the timing of individual spikes. Here we present the mathematical background for such a study. Standard methods from hidden Markov models are used to deﬁne what “ﬁring episodes” are. Estimating the probability of being in such an episode requires not only the knowledge of past spikes, but also of future spikes. We show how to construct a causal learning rule, which depends only on past spikes, but associates pre- and postsynaptic ﬁring episodes as if it also knew future spikes. We also show that this learning rule agrees with some features of synaptic plasticity in superﬁcial layers of rat visual cortex (Froemke and Dan, Nature 416:433, 2002).</p><p>5 0.26815131 <a title="180-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Neuromorphic_Bisable_VLSI_Synapses_with_Spike-Timing-Dependent_Plasticity.html">154 nips-2002-Neuromorphic Bisable VLSI Synapses with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: We present analog neuromorphic circuits for implementing bistable synapses with spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) properties. In these types of synapses, the short-term dynamics of the synaptic efﬁcacies are governed by the relative timing of the pre- and post-synaptic spikes, while on long time scales the efﬁcacies tend asymptotically to either a potentiated state or to a depressed one. We fabricated a prototype VLSI chip containing a network of integrate and ﬁre neurons interconnected via bistable STDP synapses.

<p>Author: David Barber</p><p>Abstract: We consider a statistical framework for learning in a class of networks of spiking neurons. Our aim is to show how optimal local learning rules can be readily derived once the neural dynamics and desired functionality of the neural assembly have been speciﬁed, in contrast to other models which assume (sub-optimal) learning rules. Within this framework we derive local rules for learning temporal sequences in a model of spiking neurons and demonstrate its superior performance to correlation (Hebbian) based approaches. We further show how to include mechanisms such as synaptic depression and outline how the framework is readily extensible to learning in networks of highly complex spiking neurons. A stochastic quantal vesicle release mechanism is considered and implications on the complexity of learning discussed. 1</p><p>6 0.65928727 <a title="180-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Hidden_Markov_Model_of_Cortical_Synaptic_Plasticity%3A_Derivation_of_the_Learning_Rule.html">102 nips-2002-Hidden Markov Model of Cortical Synaptic Plasticity: Derivation of the Learning Rule</a></p>

<p>Author: Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very diﬃcult to develop a uniﬁed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community. Here we suggest a formal perspective on the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a uniﬁcation, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-oﬀs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90201628 <a title="180-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Selectivity_and_Metaplasticity_in_a_Unified_Calcium-Dependent_Model.html">180 nips-2002-Selectivity and Metaplasticity in a Unified Calcium-Dependent Model</a></p>

We used the replica symmetry breaking technique with a toy model to demonstrate Shannon’s result. The rate distortion function, which is widely known as the theoretical limit of the compression with a ﬁdelity criterion, is derived. Numerical study shows that sparse constructions of the model provide suboptimal compressions. 1</p><p>5 0.66735762 <a title="180-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_About_Multiple_Objects_in_Images%3A_Factorial_Learning_without_Factorial_Search.html">122 nips-2002-Learning About Multiple Objects in Images: Factorial Learning without Factorial Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>6 0.51941025 <a title="180-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Analysis_of_Information_in_Speech_Based_on_MANOVA.html">29 nips-2002-Analysis of Information in Speech Based on MANOVA</a></p>

</p><p>50 3 Simulations FitzHugh-Nagumo models are known to have so-called class II neural excitability (see [21] for a review). [sent-82, score-0.054]
</p><p>51 This class is characterized by an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation for increasing excitation, and exhibits some dynamical phenomena that are not present in integrate-andﬁre dynamics. [sent-83, score-0.186]
</p><p>52 For equal intensity input pulses, integrators will respond maximally to the pulse train with lowest inter-spike interval. [sent-84, score-0.371]
</p><p>53 Class II neurons have resonant response to a range of input frequencies. [sent-85, score-0.182]
</p><p>54 There are non-trivial forms of excitation in resonator models that are not matched by integrators: the former can produce a spike at the end of an inhibitory pulse, and conversely, can have a limit cycle condition interrupted (with the system recovering to rest) by an excitatory pulse. [sent-86, score-0.265]
</p><p>55 We have veriﬁed that these characteristics are maintained in the modiﬁed optical model, despite the use of a sinusoidal nonlinearity instead of the original degree polynomial function. [sent-87, score-0.569]
</p><p>56 Stability analysis based on the Jacobian of the dynamical system (Equation 4) shows an Andronov-Hopf bifurcation, as in the original model. [sent-88, score-0.13]

</p><p>62 The decrease in driver voltage observed as the recovery variable increases produces initially an increase in detected power, and thus the second, broader peak at the end of the cycle. [sent-131, score-0.568]
</p><p>63 The production of sustained oscillations for constant input is one of the desired characteristics of the model, but in a network, neurons will mostly communicate through their pulsed output. [sent-132, score-0.199]

</p><p>69 The most elegant optical implementation of adaptive interconnection is through dynamic volume holography[6, 11], but that requires a set of coherent optical signals, not what we have with an array of pulse emitters. [sent-146, score-1.404]
</p><p>70 In contrast, the matrix-vector multiplier architecture allows parallel interconnection of incoherent optical signals, and has been used to demonstrate implementations of the Hopﬁeld model [7] and Boltzman machines [9]. [sent-147, score-0.619]
</p><p>71 An interesting aspect of the coupled dynamics in oscillators exhibiting class II excitability is that the timing of an input pulse can result in advance or retardation of the next spike [22]. [sent-148, score-0.752]
</p><p>72 This is potentially relevant for hardware implementation, as the excitatory (i. [sent-149, score-0.076]

</p><p>75 A constant input to a model neuron (Equation 4) was maintained, producing periodic spiking. [sent-153, score-0.163]

</p><p>77 A region of output spike retardation ( excitatory pulsed input can be seen. [sent-155, score-0.412]
</p><p>78 Even more interesting, for phases around rad relative to the latest spike, the excitatory pulse can terminate periodic spiking altogether. [sent-156, score-0.583]
</p><p>79 For this particular condition, the equilibrium point of the system is stable. [sent-158, score-0.069]
</p><p>80 When correctly timed, the short excitatory pulse forces the system out of its limit cycle, into the basin of attraction of the stable equilibrium, hence stopping the periodic spiking. [sent-159, score-0.404]
</p><p>81 As the individual models used in this simulations were shown to match experimental implementations in Section 4, we expect to observe the same kind of effect in the coupling of the optoelectronic oscillators. [sent-160, score-0.417]

</p><p>87 Feedback circuit simpliﬁcation is another important aspect, since we are interested in implementing large arrays of spiking neurons. [sent-200, score-0.149]

<p>Author: Jakob Heinzle, Alan Stocker</p><p>Abstract: We report a system that classiﬁes and can learn to classify patterns of visual motion on-line. The complete system is described by the dynamics of its physical network architectures. The combination of the following properties makes the system novel: Firstly, the front-end of the system consists of an aVLSI optical ﬂow chip that collectively computes 2-D global visual motion in real-time [1]. Secondly, the complexity of the classiﬁcation task is signiﬁcantly reduced by mapping the continuous motion trajectories to sequences of ’motion events’. And thirdly, all the network structures are simple and with the exception of the optical ﬂow chip based on a Winner-Take-All (WTA) architecture. We demonstrate the application of the proposed generic system for a contactless man-machine interface that allows to write letters by visual motion.

Based on a recent framework that provides a simple criterion to determine whether a spike sequence produced by a generic network is sensitive to initial conditions, and numerical simulations of a variety of network architectures, we argue within the limits set by our model of the neuron, that it is unlikely that precise sequences of spike timings are used for computation under conditions typically found in the cortex.</p><p>4 0.11008598 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Circuit_Model_of_Short-Term_Synaptic_Dynamics.html">50 nips-2002-Circuit Model of Short-Term Synaptic Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Shih-Chii Liu, Malte Boegershausen, Pascal Suter</p><p>Abstract: We describe a model of short-term synaptic depression that is derived from a silicon circuit implementation. The dynamics of this circuit model are similar to the dynamics of some present theoretical models of shortterm depression except that the recovery dynamics of the variable describing the depression is nonlinear and it also depends on the presynaptic frequency. The equations describing the steady-state and transient responses of this synaptic model ﬁt the experimental results obtained from a fabricated silicon network consisting of leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neurons and different types of synapses.

<p>Author: Duane Q. Nykamp</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to distinguish direct connections between two neurons from common input originating from other, unmeasured neurons. The distinction is computed from the spike times of the two neurons in response to a white noise stimulus. Although the method is based on a highly idealized linear-nonlinear approximation of neural response, we demonstrate via simulation that the approach can work with a more realistic, integrate-and-ﬁre neuron model. We propose that the approach exempliﬁed by this analysis may yield viable tools for reconstructing stimulus-driven neural networks from data gathered in neurophysiology experiments.</p><p>6 0.099106841 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Neuromorphic_Bisable_VLSI_Synapses_with_Spike-Timing-Dependent_Plasticity.html">154 nips-2002-Neuromorphic Bisable VLSI Synapses with Spike-Timing-Dependent Plasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Mikio L. Braun, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Model selection is linked to model assessment, which is the problem of comparing different models, or model parameters, for a speciﬁc learning task. For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>3 0.4301737 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael C. Mozer, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of classiﬁers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classiﬁers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the ν–SVM and the C–SVM. In the electrostatics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classiﬁcation function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algorithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-deﬁnite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classiﬁer in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and perform simulation studies to show that they are comparable or superior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classiﬁcation tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise proximities, where a Coulomb Classiﬁer outperformed standard SVMs. 1</p><p>6 0.42499912 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Dynamical_Constraints_on_Computing_with_Spike_Timing_in_the_Cortex.html">76 nips-2002-Dynamical Constraints on Computing with Spike Timing in the Cortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very diﬃcult to develop a uniﬁed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community. Here we suggest a formal perspective on the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a uniﬁcation, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-oﬀs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median. 1</p><p>3 0.14871749 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Theory-Based_Causal_Inference.html">198 nips-2002-Theory-Based Causal Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: People routinely make sophisticated causal inferences unconsciously, effortlessly, and from very little data – often from just one or a few observations. We argue that these inferences can be explained as Bayesian computations over a hypothesis space of causal graphical models, shaped by strong top-down prior knowledge in the form of intuitive theories. We present two case studies of our approach, including quantitative models of human causal judgments and brief comparisons with traditional bottom-up models of inference.</p><p>4 0.14239927 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Categorization_Under_Complexity%3A_A_Unified_MDL_Account_of_Human_Learning_of_Regular_and_Irregular_Categories.html">48 nips-2002-Categorization Under Complexity: A Unified MDL Account of Human Learning of Regular and Irregular Categories</a></p>
<p>Author: David Fass, Jacob Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We present an account of human concept learning-that is, learning of categories from examples-based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL). In support of this theory, we tested a wide range of two-dimensional concept types, including both regular (simple) and highly irregular (complex) structures, and found the MDL theory to give a good account of subjects' performance. This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description -length) systematically influences its leamability. 1- The Structure of Categories A number of different principles have been advanced to explain the manner in which humans learn to categorize objects. It has been variously suggested that the underlying principle might be the similarity structure of objects [1], the manipulability of decision bound~ aries [2], or Bayesian inference [3][4]. While many of these theories are mathematically well-grounded and have been successful in explaining a range of experimental findings, they have commonly only been tested on a narrow collection of concept types similar to the simple unimodal categories of Figure 1(a-e).

All except (e) are unimodal. ~http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~jacob/feldman.html Moreover, in the scarce research that has ventured to look beyond simple category types, the goal has largely been to investigate categorization performance for isolated irregular distributions, rather than to present a survey of performance across a range of interesting distributions.

<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Mikio L. Braun, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Model selection is linked to model assessment, which is the problem of comparing different models, or model parameters, for a speciﬁc learning task. For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>6 0.110525 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew G. Snover, Michael R. Brent</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system for the unsupervised learning of morphological sufﬁxes and stems from word lists. The system is composed of a generative probability model and hill-climbing and directed search algorithms. By extracting and examining morphologically rich subsets of an input lexicon, the directed search identiﬁes highly productive paradigms. The hill-climbing algorithm then further maximizes the probability of the hypothesis. Quantitative results are shown by measuring the accuracy of the morphological relations identiﬁed. Experiments in English and Polish, as well as comparisons with another recent unsupervised morphology learning algorithm demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique.</p><p>5 0.51530612 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Dynamical_Causal_Learning.html">75 nips-2002-Dynamical Causal Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian W. Eurich</p><p>Abstract: A framework is introduced for assessing the encoding accuracy and the discriminational ability of a population of neurons upon simultaneous presentation of multiple stimuli. Minimal square estimation errors are obtained from a Fisher information analysis in an abstract compound space comprising the features of all stimuli. Even for the simplest case of linear superposition of responses and Gaussian tuning, the symmetries in the compound space are very diﬀerent from those in the case of a single stimulus. The analysis allows for a quantitative description of attentional eﬀects and can be extended to include neural nonlinearities such as nonclassical receptive ﬁelds. 1</p><p>3 0.63717276 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Information_Regularization_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">114 nips-2002-Information Regularization with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation with partially labeled data requires using a large number of unlabeled examples (or an estimated marginal P (x)), to further constrain the conditional P (y|x) beyond a few available labeled examples. We formulate a regularization approach to linking the marginal and the conditional in a general way. The regularization penalty measures the information that is implied about the labels over covering regions. No parametric assumptions are required and the approach remains tractable even for continuous marginal densities P (x). We develop algorithms for solving the regularization problem for ﬁnite covers, establish a limiting differential equation, and exemplify the behavior of the new regularization approach in simple cases.</p><p>4 0.63324255 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-VIBES%3A_A_Variational_Inference_Engine_for_Bayesian_Networks.html">204 nips-2002-VIBES: A Variational Inference Engine for Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher M. Bishop, David Spiegelhalter, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: In recent years variational methods have become a popular tool for approximate inference and learning in a wide variety of probabilistic models. For each new application, however, it is currently necessary ﬁrst to derive the variational update equations, and then to implement them in application-speciﬁc code. Each of these steps is both time consuming and error prone. In this paper we describe a general purpose inference engine called VIBES (‘Variational Inference for Bayesian Networks’) which allows a wide variety of probabilistic models to be implemented and solved variationally without recourse to coding. New models are speciﬁed either through a simple script or via a graphical interface analogous to a drawing package. VIBES then automatically generates and solves the variational equations. We illustrate the power and ﬂexibility of VIBES using examples from Bayesian mixture modelling. 1</p><p>5 0.63295585 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Dirichlet_Prior_and_Bayesian_Regularization.html">157 nips-2002-On the Dirichlet Prior and Bayesian Regularization</a></p>

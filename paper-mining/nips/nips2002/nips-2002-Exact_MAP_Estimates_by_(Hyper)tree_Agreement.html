<p>Author: Dan Pelleg, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: We focus on the problem of efﬁcient learning of dependency trees. It is well-known that given the pairwise mutual information coefﬁcients, a minimum-weight spanning tree algorithm solves this problem exactly and in polynomial time. However, for large data-sets it is the construction of the correlation matrix that dominates the running time. We have developed a new spanning-tree algorithm which is capable of exploiting partial knowledge about edge weights. The partial knowledge we maintain is a probabilistic conﬁdence interval on the coefﬁcients, which we derive by examining just a small sample of the data. The algorithm is able to ﬂag the need to shrink an interval, which translates to inspection of more data for the particular attribute pair. Experimental results show running time that is near-constant in the number of records, without signiﬁcant loss in accuracy of the generated trees. Interestingly, our spanning-tree algorithm is based solely on Tarjan’s red-edge rule, which is generally considered a guaranteed recipe for bad performance. 1</p><p>3 0.12796706 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Stable_Fixed_Points_of_Loopy_Belief_Propagation_Are_Local_Minima_of_the_Bethe_Free_Energy.html">189 nips-2002-Stable Fixed Points of Loopy Belief Propagation Are Local Minima of the Bethe Free Energy</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We extend recent work on the connection between loopy belief propagation and the Bethe free energy. Constrained minimization of the Bethe free energy can be turned into an unconstrained saddle-point problem. Both converging double-loop algorithms and standard loopy belief propagation can be interpreted as attempts to solve this saddle-point problem. Stability analysis then leads us to conclude that stable ﬁxed points of loopy belief propagation must be (local) minima of the Bethe free energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the converse need not be the case: minima can be unstable ﬁxed points. We illustrate this with an example and discuss implications. 1</p><p>4 0.11254244 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the generalization performance of some learning problems in Hilbert function Spaces. We introduce a concept of scalesensitive effective data dimension, and show that it characterizes the convergence rate of the underlying learning problem. Using this concept, we can naturally extend results for parametric estimation problems in ﬁnite dimensional spaces to non-parametric kernel learning methods. We derive upper bounds on the generalization performance and show that the resulting convergent rates are optimal under various circumstances.</p><p>5 0.11161099 <a title="80-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Scaling_for_Feature_Selection_in_SVMs.html">24 nips-2002-Adaptive Scaling for Feature Selection in SVMs</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm for the automatic relevance determination of input variables in kernelized Support Vector Machines. Relevance is measured by scale factors deﬁning the input space metric, and feature selection is performed by assigning zero weights to irrelevant variables. The metric is automatically tuned by the minimization of the standard SVM empirical risk, where scale factors are added to the usual set of parameters deﬁning the classiﬁer. Feature selection is achieved by constraints encouraging the sparsity of scale factors. The resulting algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art feature selection procedures and demonstrates its effectiveness on a demanding facial expression recognition problem.</p><p>6 0.10495023 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Differential_Semantics_for_Jointree_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2002-A Differential Semantics for Jointree Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Dan Klein, Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel generative model for natural language tree structures in which semantic (lexical dependency) and syntactic (PCFG) structures are scored with separate models. This factorization provides conceptual simplicity, straightforward opportunities for separately improving the component models, and a level of performance comparable to similar, non-factored models. Most importantly, unlike other modern parsing models, the factored model admits an extremely effective A* parsing algorithm, which enables efﬁcient, exact inference.</p><p>4 0.52299333 <a title="80-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Concentration_Inequalities_for_the_Missing_Mass_and_for_Histogram_Rule_Error.html">56 nips-2002-Concentration Inequalities for the Missing Mass and for Histogram Rule Error</a></p>
<p>Author: Luis E. Ortiz, David A. McAllester</p><p>Abstract: This paper gives distribution-free concentration inequalities for the missing mass and the error rate of histogram rules. Negative association methods can be used to reduce these concentration problems to concentration questions about independent sums. Although the sums are independent, they are highly heterogeneous. Such highly heterogeneous independent sums cannot be analyzed using standard concentration inequalities such as Hoeffding’s inequality, the Angluin-Valiant bound, Bernstein’s inequality, Bennett’s inequality, or McDiarmid’s theorem.</p><p>5 0.51613873 <a title="80-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Differential_Semantics_for_Jointree_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2002-A Differential Semantics for Jointree Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: James D. Park, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: A new approach to inference in belief networks has been recently proposed, which is based on an algebraic representation of belief networks using multi–linear functions. According to this approach, the key computational question is that of representing multi–linear functions compactly, since inference reduces to a simple process of ev aluating and diﬀerentiating such functions. W e show here that mainstream inference algorithms based on jointrees are a special case of this approach in a v ery precise sense. W e use this result to prov e new properties of jointree algorithms, and then discuss some of its practical and theoretical implications. 1</p><p>6 0.45843464 <a title="80-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, Nebojsa Jojic, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are used to discover a linear mapping between high dimensional data samples and points in a lower dimensional subspace. In [6], Jojic and Frey introduced mixture of transformation-invariant component analyzers (MTCA) that can account for global transformations such as translations and rotations, perform clustering and learn local appearance deformations by dimensionality reduction. However, due to enormous computational requirements of the EM algorithm for learning the model, O( ) where is the dimensionality of a data sample, MTCA was not practical for most applications. In this paper, we demonstrate how fast Fourier transforms can reduce the computation to the order of log . With this speedup, we show the effectiveness of MTCA in various applications - tracking, video textures, clustering video sequences, object recognition, and object detection in images. ¡ ¤ ¤ ¤ ¤</p><p>4 0.62447912 <a title="80-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Field-Programmable_Learning_Arrays.html">91 nips-2002-Field-Programmable Learning Arrays</a></p>
<p>Author: Seth Bridges, Miguel Figueroa, Chris Diorio, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces the Field-Programmable Learning Array, a new paradigm for rapid prototyping of learning primitives and machinelearning algorithms in silicon. The FPLA is a mixed-signal counterpart to the all-digital Field-Programmable Gate Array in that it enables rapid prototyping of algorithms in hardware. Unlike the FPGA, the FPLA is targeted directly for machine learning by providing local, parallel, online analog learning using ﬂoating-gate MOS synapse transistors. We present a prototype FPLA chip comprising an array of reconﬁgurable computational blocks and local interconnect. We demonstrate the viability of this architecture by mapping several learning circuits onto the prototype chip.</p><p>5 0.56874162 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Kernels_for_String_and_Tree_Matching.html">85 nips-2002-Fast Kernels for String and Tree Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a new algorithm suitable for matching discrete objects such as strings and trees in linear time, thus obviating dynarrtic programming with quadratic time complexity. Furthermore, prediction cost in many cases can be reduced to linear cost in the length of the sequence to be classified, regardless of the number of support vectors. This improvement on the currently available algorithms makes string kernels a viable alternative for the practitioner.</p><p>6 0.53614539 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Topographic_Map_Formation_by_Silicon_Growth_Cones.html">200 nips-2002-Topographic Map Formation by Silicon Growth Cones</a></p>

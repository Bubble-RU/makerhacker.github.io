<p>Author: Wim Wiegerinck, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-ﬁeld free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.</p><p>3 0.16611895 <a title="189-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: We develop a systems theoretical treatment of a behavioural system that interacts with its environment in a closed loop situation such that its motor actions inﬂuence its sensor inputs. The simplest form of a feedback is a reﬂex. Reﬂexes occur always “too late”; i.e., only after a (unpleasant, painful, dangerous) reﬂex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This deﬁnes an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary reﬂex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algorithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feedforward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.</p><p>4 0.15564735 <a title="189-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Exponential_Family_PCA_for_Belief_Compression_in_POMDPs.html">82 nips-2002-Exponential Family PCA for Belief Compression in POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicholas Roy, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Standard value function approaches to ﬁnding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is due to a great extent to their generating an optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real POMDP problems most belief states are unlikely, and there is a structured, low-dimensional manifold of plausible beliefs embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by taking advantage of belief space sparsity. We reduce the dimensionality of the belief space by exponential family Principal Components Analysis [1], which allows us to turn the sparse, highdimensional belief space into a compact, low-dimensional representation in terms of learned features of the belief state. We then plan directly on the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in a low-dimensional space, we can ﬁnd policies for POMDPs that are orders of magnitude larger than can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and also on a mobile robot navigation task.</p><p>5 0.14288363 <a title="189-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Approximate_Inference_and_Protein-Folding.html">32 nips-2002-Approximate Inference and Protein-Folding</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Side-chain prediction is an important subtask in the protein-folding problem. We show that finding a minimal energy side-chain configuration is equivalent to performing inference in an undirected graphical model. The graphical model is relatively sparse yet has many cycles. We used this equivalence to assess the performance of approximate inference algorithms in a real-world setting. Specifically we compared belief propagation (BP), generalized BP (GBP) and naive mean field (MF). In cases where exact inference was possible, max-product BP always found the global minimum of the energy (except in few cases where it failed to converge), while other approximation algorithms of similar complexity did not. In the full protein data set, maxproduct BP always found a lower energy configuration than the other algorithms, including a widely used protein-folding software (SCWRL). 1</p><p>6 0.13906014 <a title="189-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Differential_Semantics_for_Jointree_Algorithms.html">4 nips-2002-A Differential Semantics for Jointree Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: James D. Park, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: A new approach to inference in belief networks has been recently proposed, which is based on an algebraic representation of belief networks using multi–linear functions. According to this approach, the key computational question is that of representing multi–linear functions compactly, since inference reduces to a simple process of ev aluating and diﬀerentiating such functions. W e show here that mainstream inference algorithms based on jointrees are a special case of this approach in a v ery precise sense. W e use this result to prov e new properties of jointree algorithms, and then discuss some of its practical and theoretical implications. 1</p><p>5 0.41337654 <a title="189-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>

<p>Author: David Fass, Jacob Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We present an account of human concept learning-that is, learning of categories from examples-based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL). In support of this theory, we tested a wide range of two-dimensional concept types, including both regular (simple) and highly irregular (complex) structures, and found the MDL theory to give a good account of subjects' performance. This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description -length) systematically influences its leamability. 1- The Structure of Categories A number of different principles have been advanced to explain the manner in which humans learn to categorize objects. It has been variously suggested that the underlying principle might be the similarity structure of objects [1], the manipulability of decision bound~ aries [2], or Bayesian inference [3][4]. While many of these theories are mathematically well-grounded and have been successful in explaining a range of experimental findings, they have commonly only been tested on a narrow collection of concept types similar to the simple unimodal categories of Figure 1(a-e). (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 1: Categories similar to those previously studied. Lines represent contours of equal probability. All except (e) are unimodal. ~http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~jacob/feldman.html Moreover, in the scarce research that has ventured to look beyond simple category types, the goal has largely been to investigate categorization performance for isolated irregular distributions, rather than to present a survey of performance across a range of interesting distributions.

<p>Author: Rong Jin, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study a special kind of learning problem in which each training instance is given a set of (or distribution over) candidate class labels and only one of the candidate labels is the correct one. Such a problem can occur, e.g., in an information retrieval setting where a set of words is associated with an image, or if classes labels are organized hierarchically. We propose a novel discriminative approach for handling the ambiguity of class labels in the training examples. The experiments with the proposed approach over five different UCI datasets show that our approach is able to find the correct label among the set of candidate labels and actually achieve performance close to the case when each training instance is given a single correct label.

A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-ﬁeld free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.</p><p>6 0.6340729 <a title="189-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Multiclass_Learning_by_Probabilistic_Embeddings.html">149 nips-2002-Multiclass Learning by Probabilistic Embeddings</a></p>

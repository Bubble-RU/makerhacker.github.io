<p>Author: Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very diﬃcult to develop a uniﬁed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community. Here we suggest a formal perspective on the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a uniﬁcation, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-oﬀs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median. 1</p><p>3 0.2631247 <a title="53-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Going_Metric%3A_Denoising_Pairwise_Data.html">98 nips-2002-Going Metric: Denoising Pairwise Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Roth, Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise data in empirical sciences typically violate metricity, either due to noise or due to fallible estimates, and therefore are hard to analyze by conventional machine learning technology. In this paper we therefore study ways to work around this problem. First, we present an alternative embedding to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that allows us to apply a variety of classical machine learning and signal processing algorithms. The class of pairwise grouping algorithms which share the shift-invariance property is statistically invariant under this embedding procedure, leading to identical assignments of objects to clusters. Based on this new vectorial representation, denoising methods are applied in a second step. Both steps provide a theoretically well controlled setup to translate from pairwise data to the respective denoised metric representation. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our theoretical reasoning by discovering structure in protein sequence data bases, visibly improving performance upon existing automatic methods. 1</p><p>4 0.22493201 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-String_Kernels%2C_Fisher_Kernels_and_Finite_State_Automata.html">191 nips-2002-String Kernels, Fisher Kernels and Finite State Automata</a></p>
<p>Author: Craig Saunders, Alexei Vinokourov, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we show how the generation of documents can be thought of as a k-stage Markov process, which leads to a Fisher kernel from which the n-gram and string kernels can be re-constructed. The Fisher kernel view gives a more flexible insight into the string kernel and suggests how it can be parametrised in a way that reflects the statistics of the training corpus. Furthermore, the probabilistic modelling approach suggests extending the Markov process to consider sub-sequences of varying length, rather than the standard fixed-length approach used in the string kernel. We give a procedure for determining which sub-sequences are informative features and hence generate a Finite State Machine model, which can again be used to obtain a Fisher kernel. By adjusting the parametrisation we can also influence the weighting received by the features . In this way we are able to obtain a logarithmic weighting in a Fisher kernel. Finally, experiments are reported comparing the different kernels using the standard Bag of Words kernel as a baseline. 1</p><p>5 0.22425726 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Stuart Russell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to ﬁnd one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufﬁciently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, , learns a distance metric over if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efﬁcient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to signiﬁcantly improve clustering performance. £ ¤¢ £ ¥¢</p><p>5 0.54139072 <a title="53-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Maximum_Entropy_Approach_to_Collaborative_Filtering_in_Dynamic%2C_Sparse%2C_High-Dimensional_Domains.html">8 nips-2002-A Maximum Entropy Approach to Collaborative Filtering in Dynamic, Sparse, High-Dimensional Domains</a></p>
<p>Author: Dmitry Y. Pavlov, David M. Pennock</p><p>Abstract: We develop a maximum entropy (maxent) approach to generating recommendations in the context of a user’s current navigation stream, suitable for environments where data is sparse, high-dimensional, and dynamic— conditions typical of many recommendation applications. We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by ﬁrst clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probability that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recommending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity ﬁts naturally into a maxent framework. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popular online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algorithms in ofﬂine tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.</p><p>6 0.53553337 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Stability-Based_Model_Selection.html">188 nips-2002-Stability-Based Model Selection</a></p>

Smola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider formulations of multi-class problems based on a generalized notion of a margin and using output coding. This includes, but is not restricted to, standard multi-class SVM formulations. Differently from many previous approaches we learn the code as well as the embedding function. We illustrate how this can lead to a formulation that allows for solving a wider range of problems with for instance many classes or even “missing classes”. To keep our optimization problems tractable we propose an algorithm capable of solving them using twoclass classiﬁers, similar in spirit to Boosting.</p><p>4 0.81578201 <a title="53-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Stuart Russell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to ﬁnd one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufﬁciently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, , learns a distance metric over if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efﬁcient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to signiﬁcantly improve clustering performance. £ ¤¢ £ ¥¢</p><p>6 0.81435484 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Spikernels%3A_Embedding_Spiking_Neurons_in_Inner-Product_Spaces.html">187 nips-2002-Spikernels: Embedding Spiking Neurons in Inner-Product Spaces</a></p>

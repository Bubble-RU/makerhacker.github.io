<p>Author: Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very diﬃcult to develop a uniﬁed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community. Here we suggest a formal perspective on the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a uniﬁcation, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-oﬀs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median. 1</p><p>3 0.22840866 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Going_Metric%3A_Denoising_Pairwise_Data.html">98 nips-2002-Going Metric: Denoising Pairwise Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Roth, Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Pairwise data in empirical sciences typically violate metricity, either due to noise or due to fallible estimates, and therefore are hard to analyze by conventional machine learning technology. In this paper we therefore study ways to work around this problem. First, we present an alternative embedding to multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) that allows us to apply a variety of classical machine learning and signal processing algorithms. The class of pairwise grouping algorithms which share the shift-invariance property is statistically invariant under this embedding procedure, leading to identical assignments of objects to clusters. Based on this new vectorial representation, denoising methods are applied in a second step. Both steps provide a theoretically well controlled setup to translate from pairwise data to the respective denoised metric representation. We demonstrate the practical usefulness of our theoretical reasoning by discovering structure in protein sequence data bases, visibly improving performance upon existing automatic methods. 1</p><p>4 0.19488862 <a title="70-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Daniel Herrmann</p><p>Abstract: We investigate data based procedures for selecting the kernel when learning with Support Vector Machines. We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors ﬁx. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overﬁtting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.</p><p>3 0.75973684 <a title="70-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Maximum_Likelihood_and_the_Information_Bottleneck.html">142 nips-2002-Maximum Likelihood and the Information Bottleneck</a></p>
<p>Author: Noam Slonim, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is an information-theoretic formulation for clustering problems. Given a joint distribution , this method constructs a new variable that deﬁnes partitions over the values of that are informative about . Maximum likelihood (ML) of mixture models is a standard statistical approach to clustering problems. In this paper, we ask: how are the two methods related ? We deﬁne a simple mapping between the IB problem and the ML problem for the multinomial mixture model. We show that under this mapping the or problems are strongly related. In fact, for uniform input distribution over for large sample size, the problems are mathematically equivalent. Speciﬁcally, in these cases, every ﬁxed point of the IB-functional deﬁnes a ﬁxed point of the (log) likelihood and vice versa. Moreover, the values of the functionals at the ﬁxed points are equal under simple transformations. As a result, in these cases, every algorithm that solves one of the problems, induces a solution for the other.   ©§ ¥£ ¨¦¤¢   </p><p>4 0.75701553 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>6 0.74175364 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Hyperkernels.html">106 nips-2002-Hyperkernels</a></p>

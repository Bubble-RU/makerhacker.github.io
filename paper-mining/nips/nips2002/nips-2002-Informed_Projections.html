<p>Author: Alexei Vinokourov, Nello Cristianini, John Shawe-Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The problem of learning a semantic representation of a text document from data is addressed, in the situation where a corpus of unlabeled paired documents is available, each pair being formed by a short English document and its French translation. This representation can then be used for any retrieval, categorization or clustering task, both in a standard and in a cross-lingual setting. By using kernel functions, in this case simple bag-of-words inner products, each part of the corpus is mapped to a high-dimensional space. The correlations between the two spaces are then learnt by using kernel Canonical Correlation Analysis. A set of directions is found in the ﬁrst and in the second space that are maximally correlated. Since we assume the two representations are completely independent apart from the semantic content, any correlation between them should reﬂect some semantic similarity. Certain patterns of English words that relate to a speciﬁc meaning should correlate with certain patterns of French words corresponding to the same meaning, across the corpus. Using the semantic representation obtained in this way we ﬁrst demonstrate that the correlations detected between the two versions of the corpus are signiﬁcantly higher than random, and hence that a representation based on such features does capture statistical patterns that should reﬂect semantic information. Then we use such representation both in cross-language and in single-language retrieval tasks, observing performance that is consistently and signiﬁcantly superior to LSI on the same data.</p><p>3 0.25678033 <a title="115-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Mean_Field_Approach_to_a_Probabilistic_Model_in_Information_Retrieval.html">143 nips-2002-Mean Field Approach to a Probabilistic Model in Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitry Y. Pavlov, David M. Pennock</p><p>Abstract: We develop a maximum entropy (maxent) approach to generating recommendations in the context of a user’s current navigation stream, suitable for environments where data is sparse, high-dimensional, and dynamic— conditions typical of many recommendation applications. We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by ﬁrst clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probability that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recommending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity ﬁts naturally into a maxent framework. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popular online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algorithms in ofﬂine tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.</p><p>5 0.19818066 <a title="115-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Prediction_and_Semantic_Association.html">163 nips-2002-Prediction and Semantic Association</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: We explore the consequences of viewing semantic association as the result of attempting to predict the concepts likely to arise in a particular context. We argue that the success of existing accounts of semantic representation comes as a result of indirectly addressing this problem, and show that a closer correspondence to human data can be obtained by taking a probabilistic approach that explicitly models the generative structure of language. 1</p><p>6 0.18777217 <a title="115-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Semantic_Similarity.html">125 nips-2002-Learning Semantic Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: The extraction of a single high-quality image from a set of lowresolution images is an important problem which arises in fields such as remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging and the extraction of still images from video. Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high resolution image to the observed low resolution images, using regularization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registration parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-resolution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images. Results indicate a significant improvement over techniques based on MAP (maximum a-posteriori) point optimization of the high resolution image and associated registration parameters. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.99027377 <a title="115-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: People routinely make sophisticated causal inferences unconsciously, effortlessly, and from very little data – often from just one or a few observations. We argue that these inferences can be explained as Bayesian computations over a hypothesis space of causal graphical models, shaped by strong top-down prior knowledge in the form of intuitive theories. We present two case studies of our approach, including quantitative models of human causal judgments and brief comparisons with traditional bottom-up models of inference.</p><p>4 0.98916811 <a title="115-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Forward-Decoding_Kernel-Based_Phone_Recognition.html">93 nips-2002-Forward-Decoding Kernel-Based Phone Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Shantanu Chakrabartty, Gert Cauwenberghs</p><p>Abstract: Forward decoding kernel machines (FDKM) combine large-margin classifiers with hidden Markov models (HMM) for maximum a posteriori (MAP) adaptive sequence estimation. State transitions in the sequence are conditioned on observed data using a kernel-based probability model trained with a recursive scheme that deals effectively with noisy and partially labeled data. Training over very large data sets is accomplished using a sparse probabilistic support vector machine (SVM) model based on quadratic entropy, and an on-line stochastic steepest descent algorithm. For speaker-independent continuous phone recognition, FDKM trained over 177 ,080 samples of the TlMIT database achieves 80.6% recognition accuracy over the full test set, without use of a prior phonetic language model.</p><p>5 0.9758302 <a title="115-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Value-Directed_Compression_of_POMDPs.html">205 nips-2002-Value-Directed Compression of POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Pascal Poupart, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: We examine the problem of generating state-space compressions of POMDPs in a way that minimally impacts decision quality. We analyze the impact of compressions on decision quality, observing that compressions that allow accurate policy evaluation (prediction of expected future reward) will not affect decision quality. We derive a set of sufﬁcient conditions that ensure accurate prediction in this respect, illustrate interesting mathematical properties these confer on lossless linear compressions, and use these to derive an iterative procedure for ﬁnding good linear lossy compressions. We also elaborate on how structured representations of a POMDP can be used to ﬁnd such compressions.</p><p>6 0.92752081 <a title="115-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Dynamical_Causal_Learning.html">75 nips-2002-Dynamical Causal Learning</a></p>

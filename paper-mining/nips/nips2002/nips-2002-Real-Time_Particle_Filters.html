We consider two ubiquitous processes: an industrial dryer and a level tank.

<p>Author: Nicholas Roy, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Standard value function approaches to ﬁnding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is due to a great extent to their generating an optimal policy over the entire belief space. However, in real POMDP problems most belief states are unlikely, and there is a structured, low-dimensional manifold of plausible beliefs embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by taking advantage of belief space sparsity. We reduce the dimensionality of the belief space by exponential family Principal Components Analysis [1], which allows us to turn the sparse, highdimensional belief space into a compact, low-dimensional representation in terms of learned features of the belief state. We then plan directly on the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in a low-dimensional space, we can ﬁnd policies for POMDPs that are orders of magnitude larger than can be handled by conventional techniques. We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and also on a mobile robot navigation task.</p><p>4 0.18290523 <a title="169-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Classification_by_Variational_Kalman_Filtering.html">21 nips-2002-Adaptive Classification by Variational Kalman Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: We propose in this paper a probabilistic approach for adaptive inference of generalized nonlinear classiﬁcation that combines the computational advantage of a parametric solution with the ﬂexibility of sequential sampling techniques. We regard the parameters of the classiﬁer as latent states in a ﬁrst order Markov process and propose an algorithm which can be regarded as variational generalization of standard Kalman ﬁltering. The variational Kalman ﬁlter is based on two novel lower bounds that enable us to use a non-degenerate distribution over the adaptation rate. An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of infering competitive classiﬁers both in stationary and non-stationary environments. Although we focus on classiﬁcation, the algorithm is easily extended to other generalized nonlinear models.</p><p>5 0.141477 <a title="169-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_Sparse_Topographic_Representations_with_Products_of_Student-t_Distributions.html">127 nips-2002-Learning Sparse Topographic Representations with Products of Student-t Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Max Welling, Simon Osindero, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We propose a model for natural images in which the probability of an image is proportional to the product of the probabilities of some ﬁlter outputs. We encourage the system to ﬁnd sparse features by using a Studentt distribution to model each ﬁlter output. If the t-distribution is used to model the combined outputs of sets of neurally adjacent ﬁlters, the system learns a topographic map in which the orientation, spatial frequency and location of the ﬁlters change smoothly across the map. Even though maximum likelihood learning is intractable in our model, the product form allows a relatively efﬁcient learning procedure that works well even for highly overcomplete sets of ﬁlters. Once the model has been learned it can be used as a prior to derive the “iterated Wiener ﬁlter” for the purpose of denoising images.</p><p>6 0.13969214 <a title="169-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Neural_Decoding_of_Cursor_Motion_Using_a_Kalman_Filter.html">153 nips-2002-Neural Decoding of Cursor Motion Using a Kalman Filter</a></p>

<p>Author: W Wu, M. J. Black, Y. Gao, M. Serruya, A. Shaikhouni, J. P. Donoghue, Elie Bienenstock</p><p>Abstract: The direct neural control of external devices such as computer displays or prosthetic limbs requires the accurate decoding of neural activity representing continuous movement. We develop a real-time control system using the spiking activity of approximately 40 neurons recorded with an electrode array implanted in the arm area of primary motor cortex. In contrast to previous work, we develop a control-theoretic approach that explicitly models the motion of the hand and the probabilistic relationship between this motion and the mean ﬁring rates of the cells in 70 bins. We focus on a realistic cursor control task in which the subject must move a cursor to “hit” randomly placed targets on a computer monitor. Encoding and decoding of the neural data is achieved with a Kalman ﬁlter which has a number of advantages over previous linear ﬁltering techniques. In particular, the Kalman ﬁlter reconstructions of hand trajectories in off-line experiments are more accurate than previously reported results and the model provides insights into the nature of the neural coding of movement. ¨ ©§</p><p>5 0.42995688 <a title="169-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Exponential_Family_PCA_for_Belief_Compression_in_POMDPs.html">82 nips-2002-Exponential Family PCA for Belief Compression in POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Guido Dornhege, Benjamin Blankertz, Gabriel Curio, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Recently, interest is growing to develop an effective communication interface connecting the human brain to a computer, the ’Brain-Computer Interface’ (BCI). One motivation of BCI research is to provide a new communication channel substituting normal motor output in patients with severe neuromuscular disabilities. In the last decade, various neurophysiological cortical processes, such as slow potential shifts, movement related potentials (MRPs) or event-related desynchronization (ERD) of spontaneous EEG rhythms, were shown to be suitable for BCI, and, consequently, different independent approaches of extracting BCI-relevant EEG-features for single-trial analysis are under investigation. Here, we present and systematically compare several concepts for combining such EEG-features to improve the single-trial classiﬁcation. Feature combinations are evaluated on movement imagination experiments with 3 subjects where EEG-features are based on either MRPs or ERD, or both. Those combination methods that incorporate the assumption that the single EEG-features are physiologically mutually independent outperform the plain method of ’adding’ evidence where the single-feature vectors are simply concatenated. These results strengthen the hypothesis that MRP and ERD reﬂect at least partially independent aspects of cortical processes and open a new perspective to boost BCI effectiveness.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78089517 <a title="169-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Real-Time_Particle_Filters.html">169 nips-2002-Real-Time Particle Filters</a></p>

In many real time applications of particle ﬁlters, however, sensor information arrives at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than the update rate of the ﬁlter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle ﬁlter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle ﬁlters, which make use of all sensor information even when the ﬁlter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by representing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a ﬁlter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources (samples) on valuable sensor information. Experiments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.</p><p>3 0.73056704 <a title="169-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>

Using this concept, we can naturally extend results for parametric estimation problems in ﬁnite dimensional spaces to non-parametric kernel learning methods. We derive upper bounds on the generalization performance and show that the resulting convergent rates are optimal under various circumstances.</p><p>4 0.71422309 <a title="169-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>5 0.71109378 <a title="169-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_a_Forward_Model_of_a_Reflex.html">128 nips-2002-Learning a Forward Model of a Reflex</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: We develop a systems theoretical treatment of a behavioural system that interacts with its environment in a closed loop situation such that its motor actions inﬂuence its sensor inputs. The simplest form of a feedback is a reﬂex. Reﬂexes occur always “too late”; i.e., only after a (unpleasant, painful, dangerous) reﬂex-eliciting sensor event has occurred. This deﬁnes an objective problem which can be solved if another sensor input exists which can predict the primary reﬂex and can generate an earlier reaction. In contrast to previous approaches, our linear learning algorithm allows for an analytical proof that this system learns to apply feedforward control with the result that slow feedback loops are replaced by their equivalent feed-forward controller creating a forward model. In other words, learning turns the reactive system into a pro-active system. By means of a robot implementation we demonstrate the applicability of the theoretical results which can be used in a variety of different areas in physics and engineering.</p><p>6 0.70822984 <a title="169-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Digital_Antennal_Lobe_for_Pattern_Equalization%3A_Analysis_and_Design.html">5 nips-2002-A Digital Antennal Lobe for Pattern Equalization: Analysis and Design</a></p>

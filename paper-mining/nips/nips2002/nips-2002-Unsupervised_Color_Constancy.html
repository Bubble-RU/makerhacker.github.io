Using both color information and a classiﬁer trained to recognize gray-scale patterns, each image derivative is classiﬁed as being caused by shading or a change in the surface’s reﬂectance. Generalized Belief Propagation is then used to propagate information from areas where the correct classiﬁcation is clear to areas where it is ambiguous.

<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Thomas Wachtler, Thomas D. Albright, Terrence Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help understand information integration and perceptual coding in the brain. We show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. We show evidence suggesting that the classical/non-classical receptive ﬁeld organization in the cortex effectively enforces the development of Morton-style factorial codes. This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual coding in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms. While methods like ICA (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997) develop independent codes, in Morton-style coding the goal is to make two or more external aspects of the world become independent when conditioning on internal representations. In this paper we introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help analyze information integration and perceptual organization in the brain. In the neurosciences factorial codes are often studied in the context of mean tuning curves. A tuning curve is called separable if it can be expressed as the product of terms selectively inﬂuenced by different stimulus dimensions. Separable tuning curves are taken as evidence of factorial coding mechanisms. In this paper we show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. Morton (1969) analyzed a wide variety of psychophysical experiments on word perception and showed that they could be explained using a model in which stimulus and context have separable effects on perception. More precisely, in Mortons’ model the joint effect of stimulus and context on a perceptual representation can be obtained by multiplying terms selectively controlled by stimulus and by context, i.e.,  £ © # #</p><p>5 0.22865616 <a title="202-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Half-Lives_of_EigenFlows_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">100 nips-2002-Half-Lives of EigenFlows for Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Chakra Chennubhotla, Allan D. Jepson</p><p>Abstract: Using a Markov chain perspective of spectral clustering we present an algorithm to automatically ﬁnd the number of stable clusters in a dataset. The Markov chain’s behaviour is characterized by the spectral properties of the matrix of transition probabilities, from which we derive eigenﬂows along with their halﬂives. An eigenﬂow describes the ﬂow of probability mass due to the Markov chain, and it is characterized by its eigenvalue, or equivalently, by the halﬂife of its decay as the Markov chain is iterated. A ideal stable cluster is one with zero eigenﬂow and inﬁnite half-life. The key insight in this paper is that bottlenecks between weakly coupled clusters can be identiﬁed by computing the sensitivity of the eigenﬂow’s halﬂife to variations in the edge weights. We propose a novel E IGEN C UTS algorithm to perform clustering that removes these identiﬁed bottlenecks in an iterative fashion.</p><p>6 0.22202511 <a title="202-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Bayesian_Image_Super-Resolution.html">39 nips-2002-Bayesian Image Super-Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: William T. Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The goal of low-level vision is to estimate an underlying scene, given an observed image. Real-world scenes (eg, albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate and store. We propose a low-dimensional representation, called a scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to describe the complex scene conﬁgurations. Shape recipes are an example: these are the regression coefﬁcients that predict the bandpassed shape from image data. We describe the beneﬁts of this representation, and show two uses illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution; (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting and materials and we use them for material segmentation.</p><p>5 0.4463101 <a title="202-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Half-Lives_of_EigenFlows_for_Spectral_Clustering.html">100 nips-2002-Half-Lives of EigenFlows for Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Nathaniel D. Daw, Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: According to a series of inﬂuential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been conﬁned to more abstract psychological models.</p><p>4 0.67733318 <a title="202-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Spikernels%3A_Embedding_Spiking_Neurons_in_Inner-Product_Spaces.html">187 nips-2002-Spikernels: Embedding Spiking Neurons in Inner-Product Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Yoram Singer, Rony Paz, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Inner-product operators, often referred to as kernels in statistical learning, deﬁne a mapping from some input space into a feature space. The focus of this paper is the construction of biologically-motivated kernels for cortical activities. The kernels we derive, termed Spikernels, map spike count sequences into an abstract vector space in which we can perform various prediction tasks. We discuss in detail the derivation of Spikernels and describe an efﬁcient algorithm for computing their value on any two sequences of neural population spike counts. We demonstrate the merits of our modeling approach using the Spikernel and various standard kernels for the task of predicting hand movement velocities from cortical recordings. In all of our experiments all the kernels we tested outperform the standard scalar product used in regression with the Spikernel consistently achieving the best performance. 1</p><p>5 0.63745439 <a title="202-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-A_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Markovian_Model_for_Motifs_in_Biopolymer_Sequences.html">7 nips-2002-A Hierarchical Bayesian Markovian Model for Motifs in Biopolymer Sequences</a></p>
<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Richard M. Karp, Stuart Russell</p><p>Abstract: We propose a dynamic Bayesian model for motifs in biopolymer sequences which captures rich biological prior knowledge and positional dependencies in motif structure in a principled way. Our model posits that the position-speciﬁc multinomial parameters for monomer distribution are distributed as a latent Dirichlet-mixture random variable, and the position-speciﬁc Dirichlet component is determined by a hidden Markov process. Model parameters can be ﬁt on training motifs using a variational EM algorithm within an empirical Bayesian framework. Variational inference is also used for detecting hidden motifs. Our model improves over previous models that ignore biological priors and positional dependence. It has much higher sensitivity to motifs during detection and a notable ability to distinguish genuine motifs from false recurring patterns.</p><p>6 0.63505548 <a title="202-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-A_Probabilistic_Approach_to_Single_Channel_Blind_Signal_Separation.html">14 nips-2002-A Probabilistic Approach to Single Channel Blind Signal Separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jon M. Kleinberg</p><p>Abstract: Although the study of clustering is centered around an intuitively compelling goal, it has been very diﬃcult to develop a uniﬁed framework for reasoning about it at a technical level, and profoundly diverse approaches to clustering abound in the research community. Here we suggest a formal perspective on the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such a uniﬁcation, in the form of an impossibility theorem: for a set of three simple properties, we show that there is no clustering function satisfying all three. Relaxations of these properties expose some of the interesting (and unavoidable) trade-oﬀs at work in well-studied clustering techniques such as single-linkage, sum-of-pairs, k-means, and k-median. 1</p><p>5 0.11445328 <a title="56-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods.html">64 nips-2002-Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixture Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Meir, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We consider Bayesian mixture approaches, where a predictor is constructed by forming a weighted average of hypotheses from some space of functions. While such procedures are known to lead to optimal predictors in several cases, where suﬃciently accurate prior information is available, it has not been clear how they perform when some of the prior assumptions are violated. In this paper we establish data-dependent bounds for such procedures, extending previous randomized approaches such as the Gibbs algorithm to a fully Bayesian setting. The ﬁnite-sample guarantees established in this work enable the utilization of Bayesian mixture approaches in agnostic settings, where the usual assumptions of the Bayesian paradigm fail to hold. Moreover, the bounds derived can be directly applied to non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. 1 Introduction and Motivation The standard approach to Computational Learning Theory is usually formulated within the so-called frequentist approach to Statistics. Within this paradigm one is interested in constructing an estimator, based on a ﬁnite sample, which possesses a small loss (generalization error). While many algorithms have been constructed and analyzed within this context, it is not clear how these approaches relate to standard optimality criteria within the frequentist framework. Two classic optimality criteria within the latter approach are the minimax and admissibility criteria, which characterize optimality of estimators in a rigorous and precise fashion [9]. Except in some special cases [12], it is not known whether any of the approaches used within the Learning community lead to optimality in either of the above senses of the word. On the other hand, it is known that under certain regularity conditions, Bayesian estimators lead to either minimax or admissible estimators, and thus to well-deﬁned optimality in the classical (frequentist) sense. In fact, it can be shown that Bayes estimators are essentially the only estimators which can achieve optimality in the above senses [9]. This optimality feature provides strong motivation for the study of Bayesian approaches in a frequentist setting. While Bayesian approaches have been widely studied, there have not been generally applicable bounds in the frequentist framework. Recently, several approaches have attempted to address this problem. In this paper we establish ﬁnite sample datadependent bounds for Bayesian mixture methods, which together with the above optimality properties suggest that these approaches should become more widely used. Consider the problem of supervised learning where we attempt to construct an estimator based on a ﬁnite sample of pairs of examples S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )}, each drawn independently according to an unknown distribution µ(x, y). Let A be a learning algorithm which, based on the sample S, constructs a hypothesis (estimator) h from some set of hypotheses H. Denoting by (y, h(x)) the instantaneous loss of the hypothesis h, we wish to assess the true loss L(h) = Eµ (y, h(x)) where the expectation is taken with respect to µ. In particular, the objective is to provide data-dependent bounds of the following form. For any h ∈ H and δ ∈ (0, 1), with probability at least 1 − δ, L(h) ≤ Λ(h, S) + ∆(h, S, δ), (1) where Λ(h, S) is some empirical assessment of the true loss, and ∆(h, S, δ) is a complexity term. For example, in the classic Vapnik-Chervonenkis framework, Λ(h, S) n is the empirical error (1/n) i=1 (yi , h(xi )) and ∆(h, S, δ) depends on the VCdimension of H but is independent of both the hypothesis h and the sample S. By algorithm and data-dependent bounds we mean bounds where the complexity term depends on both the hypothesis (chosen by the algorithm A) and the sample S. 2 A Decision Theoretic Bayesian Framework Consider a decision theoretic setting where we deﬁne the sample dependent loss of an algorithm A by R(µ, A, S) = Eµ (y, A(x, S)). Let θµ be the optimal predictor for y, namely the function minimizing Eµ { (y, φ(x))} over φ. It is clear that the best algorithm A (Bayes algorithm) is the one that always return θµ , assuming µ is known. We are interested in the expected loss of an algorithm averaged over samples S: R(µ, A) = ES R(µ, A, S) = R(µ, A, S)dµ(S), where the expectation is taken with respect to the sample S drawn i.i.d. from the probability measure µ. If we consider a family of measures µ, which possesses some underlying prior distribution π(µ), then we can construct the averaged risk function with respect to the prior as, r(π, A) = Eπ R(µ, A) = where dπ(µ|S) = dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) dµ(S)dπ(µ) R(µ, A, S)dπ(µ|S), is the posterior distribution on the µ family, which µ induces a posterior distribution on the sample space as πS = Eπ(µ|S) µ. An algorithm minimizing the Bayes risk r(π, A) is referred to as a Bayes algorithm. In fact, for a given prior, and a given sample S, the optimal algorithm should return the Bayes optimal predictor with respect to the posterior measure πS . For many important practical problems, the optimal Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the underlying probability measure. For example, if the loss function is quadratic, namely (y, A(x)) = (y −A(x))2 , then the optimal Bayes predictor θµ (x) is the conditional mean of y, namely Eµ [y|x]. For binary classiﬁcation problems, we can let the predictor be the conditional probability θµ (x) = µ(y = 1|x) (the optimal classiﬁcation decision rule then corresponds to a test of whether θµ (x) > 0.5), which is also a linear functional of µ. Clearly if the Bayes predictor is a linear functional of the probability measure, then the optimal Bayes algorithm with respect to the prior π is given by AB (x, S) = θµ (x)dπ(µ|S) = µ θ (x)dµ(S)dπ(µ) µ µ µ dµ(S)dπ(µ) . (2) In this case, an optimal Bayesian algorithm can be regarded as the predictor constructed by averaging over all predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior π(µ|S). We refer to such methods as Bayesian mixture methods. While the Bayes estimator AB (x, S) is optimal with respect to the Bayes risk r(π, A), it can be shown, that under appropriate conditions (and an appropriate prior) it is also a minimax and admissible estimator [9]. In general, θµ is unknown. Rather we may have some prior information about possible models for θµ . In view of (2) we consider a hypothesis space H, and an algorithm based on a mixture of hypotheses h ∈ H. This should be contrasted with classical approaches where an algorithm selects a single hypothesis h form H. For simplicity, we consider a countable hypothesis space H = {h1 , h2 , . . .}; the general case will be deferred to the full paper. Let q = {qj }∞ be a probability j=1 vector, namely qj ≥ 0 and j qj = 1, and construct the composite predictor by fq (x) = j qj hj (x). Observe that in general fq (x) may be a great deal more complex that any single hypothesis hj . For example, if hj (x) are non-polynomial ridge functions, the composite predictor f corresponds to a two-layer neural network with universal approximation power. We denote by Q the probability distribution deﬁned by q, namely j qj hj = Eh∼Q h. A main feature of this work is the establishment of data-dependent bounds on L(Eh∼Q h), the loss of the Bayes mixture algorithm. There has been a ﬂurry of recent activity concerning data-dependent bounds (a non-exhaustive list includes [2, 3, 5, 11, 13]). In a related vein, McAllester [7] provided a data-dependent bound for the so-called Gibbs algorithm, which selects a hypothesis at random from H based on the posterior distribution π(h|S). Essentially, this result provides a bound on the average error Eh∼Q L(h) rather than a bound on the error of the averaged hypothesis. Later, Langford et al. [6] extended this result to a mixture of classiﬁers using a margin-based loss function. A more general result can also be obtained using the covering number approach described in [14]. Finally, Herbrich and Graepel [4] showed that under certain conditions the bounds for the Gibbs classiﬁer can be extended to a Bayesian mixture classiﬁer. However, their bound contained an explicit dependence on the dimension (see Thm. 3 in [4]). Although the approach pioneered by McAllester came to be known as PAC-Bayes, this term is somewhat misleading since an optimal Bayesian method (in the decision theoretic framework outline above) does not average over loss functions but rather over hypotheses. In this regard, the learning behavior of a true Bayesian method is not addressed in the PAC-Bayes analysis. In this paper, we would like to narrow the discrepancy by analyzing Bayesian mixture methods, where we consider a predictor that is the average of a family of predictors with respect to a data-dependent posterior distribution. Bayesian mixtures can often be regarded as a good approximation to a true optimal Bayesian method. In fact, we have shown above that they are equivalent for many important practical problems. Therefore the main contribution of the present work is the extension of the above mentioned results in PAC-Bayes analysis to a rather uniﬁed setting for Bayesian mixture methods, where diﬀerent regularization criteria may be incorporated, and their eﬀect on the performance easily assessed. Furthermore, it is also essential that the bounds obtained are dimension-independent, since otherwise they yield useless results when applied to kernel-based methods, which often map the input space into a space of very high dimensionality. Similar results can also be obtained using the covering number analysis in [14]. However the approach presented in the current paper, which relies on the direct computation of the Rademacher complexity, is more direct and gives better bounds. The analysis is also easier to generalize than the corresponding covering number approach. Moreover, our analysis applies directly to other non-Bayesian mixture approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. Before moving to the derivation of our bounds, we formalize our approach. Consider a countable hypothesis space H = {hj }∞ , and a probability distribution {qj } over j=1 ∞ H. Introduce the vector notation k=1 qk hk (x) = q h(x). A learning algorithm within the Bayesian mixture framework uses the sample S to select a distribution Q over H and then constructs a mixture hypothesis fq (x) = q h(x). In order to constrain the class of mixtures used in constructing the mixture q h we impose constraints on the mixture vector q. Let g(q) be a non-negative convex function of q and deﬁne for any positive A, ΩA = {q ∈ S : g(q) ≤ A} ; FA = fq : fq (x) = q h(x) : q ∈ ΩA , (3) where S denotes the probability simplex. In subsequent sections we will consider diﬀerent choices for g(q), which essentially acts as a regularization term. Finally, for any mixture q h we deﬁne the loss by L(q h) = Eµ (y, (q h)(x)) and the n ˆ empirical loss incurred on the sample by L(q h) = (1/n) i=1 (yi , (q h)(xi )). 3 A Mixture Algorithm with an Entropic Constraint In this section we consider an entropic constraint, which penalizes weights deviating signiﬁcantly from some prior probability distribution ν = {νj }∞ , which may j=1 incorporate our prior information about he problem. The weights q themselves are chosen by the algorithm based on the data. In particular, in this section we set g(q) to be the Kullback-Leibler divergence of q from ν, g(q) = D(q ν) ; qj log(qj /νj ). D(q ν) = j Let F be a class of real-valued functions, and denote by σi independent Bernoulli random variables assuming the values ±1 with equal probability. We deﬁne the data-dependent Rademacher complexity of F as 1 ˆ Rn (F) = Eσ sup n f ∈F n σi f (xi ) |S . i=1 ˆ The expectation of Rn (F) with respect to S will be denoted by Rn (F). We note ˆ n (F) is concentrated around its mean value Rn (F) (e.g., Thm. 8 in [1]). We that R quote a slightly adapted result from [5]. Theorem 1 (Adapted from Theorem 1 in [5]) Let {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn } ∈ X be a sequence of points generated independently at random according to a probability distribution P , and let F be a class of measurable functions from X to R. Furthermore, let φ be a non-negative Lipschitz function with Lipschitz constant κ, such that φ◦f is uniformly bounded by a constant M . Then for all f ∈ F with probability at least 1 − δ Eφ(f (x)) − 1 n n φ(f (xi )) ≤ 4κRn (F) + M i=1 log(1/δ) . 2n An immediate consequence of Theorem 1 is the following. Lemma 3.1 Let the loss function be bounded by M , and assume that it is Lipschitz with constant κ. Then for all q ∈ ΩA with probability at least 1 − δ log(1/δ) . 2n ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κRn (FA ) + M Next, we bound the empirical Rademacher average of FA using g(q) = D(q ν). Lemma 3.2 The empirical Rademacher complexity of FA is upper bounded as follows: 2A n ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ 1 n sup j n hj (xi )2 . i=1 Proof: We ﬁrst recall a few facts from the theory of convex duality [10]. Let p(u) be a convex function over a domain U , and set its dual s(z) = supu∈U u z − p(u) . It is known that s(z) is also convex. Setting u = q and p(q) = j qj log(qj /νj ) we ﬁnd that s(v) = log j νj ezj . From the deﬁnition of s(z) it follows that for any q ∈ S, q z≤ qj log(qj /νj ) + log ν j ez j . j j Since z is arbitrary, we set z = (λ/n) i σi h(xi ) and conclude that for q ∈ ΩA and any λ > 0   n   1 λ 1 sup A + log νj exp σi q h(xi ) ≤ σi hj (xi ) .  n i=1 λ n i q∈ΩA j Taking the expectation with respect to σ, and using 2 Eσ {exp ( i σi ai )} ≤ exp i ai /2 , we have that  λ 1 ˆ νj exp A + Eσ log σi hj (xi ) Rn (FA ) ≤ λ n j ≤ ≤ = i 1 λ A + sup log Eσ exp 1 λ A + sup log exp j j A λ + 2 sup λ 2n j λ2 n2 λ n i σi hj (xi ) the Chernoﬀ bound    (Jensen) i hj (xi )2 2 (Chernoﬀ) hj (xi )2 . i Minimizing the r.h.s. with respect to λ, we obtain the desired result. Combining Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2 yields our basic bound, where κ and M are deﬁned in Lemma 3.1. Theorem 2 Let S = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xn , yn )} be a sample of i.i.d. points each drawn according to a distribution µ(x, y). Let H be a countable hypothesis class, and set FA to be the class deﬁned in (3) with g(q) = D(q ν). Set ∆H = (1/n)Eµ supj 1−δ n i=1 hj (xi )2 1/2 . Then for any q ∈ ΩA with probability at least ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2A +M n log(1/δ) . 2n Note that if hj are uniformly bounded, hj ≤ c, then ∆H ≤ c. Theorem 2 holds for a ﬁxed value of A. Using the so-called multiple testing Lemma (e.g. [11]) we obtain: Corollary 3.1 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold, and let {Ai , pi } be a set of positive numbers such that i pi = 1. Then for all Ai and q ∈ ΩAi with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + 4κ∆H 2Ai +M n log(1/pi δ) . 2n Note that the only distinction with Theorem 2 is the extra factor of log pi which is the price paid for the uniformity of the bound. Finally, we present a data-dependent bound of the form (1). Theorem 3 Let the assumptions of Theorem 2 hold. Then for all q ∈ S with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H , M ) × 130D(q ν) + log(1/δ) . n (4) Proof sketch Pick Ai = 2i and pi = 1/i(i + 1), i = 1, 2, . . . (note that i pi = 1). For each q, let i(q) be the smallest index for which Ai(q) ≥ D(q ν) implying that log(1/pi(q) ) ≤ 2 log log2 (4D(q ν)). A few lines of algebra, to be presented in the full paper, yield the desired result. The results of Theorem 3 can be compared to those derived by McAllester [8] for the randomized Gibbs procedure. In the latter case, the ﬁrst term on the r.h.s. is ˆ Eh∼Q L(h), namely the average empirical error of the base classiﬁers h. In our case ˆ the corresponding term is L(Eh∼Q h), namely the empirical error of the average hypothesis. Since Eh∼Q h is potentially much more complex than any single h ∈ H, we expect that the empirical term in (4) is much smaller than the corresponding term in [8]. Moreover, the complexity term we obtain is in fact tighter than the corresponding term in [8] by a logarithmic factor in n (although the logarithmic factor in [8] could probably be eliminated). We thus expect that Bayesian mixture approach advocated here leads to better performance guarantees. Finally, we comment that Theorem 3 can be used to obtain so-called oracle inequalities. In particular, let q∗ be the optimal distribution minimizing L(q h), which can only be computed if the underlying distribution µ(x, y) is known. Consider an ˆ algorithm which, based only on the data, selects a distribution q by minimizing the r.h.s. of (4), with the implicit constants appropriately speciﬁed. Then, using standard approaches (e.g. [2]) we can obtain a bound on L(ˆ h) − L(q∗ h). For q lack of space, we defer the derivation of the precise bound to the full paper. 4 General Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixtures The Kullback-Leibler divergence is but one way to incorporate prior information. In this section we extend the results to general convex regularization functions g(q). Some possible choices for g(q) besides the Kullback-Leibler divergence are the standard Lp norms q p . In order to proceed along the lines of Section 3, we let s(z) be the convex function associated with g(q), namely s(z) = supq∈ΩA q z − g(q) . Repeating n 1 the arguments of Section 3 we have for any λ > 0 that n i=1 σi q h(xi ) ≤ 1 λ i σi h(xi ) , which implies that λ A+s n 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ λ n A + Eσ s σi h(xi ) . (5) i n Assume that s(z) is second order diﬀerentiable, and that for any h = i=1 σi h(xi ) 1 2 (s(h + ∆h) + s(h − ∆h)) − s(h) ≤ u(∆h). Then, assuming that s(0) = 0, it is easy to show by induction that n n Eσ s (λ/n) i=1 σi h(xi ) ≤ u((λ/n)h(xi )). (6) i=1 In the remainder of the section we focus on the the case of regularization based on the Lp norm. Consider p and q such that 1/q + 1/p = 1, p ∈ (1, ∞), and let p = max(p, 2) and q = min(q, 2). Note that if p ≤ 2 then q ≥ 2, q = p = 2 and if p > 2 1 then q < 2, q = q, p = p. Consider p-norm regularization g(q) = p q p , in which p 1 case s(z) = q z q . The Rademacher averaging result for p-norm regularization q is known in the Geometric theory of Banach spaces (type structure of the Banach space), and it also follows from Khinchtine’s inequality. We show that it can be easily obtained in our framework. In this case, it is easy to see that s(z) = Substituting in (5) we have 1 ˆ Rn (FA ) ≤ inf λ≥0 λ A+ λ n q−1 q where Cq = ((q − 1)/q ) 1/q q 1 q z q q n h(xi ) q q = i=1 implies u(h(x)) ≤ Cq A1/p n1/p 1 n q−1 q h(x) q q . 1/q n h(xi ) q q i=1 . Combining this result with the methods described in Section 3, we establish a bound for regularization based on the Lp norm. Assume that h(xi ) q is ﬁnite for all i, and set ∆H,q = E (1/n) n i=1 h(xi ) q q 1/q . Theorem 4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3 hold and set g(q) = (1, ∞). Then for all q ∈ S, with probability at least 1 − δ, ˆ L(q h) ≤ L(q h) + max(κ∆H,q , M ) × O q p + n1/p log log( q p 1 p q p p , p ∈ + 3) + log(1/δ) n where O(·) hides a universal constant that depends only on p. 5 Discussion We have introduced and analyzed a class of regularized Bayesian mixture approaches, which construct complex composite estimators by combining hypotheses from some underlying hypothesis class using data-dependent weights. Such weighted averaging approaches have been used extensively within the Bayesian framework, as well as in more recent approaches such as Bagging and Boosting. While Bayesian methods are known, under favorable conditions, to lead to optimal estimators in a frequentist setting, their performance in agnostic settings, where no reliable assumptions can be made concerning the data generating mechanism, has not been well understood. Our data-dependent bounds allow the utilization of Bayesian mixture models in general settings, while at the same time taking advantage of the beneﬁts of the Bayesian approach in terms of incorporation of prior knowledge. The bounds established, being independent of the cardinality of the underlying hypothesis space, can be directly applied to kernel based methods.

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Tommi S. Jaakkola, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method for computing provably exact maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates for a subclass of problems on graphs with cycles. The basic idea is to represent the original problem on the graph with cycles as a convex combination of tree-structured problems. A convexity argument then guarantees that the optimal value of the original problem (i.e., the log probability of the MAP assignment) is upper bounded by the combined optimal values of the tree problems. We prove that this upper bound is met with equality if and only if the tree problems share an optimal conﬁguration in common. An important implication is that any such shared conﬁguration must also be the MAP conﬁguration for the original problem. Next we develop a tree-reweighted max-product algorithm for attempting to ﬁnd convex combinations of tree-structured problems that share a common optimum. We give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for a ﬁxed point to yield the exact MAP estimate. An attractive feature of our analysis is that it generalizes naturally to convex combinations of hypertree-structured distributions.</p><p>4 0.53957647 <a title="56-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-PAC-Bayes_%26_Margins.html">161 nips-2002-PAC-Bayes & Margins</a></p>

<p>Author: Noam Slonim, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The information bottleneck (IB) method is an information-theoretic formulation for clustering problems. Given a joint distribution , this method constructs a new variable that deﬁnes partitions over the values of that are informative about . Maximum likelihood (ML) of mixture models is a standard statistical approach to clustering problems. In this paper, we ask: how are the two methods related ? We deﬁne a simple mapping between the IB problem and the ML problem for the multinomial mixture model. We show that under this mapping the or problems are strongly related. In fact, for uniform input distribution over for large sample size, the problems are mathematically equivalent. Speciﬁcally, in these cases, every ﬁxed point of the IB-functional deﬁnes a ﬁxed point of the (log) likelihood and vice versa. Moreover, the values of the functionals at the ﬁxed points are equal under simple transformations. As a result, in these cases, every algorithm that solves one of the problems, induces a solution for the other.   ©§ ¥£ ¨¦¤¢   </p><p>6 0.52498072 <a title="56-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods.html">64 nips-2002-Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixture Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Hanna Pasula, Bhaskara Marthi, Brian Milch, Stuart Russell, Ilya Shpitser</p><p>Abstract: Identity uncertainty is a pervasive problem in real-world data analysis. It arises whenever objects are not labeled with unique identiﬁers or when those identiﬁers may not be perceived perfectly. In such cases, two observations may or may not correspond to the same object. In this paper, we consider the problem in the context of citation matching—the problem of deciding which citations correspond to the same publication. Our approach is based on the use of a relational probability model to deﬁne a generative model for the domain, including models of author and title corruption and a probabilistic citation grammar. Identity uncertainty is handled by extending standard models to incorporate probabilities over the possible mappings between terms in the language and objects in the domain. Inference is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo, augmented with speciﬁc methods for generating efﬁcient proposals when the domain contains many objects. Results on several citation data sets show that the method outperforms current algorithms for citation matching. The declarative, relational nature of the model also means that our algorithm can determine object characteristics such as author names by combining multiple citations of multiple papers. 1 INTRODUCTION Citation matching is the problem currently handled by systems such as Citeseer [1]. 1 Such systems process a large number of scientiﬁc publications to extract their citation lists. By grouping together all co-referring citations (and, if possible, linking to the actual cited paper), the system constructs a database of “paper” entities linked by the “cites(p 1 , p2 )” relation. This is an example of the general problem of determining the existence of a set of objects, and their properties and relations, given a collection of “raw” perceptual data; this problem is faced by intelligence analysts and intelligent agents as well as by citation systems. A key aspect of this problem is determining when two observations describe the same object; only then can evidence be combined to develop a more complete description of the object. Objects seldom carry unique identiﬁers around with them, so identity uncertainty is ubiquitous. For example, Figure 1 shows two citations that probably refer to the same paper, despite many superﬁcial differences. Citations appear in many formats and are rife with errors of all kinds. As a result, Citeseer—which is speciﬁcally designed to overcome such problems—currently lists more than 100 distinct AI textbooks published by Russell 1 See citeseer.nj.nec.com. Citeseer is now known as ResearchIndex.

Record linkage [2] is a method for matching up the records in two ﬁles, as might be required when merging two databases. For each pair of records, a comparison vector is computed that encodes the ways in which the records do and do not match up. EM is used to learn a naive-Bayes distribution over this vector for both matched and unmatched record pairs, so that the pairwise match probability can then be calculated using Bayes’ rule. Linkage decisions are typically made in a greedy fashion based on closest match and/or a probability threshold, so the overall process is order-dependent and may be inconsistent. The model does not provide for a principled way to combine matched records. A richer probability model is developed by Cohen et al [3], who model the database as a combination of some “original” records that are correct and some number of erroneous versions. They give an efﬁcient greedy algorithm for ﬁnding a single locally optimal assignment of records into groups. Data association [4] is the problem of assigning new observations to existing trajectories when multiple objects are being tracked; it also arises in robot mapping when deciding if an observed landmark is the same as one previously mapped. While early data association systems used greedy methods similar to record linkage, recent systems have tried to ﬁnd high-probability global solutions [5] or to approximate the true posterior over assignments [6]. The latter method has also been applied to the problem of stereo correspondence, in which a computer vision system must determine how to match up features observed in two or more cameras [7]. Data association systems usually have simple observation models (e.g., Gaussian noise) and assume that observations at each time step are all distinct. More general patterns of identity occur in natural language text, where the problem of anaphora resolution involves determining whether phrases (especially pronouns) co-refer; some recent work [8] has used an early form of relational probability model, although with a somewhat counterintuitive semantics. Citeseer is the best-known example of work on citation matching [1]. The system groups citations using a form of greedy agglomerative clustering based on a text similarity metric (see Section 6). McCallum et al [9] use a similar technique, but also develop clustering algorithms designed to work well with large numbers of small clusters (see Section 5). With the exception of [8], all of the preceding systems have used domain-speciﬁc algorithms and data structures; the probabilistic approaches are based on a ﬁxed probability model. In previous work [10], we have suggested a declarative approach to identity uncertainty using a formal language—an extension of relational probability models [11]. Here, we describe the ﬁrst substantial application of the approach. Section 2 explains how to specify a generative probability model of the domain. The key technical point (Section 3) is that the possible worlds include not only objects and relations but also mappings from terms in the language to objects in the domain, and the probability model must include a prior over such mappings. Once the extended model has been deﬁned, Section 4 details the probability distributions used. A general-purpose inference method is applied to the model. We have found Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to be effective for this and other applications (see Section 5); here, we include a method for generating effective proposals based on ideas from [9]. The system also incorporates an EM algorithm for learning the local probability models, such as the model of how author names are abbreviated, reordered, and misspelt in citations. Section 6 evaluates the performance of four datasets originally used to test the Citeseer algorithms [1]. As well as providing signiﬁcantly better performance, our system is able to reason simultaneously about papers, authors, titles, and publication types, and does a good job of extracting this information from the grouped citations. For example, an author’s name can be identiﬁed more accurately by combining information from multiple citations of several different papers. The errors made by our system point to some interesting unmodeled aspects of the citation process. 2 RPMs Reasoning about identity requires reasoning about objects, which requires at least some of the expressive power of a ﬁrst-order logical language. Our approach builds on relational probability models (RPMs) [11], which let us specify probability models over possible worlds deﬁned by objects, properties, classes, and relations. 2.1 Basic RPMs At its most basic, an RPM, as deﬁned by Koller et al [12], consists of • A set C of classes denoting sets of objects, related by subclass/superclass relations. • A set I of named instances denoting objects, each an instance of one class. • A set A of complex attributes denoting functional relations. Each complex attribute A has a domain type Dom[A] ∈ C and a range type Range[A] ∈ C. • A set B of simple attributes denoting functions. Each simple attribute B has a domain type Dom[B] ∈ C and a range V al[B]. • A set of conditional probability models P (B|P a[B]) for the simple attributes. P a[B] is the set of B’s parents, each of which is a nonempty chain of (appropriately typed) attributes σ = A1 . · · · .An .B , where B is a simple attribute. Probability models may be attached to instances or inherited from classes. The parent links should be such that no cyclic dependencies are formed. • A set of instance statements, which set the value of a complex attribute to an instance of the appropriate class. We also use a slight variant of an additional concept from [11]: number uncertainty, which allows for multi-valued complex attributes of uncertain cardinality. We deﬁne each such attribute A as a relation rather than a function, and we associate with it a simple attribute #[A] (i.e., the number of values of A) with a domain type Dom[A] and a range {0, 1, . . . , max #[A]}. 2.2 RPMs for citations Figure 2 outlines an RPM for the example citations of Figure 1. There are four classes, the self-explanatory Author, Paper, and Citation, as well as AuthorAsCited, which represents not actual authors, but author names as they appear when cited. Each citation we wish to match leads to the creation of a Citation instance; instances of the remaining three classes are then added as needed to ﬁll all the complex attributes. E.g., for the ﬁrst citation of Figure 1, we would create a Citation instance C1 , set its text attribute to the string “Metral M. ...August 1994.”, and set its paper attribute to a newly created Paper instance, which we will call P1 . We would then introduce max(#[author]) (here only 3, for simplicity) AuthorAsCited instances (D11 , D12 , and D13 ) to ﬁll the P1 .obsAuthors (i.e., observed authors) attribute, and an equal number of Author instances (A 11 , A12 , and A13 ) to ﬁll both the P1 .authors[i] and the D1i .author attributes. (The complex attributes would be set using instance statements, which would then also constrain the cited authors to be equal to the authors of the actual paper. 2 ) Assuming (for now) that the value of C1 .parse 2 Thus, uncertainty over whether the authors are ordered correctly can be modeled using probabilistic instance statements. A11 Author A12 surname #(fnames) fnames A13 A21 D11 AuthorAsCited surname #(fnames) fnames author A22 A23 D12 D13 D21 D22 Paper D23 Citation #(authors) authors title publication type P1 P2 #(obsAuthors) obsAuthors obsTitle parse C1 C2 text paper Figure 2: An RPM for our Citeseer example. The large rectangles represent classes: the dark arrows indicate the ranges of their complex attributes, and the light arrows lay out all the probabilistic dependencies of their basic attributes. The small rectangles represent instances, linked to their classes with thick grey arrows. We omit the instance statements which set many of the complex attributes. is observed, we can set the values of all the basic attributes of the Citation and AuthorAsCited instances. (E.g., given the correct parse, D11 .surname would be set to Lashkari, and D12 .fnames would be set to (Max)). The remaining basic attributes — those of the Paper and Author instances — represent the “true” attributes of those objects, and their values are unobserved. The standard semantics of RPMs includes the unique names assumption, which precludes identity uncertainty. Under this assumption, any two papers are assumed to be different unless we know for a fact that they are the same. In other words, although there are many ways in which the terms of the language can map to the objects in a possible world, only one of these identity mappings is legal: the one with the fewest co-referring terms. It is then possible to express the RPM as an equivalent Bayesian network: each of the basic attributes of each of the objects becomes a node, with the appropriate parents and probability model. RPM inference usually involves the construction of such a network. The Bayesian network equivalent to our RPM is shown in Figure 3. 3 IDENTITY UNCERTAINTY In our application, any two citations may or may not refer to the same paper. Thus, for citations C1 and C2 , there is uncertainty as to whether the corresponding papers P 1 and P2 are in fact the same object. If they are the same, they will share one set of basic attributes; A11. surname D12. #(fnames) D12. surname A11. fnames D11. #(fnames) D12. fnames A21. #(fnames) A13. surname A12. fnames A21. fnames A13. fnames A13. #(fnames) D13. surname D11. fnames D11. surname D13. #(fnames) C1. #(authors) P1. title C1. text P1. pubtype C1. obsTitle A21. surname A23. surname A22. fnames D22. #(fnames) D12. surname D21. #(fnames) D22. fnames A23. fnames A23. #(fnames) D23. surname D21. fnames D13. fnames C1. parse A22. #(fnames) A22. surname A12. #(fnames) A12. surname A11. #(fnames) D23. fnames D21. surname D23. #(fnames) C2. #(authors) P2. title C2. parse C2. text C2. obsTitle P2. pubtype Figure 3: The Bayesian network equivalent to our RPM, assuming C 1 = C2 . if they are distinct, there will be two sets. Thus, the possible worlds of our probability model may differ in the number of random variables, and there will be no single equivalent Bayesian network. The approach we have taken to this problem [10] is to extend the representation of a possible world so that it includes not only the basic attributes of a set of objects, but also the number of objects n and an identity clustering ι, that is, a mapping from terms in the language (such as P1 ) to objects in the world. We are interested only in whether terms co-refer or not, so ι can be represented by a set of equivalence classes of terms. For example, if P1 and P2 are the only terms, and they co-refer, then ι is {{P1 , P2 }}; if they do not co-refer, then ι is {{P1 }, {P2 }}. We deﬁne a probability model for the space of extended possible worlds by specifying the prior P (n) and the conditional distribution P (ι|n). As in standard RPMs, we assume that the class of every instance is known. Hence, we can simplify these distributions further by factoring them by class, so that, e.g., P (ι) = C∈C P (ιC ). We then distinguish two cases: • For some classes (such as the citations themselves), the unique names assumptions remains appropriate. Thus, we deﬁne P (ιCitation ) to assign a probability of 1.0 to the one assignment where each citation object is unique. • For classes such as Paper and Author, whose elements are subject to identity uncertainty, we specify P (n) using a high-variance log-normal distribution. 3 Then we make appropriate uniformity assumptions to construct P (ιC ). Speciﬁcally, we assume that each paper is a priori equally likely to be cited, and that each author is a priori equally likely to write a paper. Here, “a priori” means prior to obtaining any information about the object in question, so the uniformity assumption is entirely reasonable. With these assumptions, the probability of an assignment ι C,k,m that maps k named instances to m distinct objects, when C contains n objects, is given by 1 n! P (ιC,k,m ) = (n − m)! nk When n > m, the world contains objects unreferenced by any of the terms. However, these ﬁller objects are obviously irrelevant (if they affected the attributes of some named term, they would have been named as functions of that term.) Therefore, we never have to create them, or worry about their attribute values. Our model assumes that the cardinalities and identity clusterings of the classes are independent of each other, as well as of the attribute values. We could remove these assumptions. For one, it would be straightforward to specify a class-wise dependency model for n or ι using standard Bayesian network semantics, where the network nodes correspond to the cardinality attributes of the classes. E.g., it would be reasonable to let the total number of papers depend on the total number of authors. Similarly, we could allow ι to depend on the attribute values—e.g., the frequency of citations to a given paper might depend on the fame of the authors—provided we did not introduce cyclic dependencies. 4 The Probability Model We will now ﬁll in the details of the conditional probability models. Our priors over the “true” attributes are constructed off-line, using the following resources: the 1990 Census data on US names, a large A.I. BibTeX bibliography, and a hand-parsed collection of 500 citations. We learn several bigram models (actually, linear combinations of a bigram model and a unigram model): letter-based models of ﬁrst names, surnames, and title words, as well as higher-level models of various parts of the citation string. More speciﬁcally, the values of Author.fnames and Author.surname are modeled as having a a 0.9 chance of being 3 Other models are possible; for example, in situations where objects appear and disappear, P (ι) can be modeled implicitly by specifying the arrival, transition, and departure rates [6]. drawn from the relevant US census ﬁle, and a 0.1 chance of being generated using a bigram model learned from that ﬁle. The prior over Paper.titles is deﬁned using a two-tier bigram model constructed using the bibliography, while the distributions over Author.#(fnames), Paper.#(authors), and Paper.pubType 4 are derived from our hand-parsed ﬁle. The conditional distributions of the “observed” variables given their true values (i.e., the corruption models of Citation.obsTitle, AuthorAsCited.surname, and AuthorAsCited.fnames) are modeled as noisy channels where each letter, or word, has a small probability of being deleted, or, alternatively, changed, and there is also a small probability of insertion. AuthorAsCited.fnames may also be abbreviated as an initial. The parameters of the corruption models are learnt online, using stochastic EM. Let us now return to Citation.parse, which cannot be an observed variable, since citation parsing, or even citation subﬁeld extraction, is an unsolved problem. It is therefore fortunate that our approach lets us handle uncertainty over parses so naturally. The state space of Citation.parse has two different components. First of all, it keeps track of the citation style, deﬁned as the ordering of the author and title subﬁelds, as well as the format in which the author names are written. The prior over styles is learned using our hand-segmented ﬁle. Secondly, it keeps track of the segmentation of Citation.text, which is divided into an author segment, a title segment, and three ﬁller segments (one before, one after, and one in between.) We assume a uniform distribution over segmentations. Citation.parse greatly constrains Citation.text: the title segment of Citation.text must match the value of Citation.obsTitle, while its author segment must match the combined values of the simple attributes of Citation.obsAuthors. The distributions over the remaining three segments of Citation.text are deﬁned using bigram models, with the model used for the ﬁnal segment chosen depending on the publication type. These models were, once more, learned using our pre-segmented ﬁle. 5 INFERENCE With the introduction of identity uncertainty, our model grows from a single Bayesian network to a collection of networks, one for each possible value of ι. This collection can be rather large, since the number of ways in which a set can be partitioned grows very quickly with the size of the set. 5 Exact inference is, therefore, impractical. We use an approximate method based on Markov chain Monte Carlo. 5.1 MARKOV CHAIN MONTE CARLO MCMC [13] is a well-known method for approximating an expectation over some distribution π(x), commonly used when the state space of x is too large to sum over. The weighted sum over the values of x is replaced by a sum over samples from π(x), which are generated using a Markov chain constructed to have π(x) as a stationary distribution. There are several ways of building up an appropriate Markov chain. In the Metropolis– Hastings method (M-H), transitions in the chain are constructed in two steps. First, a candidate next state x is generated from the current state x, using the (more or less arbitrary) proposal distribution q(x |x). The probability that the move to x is actually made is the acceptance probability, deﬁned as α(x |x) = min 1, π(x )q(x|x ) . π(x)q(x |x) Such a Markov chain will have the right stationary distribution π(x) as long as q is deﬁned in such a way that the chain is ergodic. It is even possible to factor q into separate proposals for various subsets of variables. In those situations, the variables that are not changed by the transition cancel in the ratio π(x )/π(x), so the required calculation can be quite simple. 4 Publication types range over {article, conference paper, book, thesis, and tech report} This sequence is described by the Bell numbers, whose asymptotic behaviour is more than exponential. 5 5.2 THE CITATION-MATCHING ALGORITHM The state space of our MCMC algorithm is the space of all the possible worlds, where each possible world contains an identity clustering ι, a set of class cardinalities n, and the values of all the basic attributes of all the objects. Since the ι is given in each world, the distribution over the attributes can be represented using a Bayesian network as described in Section 3. Therefore, the probability of a state is simply the product pf P (n), P (ι), and the probability of the hidden attributes of the network. Our algorithm uses a factored q function. One of our proposals attempts to change n using a simple random walk. The other suggests, ﬁrst, a change to ι, and then, values for all the hidden attributes of all the objects (or clusters in ι) affected by that change. The algorithm for proposing a change in ιC works as follows: Select two clusters a1 , a2 ∈ ιC 6 Create two empty clusters b1 and b2 place each instance i ∈ a1 ∪ a2 u.a.r. into b1 or b2 Propose ιC = ιC − {a1, a2} ∪ {b1, b2} Given a proposed ιC , suggesting values for the hidden attributes boils down to recovering their true values from (possibly) corrupt observations, e.g., guessing the true surname of the author currently known both as “Simth” and “Smith”. Since our title and name noise models are symmetric, our basic strategy is to apply these noise models to one of the observed values. In the case of surnames, we have the additional resource of a dictionary of common names, so, some of the time, we instead pick one of the set of dictionary entries that are within a few corruptions of our observed names. (One must, of course, careful to account for this hybrid approach in our acceptance probability calculations.) Parses are handled differently: we preprocess each citation, organizing its plausible segmentations into a list ordered in terms of descending probability. At runtime, we simply sample from these discrete distributions. Since we assume that boundaries occur only at punctuation marks, and discard segmentations of probability < 10−6 , the lists are usually quite short. 7 The publication type variables, meanwhile, are not sampled at all. Since their range is so small, we sum them out. 5.3 SCALING UP One of the acknowledged ﬂaws of the MCMC algorithm is that it often fails to scale. In this application, as the number of papers increases, the simplest approach — one where the two clusters a1 and a2 are picked u.a.r — is likely to lead to many rejected proposals, as most pairs of clusters will have little in common. The resulting Markov chain will mix slowly. Clearly, we would prefer to focus our proposals on those pairs of clusters which are actually likely to exchange their instances. We have implemented an approach based on the efﬁcient clustering algorithm of McCallum et al [9], where a cheap distance metric is used to preprocess a large dataset and fragment it into many canopies, or smaller, overlapping sets of elements that have a non-zero probability of matching. We do the same, using word-matching as our metric, and setting the thresholds to 0.5 and 0.2. Then, at runtime, our q(x |x) function proposes ﬁrst a canopy c, and then a pair of clusters u.a.r. from c. (q(x|x ) is calculated by summing over all the canopies which contain any of the elements of the two clusters.) 6 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS We have applied the MCMC-based algorithm to the hand-matched datasets used in [1]. (Each of these datasets contains several hundred citations of machine learning papers, about half of them in clusters ranging in size from two to twenty-one citations.) We have also 6 7 Note that if the same cluster is picked twice, it will probably be split. It would also be possible to sample directly from a model such as a hierarchical HMM Face Reinforcement Reasoning Constraint 349 citations, 242 papers 406 citations, 148 papers 514 citations, 296 papers 295 citations, 199 papers Phrase matching 94% 79% 86% 89% RPM + MCMC 97% 94% 96% 93% Table 1: Results on four Citeseer data sets, for the text matching and MCMC algorithms.

(They obtain their “phrases” by segmenting each citation at all punctuation marks, and then taking all the bigrams of all the segments longer than two words.) The results of our comparison are displayed in Figure 1, in terms of the Citeseer error metric. Clearly, the algorithm we have developed easily beats our implementation of phrase matching. We have also applied our algorithm to a large set of citations referring to the textbook Artiﬁcial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. It clusters most of them correctly, but there are a couple of notable exceptions. Whenever several citations share the same set of unlikely errors, they are placed together in a separate cluster. This occurs because we do not currently model the fact that erroneous citations are often copied from reference list to reference list, which could be handled by extending the model to include a copiedFrom attribute. Another possible extension would be the addition of a topic attribute to both papers and authors: tracking the authors’ research topics might enable the system to distinguish between similarly-named authors working in different ﬁelds. Generally speaking, we expect that relational probabilistic languages with identity uncertainty will be a useful tool for creating knowledge from raw data.

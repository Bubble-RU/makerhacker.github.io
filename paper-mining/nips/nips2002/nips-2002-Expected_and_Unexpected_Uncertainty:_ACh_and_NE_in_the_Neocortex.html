<p>Author: Patrik O. Hoyer, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: The responses of cortical sensory neurons are notoriously variable, with the number of spikes evoked by identical stimuli varying signiﬁcantly from trial to trial. This variability is most often interpreted as ‘noise’, purely detrimental to the sensory system. In this paper, we propose an alternative view in which the variability is related to the uncertainty, about world parameters, which is inherent in the sensory stimulus. Speciﬁcally, the responses of a population of neurons are interpreted as stochastic samples from the posterior distribution in a latent variable model. In addition to giving theoretical arguments supporting such a representational scheme, we provide simulations suggesting how some aspects of response variability might be understood in this framework.</p><p>3 0.070538573 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Derivative_Observations_in_Gaussian_Process_Models_of_Dynamic_Systems.html">65 nips-2002-Derivative Observations in Gaussian Process Models of Dynamic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: E. Solak, R. Murray-smith, W. E. Leithead, D. J. Leith, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes provide an approach to nonparametric modelling which allows a straightforward combination of function and derivative observations in an empirical model. This is of particular importance in identiﬁcation of nonlinear dynamic systems from experimental data. 1) It allows us to combine derivative information, and associated uncertainty with normal function observations into the learning and inference process. This derivative information can be in the form of priors speciﬁed by an expert or identiﬁed from perturbation data close to equilibrium. 2) It allows a seamless fusion of multiple local linear models in a consistent manner, inferring consistent models and ensuring that integrability constraints are met. 3) It improves dramatically the computational efﬁciency of Gaussian process models for dynamic system identiﬁcation, by summarising large quantities of near-equilibrium data by a handful of linearisations, reducing the training set size – traditionally a problem for Gaussian process models.</p><p>4 0.066064008 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Classification_by_Variational_Kalman_Filtering.html">21 nips-2002-Adaptive Classification by Variational Kalman Filtering</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Sykacek, Stephen J. Roberts</p><p>Abstract: We propose in this paper a probabilistic approach for adaptive inference of generalized nonlinear classiﬁcation that combines the computational advantage of a parametric solution with the ﬂexibility of sequential sampling techniques. We regard the parameters of the classiﬁer as latent states in a ﬁrst order Markov process and propose an algorithm which can be regarded as variational generalization of standard Kalman ﬁltering. The variational Kalman ﬁlter is based on two novel lower bounds that enable us to use a non-degenerate distribution over the adaptation rate. An extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed method is capable of infering competitive classiﬁers both in stationary and non-stationary environments. Although we focus on classiﬁcation, the algorithm is easily extended to other generalized nonlinear models.</p><p>5 0.056340434 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Timing_and_Partial_Observability_in_the_Dopamine_System.html">199 nips-2002-Timing and Partial Observability in the Dopamine System</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathaniel D. Daw, Aaron C. Courville, David S. Touretzky</p><p>Abstract: According to a series of inﬂuential models, dopamine (DA) neurons signal reward prediction error using a temporal-difference (TD) algorithm. We address a problem not convincingly solved in these accounts: how to maintain a representation of cues that predict delayed consequences. Our new model uses a TD rule grounded in partially observable semi-Markov processes, a formalism that captures two largely neglected features of DA experiments: hidden state and temporal variability. Previous models predicted rewards using a tapped delay line representation of sensory inputs; we replace this with a more active process of inference about the underlying state of the world. The DA system can then learn to map these inferred states to reward predictions using TD. The new model can explain previously vexing data on the responses of DA neurons in the face of temporal variability. By combining statistical model-based learning with a physiologically grounded TD theory, it also brings into contact with physiology some insights about behavior that had previously been conﬁned to more abstract psychological models.</p><p>6 0.054746058 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Spikernels%3A_Embedding_Spiking_Neurons_in_Inner-Product_Spaces.html">187 nips-2002-Spikernels: Embedding Spiking Neurons in Inner-Product Spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>6 0.48401585 <a title="81-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Adaptation_and_Unsupervised_Learning.html">18 nips-2002-Adaptation and Unsupervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Roy, Daniela D. Farias</p><p>Abstract: This paper extends our earlier analysis on approximate linear programming as an approach to approximating the cost-to-go function in a discounted-cost dynamic program [6]. In this paper, we consider the average-cost criterion and a version of approximate linear programming that generates approximations to the optimal average cost and differential cost function. We demonstrate that a naive version of approximate linear programming prioritizes approximation of the optimal average cost and that this may not be well-aligned with the objective of deriving a policy with low average cost. For that, the algorithm should aim at producing a good approximation of the differential cost function. We propose a twophase variant of approximate linear programming that allows for external control of the relative accuracy of the approximation of the differential cost function over different portions of the state space via state-relevance weights. Performance bounds suggest that the new algorithm is compatible with the objective of optimizing performance and provide guidance on appropriate choices for state-relevance weights.</p><p>3 0.5336771 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Morton-Style_Factorial_Coding_of_Color_in_Primary_Visual_Cortex.html">148 nips-2002-Morton-Style Factorial Coding of Color in Primary Visual Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Thomas Wachtler, Thomas D. Albright, Terrence Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help understand information integration and perceptual coding in the brain. We show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. We show evidence suggesting that the classical/non-classical receptive ﬁeld organization in the cortex effectively enforces the development of Morton-style factorial codes. This may provide some cues to help understand perceptual coding in the brain and to develop new unsupervised learning algorithms. While methods like ICA (Bell & Sejnowski, 1997) develop independent codes, in Morton-style coding the goal is to make two or more external aspects of the world become independent when conditioning on internal representations. In this paper we introduce the notion of Morton-style factorial coding and illustrate how it may help analyze information integration and perceptual organization in the brain. In the neurosciences factorial codes are often studied in the context of mean tuning curves. A tuning curve is called separable if it can be expressed as the product of terms selectively inﬂuenced by different stimulus dimensions. Separable tuning curves are taken as evidence of factorial coding mechanisms. In this paper we show that by focusing on average responses one may miss the existence of factorial coding mechanisms that become only apparent when analyzing spike count histograms. Morton (1969) analyzed a wide variety of psychophysical experiments on word perception and showed that they could be explained using a model in which stimulus and context have separable effects on perception. More precisely, in Mortons’ model the joint effect of stimulus and context on a perceptual representation can be obtained by multiplying terms selectively controlled by stimulus and by context, i.e.,  £ © # #</p><p>4 0.52899051 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_the_Functional_Classification_of_Neurons.html">28 nips-2002-An Information Theoretic Approach to the Functional Classification of Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>5 0.52712238 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Maximally_Informative_Dimensions%3A_Analyzing_Neural_Responses_to_Natural_Signals.html">141 nips-2002-Maximally Informative Dimensions: Analyzing Neural Responses to Natural Signals</a></p>

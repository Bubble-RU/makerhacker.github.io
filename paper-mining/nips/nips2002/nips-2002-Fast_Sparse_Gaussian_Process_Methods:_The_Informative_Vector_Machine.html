<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces an algorithm for the automatic relevance determination of input variables in kernelized Support Vector Machines. Relevance is measured by scale factors deﬁning the input space metric, and feature selection is performed by assigning zero weights to irrelevant variables. The metric is automatically tuned by the minimization of the standard SVM empirical risk, where scale factors are added to the usual set of parameters deﬁning the classiﬁer. Feature selection is achieved by constraints encouraging the sparsity of scale factors. The resulting algorithm compares favorably to state-of-the-art feature selection procedures and demonstrates its effectiveness on a demanding facial expression recognition problem.</p><p>3 0.15748939 <a title="86-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Incremental_Gaussian_Processes.html">110 nips-2002-Incremental Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Joaquin Quiñonero-candela, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider Tipping’s relevance vector machine (RVM) [1] and formalize an incremental training strategy as a variant of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that we call Subspace EM (SSEM). Working with a subset of active basis functions, the sparsity of the RVM solution will ensure that the number of basis functions and thereby the computational complexity is kept low. We also introduce a mean ﬁeld approach to the intractable classiﬁcation model that is expected to give a very good approximation to exact Bayesian inference and contains the Laplace approximation as a special case. We test the algorithms on two large data sets with O(103 − 104 ) examples. The results indicate that Bayesian learning of large data sets, e.g. the MNIST database is realistic.</p><p>4 0.15312092 <a title="86-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Derivative_Observations_in_Gaussian_Process_Models_of_Dynamic_Systems.html">65 nips-2002-Derivative Observations in Gaussian Process Models of Dynamic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: E. Solak, R. Murray-smith, W. E. Leithead, D. J. Leith, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian processes provide an approach to nonparametric modelling which allows a straightforward combination of function and derivative observations in an empirical model. This is of particular importance in identiﬁcation of nonlinear dynamic systems from experimental data. 1) It allows us to combine derivative information, and associated uncertainty with normal function observations into the learning and inference process. This derivative information can be in the form of priors speciﬁed by an expert or identiﬁed from perturbation data close to equilibrium. 2) It allows a seamless fusion of multiple local linear models in a consistent manner, inferring consistent models and ensuring that integrability constraints are met. 3) It improves dramatically the computational efﬁciency of Gaussian process models for dynamic system identiﬁcation, by summarising large quantities of near-equilibrium data by a handful of linearisations, reducing the training set size – traditionally a problem for Gaussian process models.</p><p>5 0.14279915 <a title="86-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Anton Schwaighofer, Volker Tresp, Peter Mayer, Alexander K. Scheel, Gerhard A. Müller</p><p>Abstract: We describe the RA scanner, a novel system for the examination of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis. The RA scanner is based on a novel laser-based imaging technique which is sensitive to the optical characteristics of ﬁnger joint tissue. Based on the laser images, ﬁnger joints are classiﬁed according to whether the inﬂammatory status has improved or worsened. To perform the classiﬁcation task, various linear and kernel-based systems were implemented and their performances were compared. Special emphasis was put on measures to reliably perform parameter tuning and evaluation, since only a very small data set was available. Based on the results presented in this paper, it was concluded that the RA scanner permits a reliable classiﬁcation of pathological ﬁnger joints, thus paving the way for a further development from prototype to product stage.</p><p>4 0.71583372 <a title="86-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Coulomb_Classifiers%3A_Generalizing_Support_Vector_Machines_via_an_Analogy_to_Electrostatic_Systems.html">62 nips-2002-Coulomb Classifiers: Generalizing Support Vector Machines via an Analogy to Electrostatic Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael C. Mozer, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of classiﬁers based on a physical analogy to an electrostatic system of charged conductors. The family, called Coulomb classiﬁers, includes the two best-known support-vector machines (SVMs), the ν–SVM and the C–SVM. In the electrostatics analogy, a training example corresponds to a charged conductor at a given location in space, the classiﬁcation function corresponds to the electrostatic potential function, and the training objective function corresponds to the Coulomb energy. The electrostatic framework provides not only a novel interpretation of existing algorithms and their interrelationships, but it suggests a variety of new methods for SVMs including kernels that bridge the gap between polynomial and radial-basis functions, objective functions that do not require positive-deﬁnite kernels, regularization techniques that allow for the construction of an optimal classiﬁer in Minkowski space. Based on the framework, we propose novel SVMs and perform simulation studies to show that they are comparable or superior to standard SVMs. The experiments include classiﬁcation tasks on data which are represented in terms of their pairwise proximities, where a Coulomb Classiﬁer outperformed standard SVMs. 1</p><p>5 0.68419099 <a title="86-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Transductive_and_Inductive_Methods_for_Approximate_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">201 nips-2002-Transductive and Inductive Methods for Approximate Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Anton Schwaighofer, Volker Tresp</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian process regression allows a simple analytical treatment of exact Bayesian inference and has been found to provide good performance, yet scales badly with the number of training data. In this paper we compare several approaches towards scaling Gaussian processes regression to large data sets: the subset of representers method, the reduced rank approximation, online Gaussian processes, and the Bayesian committee machine. Furthermore we provide theoretical insight into some of our experimental results. We found that subset of representers methods can give good and particularly fast predictions for data sets with high and medium noise levels. On complex low noise data sets, the Bayesian committee machine achieves signiﬁcantly better accuracy, yet at a higher computational cost.</p><p>6 0.67408013 <a title="86-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Scaling_for_Feature_Selection_in_SVMs.html">24 nips-2002-Adaptive Scaling for Feature Selection in SVMs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaz Kandola, Nello Cristianini, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: The standard representation of text documents as bags of words suffers from well known limitations, mostly due to its inability to exploit semantic similarity between terms. Attempts to incorporate some notion of term similarity include latent semantic indexing [8], the use of semantic networks [9], and probabilistic methods [5]. In this paper we propose two methods for inferring such similarity from a corpus. The first one defines word-similarity based on document-similarity and viceversa, giving rise to a system of equations whose equilibrium point we use to obtain a semantic similarity measure. The second method models semantic relations by means of a diffusion process on a graph defined by lexicon and co-occurrence information. Both approaches produce valid kernel functions parametrised by a real number. The paper shows how the alignment measure can be used to successfully perform model selection over this parameter. Combined with the use of support vector machines we obtain positive results. 1</p><p>3 0.88958353 <a title="86-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Complexity_of_Learning_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">156 nips-2002-On the Complexity of Learning the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Daniel Herrmann</p><p>Abstract: We investigate data based procedures for selecting the kernel when learning with Support Vector Machines. We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors ﬁx. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overﬁtting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.</p><p>4 0.88438952 <a title="86-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Adapting_Codes_and_Embeddings_for_Polychotomies.html">19 nips-2002-Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunnar Rätsch, Sebastian Mika, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider formulations of multi-class problems based on a generalized notion of a margin and using output coding. This includes, but is not restricted to, standard multi-class SVM formulations. Differently from many previous approaches we learn the code as well as the embedding function. We illustrate how this can lead to a formulation that allows for solving a wider range of problems with for instance many classes or even “missing classes”. To keep our optimization problems tractable we propose an algorithm capable of solving them using twoclass classiﬁers, similar in spirit to Boosting.</p><p>5 0.88340056 <a title="86-lda-5" href="./nips-2002-Dyadic_Classification_Trees_via_Structural_Risk_Minimization.html">72 nips-2002-Dyadic Classification Trees via Structural Risk Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation trees are one of the most popular types of classiﬁers, with ease of implementation and interpretation being among their attractive features. Despite the widespread use of classiﬁcation trees, theoretical analysis of their performance is scarce. In this paper, we show that a new family of classiﬁcation trees, called dyadic classiﬁcation trees (DCTs), are near optimal (in a minimax sense) for a very broad range of classiﬁcation problems. This demonstrates that other schemes (e.g., neural networks, support vector machines) cannot perform signiﬁcantly better than DCTs in many cases. We also show that this near optimal performance is attained with linear (in the number of training data) complexity growing and pruning algorithms. Moreover, the performance of DCTs on benchmark datasets compares favorably to that of standard CART, which is generally more computationally intensive and which does not possess similar near optimality properties. Our analysis stems from theoretical results on structural risk minimization, on which the pruning rule for DCTs is based.</p><p>6 0.88234586 <a title="86-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: The extraction of a single high-quality image from a set of lowresolution images is an important problem which arises in fields such as remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging and the extraction of still images from video. Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high resolution image to the observed low resolution images, using regularization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registration parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-resolution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images. Results indicate a significant improvement over techniques based on MAP (maximum a-posteriori) point optimization of the high resolution image and associated registration parameters. 1</p><p>3 0.075317174 <a title="150-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Learning_Variance_Components_of_Natural_Images.html">10 nips-2002-A Model for Learning Variance Components of Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>4 0.073412329 <a title="150-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Information_Regularization_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">114 nips-2002-Information Regularization with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation with partially labeled data requires using a large number of unlabeled examples (or an estimated marginal P (x)), to further constrain the conditional P (y|x) beyond a few available labeled examples. We formulate a regularization approach to linking the marginal and the conditional in a general way. The regularization penalty measures the information that is implied about the labels over covering regions. No parametric assumptions are required and the approach remains tractable even for continuous marginal densities P (x). We develop algorithms for solving the regularization problem for ﬁnite covers, establish a limiting differential equation, and exemplify the behavior of the new regularization approach in simple cases.</p><p>5 0.070710771 <a title="150-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Dynamic_Structure_Super-Resolution.html">74 nips-2002-Dynamic Structure Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: The problem of super-resolution involves generating feasible higher resolution images, which are pleasing to the eye and realistic, from a given low resolution image. This might be attempted by using simple ﬁlters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean ﬁeld approach. 1</p><p>6 0.067965239 <a title="150-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>

<p>Author: William T. Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: The goal of low-level vision is to estimate an underlying scene, given an observed image. Real-world scenes (eg, albedos or shapes) can be very complex, conventionally requiring high dimensional representations which are hard to estimate and store. We propose a low-dimensional representation, called a scene recipe, that relies on the image itself to describe the complex scene conﬁgurations. Shape recipes are an example: these are the regression coefﬁcients that predict the bandpassed shape from image data. We describe the beneﬁts of this representation, and show two uses illustrating their properties: (1) we improve stereo shape estimates by learning shape recipes at low resolution and applying them at full resolution; (2) Shape recipes implicitly contain information about lighting and materials and we use them for material segmentation.</p><p>5 0.51818544 <a title="150-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Low rank approximation techniques are widespread in pattern recognition research — they include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic LSA, Principal Components Analysus (PCA), the Generative Aspect Model, and many forms of bibliometric analysis. All make use of a low-dimensional manifold onto which data are projected. Such techniques are generally “unsupervised,” which allows them to model data in the absence of labels or categories. With many practical problems, however, some prior knowledge is available in the form of context. In this paper, I describe a principled approach to incorporating such information, and demonstrate its application to PCA-based approximations of several data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.51596391 <a title="150-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Fast_Transformation-Invariant_Factor_Analysis.html">87 nips-2002-Fast Transformation-Invariant Factor Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Schneidman, William Bialek, Michael Ii</p><p>Abstract: A population of neurons typically exhibits a broad diversity of responses to sensory inputs. The intuitive notion of functional classiﬁcation is that cells can be clustered so that most of the diversity is captured by the identity of the clusters rather than by individuals within clusters. We show how this intuition can be made precise using information theory, without any need to introduce a metric on the space of stimuli or responses. Applied to the retinal ganglion cells of the salamander, this approach recovers classical results, but also provides clear evidence for subclasses beyond those identiﬁed previously. Further, we ﬁnd that each of the ganglion cells is functionally unique, and that even within the same subclass only a few spikes are needed to reliably distinguish between cells. 1</p><p>3 0.54890382 <a title="150-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-Nash_Propagation_for_Loopy_Graphical_Games.html">152 nips-2002-Nash Propagation for Loopy Graphical Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Luis E. Ortiz, Michael Kearns</p><p>Abstract: We introduce NashProp, an iterative and local message-passing algorithm for computing Nash equilibria in multi-player games represented by arbitrary undirected graphs. We provide a formal analysis and experimental evidence demonstrating that NashProp performs well on large graphical games with many loops, often converging in just a dozen iterations on graphs with hundreds of nodes. NashProp generalizes the tree algorithm of (Kearns et al. 2001), and can be viewed as similar in spirit to belief propagation in probabilistic inference, and thus complements the recent work of (Vickrey and Koller 2002), who explored a junction tree approach. Thus, as for probabilistic inference, we have at least two promising general-purpose approaches to equilibria computation in graphs.</p><p>4 0.44725597 <a title="150-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-A_Model_for_Real-Time_Computation_in_Generic_Neural_Microcircuits.html">11 nips-2002-A Model for Real-Time Computation in Generic Neural Microcircuits</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data, in face of multiple conﬂicting structures, is inherent to modeling of complex data. Extracting structure in one random variable that is relevant for another variable has been principally addressed recently via the information bottleneck method [15]. However, such auxiliary variables often contain more information than is actually required due to structures that are irrelevant for the task. In many other cases it is in fact easier to specify what is irrelevant than what is, for the task at hand. Identifying the relevant structures, however, can thus be considerably improved by also minimizing the information about another, irrelevant, variable. In this paper we give a general formulation of this problem and derive its formal, as well as algorithmic, solution. Its operation is demonstrated in a synthetic example and in two real world problems in the context of text categorization and face images. While the original information bottleneck problem is related to rate distortion theory, with the distortion measure replaced by the relevant information, extracting relevant features while removing irrelevant ones is related to rate distortion with side information.</p><p>5 0.2158519 <a title="8-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Informed_Projections.html">115 nips-2002-Informed Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Low rank approximation techniques are widespread in pattern recognition research — they include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic LSA, Principal Components Analysus (PCA), the Generative Aspect Model, and many forms of bibliometric analysis. All make use of a low-dimensional manifold onto which data are projected. Such techniques are generally “unsupervised,” which allows them to model data in the absence of labels or categories. With many practical problems, however, some prior knowledge is available in the form of context. In this paper, I describe a principled approach to incorporating such information, and demonstrate its application to PCA-based approximations of several data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.19988096 <a title="8-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Inferring_a_Semantic_Representation_of_Text_via_Cross-Language_Correlation_Analysis.html">112 nips-2002-Inferring a Semantic Representation of Text via Cross-Language Correlation Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Lebanon, John D. Lafferty</p><p>Abstract: A distance-based conditional model on the ranking poset is presented for use in classiﬁcation and ranking. The model is an extension of the Mallows model, and generalizes the classiﬁer combination methods used by several ensemble learning algorithms, including error correcting output codes, discrete AdaBoost, logistic regression and cranking. The algebraic structure of the ranking poset leads to a simple Bayesian interpretation of the conditional model and its special cases. In addition to a unifying view, the framework suggests a probabilistic interpretation for error correcting output codes and an extension beyond the binary coding scheme.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.77363616 <a title="8-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-A_Maximum_Entropy_Approach_to_Collaborative_Filtering_in_Dynamic%2C_Sparse%2C_High-Dimensional_Domains.html">8 nips-2002-A Maximum Entropy Approach to Collaborative Filtering in Dynamic, Sparse, High-Dimensional Domains</a></p>

<p>Author: Cody Kwok, Dieter Fox, Marina Meila</p><p>Abstract: Particle ﬁlters estimate the state of dynamical systems from sensor information. In many real time applications of particle ﬁlters, however, sensor information arrives at a signiﬁcantly higher rate than the update rate of the ﬁlter. The prevalent approach to dealing with such situations is to update the particle ﬁlter as often as possible and to discard sensor information that cannot be processed in time. In this paper we present real-time particle ﬁlters, which make use of all sensor information even when the ﬁlter update rate is below the update rate of the sensors. This is achieved by representing posteriors as mixtures of sample sets, where each mixture component integrates one observation arriving during a ﬁlter update. The weights of the mixture components are set so as to minimize the approximation error introduced by the mixture representation. Thereby, our approach focuses computational resources (samples) on valuable sensor information. Experiments using data collected with a mobile robot show that our approach yields strong improvements over other approaches.</p><p>4 0.6206972 <a title="8-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Gaussian_Process_Priors_with_Uncertain_Inputs_Application_to_Multiple-Step_Ahead_Time_Series_Forecasting.html">95 nips-2002-Gaussian Process Priors with Uncertain Inputs Application to Multiple-Step Ahead Time Series Forecasting</a></p>

For a state-space model of the form , the prediction of at time is based on the point estimates of the previous outputs.

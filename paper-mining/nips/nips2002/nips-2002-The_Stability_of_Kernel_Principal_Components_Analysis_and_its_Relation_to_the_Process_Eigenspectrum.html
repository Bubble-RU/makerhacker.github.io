</p><p>5 In this paper we study the stability of the subspace of feature space extracted by kernel peA with respect to the sample of size m, and relate this to the feature space that would be extracted in the infinite sample-size limit. [sent-23, score-0.774]

</p><p>7 However, these results gave deviation bounds on the sampling variability the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix, but did not address the relationship of sample and population eigenvalues, or the estimation problem of the residual of peA on new data. [sent-27, score-0.518]
</p><p>8 In section 2 we provide background on the continuous kernel eigenproblem, and the relationship between the eigenvalues of certain matrices and the expected residuals when projecting into spaces of dimension k. [sent-29, score-0.664]
</p><p>9 Section 3 provides inequality relationships between the process eigenvalues and the expectation of the Gram matrix eigenvalues. [sent-30, score-0.567]
</p><p>10 Section 4 presents some concentration results and uses these to develop an approximate chain of inequalities. [sent-31, score-0.195]
</p><p>11 In section 5 we obtain a performance bound on kernel peA, relating the performance on the training sample to the expected performance wrt p(x). [sent-32, score-0.304]
</p><p>12 1  Background The kernel eigenproblern  For a given kernel function k(·,·) the m x m Gram matrix K has entries k(Xi,Xj), i, j = 1, . [sent-34, score-0.475]
</p><p>13 We denote the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix as Al 2: A2 . [sent-42, score-0.422]
</p><p>14 2: Am 2: 0 and write its eigendecomposition as K = zAz' where A is a diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues and Z' denotes the transpose of matrix Z. [sent-45, score-0.549]
</p><p>15 The eigenvalues are also referred to as the spectrum of the Gram matrix. [sent-46, score-0.377]
</p><p>16 We now describe the relationship between the eigenvalues of the Gram matrix and those of the underlying process. [sent-47, score-0.422]
</p><p>17 For a given kernel function and density p(x) on a space X, we can also write down the eigenfunction problem  Ix  k(x,Y)P(X)¢i(X) dx = AiC/Ji(Y)·  (1)  Note that the eigenfunctions are orthonormal with respect to p(x), i. [sent-48, score-0.507]

</p><p>19 This continuous eigenproblem can be approximated in the following way. [sent-55, score-0.046]
</p><p>20 Then as pointed out in Williams and Seeger (2000), we can approximate the integral with weight function p(x) by an average over the sample points, and then plug in Y = Xj for j = 1, . [sent-60, score-0.122]

</p><p>25 The measure they use compares the whole spectrum rather than individual eigenvalues or subsets of eigenvalues. [sent-76, score-0.377]
</p><p>26 2  Projections, residuals and eigenvalues  The approach adopted in the proofs of the next section is to relate the eigenvalues to the sums of squares of residuals. [sent-79, score-0.876]
</p><p>27 Let X be a random variable in d dimensions, and let X be a d x m matrix containing m sample vectors Xl, . [sent-80, score-0.224]
</p><p>28 Consider the m x m matrix M = XIX with eigendecomposition M = zAz'. [sent-84, score-0.127]
</p><p>29 Then taking X = Z we obtain a finite dimensional version of Mercer's theorem. [sent-85, score-0.044]
</p><p>30 To set the scene, we now present a short description of the residuals viewpoint. [sent-86, score-0.155]
</p><p>31 The starting point is the singular value decomposition of X = UY',Z' , where U and Z are orthonormal matrices and Y', is a diagonal matrix containing the singular  VA  values (in descending order). [sent-87, score-0.269]
</p><p>32 We can now reconstruct the eigenvalue decomposition of M = X'X = Z~U'U~Z' = zAz', where A = ~2. [sent-88, score-0.058]
</p><p>33 But equally we can construct a d x d matrix N = X X' = U~Z' Z~U' = u Au', with the same eigenvalues as M. [sent-89, score-0.422]
</p><p>34 Note that N = mCx , where C x is the sample correlation matrix. [sent-91, score-0.083]
</p><p>35 Let V be a linear space spanned by k linearly independent vectors. [sent-92, score-0.155]
</p><p>36 Let Pv(x) (PV(x)) be the projection of x onto V (space perpendicular to V), so that IlxW = IIPv(x)112 + IIPv(x)112. [sent-93, score-0.14]
</p><p>37 Using the Courant-Fisher minimax theorem it can be proved (Shawe-Taylor et al. [sent-94, score-0.153]
</p><p>38 (2) dim(V)=k i=k+1 j=l i=l j=l Hence the subspace spanned by the first k eigenvectors is characterised as that for which the sum of the squares of the residuals is minimal. [sent-102, score-0.433]
</p><p>39 3  Residuals in feature space  Frequently, we consider all of the above as occurring in a kernel defined feature space, so that wherever we have written a vector x we should have put 'l/J(x), where 'l/J is the corresponding feature map 'l/J : x E X f---t 'l/J(x) E F to a feature space F. [sent-107, score-0.695]
</p><p>40 Hence, the matrix M has entries Mij = ('l/J(Xi),'l/J(Xj)). [sent-108, score-0.133]
</p><p>41 The kernel function computes the composition of the inner product with the feature maps, k(x , z) = ('l/J(x) , 'l/J(z)) = 'l/J(x)''l/J(z) , which can in many cases be computed without explicitly evaluating the mapping 'l/J. [sent-109, score-0.262]
</p><p>42 We would also like to evaluate the projections into eigenspaces without explicitly computing the feature mapping 'l/J . [sent-110, score-0.091]
</p><p>43 Let Ui be the i-th singular vector in the feature space, that is the i-th eigenvector of the matrix N, with the corresponding singular value being O"i = ~ and the corresponding eigenvector of M being Zi. [sent-112, score-0.309]
</p><p>44 The projection of an input x onto Ui is given by 'l/J(X)'Ui = ('l/J(X)'U)i = ('l/J(x)' X Z)W;l = k'ZW;l, where we have used the fact that X = U~Z' and k j = 'l/J(x)''l/J(Xj) = k(x,xj). [sent-113, score-0.14]
</p><p>45 Our final background observation concerns the kernel operator and its eigenspaces. [sent-114, score-0.273]
</p><p>46 The operator in question is  K(f)(x) =  Ix  k(x, z)J(z)p(z)dz. [sent-115, score-0.061]
</p><p>47 Provided the operator is positive semi-definite, by Mercer's theorem we can decompose k(x,z) as a sum of eigenfunctions, k(x,z) = L :1 AiC! [sent-116, score-0.163]
</p><p>48 Ji(X) ¢i(Z) = ('l/J(x), 'l/J(z)), where the functions (¢i(X)) ~l form a complete orthonormal basis with respect to the inner product (j, g)p = J(x)g(x)p(x)dx and 'l/J(x) is the feature space mapping  Ix  'l/J : x --+ (1Pi(X)):l = ( A¢i(X)):l E F. [sent-117, score-0.194]
</p><p>49 Note that ¢i(X) has norm 1 and satisfies Ai¢i(x) = 1) , so that  Ai =  Ix k(x, z)¢i(z)p(z)dz (equation  r iX2 k(y, Z) ¢i(Y)¢i (Z)p(Z)p(y)dydz. [sent-118, score-0.153]
</p><p>50 (3)  If we let cf>(x) = (cPi(X)):l E F, we can define the unit vector U i E F corresponding to Ai by Ui = cPi(x)cf>(x)p(x)dx. [sent-119, score-0.057]
</p><p>51 Similarly, k  L:Ai i=l  max lE [llPv(1jJ(x)) 112] = lE [111jJ(x)112] min lE [IIPv(1jJ(x))112] , dim(V)=k dim(V)=k  00  (5) where Pv(1jJ(x)) (PV(1jJ(x))) is the projection of 1jJ(x) into the subspace V (the projection of 1jJ(x) into the space orthogonal to V). [sent-123, score-0.407]
</p><p>52 We consider the general case of a kernel defined feature space with input space X and probability density p(x). [sent-126, score-0.47]
</p><p>53 We fix a sample size m and a draw of m examples S = (Xl, X2 , . [sent-127, score-0.157]
</p><p>54 Let V be the space spanned by k the first k eigenvectors of the sample kernel matrix K with corresponding eigenvalues '\1, '\2,"" '\k, while Vk is the space spanned by the first k process eigenvectors with corresponding eigenvalues A1 , A2 , . [sent-132, score-1.57]
</p><p>55 , Ak ' Similarly, let E[J(x)] denote expectation with respect to the sample, E[J(x)] = ~ 2:::1 J(Xi), while as before lE[·] denotes expectation with respect to p. [sent-135, score-0.157]
</p><p>56 Bounding the difference between the first and second will relate the process eigenvalues to the sample eigenvalues, while the difference between t he first and third will bound the expected performance of the space identified by kernel PCA when used on new data. [sent-137, score-0.865]
</p><p>57 (7)  i=l Our strategy will be to show that the right hand side of inequality (6) and the left hand side of inequality (7) are close in value making the two inequalit ies approximately a chain of inequalities. [sent-139, score-0.13]
</p><p>58 We then bound the difference between the first and last entries in the chain. [sent-140, score-0.137]

</p><p>65 Again, applying the expectation operator Em to both sides of this equation and taking equation (5) into account, the first inequality follows. [sent-172, score-0.194]
</p><p>66 0 Applying the results obtained in this section, it follows that Em [ILl] will overestimate A1, and the cumulative sum 2::=1Em [ILi ] will overestimate 2::=1Ai. [sent-176, score-0.086]

</p><p>69 We have Theorem 3 Let K(x, z) be a positive semi-definite kernel function on a space X, and let p be a probability density function on X. [sent-180, score-0.328]

</p><p>73 This follows by a similar derivation to Theorem 5 in Shawe-Taylor et al. [sent-186, score-0.051]
</p><p>74 Our next result concerns the concentration of the residuals with respect to a fixed subspace. [sent-188, score-0.351]

</p><p>81 It remains to bound the difference between the first and last entries in this chain. [sent-202, score-0.137]
</p><p>82 This together with the concentration results of this section will deliver the required bounds on the differences between empirical and process eigenvalues, as well as providing a performance bound on kernel peA. [sent-203, score-0.426]

<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Daniel Herrmann</p><p>Abstract: We investigate data based procedures for selecting the kernel when learning with Support Vector Machines. We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors ﬁx. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overﬁtting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.</p><p>3 0.16821398 <a title="197-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Effective_Dimension_and_Generalization_of_Kernel_Learning.html">77 nips-2002-Effective Dimension and Generalization of Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Joseph Keshet, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: The focus of the paper is the problem of learning kernel operators from empirical data. We cast the kernel design problem as the construction of an accurate kernel from simple (and less accurate) base kernels. We use the boosting paradigm to perform the kernel construction process. To do so, we modify the booster so as to accommodate kernel operators. We also devise an efﬁcient weak-learner for simple kernels that is based on generalized eigen vector decomposition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and on the USPS dataset. On the USPS dataset, the performance of the Perceptron algorithm with learned kernels is systematically better than a ﬁxed RBF kernel. 1 Introduction and problem Setting The last decade brought voluminous amount of work on the design, analysis and experimentation of kernel machines. Algorithm based on kernels can be used for various machine learning tasks such as classiﬁcation, regression, ranking, and principle component analysis. The most prominent learning algorithm that employs kernels is the Support Vector Machines (SVM) [1, 2] designed for classiﬁcation and regression. A key component in a kernel machine is a kernel operator which computes for any pair of instances their inner-product in some abstract vector space. Intuitively and informally, a kernel operator is a means for measuring similarity between instances. Almost all of the work that employed kernel operators concentrated on various machine learning problems that involved a predeﬁned kernel. A typical approach when using kernels is to choose a kernel before learning starts. Examples to popular predeﬁned kernels are the Radial Basis Functions and the polynomial kernels (see for instance [1]). Despite the simplicity required in modifying a learning algorithm to a “kernelized” version, the success of such algorithms is not well understood yet. More recently, special efforts have been devoted to crafting kernels for speciﬁc tasks such as text categorization [3] and protein classiﬁcation problems [4]. Our work attempts to give a computational alternative to predeﬁned kernels by learning kernel operators from data. We start with a few deﬁnitions. Let X be an instance space. A kernel is an inner-product operator K : X × X → . An explicit way to describe K is via a mapping φ : X → H from X to an inner-products space H such that K(x, x ) = φ(x)·φ(x ). Given a kernel operator and a ﬁnite set of instances S = {xi , yi }m , the kernel i=1 matrix (a.k.a the Gram matrix) is the matrix of all possible inner-products of pairs from S, Ki,j = K(xi , xj ). We therefore refer to the general form of K as the kernel operator and to the application of the kernel operator to a set of pairs of instances as the kernel matrix.   The speciﬁc setting of kernel design we consider assumes that we have access to a base kernel learner and we are given a target kernel K manifested as a kernel matrix on a set of examples. Upon calling the base kernel learner it returns a kernel operator denote Kj . The goal thereafter is to ﬁnd a weighted combination of kernels ˆ K(x, x ) = j αj Kj (x, x ) that is similar, in a sense that will be deﬁned shortly, to ˆ the target kernel, K ∼ K . Cristianini et al. [5] in their pioneering work on kernel target alignment employed as the notion of similarity the inner-product between the kernel matrices < K, K >F = m K(xi , xj )K (xi , xj ). Given this deﬁnition, they deﬁned the i,j=1 kernel-similarity, or alignment, to be the above inner-product normalized by the norm of ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ each kernel, A(S, K, K ) = < K, K >F / < K, K >F < K , K >F , where S is, as above, a ﬁnite sample of m instances. Put another way, the kernel alignment Cristianini et al. employed is the cosine of the angle between the kernel matrices where each matrix is “ﬂattened” into a vector of dimension m2 . Therefore, this deﬁnition implies that the alignment is bounded above by 1 and can attain this value iff the two kernel matrices are identical. Given a (column) vector of m labels y where yi ∈ {−1, +1} is the label of the instance xi , Cristianini et al. used the outer-product of y as the the target kernel, ˆ K = yy T . Therefore, an optimal alignment is achieved if K(xi , xj ) = yi yj . Clearly, if such a kernel is used for classifying instances from X , then the kernel itself sufﬁces to construct an excellent classiﬁer f : X → {−1, +1} by setting, f (x) = sign(y i K(xi , x)) where (xi , yi ) is any instance-label pair. Cristianini et al. then devised a procedure that works with both labelled and unlabelled examples to ﬁnd a Gram matrix which attains a good alignment with K on the labelled part of the matrix. While this approach can clearly construct powerful kernels, a few problems arise from the notion of kernel alignment they employed. For instance, a kernel operator such that the sign(K(x i , xj )) is equal to yi yj but its magnitude, |K(xi , xj )|, is not necessarily 1, might achieve a poor alignment score while it can constitute a classiﬁer whose empirical loss is zero. Furthermore, the task of ﬁnding a good kernel when it is not always possible to ﬁnd a kernel whose sign on each pair of instances is equal to the products of the labels (termed the soft-margin case in [5, 6]) becomes rather tricky. We thus propose a different approach which attempts to overcome some of the difﬁculties above. Like Cristianini et al. we assume that we are given a set of labelled instances S = {(xi , yi ) | xi ∈ X , yi ∈ {−1, +1}, i = 1, . . . , m} . We are also given a set of unlabelled m ˜ ˜ examples S = {˜i }i=1 . If such a set is not provided we can simply use the labelled inx ˜ ˜ stances (without the labels themselves) as the set S. The set S is used for constructing the ˆ primitive kernels that are combined to constitute the learned kernel K. The labelled set is used to form the target kernel matrix and its instances are used for evaluating the learned ˆ kernel K. This approach, known as transductive learning, was suggested in [5, 6] for kernel alignment tasks when the distribution of the instances in the test data is different from that of the training data. This setting becomes in particular handy in datasets where the test data was collected in a different scheme than the training data. We next discuss the notion of kernel goodness employed in this paper. This notion builds on the objective function that several variants of boosting algorithms maintain [7, 8]. We therefore ﬁrst discuss in brief the form of boosting algorithms for kernels. 2 Using Boosting to Combine Kernels Numerous interpretations of AdaBoost and its variants cast the boosting process as a procedure that attempts to minimize, or make small, a continuous bound on the classiﬁcation error (see for instance [9, 7] and the references therein). A recent work by Collins et al. [8] uniﬁes the boosting process for two popular loss functions, the exponential-loss (denoted henceforth as ExpLoss) and logarithmic-loss (denoted as LogLoss) that bound the empir- ˜ ˜ Input: Labelled and unlabelled sets of examples: S = {(xi , yi )}m ; S = {˜i }m x i=1 i=1 Initialize: K ← 0 (all zeros matrix) For t = 1, 2, . . . , T : • Calculate distribution over pairs 1 ≤ i, j ≤ m: Dt (i, j) = exp(−yi yj K(xi , xj )) 1/(1 + exp(−yi yj K(xi , xj ))) ExpLoss LogLoss ˜ • Call base-kernel-learner with (Dt , S, S) and receive Kt • Calculate: + − St = {(i, j) | yi yj Kt (xi , xj ) > 0} ; St = {(i, j) | yi yj Kt (xi , xj ) < 0} + Wt = (i,j)∈S + Dt (i, j)|Kt (xi , xj )| ; Wt− = (i,j)∈S − Dt (i, j)|Kt (xi , xj )| t t 1 2 + Wt − Wt • Set: αt = ln ; K ← K + α t Kt .

Given the prediction of a classiﬁer f on an instance x and a label y ∈ {−1, +1} the ExpLoss and the LogLoss are deﬁned as, ExpLoss(f (x), y) = exp(−yf (x)) LogLoss(f (x), y) = log(1 + exp(−yf (x))) . Collins et al. described a single algorithm for the two losses above that can be used within the boosting framework to construct a strong-hypothesis which is a classiﬁer f (x). This classiﬁer is a weighted combination of (possibly very simple) base classiﬁers. (In the boosting framework, the base classiﬁers are referred to as weak-hypotheses.) The strongT hypothesis is of the form f (x) = t=1 αt ht (x). Collins et al. discussed a few ways to select the weak-hypotheses ht and to ﬁnd a good of weights αt . Our starting point in this paper is the ﬁrst sequential algorithm from [8] that enables the construction or creation of weak-hypotheses on-the-ﬂy. We would like to note however that it is possible to use other variants of boosting to design kernels. In order to use boosting to design kernels we extend the algorithm to operate over pairs of instances. Building on the notion of alignment from [5, 6], we say that the inner-product of x1 and x2 is aligned with the labels y1 and y2 if sign(K(x1 , x2 )) = y1 y2 . Furthermore, we would like to make the magnitude of K(x, x ) to be as large as possible. We therefore use one of the following two alignment losses for a pair of examples (x 1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ), ExpLoss(K(x1 , x2 ), y1 y2 ) = exp(−y1 y2 K(x1 , x2 )) LogLoss(K(x1 , x2 ), y1 y2 ) = log(1 + exp(−y1 y2 K(x1 , x2 ))) . Put another way, we view a pair of instances as a single example and cast the pairs of instances that attain the same label as positively labelled examples while pairs of opposite labels are cast as negatively labelled examples. Clearly, this approach can be applied to both losses. In the boosting process we therefore maintain a distribution over pairs of instances. The weight of each pair reﬂects how difﬁcult it is to predict whether the labels of the two instances are the same or different. The core boosting algorithm follows similar lines to boosting algorithms for classiﬁcation algorithm. The pseudo code of the booster is given in Fig. 1. The pseudo-code is an adaptation the to problem of kernel design of the sequentialupdate algorithm from [8]. As with other boosting algorithm, the base-learner, which in our case is charge of returning a good kernel with respect to the current distribution, is left unspeciﬁed. We therefore turn our attention to the algorithmic implementation of the base-learning algorithm for kernels. 3 Learning Base Kernels The base kernel learner is provided with a training set S and a distribution D t over a pairs ˜ of instances from the training set. It is also provided with a set of unlabelled examples S. Without any knowledge of the topology of the space of instances a learning algorithm is likely to fail. Therefore, we assume the existence of an initial inner-product over the input space. We assume for now that this initial inner-product is the standard scalar products over vectors in n . We later discuss a way to relax the assumption on the form of the inner-product. Equipped with an inner-product, we deﬁne the family of base kernels to be the possible outer-products Kw = wwT between a vector w ∈ n and itself.     Using this deﬁnition we get, Kw (xi , xj ) = (xi ·w)(xj ·w) . Input: A distribution Dt .

First, we assume ˜ that w is restricted to a linear combination of vectors from S. Second, since scaling of the base kernels is performed by the boosted, we constrain the norm of w to be 1. The m ˜ resulting class of kernels is therefore, C = {Kw = wwT | w = r=1 βr xr , w = 1} . ˜ In the boosting process we need to choose a speciﬁc base-kernel K w from C. We therefore need to devise a notion of how good a candidate for base kernel is given a labelled set S and a distribution function Dt . In this work we use the simplest version suggested by Collins et al. This version can been viewed as a linear approximation on the loss function. We deﬁne the score of a kernel Kw w.r.t to the current distribution Dt to be,         Score(Kw ) = Dt (i, j)yi yj Kw (xi , xj ) . (1) i,j The higher the value of the score is, the better Kw ﬁts the training data. Note that if Dt (i, j) = 1/m2 (as is D0 ) then Score(Kw ) is proportional to the alignment since w = 1. Under mild assumptions the score can also provide a lower bound of the loss function. To see that let c be the derivative of the loss function at margin zero, c = Loss (0) . If all the √ training examples xi ∈ S lies in a ball of radius c, we get that Loss(Kw (xi , xj ), yi yj ) ≥ 1 − cKw (xi , xj )yi yj ≥ 0, and therefore, i,j Dt (i, j)Loss(Kw (xi , xj ), yi yj ) ≥ 1 − c Dt (i, j)Kw (xi , xj )yi yj . i,j Using the explicit form of Kw in the Score function (Eq. (1)) we get, Score(Kw ) = i,j D(i, j)yi yj (w·xi )(w·xj ) . Further developing the above equation using the constraint that w = m ˜ r=1 βr xr we get, ˜ Score(Kw ) = βs βr r,s i,j D(i, j)yi yj (xi · xr ) (xj · xs ) . ˜ ˜ To compute efﬁciently the base kernel score without an explicit enumeration we exploit the fact that if the initial distribution D0 is symmetric (D0 (i, j) = D0 (j, i)) then all the distributions generated along the run of the boosting process, D t , are also symmetric. We ˜ now deﬁne a matrix A ∈ m×m where Ai,r = xi · xr and a symmetric matrix B ∈ m×m ˜ with Bi,j = Dt (i, j)yi yj . Simple algebraic manipulations yield that the score function can be written as the following quadratic form, Score(β) = β T (AT BA)β , where β is m dimensional column vector. Note that since B is symmetric so is A T BA. Finding a ˜ good base kernel is equivalent to ﬁnding a vector β which maximizes this quadratic form 2 m ˜ under the norm equality constraint w = ˜ 2 = β T Kβ = 1 where Kr,s = r=1 βr xr xr · xs . Finding the maximum of Score(β) subject to the norm constraint is a well known ˜ ˜ maximization problem known as the generalized eigen vector problem (cf. [10]). Applying simple algebraic manipulations it is easy to show that the matrix AT BA is positive semideﬁnite. Assuming that the matrix K is invertible, the the vector β which maximizes the quadratic form is proportional the eigenvector of K −1 AT BA which is associated with the m ˜ generalized largest eigenvalue. Denoting this vector by v we get that w ∝ ˜ r=1 vr xr . m ˜ m ˜ Adding the norm constraint we get that w = ( r=1 vr xr )/ ˜ vr xr . The skeleton ˜ r=1 of the algorithm for ﬁnding a base kernels is given in Fig. 3. To conclude the description of the kernel learning algorithm we describe how to the extend the algorithm to be employed with general kernel functions.     Kernelizing the Kernel: As described above, we assumed that the standard scalarproduct constitutes the template for the class of base-kernels C. However, since the proce˜ dure for choosing a base kernel depends on S and S only through the inner-products matrix A, we can replace the scalar-product itself with a general kernel operator κ : X × X → , where κ(xi , xj ) = φ(xi ) · φ(xj ). Using a general kernel function κ we can not compute however the vector w explicitly. We therefore need to show that the norm of w, and evaluation Kw on any two examples can still be performed efﬁciently.   First note that given the vector v we can compute the norm of w as follows, T w 2 = vr xr ˜ vs xr ˜ r s = vr vs κ(˜r , xs ) . x ˜ r,s Next, given two vectors xi and xj the value of their inner-product is, Kw (xi , xj ) = vr vs κ(xi , xr )κ(xj , xs ) . ˜ ˜ r,s Therefore, although we cannot compute the vector w explicitly we can still compute its norm and evaluate any of the kernels from the class C. 4 Experiments Synthetic data: We generated binary-labelled data using as input space the vectors in 100 . The labels, in {−1, +1}, were picked uniformly at random. Let y designate the label of a particular example. Then, the ﬁrst two components of each instance were drawn from a two-dimensional normal distribution, N (µ, ∆ ∆−1 ) with the following parameters,   µ=y 0.03 0.03 1 ∆= √ 2 1 −1 1 1 = 0.1 0 0 0.01 . That is, the label of each examples determined the mean of the distribution from which the ﬁrst two components were generated.

For each of the two settings we show the ﬁrst two components of the training data (left) and the matrix of inner products between the train and the test data (right). altogether) were generated independently using the normal distribution with a zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.05. We generated 100 training and test sets of size 300 and 200 respectively. We used the standard dot-product as the initial kernel operator. On each experiment we ﬁrst learned a linear classier that separates the classes using the Perceptron [11] algorithm. We ran the algorithm for 10 epochs on the training set. After each epoch we evaluated the performance of the current classiﬁer on the test set. We then used the boosting algorithm for kernels with the LogLoss for 30 rounds to build a kernel for each random training set. After learning the kernel we re-trained a classiﬁer with the Perceptron algorithm and recorded the results. A summary of the online performance is given in Fig. 4. The plot on the left-hand-side of the ﬁgure shows the instantaneous error (achieved during the run of the algorithm). Clearly, the Perceptron algorithm with the learned kernel converges much faster than the original kernel. The middle plot shows the test error after each epoch. The plot on the right shows the test error on a noisy test set in which we added a Gaussian noise of zero mean and a standard deviation of 0.03 to the ﬁrst two features. In all plots, each bar indicates a 95% conﬁdence level. It is clear from the ﬁgure that the original kernel is much slower to converge than the learned kernel. Furthermore, though the kernel learning algorithm was not expoed to the test set noise, the learned kernel reﬂects better the structure of the feature space which makes the learned kernel more robust to noise. Fig. 3 further illustrates the beneﬁts of using a boutique kernel. The ﬁrst and third plots from the left correspond to results obtained using the original kernel and the second and fourth plots show results using the learned kernel. The left plots show the empirical distribution of the two informative components on the test data. For the learned kernel we took each input vector and projected it onto the two eigenvectors of the learned kernel operator matrix that correspond to the two largest eigenvalues. Note that the distribution after the projection is bimodal and well separated along the ﬁrst eigen direction (x-axis) and shows rather little deviation along the second eigen direction (y-axis). This indicates that the kernel learning algorithm indeed found the most informative projection for separating the labelled data with large margin. It is worth noting that, in this particular setting, any algorithm which chooses a single feature at a time is prone to failure since both the ﬁrst and second features are mandatory for correctly classifying the data. The two plots on the right hand side of Fig. 3 use a gray level color-map to designate the value of the inner-product between each pairs instances, one from training set (y-axis) and the other from the test set. The examples were ordered such that the ﬁrst group consists of the positively labelled instances while the second group consists of the negatively labelled instances. Since most of the features are non-relevant the original inner-products are noisy and do not exhibit any structure. In contrast, the inner-products using the learned kernel yields in a 2 × 2 block matrix indicating that the inner-products between instances sharing the same label obtain large positive values. Similarly, for instances of opposite 200 1 12 Regular Kernel Learned Kernel 0.8 17 0.7 16 0.5 0.4 0.3 Test Error % 8 0.6 Regular Kernel Learned Kernel 18 10 Test Error % Averaged Cumulative Error % 19 Regular Kernel Learned Kernel 0.9 6 4 15 14 13 12 0.2 11 2 0.1 10 0 0 10 1 10 2 10 Round 3 10 4 10 0 2 4 6 Epochs 8 10 9 2 4 6 Epochs 8 10 Figure 4: The online training error (left), test error (middle) on clean synthetic data using a standard kernel and a learned kernel. Right: the online test error for the two kernels on a noisy test set. labels the inner products are large and negative. The form of the inner-products matrix of the learned kernel indicates that the learning problem itself becomes much easier. Indeed, the Perceptron algorithm with the standard kernel required around 94 training examples on the average before converging to a hyperplane which perfectly separates the training data while using the Perceptron algorithm with learned kernel required a single example to reach a perfect separation on all 100 random training sets. USPS dataset: The USPS (US Postal Service) dataset is known as a challenging classiﬁcation problem in which the training set and the test set were collected in a different manner. The USPS contains 7, 291 training examples and 2, 007 test examples. Each example is represented as a 16 × 16 matrix where each entry in the matrix is a pixel that can take values in {0, . . . , 255}. Each example is associated with a label in {0, . . . , 9} which is the digit content of the image. Since the kernel learning algorithm is designed for binary problems, we broke the 10-class problem into 45 binary problems by comparing all pairs of classes. The interesting question of how to learn kernels for multiclass problems is beyond the scopre of this short paper. We thus constraint on the binary error results for the 45 binary problem described above. For the original kernel we chose a RBF kernel with σ = 1 which is the value employed in the experiments reported in [12]. We used the kernelized version of the kernel design algorithm to learn a different kernel operator for each of the binary problems. We then used a variant of the Perceptron [11] and with the original RBF kernel and with the learned kernels. One of the motivations for using the Perceptron is its simplicity which can underscore differences in the kernels. We ran the kernel learning al˜ gorithm with LogLoss and ExpLoss, using bith the training set and the test test as S. Thus, we obtained four different sets of kernels where each set consists of 45 kernels. By examining the training loss, we set the number of rounds of boosting to be 30 for the LogLoss and 50 for the ExpLoss, when using the trainin set. When using the test set, the number of rounds of boosting was set to 100 for both losses. Since the algorithm exhibits slower rate of convergence with the test data, we choose a a higher value without attempting to optimize the actual value. The left plot of Fig. 5 is a scatter plot comparing the test error of each of the binary classiﬁers when trained with the original RBF a kernel versus the performance achieved on the same binary problem with a learned kernel. The kernels were built ˜ using boosting with the LogLoss and S was the training data. In almost all of the 45 binary classiﬁcation problems, the learned kernels yielded lower error rates when combined with the Perceptron algorithm. The right plot of Fig. 5 compares two learned kernels: the ﬁrst ˜ was build using the training instances as the templates constituing S while the second used the test instances. Although the differenece between the two versions is not as signiﬁcant as the difference on the left plot, we still achieve an overall improvement in about 25% of the binary problems by using the test instances. 6 4.5 4 5 Learned Kernel (Test) Learned Kernel (Train) 3.5 4 3 2 3 2.5 2 1.5 1 1 0.5 0 0 1 2 3 Base Kernel 4 5 6 0 0 1 2 3 Learned Kernel (Train) 4 5 Figure 5: Left: a scatter plot comparing the error rate of 45 binary classiﬁers trained using an RBF kernel (x-axis) and a learned kernel with training instances.

Our approach is especially appealing in transductive learning tasks where the test data distribution is different than the the distribution of the training data. For example, in speech recognition tasks the training data is often clean and well recorded while the test data often passes through a noisy channel that distorts the signal. An interesting and challanging question that stem from this research is how to extend the framework to accommodate more complex decision tasks such as multiclass and regression problems. Finally, we would like to note alternative approaches to the kernel design problem has been devised in parallel and independently. See [13, 14] for further details.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We investigate the generalization performance of some learning problems in Hilbert function Spaces. We introduce a concept of scalesensitive effective data dimension, and show that it characterizes the convergence rate of the underlying learning problem. Using this concept, we can naturally extend results for parametric estimation problems in ﬁnite dimensional spaces to non-parametric kernel learning methods. We derive upper bounds on the generalization performance and show that the resulting convergent rates are optimal under various circumstances.</p><p>3 0.71529579 <a title="197-lsi-3" href="./nips-2002-On_the_Complexity_of_Learning_the_Kernel_Matrix.html">156 nips-2002-On the Complexity of Learning the Kernel Matrix</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Daniel Herrmann</p><p>Abstract: We investigate data based procedures for selecting the kernel when learning with Support Vector Machines. We provide generalization error bounds by estimating the Rademacher complexities of the corresponding function classes. In particular we obtain a complexity bound for function classes induced by kernels with given eigenvectors, i.e., we allow to vary the spectrum and keep the eigenvectors ﬁx. This bound is only a logarithmic factor bigger than the complexity of the function class induced by a single kernel. However, optimizing the margin over such classes leads to overﬁtting. We thus propose a suitable way of constraining the class. We use an efﬁcient algorithm to solve the resulting optimization problem, present preliminary experimental results, and compare them to an alignment-based approach.</p><p>4 0.66924739 <a title="197-lsi-4" href="./nips-2002-Hyperkernels.html">106 nips-2002-Hyperkernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Cheng S. Ong, Robert C. Williamson, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of choosing a kernel suitable for estimation using a Gaussian Process estimator or a Support Vector Machine. A novel solution is presented which involves deﬁning a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space on the space of kernels itself. By utilizing an analog of the classical representer theorem, the problem of choosing a kernel from a parameterized family of kernels (e.g. of varying width) is reduced to a statistical estimation problem akin to the problem of minimizing a regularized risk functional. Various classical settings for model or kernel selection are special cases of our framework.</p><p>5 0.59333402 <a title="197-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Robust_Novelty_Detection_with_Single-Class_MPM.html">178 nips-2002-Robust Novelty Detection with Single-Class MPM</a></p>

<p>Author: David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Low rank approximation techniques are widespread in pattern recognition research — they include Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Probabilistic LSA, Principal Components Analysus (PCA), the Generative Aspect Model, and many forms of bibliometric analysis. All make use of a low-dimensional manifold onto which data are projected. Such techniques are generally “unsupervised,” which allows them to model data in the absence of labels or categories. With many practical problems, however, some prior knowledge is available in the form of context. In this paper, I describe a principled approach to incorporating such information, and demonstrate its application to PCA-based approximations of several data sets. 1</p><p>2 0.95768857 <a title="197-lda-2" href="./nips-2002-Adaptive_Nonlinear_System_Identification_with_Echo_State_Networks.html">22 nips-2002-Adaptive Nonlinear System Identification with Echo State Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Max Welling, Richard S. Zemel, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: Boosting algorithms and successful applications thereof abound for classiﬁcation and regression learning problems, but not for unsupervised learning. We propose a sequential approach to adding features to a random ﬁeld model by training them to improve classiﬁcation performance between the data and an equal-sized sample of “negative examples” generated from the model’s current estimate of the data density. Training in each boosting round proceeds in three stages: ﬁrst we sample negative examples from the model’s current Boltzmann distribution. Next, a feature is trained to improve classiﬁcation performance between data and negative examples. Finally, a coefﬁcient is learned which determines the importance of this feature relative to ones already in the pool. Negative examples only need to be generated once to learn each new feature. The validity of the approach is demonstrated on binary digits and continuous synthetic data.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.9431206 <a title="197-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-The_Stability_of_Kernel_Principal_Components_Analysis_and_its_Relation_to_the_Process_Eigenspectrum.html">197 nips-2002-The Stability of Kernel Principal Components Analysis and its Relation to the Process Eigenspectrum</a></p>

<p>Author: Pascal Vincent, Yoshua Bengio</p><p>Abstract: The similarity between objects is a fundamental element of many learning algorithms. Most non-parametric methods take this similarity to be ﬁxed, but much recent work has shown the advantages of learning it, in particular to exploit the local invariances in the data or to capture the possibly non-linear manifold on which most of the data lies. We propose a new non-parametric kernel density estimation method which captures the local structure of an underlying manifold through the leading eigenvectors of regularized local covariance matrices. Experiments in density estimation show signiﬁcant improvements with respect to Parzen density estimators. The density estimators can also be used within Bayes classiﬁers, yielding classiﬁcation rates similar to SVMs and much superior to the Parzen classiﬁer.</p><p>6 0.69182295 <a title="197-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Optimality_of_Reinforcement_Learning_Algorithms_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">159 nips-2002-Optimality of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: The problem of super-resolution involves generating feasible higher resolution images, which are pleasing to the eye and realistic, from a given low resolution image. This might be attempted by using simple ﬁlters for smoothing out the high resolution blocks or through applications where substantial prior information is used to imply the textures and shapes which will occur in the images. In this paper we describe an approach which lies between the two extremes. It is a generic unsupervised method which is usable in all domains, but goes beyond simple smoothing methods in what it achieves. We use a dynamic tree-like architecture to model the high resolution data. Approximate conditioning on the low resolution image is achieved through a mean ﬁeld approach. 1</p><p>3 0.29017588 <a title="57-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2002-Learning_to_Detect_Natural_Image_Boundaries_Using_Brightness_and_Texture.html">132 nips-2002-Learning to Detect Natural Image Boundaries Using Brightness and Texture</a></p>

<p>Author: Yan Karklin, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for learning efﬁcient codes of higher-order structure in natural images. The model, a non-linear generalization of independent component analysis, replaces the standard assumption of independence for the joint distribution of coefﬁcients with a distribution that is adapted to the variance structure of the coefﬁcients of an efﬁcient image basis. This offers a novel description of higherorder image structure and provides a way to learn coarse-coded, sparsedistributed representations of abstract image properties such as object location, scale, and texture.</p><p>5 0.18523163 <a title="57-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Learning_About_Multiple_Objects_in_Images%3A_Factorial_Learning_without_Factorial_Search.html">122 nips-2002-Learning About Multiple Objects in Images: Factorial Learning without Factorial Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: We consider data which are images containing views of multiple objects. Our task is to learn about each of the objects present in the images. This task can be approached as a factorial learning problem, where each image must be explained by instantiating a model for each of the objects present with the correct instantiation parameters. A major problem with learning a factorial model is that as the number of objects increases, there is a combinatorial explosion of the number of conﬁgurations that need to be considered. We develop a method to extract object models sequentially from the data by making use of a robust statistical method, thus avoiding the combinatorial explosion, and present results showing successful extraction of objects from real images.</p><p>6 0.14965355 <a title="57-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Bayesian_Image_Super-Resolution.html">39 nips-2002-Bayesian Image Super-Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping, Christopher M. Bishop</p><p>Abstract: The extraction of a single high-quality image from a set of lowresolution images is an important problem which arises in fields such as remote sensing, surveillance, medical imaging and the extraction of still images from video. Typical approaches are based on the use of cross-correlation to register the images followed by the inversion of the transformation from the unknown high resolution image to the observed low resolution images, using regularization to resolve the ill-posed nature of the inversion process. In this paper we develop a Bayesian treatment of the super-resolution problem in which the likelihood function for the image registration parameters is based on a marginalization over the unknown high-resolution image. This approach allows us to estimate the unknown point spread function, and is rendered tractable through the introduction of a Gaussian process prior over images. Results indicate a significant improvement over techniques based on MAP (maximum a-posteriori) point optimization of the high resolution image and associated registration parameters. 1</p><p>6 0.52989697 <a title="57-lsi-6" href="./nips-2002-Recovering_Articulated_Model_Topology_from_Observed_Rigid_Motion.html">172 nips-2002-Recovering Articulated Model Topology from Observed Rigid Motion</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric P. Xing, Michael I. Jordan, Stuart Russell, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms rely critically on being given a good metric over their inputs. For instance, data can often be clustered in many “plausible” ways, and if a clustering algorithm such as K-means initially fails to ﬁnd one that is meaningful to a user, the only recourse may be for the user to manually tweak the metric until sufﬁciently good clusters are found. For these and other applications requiring good metrics, it is desirable that we provide a more systematic way for users to indicate what they consider “similar.” For instance, we may ask them to provide examples. In this paper, we present an algorithm that, given examples of similar (and, , learns a distance metric over if desired, dissimilar) pairs of points in that respects these relationships. Our method is based on posing metric learning as a convex optimization problem, which allows us to give efﬁcient, local-optima-free algorithms. We also demonstrate empirically that the learned metrics can be used to signiﬁcantly improve clustering performance. £ ¤¢ £ ¥¢</p><p>4 0.69593841 <a title="57-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We present an automatic alignment procedure which maps the disparate internal representations learned by several local dimensionality reduction experts into a single, coherent global coordinate system for the original data space. Our algorithm can be applied to any set of experts, each of which produces a low-dimensional local representation of a highdimensional input. Unlike recent efforts to coordinate such models by modifying their objective functions [1, 2], our algorithm is invoked after training and applies an efﬁcient eigensolver to post-process the trained models. The post-processing has no local optima and the size of the system it must solve scales with the number of local models rather than the number of original data points, making it more efﬁcient than model-free algorithms such as Isomap [3] or LLE [4]. 1 Introduction: Local vs. Global Dimensionality Reduction Beyond density modelling, an important goal of unsupervised learning is to discover compact, informative representations of high-dimensional data. If the data lie on a smooth low dimensional manifold, then an excellent encoding is the coordinates internal to that manifold. The process of determining such coordinates is dimensionality reduction. Linear dimensionality reduction methods such as principal component analysis and factor analysis are easy to train but cannot capture the structure of curved manifolds. Mixtures of these simple unsupervised models [5, 6, 7, 8] have been used to perform local dimensionality reduction, and can provide good density models for curved manifolds, but unfortunately such mixtures cannot do dimensionality reduction. They do not describe a single, coherent low-dimensional coordinate system for the data since there is no pressure for the local coordinates of each component to agree. Roweis et al [1] recently proposed a model which performs global coordination of local coordinate systems in a mixture of factor analyzers (MFA). Their model is trained by maximizing the likelihood of the data, with an additional variational penalty term to encourage the internal coordinates of the factor analyzers to agree. While their model can trade off modelling the data and having consistent local coordinate systems, it requires a user given trade-off parameter, training is quite inefﬁcient (although [2] describes an improved training algorithm for a more constrained model), and it has quite serious local minima problems (methods like LLE [4] or Isomap [3] have to be used for initialization). In this paper we describe a novel, automatic way to align the hidden representations used by each component of a mixture of dimensionality reducers into a single global representation of the data throughout space. Given an already trained mixture, the alignment is achieved by applying an eigensolver to a matrix constructed from the internal representations of the mixture components. Our method is efﬁcient, simple to implement, and has no local optima in its optimization nor any learning rates or annealing schedules. 2 The Locally Linear Coordination Algorithm H 9¥ EI¡ CD66B9 ©9B 766 % G F 5 #</p><p>6 0.69207621 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Stability-Based_Model_Selection.html">188 nips-2002-Stability-Based Model Selection</a></p>

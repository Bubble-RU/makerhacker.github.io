<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new algorithmic framework for learning multiclass categorization problems. In this framework a multiclass predictor is composed of a pair of embeddings that map both instances and labels into a common space. In this space each instance is assigned the label it is nearest to. We outline and analyze an algorithm, termed Bunching, for learning the pair of embeddings from labeled data. A key construction in the analysis of the algorithm is the notion of probabilistic output codes, a generalization of error correcting output codes (ECOC). Furthermore, the method of multiclass categorization using ECOC is shown to be an instance of Bunching. We demonstrate the advantage of Bunching over ECOC by comparing their performance on numerous categorization problems.</p><p>5 0.12799954 <a title="58-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Learning_for_Label_Sequences_via_Boosting.html">69 nips-2002-Discriminative Learning for Label Sequences via Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Yasemin Altun, Thomas Hofmann, Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a boosting approach to discriminative learning of label sequences based on a sequence rank loss function. The proposed method combines many of the advantages of boosting schemes with the efficiency of dynamic programming methods and is attractive both, conceptually and computationally. In addition, we also discuss alternative approaches based on the Hamming loss for label sequences. The sequence boosting algorithm offers an interesting alternative to methods based on HMMs and the more recently proposed Conditional Random Fields. Applications areas for the presented technique range from natural language processing and information extraction to computational biology. We include experiments on named entity recognition and part-of-speech tagging which demonstrate the validity and competitiveness of our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.12053751 <a title="58-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Constraint_Classification_for_Multiclass_Classification_and_Ranking.html">59 nips-2002-Constraint Classification for Multiclass Classification and Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Dmitry Y. Pavlov, David M. Pennock</p><p>Abstract: We develop a maximum entropy (maxent) approach to generating recommendations in the context of a user’s current navigation stream, suitable for environments where data is sparse, high-dimensional, and dynamic— conditions typical of many recommendation applications. We address sparsity and dimensionality reduction by ﬁrst clustering items based on user access patterns so as to attempt to minimize the apriori probability that recommendations will cross cluster boundaries and then recommending only within clusters. We address the inherent dynamic nature of the problem by explicitly modeling the data as a time series; we show how this representational expressivity ﬁts naturally into a maxent framework. We conduct experiments on data from ResearchIndex, a popular online repository of over 470,000 computer science documents. We show that our maxent formulation outperforms several competing algorithms in ofﬂine tests simulating the recommendation of documents to ResearchIndex users.</p><p>3 0.49428388 <a title="58-lda-3" href="./nips-2002-A_Minimal_Intervention_Principle_for_Coordinated_Movement.html">9 nips-2002-A Minimal Intervention Principle for Coordinated Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Emanuel Todorov, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Behavioral goals are achieved reliably and repeatedly with movements rarely reproducible in their detail. Here we offer an explanation: we show that not only are variability and goal achievement compatible, but indeed that allowing variability in redundant dimensions is the optimal control strategy in the face of uncertainty. The optimal feedback control laws for typical motor tasks obey a “minimal intervention” principle: deviations from the average trajectory are only corrected when they interfere with the task goals. The resulting behavior exhibits task-constrained variability, as well as synergetic coupling among actuators—which is another unexplained empirical phenomenon.</p><p>4 0.48901466 <a title="58-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Adapting_Codes_and_Embeddings_for_Polychotomies.html">19 nips-2002-Adapting Codes and Embeddings for Polychotomies</a></p>

<p>Author: Agathe Girard, Carl Edward Rasmussen, Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, Roderick Murray-Smith</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multi-step ahead prediction in time series analysis using the non-parametric Gaussian process model. -step ahead forecasting of a discrete-time non-linear dynamic system can be performed by doing repeated one-step ahead predictions. For a state-space model of the form , the prediction of at time is based on the point estimates of the previous outputs. In this paper, we show how, using an analytical Gaussian approximation, we can formally incorporate the uncertainty about intermediate regressor values, thus updating the uncertainty on the current prediction.   ¡ % # ¢ ¡     ¢ ¡¨ ¦ ¤ ¢ $</p><p>6 0.48858622 <a title="58-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Nash_Propagation_for_Loopy_Graphical_Games.html">152 nips-2002-Nash Propagation for Loopy Graphical Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Classiﬁcation with partially labeled data requires using a large number of unlabeled examples (or an estimated marginal P (x)), to further constrain the conditional P (y|x) beyond a few available labeled examples. We formulate a regularization approach to linking the marginal and the conditional in a general way. The regularization penalty measures the information that is implied about the labels over covering regions. No parametric assumptions are required and the approach remains tractable even for continuous marginal densities P (x). We develop algorithms for solving the regularization problem for ﬁnite covers, establish a limiting differential equation, and exemplify the behavior of the new regularization approach in simple cases.</p><p>4 0.1937359 <a title="135-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Learning_for_Label_Sequences_via_Boosting.html">69 nips-2002-Discriminative Learning for Label Sequences via Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: Tilman Lange, Mikio L. Braun, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Model selection is linked to model assessment, which is the problem of comparing different models, or model parameters, for a speciﬁc learning task. For supervised learning, the standard practical technique is crossvalidation, which is not applicable for semi-supervised and unsupervised settings. In this paper, a new model assessment scheme is introduced which is based on a notion of stability. The stability measure yields an upper bound to cross-validation in the supervised case, but extends to semi-supervised and unsupervised problems. In the experimental part, the performance of the stability measure is studied for model order selection in comparison to standard techniques in this area.</p><p>6 0.16221136 <a title="135-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2002-Cluster_Kernels_for_Semi-Supervised_Learning.html">52 nips-2002-Cluster Kernels for Semi-Supervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Most text categorization systems use simple models of documents and document collections. In this paper we describe a technique that improves a simple web page classiﬁer’s performance on pages from a new, unseen web site, by exploiting link structure within a site as well as page structure within hub pages. On real-world test cases, this technique signiﬁcantly and substantially improves the accuracy of a bag-of-words classiﬁer, reducing error rate by about half, on average. The system uses a variant of co-training to exploit unlabeled data from a new site. Pages are labeled using the base classiﬁer; the results are used by a restricted wrapper-learner to propose potential “main-category anchor wrappers”; and ﬁnally, these wrappers are used as features by a third learner to ﬁnd a categorization of the site that implies a simple hub structure, but which also largely agrees with the original bag-of-words classiﬁer.</p><p>5 0.59574014 <a title="135-lsi-5" href="./nips-2002-Discriminative_Learning_for_Label_Sequences_via_Boosting.html">69 nips-2002-Discriminative Learning for Label Sequences via Boosting</a></p>

<p>Author: David Fass, Jacob Feldman</p><p>Abstract: We present an account of human concept learning-that is, learning of categories from examples-based on the principle of minimum description length (MDL). In support of this theory, we tested a wide range of two-dimensional concept types, including both regular (simple) and highly irregular (complex) structures, and found the MDL theory to give a good account of subjects' performance. This suggests that the intrinsic complexity of a concept (that is, its description -length) systematically influences its leamability. 1- The Structure of Categories A number of different principles have been advanced to explain the manner in which humans learn to categorize objects. It has been variously suggested that the underlying principle might be the similarity structure of objects [1], the manipulability of decision bound~ aries [2], or Bayesian inference [3][4]. While many of these theories are mathematically well-grounded and have been successful in explaining a range of experimental findings, they have commonly only been tested on a narrow collection of concept types similar to the simple unimodal categories of Figure 1(a-e). (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) Figure 1: Categories similar to those previously studied. Lines represent contours of equal probability. All except (e) are unimodal. ~http://ruccs.rutgers.edu/~jacob/feldman.html Moreover, in the scarce research that has ventured to look beyond simple category types, the goal has largely been to investigate categorization performance for isolated irregular distributions, rather than to present a survey of performance across a range of interesting distributions.

<p>Author: Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We extend recent work on the connection between loopy belief propagation and the Bethe free energy. Constrained minimization of the Bethe free energy can be turned into an unconstrained saddle-point problem. Both converging double-loop algorithms and standard loopy belief propagation can be interpreted as attempts to solve this saddle-point problem. Stability analysis then leads us to conclude that stable ﬁxed points of loopy belief propagation must be (local) minima of the Bethe free energy. Perhaps surprisingly, the converse need not be the case: minima can be unstable ﬁxed points. We illustrate this with an example and discuss implications. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.88557643 <a title="135-lda-4" href="./nips-2002-Learning_with_Multiple_Labels.html">135 nips-2002-Learning with Multiple Labels</a></p>

<p>Author: Wim Wiegerinck, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We consider loopy belief propagation for approximate inference in probabilistic graphical models. A limitation of the standard algorithm is that clique marginals are computed as if there were no loops in the graph. To overcome this limitation, we introduce fractional belief propagation. Fractional belief propagation is formulated in terms of a family of approximate free energies, which includes the Bethe free energy and the naive mean-ﬁeld free as special cases. Using the linear response correction of the clique marginals, the scale parameters can be tuned. Simulation results illustrate the potential merits of the approach.</p><p>6 0.64987206 <a title="135-lda-6" href="./nips-2002-Data-Dependent_Bounds_for_Bayesian_Mixture_Methods.html">64 nips-2002-Data-Dependent Bounds for Bayesian Mixture Methods</a></p>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2005-73-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2769-fast-biped-walking-with-a-reflexive-controller-and-real-time-policy-searching.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Tao Geng, Bernd Porr, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present our design and experiments of a planar biped robot (“RunBot”) under pure reﬂexive neuronal control. The goal of this study is to combine neuronal mechanisms with biomechanics to obtain very fast speed and the on-line learning of circuit parameters. Our controller is built with biologically inspired sensor- and motor-neuron models, including local reﬂexes and not employing any kind of position or trajectory-tracking control algorithm. Instead, this reﬂexive controller allows RunBot to exploit its own natural dynamics during critical stages of its walking gait cycle. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time that dynamic biped walking is achieved using only a pure reﬂexive controller. In addition, this structure allows using a policy gradient reinforcement learning algorithm to tune the parameters of the reﬂexive controller in real-time during walking. This way RunBot can reach a relative speed of 3.5 leg-lengths per second after a few minutes of online learning, which is faster than that of any other biped robot, and is also comparable to the fastest relative speed of human walking. In addition, the stability domain of stable walking is quite large supporting this design strategy. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2008-108-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3604-integrating-locally-learned-causal-structures-with-overlapping-variables.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: David Danks, Clark Glymour, Robert E. Tillman</p><p>Abstract: In many domains, data are distributed among datasets that share only some variables; other recorded variables may occur in only one dataset. While there are asymptotically correct, informative algorithms for discovering causal relationships from a single dataset, even with missing values and hidden variables, there have been no such reliable procedures for distributed data with overlapping variables. We present a novel, asymptotically correct procedure that discovers a minimal equivalence class of causal DAG structures using local independence information from distributed data of this form and evaluate its performance using synthetic and real-world data against causal discovery algorithms for single datasets and applying Structural EM, a heuristic DAG structure learning procedure for data with missing values, to the concatenated data.</p><br/>

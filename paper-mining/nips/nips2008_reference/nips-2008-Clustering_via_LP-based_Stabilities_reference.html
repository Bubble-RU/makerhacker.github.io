<h1>48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2008-48-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3478-clustering-via-lp-based-stabilities.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><br/>

The models generalize matrix factorization to a supervised learning problem that utilizes attributes of entities in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Previously variational Bayes inference was applied for SRMs, which is, however, not scalable when the size of either entity set grows to tens of thousands. In this paper, we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for equivalent models of SRMs in order to scale the computation to very large dyadic data sets. Both superior scalability and predictive accuracy are demonstrated on a collaborative ﬁltering problem, which involves tens of thousands users and half million items. 1 Stochastic Relational Models Stochastic relational models (SRMs) [15] are generalizations of Gaussian process (GP) models [11] to the relational domain, where each observation is a dyadic datum, indexed by a pair of entities. They model dyadic data by a multiplicative interaction of two Gaussian process priors. Let U be the feature representation (or index) space of a set of entities. A pair-wise similarity in U is given by a kernel (covariance) function Σ : U × U → R. A Gaussian process (GP) deﬁnes a random function f : U → R, whose distribution is characterized by a mean function and the covariance function Σ, denoted by f ∼ N∞ (0, Σ)1 , where, for simplicity, we assume the mean to be the constant zero. GP complies with the intuition regarding the smoothness — if two entities ui and uj are similar according to Σ, then f (ui ) and f (uj ) are similar with a high probability. A domain of dyadic data must involve another set of entities, let it be represented (or indexed) by V. In a similar way, this entity set is associated with another kernel function Ω. For example, in a typical collaborative ﬁltering domain, U represents users while V represents items, then, Σ measures the similarity between users and Ω measures the similarity between items. Being the relation between a pair of entities from different sets, a dyadic variable y is indexed by the product space U × V. Then an SRM aims to model y(u, v) by the following generative process, Model 1. The generative model of an SRM: 1. Draw kernel functions Σ ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ), and Ω ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Ω◦ ); 2. For k = 1, . . . , d: draw random functions fk ∼ N∞ (0, Σ), and gk ∼ N∞ (0, Ω); 1 We denote an n dimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix Σ by Nn (0, Σ). Then N∞ (0, Σ) explicitly indicates that a GP follows an “inﬁnite dimensional” Gaussian distribution. 1 3. For each pair (u, v): draw y(u, v) ∼ p(y(u, v)|z(u, v), γ), where d 1 z(u, v) = √ fk (u)gk (v) + b(u, v). d k=1 In this model, IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ) and IW ∞ (δ, Ω◦ ) are hyper priors, whose details will be introduced later. p(y|z, γ) is the problem-speciﬁc noise model. For example, it can follow a Gaussian noise distribution y ∼ N1 (z, γ) if y is numerical, or, a Bernoulli distribution if y is binary. Function b(u, v) is the bias function over the U × V. For simplicity, we assume b(u, v) = 0. In the limit d → ∞, the model converges to a special case where fk and gk can be analytically marginalized out and z becomes a Gaussian process z ∼ N∞ (0, Σ ⊗ Ω) [15], with the covariance between pairs being a tensor kernel K ((ui , vs ), (uj , vt )) = Σ(ui , uj )Ω(vs , vt ). In anther special case, if Σ and Ω are both ﬁxed to be Dirac delta functions, and U, V are ﬁnite sets, it is easy to see that the model reduces to probabilistic matrix factorization. The hyper prior IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ) is called inverted Wishart Process that generalizes the ﬁnite ndimensional inverted Wishart distribution [2] IW n (Σ|δ, Σ◦ ) ∝ |Σ| − 1 (δ+2n) 2 1 etr − Σ−1 Σ◦ , 2 where δ is the degree-of-freedom parameter, and Σ◦ is a positive deﬁnite kernel matrix. We note that the above deﬁnition is different from the popular formulation [3] or [4] in the machine learning community. The advantage of this new notation is demonstrated by the following theorem [2]. Theorem 1. Let A ∼ IW m (δ, K), A ∈ R+ , K ∈ R+ , and A and K be partitioned as A= A11 , A12 , A21 , A22 K= K11 , K12 K21 , K22 where A11 and K11 are two n × n sub matrices, n < m, then A11 ∼ IW n (δ, K11 ). The new formulation of inverted Wishart is consistent under marginalization. Therefore, similar to the way of deriving GPs from Gaussian distributions, we deﬁne a distribution of inﬁnite-dimensional kernel functions, denoted by Σ ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ), such that any sub kernel matrix of size m × m follows Σ ∼ IW m (δ, Σ◦ ), where both Σ and Σ◦ are positive deﬁnite kernel functions. In case when U and V are sets of entity indices, SRMs let Σ◦ and Ω◦ both be Dirac delta functions, i.e., any of their sub kernel matrices is an identity matrix. Similar to GP regression/classiﬁcation, the major application of SRMs is supervised prediction based on observed relational values and input features of entities. Formally, let YI = {y(u, v)|(u, v) ∈ I} be the set of noisy observations, where I ⊂ U × V, the model aims to predict the noise-free values ZO = {z(u, v)|(u, v) ∈ O} on O ⊂ U × V. As our computation is always on a ﬁnite set containing both I and O, from now on, we only consider the ﬁnite subset U0 × V0 , a ﬁnite support subset of U × V that contains I ∪ O. Accordingly we let Σ be the covariance matrix of Σ on U0 , and Ω be the covariance matrix of Ω on V0 . Previously a variational Bayesian method was applied to SRMs [15], which computes the maximum a posterior estimates of Σ and Ω, given YI , and then predicts ZO based on the estimated Σ and Ω. There are two limitations of this empirical Bayesian approach: (1) The variational method is not a fully Bayesian treatment. Ideally we wish to integrate Σ and Ω; (2) The more critical issue is, the algorithm has the complexity O(m3 + n3 ), with m = |U0 | and n = |V0 |, is not scalable to a large relational domain where m or n exceeds several thousands. In this paper we will introduce a fully Bayesian inference algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. By deriving equivalent sampling processes, we show the algorithms can be applied to a dataset, which is 103 times larger than the previous work [15], and produce an excellent accuracy. In the rest of this paper, we present our algorithms for Bayesian inference of SRMs in Section 2. Some related work is discussed in Section 3, followed by experiment results of SRMs in Section 4. Section 5 concludes. 2 2 Bayesian Models and MCMC Inference In this paper, we tackle the scalability issue with a fully Bayesian paradigm. We estimate the expectation of ZO directly from YI using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (speciﬁcally, Gibbs sampling), instead of evaluating that from estimated Σ or Ω. Our contribution is in how to make the MCMC inference more efﬁcient for large scale data. We ﬁrst introduce some necessary notation here. Bold capital letters, e.g. X, indicate matrices. I(m) is an identity matrix of size m × m. Nd , Nm,d , IW m , χ−2 are the multivariate normal distribution, the matrix-variate normal distribution, the inverse-Wishart distribution, and the inverse chi-square distribution, respectively. 2.1 Models with Non-informative Priors Let r = |I|, m = |U0 | and n = |V0 |. It is assumed that d min(m, n), and the observed set, I, is sparse, i.e. r mn. First, we consider the case of Σ◦ = αI(m) and Ω◦ = βI(n) . Let {fk } on U0 denoted by matrix variate F of size m × d, {gk } on V0 denoted by matrix variate G of size n × d. Then the generative model is written as Model 2 and depicted in Figure 1. Model 2. The generative model of a matrix-variate SRM: Σ 1. Draw Σ ∼ IW m (δ, αI(m) ) and Ω ∼ IW n (δ, βI(n) ); Ω I(d) G F 2. Draw F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ) and G|Ω ∼ Nn,d (0, Ω ⊗ I(d) ); I(d) Z 3. Draw s2 ∼ χ−2 (ν, σ 2 ) ; 4. Draw Y|F, G, s2 ∼ Nm,n (Z, s2 I(m) ⊗ I(n) ), where Z = FG . s2 Y where Nm,d is the matrix-variate normal distribution of size m × d; α, Figure 1: Model 2 β, δ, ν and σ 2 are scalar parameters of the model. A slight difference √ between this ﬁnite model and Model 1 is that the coefﬁcient 1/ d is ignored for simplicity because this coefﬁcient can be absorbed by α or β. As we can explicitly compute Pr(Σ|F), Pr(Ω|G), Pr(F|YI , G, Σ, s2 ), Pr(G|YI , F, Ω, s2 ), Pr(s2 |YI , F, G), we can apply Gibbs sampling algorithm to compute ZO . However, the computational time complexity is at least O(m3 + n3 ), which is not practical for large scale data. 2.2 Gibbs Sampling Method To overcome the inefﬁciency in sampling large covariance matrices, we rewrite the sampling process using the property of Theorem 2 to take the advantage of d min(m, n). αI(d) αI(m) Theorem 2. If 1. Σ ∼ IW m (δ, αI(m) ) and F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ), 2. K ∼ IW d (δ, αI(d) ) and H|K ∼ Nm,d (0, I(m) ⊗ K), then, matrix variates, F and H, have the same distribution. Proof sketch. Matrix variate F follows a matrix variate t distribution, t(δ, 0, αI(m) , I(d) ), which is written as 1 Σ I(d) F → I(m) K F Figure 2: Theorem 2 1 p(F) ∝ |I(m) + (αI(m) )−1 F(I(d) )−1 F |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) = |I(m) + α−1 FF |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) Matrix variate H follows a matrix variate t distribution, t(δ, 0, I(m) , αI(d) ), which can be written as 1 1 p(H) ∝ |I(m) + (I(m) )−1 H(αI(d) )−1 H |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) = |I(m) + α−1 HH |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) Thus, matrix variates, F and H, have the same distribution. 3 This theorem allows us to sample a smaller covariance matrix K of size d × d on the column side instead of sampling a large covariance matrix Σ of size m × m on the row side. The translation is depicted in Figure 2. This theorem applies to G as well, thus we rewrite the model as Model 3 (or Figure 3). A similar idea was used in our previous work [16]. Model 3. The alternative generative model of a matrix-variate SRM: I(m) I(n) K R 1. Draw K ∼ IW d (δ, αI(d) ) and R ∼ IW d (δ, βI(d) ); G F 2. Draw F|K ∼ Nm,d (0, I(m) ⊗ K), and G|R ∼ Nn,d (0, I(n) ⊗ R), 3. Draw s2 ∼ χ−2 (ν, σ 2 ) ; Z 4. Draw Y|F, G, s2 ∼ Nm,n (Z, s2 I(m) ⊗ I(n) ), where Z = FG . s2 Y Let column vector f i be the i-th row of matrix F, and column vector gj Figure 3: Model 3 be the j-th row of matrix G. In Model 3, {f i } are independent given K, 2 G and s . Similar independence applies to {gj } as well. The conditional posterior distribution of K, R, {f i }, {gj } and s2 can be easily computed, thus the Gibbs sampling for SRM is named BSRM (for Bayesian SRM). We use Gibbs sampling to compute the mean of ZO , which is derived from the samples of FG . Because of the sparsity of I, each iteration in this sampling algorithm can be computed in O(d2 r + d3 (m + n)) time complexity2 , which is a dramatic reduction from the previous time complexity O(m3 + n3 ) . 2.3 Models with Informative Priors An important characteristic of SRMs is that it allows the inclusion of certain prior knowledge of entities into the model. Speciﬁcally, the prior information is encoded as the prior covariance parameters, i.e. Σ◦ and Ω◦ . In the general case, it is difﬁcult to run sampling process due to the size of Σ◦ and Ω◦ . We assume that Σ◦ and Ω◦ have a special form, i.e. Σ◦ = F◦ (F◦ ) + αI(m) , where F◦ is an m × p matrix, and Ω◦ = G◦ (G◦ ) + βI(n) , where G◦ is an n × q matrix, and the magnitude of p and q is about the same as or less than that of d. This prior knowledge can be obtained from some additional features of entities. Although such an informative Σ◦ prevents us from directly sampling each row of F independently, as we do in Model 3, we can expand matrix F of size m × d to (F, F◦ ) of size m × (d + p), and derive an equivalent model, where rows of F are conditionally independent given F◦ . Figure 4 illustrates this transformation. Theorem 3. Let δ > p, Σ◦ = F◦ (F◦ ) + αI(m) , where F◦ is an m × p matrix. If 1. Σ ∼ IW m (δ, Σ◦ ) and F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ), K11 K12 ∼ IW d+p (δ − p, αI(d+p) ) and K21 K22 H|K ∼ Nm,d (F◦ K−1 K21 , I(m) ⊗ K11·2 ), 22 2. K = αI(d+p) Σ0 Σ I(d) F → I(m) K (F, F0 ) Figure 4: Theorem 3 where K11·2 = K11 − K12 K−1 K21 , then F and H have the same distribution. 22 Proof sketch. Consider the distribution (H1 , H2 )|K ∼ Nm,d+p (0, I(m) ⊗ K). (1) Because H1 |H2 ∼ Nm,d (H2 K−1 K21 , I(m) ⊗ K11·2 ), p(H) = p(H1 |H2 = F◦ ). On the other 22 hand, we have a matrix-variate t distribution, (H1 , H2 ) ∼ tm,d+p (δ − p, 0, αI(m) , I(d+p) ). By Theorem 4.3.9 in [4], we have H1 |H2 ∼ tm,d (δ, 0, αI(m) + H2 H2 , I(d) ) = tm,d (δ, 0, Σ◦ , I(d) ), which implies p(F) = p(H1 |H2 = F◦ ) = p(H). 2 |Y − FG |2 can be efﬁciently computed in O(dr) time. I 4 The following corollary allows us to compute the posterior distribution of K efﬁciently. Corollary 4. K|H ∼ IW d+p (δ + m, αI(d+p) + (H, F◦ ) (H, F◦ )). Proof sketch. Because normal distribution and inverse Wishart distribution are conjugate, we can derive the posterior distribution K from Eq. (1). Thus, we can explicitly sample from the conditional posterior distributions, as listed in Algorithm 1 (BSRM/F for BSRM with features) in Appendix. We note that when p = q = 0, Algorithm 1 (BSRM/F) reduces to the exact algorithm for BSRM. Each iteration in this sampling algorithm can be computed in O(d2 r + d3 (m + n) + dpm + dqn) time complexity. 2.4 Unblocking for Sampling Implementation Blocking Gibbs sampling technique is commonly used to improve the sampling efﬁciency by reducing the sample variance according to the Rao-Blackwell theorem (c.f. [9]). However, blocking Gibbs sampling is not necessary to be computationally efﬁcient. To improve the computational efﬁciency of Algorithm 1, we use unblocking sampling to reduce the major computational cost is Step 2 and Step 4. We consider sampling each element of F conditionally. The sampling process is written as Step 4 and Step 9 of Algorithm 2, which is called BSRM/F with conditional Gibss sampling. We can reduce the computational cost of each iteration to O(dr + d2 (m + n) + dpm + dqn), which is comparable to other low-rank matrix factorization approaches. Though such a conditional sampling process increases the sample variance comparing to Algorithm 1, we can afford more samples within a given amount of time due to its faster speed. Our experiments show that the overall computational cost of Algorithm 2 is usually less than that of Algorithm 1 when achieving the same accuracy. Additionally, since {f i } are independent, we can parallelize the for loops in Step 4 and Step 9 of Algorithm 2. 3 Related Work SRMs fall into a class of statistical latent-variable relational models that explain relations by latent factors of entities. Recently a number of such models were proposed that can be roughly put into two groups, depending on whether the latent factors are continuous or discrete: (1) Discrete latent-state relational models: a large body of research infers latent classes of entities and explains the entity relationship by the probability conditioned on the joint state of participating entities, e.g., [6, 14, 7, 1]. In another work [10], binary latent factors are modeled; (2) Continuous latent-variable relational models: many such models assume relational data underlain by multiplicative effects between latent variables of entities, e.g. [5]. A simple example is matrix factorization, which recently has become very popular in collaborative ﬁltering applications, e.g., [12, 8, 13]. The latest Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization [13] reported the state-of-the-art accuracy of matrix factorization on Netﬂix data. Interestingly, the model turns out to be similar to our Model 3 under the non-informative prior. This paper reveals the equivalence between different models and offers a more general Bayesian framework that allows informative priors from entity features to play a role. The framework also generalizes Gaussian processes [11] to a relational domain, where a nonparametric prior for stochastic relational processes is described. 4 Experiments Synthetic data: We compare BSRM under noninformative priors against two other algorithms: the fast max-margin matrix factorization (fMMMF) in [12] with a square loss, and SRM using variational Bayesian approach (SRM-VB) in [15]. We generate a 30 × 20 random matrix (Figure 5(a)), then add Gaussian noise with σ 2 = 0.1 (Figure 5(b)). The root mean squared noise is 0.32. We select 70% elements as the observed data and use the rest of the elements for testing. The reconstruction matrix and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of predictions on the test elements are shown in Figure 5(c)-5(e). BSRM outperforms the variational approach of SRMs and fMMMF. Note that because of the log-determinant penalty of the inverse Wishart prior, SRM-VB enforces the rank to be smaller, thus the result of SRM-VB looks smoother than that of BSRM. 5 5 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 15 20 20 20 20 20 25 25 25 25 30 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 25 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 (a) Original Matrix (b) With Noise(0.32) (c) fMMMF (0.27) (d) SRM-VB(0.22) 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 (e) BSRM(0.19) Figure 5: Experiments on synthetic data.

All standard errors are 0.001 or less. EachMovie data: We test the accuracy and the efﬁciency of our algorithms on EachMovie. The dataset contains 74, 424 users’ 2, 811, 718 ratings on 1, 648 movies, i.e. about 2.29% are rated by zero-to-ﬁve stars. We put all the ratings into a matrix, and randomly select 80% as observed data to predict the remaining ratings. The random selection was carried out 10 times independently. We compare our approach against several competing methods: 1) User Mean, predicting ratings by the sample mean of the same user’s ratings; 2) Move Mean, predicting rating by the sample mean of ratings on the same movie; 3) fMMMF [12]; 4) VB introduced in [8], which is a probabilistic lowrank matrix factorization using variational approximation. Because of the data size, we cannot run the SRM-VB of [15]. We test the algorithms BSRM and BSRM/F, both following Algorithm 2, which run without and with features, respectively. The features used in BSRM/F are generated from the PCA result of the binary indicator matrix that indicates whether the user rates the movie. The 10 top factors of both the user side and the movie side are used as features, i.e. p = 10, q = 10. We run the experiments with different d = 16, 32, 100, 200, 300. The hyper parameters are set to some trivial values, δ = p + 1 = 11, α = β = 1, σ 2 = 1, and ν = 1. The results are shown in Table 1 and 2. We ﬁnd that the accuracy improves as the number of d is increased. Once d is greater than 100, the further improvement is not very signiﬁcant within a reasonable amount of running time. rank (d) BSRM RMSE MAE BSRM/F RMSE MAE 16 1.0983 0.8411 1.0952 0.8311 32 1.0924 0.8321 1.0872 0.8280 100 1.0905 0.8335 1.0848 0.8289 200 1.0903 0.8340 1.0846 0.8293 300 1.0902 0.8393 1.0852 0.8292 Table 2: RMSE (root mean squared error) and MAE (mean absolute error) of experiments on EachMovie data.

RMSE To compare the overall computational efﬁciency of the two Gibbs sampling procedures, Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, we run both algorithms 1.2 and record the running time and accuracy Algorithm 1 Algorithm 2 in RMSE. The dimensionality d is set to 1.18 be 100. We compute the average ZO and burn-in ends evaluate it after a certain number of itera1.16 tions. The evaluation results are shown in Figure 6. We run both algorithms for 100 1.14 burn-in ends iterations as the burn-in period, so that we 1.12 can have an independent start sample. After the burn-in period, we restart to compute 1.1 the averaged ZO and evaluate them, therefore there are abrupt points at 100 iterations 1.08 in both cases. The results show that the 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 7000 8000 overall accuracy of Algorithm 2 is better at Running time (sec) any given time.

The dataset consists of 100, 480, 507 ratings from 480, 189 users on 17, 770 movies. In addition, Netﬂix also provides a set of validation data with 1, 408, 395 ratings. In order to evaluate the prediction accuracy, there is a test set containing 2, 817, 131 ratings whose values are withheld and unknown for all the participants. The features used in BSRM/F are generated from the PCA result of a binary matrix that indicates whether or not the user rated the movie. The top 30 user-side factors are used as features, none of movie-side factors are used, i.e. p = 30, q = 0. The hyper parameters are set to some trivial values, δ = p + 1 = 31, α = β = 1, σ 2 = 1, and ν = 1. The results on the validation data are shown in Table 3.

We overcome the scalability issue by transforming SRMs into equivalent models, which can be efﬁciently sampled. The experiments show that the fully Bayesian inference outperforms the previously used variational Bayesian inference on SRMs. In addition, some techniques for efﬁcient computation in this paper can be applied to other large-scale Bayesian inferences, especially for models involving inverse-Wishart distributions.

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2008-212-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3411-skill-characterization-based-on-betweenness.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ozgur Simsek, Andre S. Barreto</p><p>Abstract: We present a characterization of a useful class of skills based on a graphical representation of an agent’s interaction with its environment. Our characterization uses betweenness, a measure of centrality on graphs. It captures and generalizes (at least intuitively) the bottleneck concept, which has inspired many of the existing skill-discovery algorithms. Our characterization may be used directly to form a set of skills suitable for a given task. More importantly, it serves as a useful guide for developing incremental skill-discovery algorithms that do not rely on knowing or representing the interaction graph in its entirety. 1</p><br/>

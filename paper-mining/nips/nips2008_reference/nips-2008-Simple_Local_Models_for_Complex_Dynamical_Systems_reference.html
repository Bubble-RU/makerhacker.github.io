<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2008-211-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3503-simple-local-models-for-complex-dynamical-systems.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Erik Talvitie, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel mathematical formalism for the idea of a “local model” of an uncontrolled dynamical system, a model that makes only certain predictions in only certain situations. As a result of its restricted responsibilities, a local model may be far simpler than a complete model of the system. We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods. 1</p><br/>

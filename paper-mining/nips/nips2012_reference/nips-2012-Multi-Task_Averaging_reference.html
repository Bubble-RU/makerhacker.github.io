<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2012-222-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4559-multi-task-averaging.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Sergey Feldman, Maya Gupta, Bela Frigyik</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-task learning approach to jointly estimate the means of multiple independent data sets. The proposed multi-task averaging (MTA) algorithm results in a convex combination of the single-task averages. We derive the optimal amount of regularization, and show that it can be effectively estimated. Simulations and real data experiments demonstrate that MTA outperforms both maximum likelihood and James-Stein estimators, and that our approach to estimating the amount of regularization rivals cross-validation in performance but is more computationally efﬁcient. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2012-30-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4635-accuracy-at-the-top.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Stephen Boyd, Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri, Ana Radovanovic</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new notion of classiﬁcation accuracy based on the top ⌧ -quantile values of a scoring function, a relevant criterion in a number of problems arising for search engines. We deﬁne an algorithm optimizing a convex surrogate of the corresponding loss, and discuss its solution in terms of a set of convex optimization problems. We also present margin-based guarantees for this algorithm based on the top ⌧ -quantile value of the scores of the functions in the hypothesis set. Finally, we report the results of several experiments in the bipartite setting evaluating the performance of our solution and comparing the results to several other algorithms seeking high precision at the top. In most examples, our solution achieves a better performance in precision at the top. 1</p><br/>

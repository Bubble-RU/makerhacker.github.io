<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2012-203-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4623-locating-changes-in-highly-dependent-data-with-unknown-number-of-change-points.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Azadeh Khaleghi, Daniil Ryabko</p><p>Abstract: The problem of multiple change point estimation is considered for sequences with unknown number of change points. A consistency framework is suggested that is suitable for highly dependent time-series, and an asymptotically consistent algorithm is proposed. In order for the consistency to be established the only assumption required is that the data is generated by stationary ergodic time-series distributions. No modeling, independence or parametric assumptions are made; the data are allowed to be dependent and the dependence can be of arbitrary form. The theoretical results are complemented with experimental evaluations. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2012-10-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4598-a-linear-time-active-learning-algorithm-for-link-classification.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile, Fabio Vitale, Giovanni Zappella</p><p>Abstract: We present very eﬃcient active learning algorithms for link classiﬁcation in signed networks. Our algorithms are motivated by a stochastic model in which edge labels are obtained through perturbations of a initial sign assignment consistent with a two-clustering of the nodes. We provide a theoretical analysis within this model, showing that we can achieve an optimal (to whithin a constant factor) number of mistakes on any graph G = (V, E) such that |E| = Ω(|V |3/2 ) by querying O(|V |3/2 ) edge labels. More generally, we show an algorithm that achieves optimality to within a factor of O(k) by querying at most order of |V | + (|V |/k)3/2 edge labels. The running time of this algorithm is at most of order |E| + |V | log |V |. 1</p><br/>

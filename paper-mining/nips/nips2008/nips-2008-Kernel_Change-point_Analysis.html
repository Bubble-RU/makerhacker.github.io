<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the ﬁrst Rademacher complexity-based error bounds for noni.i.d. settings, a generalization of similar existing bounds derived for the i.i.d. case. Our bounds hold in the scenario of dependent samples generated by a stationary β-mixing process, which is commonly adopted in many previous studies of noni.i.d. settings. They beneﬁt from the crucial advantages of Rademacher complexity over other measures of the complexity of hypothesis classes. In particular, they are data-dependent and measure the complexity of a class of hypotheses based on the training sample. The empirical Rademacher complexity can be estimated from such ﬁnite samples and lead to tighter generalization bounds. We also present the ﬁrst margin bounds for kernel-based classiﬁcation in this non-i.i.d. setting and brieﬂy study their convergence.</p><p>3 0.13786738 <a title="111-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Shared_Segmentation_of_Natural_Scenes_Using_Dependent_Pitman-Yor_Processes.html">208 nips-2008-Shared Segmentation of Natural Scenes Using Dependent Pitman-Yor Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for the simultaneous, unsupervised segmentation and discovery of visual object categories from image databases. Examining a large set of manually segmented scenes, we show that object frequencies and segment sizes both follow power law distributions, which are well modeled by the Pitman–Yor (PY) process. This nonparametric prior distribution leads to learning algorithms which discover an unknown set of objects, and segmentation methods which automatically adapt their resolution to each image. Generalizing previous applications of PY processes, we use Gaussian processes to discover spatially contiguous segments which respect image boundaries. Using a novel family of variational approximations, our approach produces segmentations which compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, while simultaneously discovering categories shared among natural scenes. 1</p><p>4 0.12886524 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Multiscale_Random_Fields_with_Application_to_Contour_Grouping.html">147 nips-2008-Multiscale Random Fields with Application to Contour Grouping</a></p>
<p>Author: Longin J. Latecki, Chengen Lu, Marc Sobel, Xiang Bai</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of multiscale random ﬁelds (MSRFs) that admits efﬁcient optimization in the framework of regular (single level) random ﬁelds (RFs). It is based on a new operator, called append, that combines sets of random variables (RVs) to single RVs. We assume that a MSRF can be decomposed into disjoint trees that link RVs at different pyramid levels. The append operator is then applied to map RVs in each tree structure to a single RV. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach on a challenging task involving grouping contours of target shapes in images. It provides a natural representation of multiscale contour models, which is needed in order to cope with unstable contour decompositions. The append operator allows us to ﬁnd optimal image segment labels using the classical framework of relaxation labeling. Alternative methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) could also be used.</p><p>5 0.10627344 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>6 0.10302156 <a title="111-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>

<p>Author: Jennifer Tam, Jiri Simsa, Sean Hyde, Luis V. Ahn</p><p>Abstract: CAP TCHAs are computer-generated tests that humans can pass but current computer systems cannot. CAP TCHAs provide a method for automatically distinguishing a human from a computer program, and therefore can protect Web services from abuse by so-called “bots.” Most CAP TCHAs consist of distorted images, usually text, for which a user must provide some description. Unfortunately, visual CAP TCHAs limit access to the millions of visually impaired people using the Web. Audio CAP TCHAs were created to solve this accessibility issue; however, the security of audio CAP TCHAs was never formally tested. Some visual CAP TCHAs have been broken using machine learning techniques, and we propose using similar ideas to test the security of audio CAP TCHAs. Audio CAP TCHAs are generally composed of a set of words to be identified, layered on top of noise. We analyzed the security of current audio CAP TCHAs from popular Web sites by using AdaBoost, SVM, and k-NN, and achieved correct solutions for test samples with accuracy up to 71%. Such accuracy is enough to consider these CAPTCHAs broken. Training several different machine learning algorithms on different types of audio CAP TCHAs allowed us to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms so that we could suggest a design for a more robust audio CAPTCHA. 1 Int rod uct i o n CAP TCHAs [1] are automated tests designed to tell computers and humans apart by presenting users with a problem that humans can solve but current computer programs cannot. Because CAPTCHAs can distinguish between humans and computers with high probability, they are used for many different security applications: they prevent bots from voting continuously in online polls, automatically registering for millions of spam email accounts, automatically purchasing tickets to buy out an event, etc. Once a CAP TCHA is broken (i.e., computer programs can successfully pass the test), bots can impersonate humans and gain access to services that they should not. Therefore, it is important for CAP TCHAs to be secure. To pass the typical visual CAP TCHA, a user must correctly type the characters displayed in an image of distorted text. Many visual CAP TCHAs have been broken with machine learning techniques [2]-[3], though some remain secure against such attacks. Because visually impaired users who surf the Web using screen-reading programs cannot see this type of CAPTCHA, audio CAP TCHAs were created. Typical audio CAP TCHAs consist of one or several speakers saying letters or digits at randomly spaced intervals. A user must correctly identify the digits or characters spoken in the audio file to pass the CAP TCHA. To make this test difficult for current computer systems, specifically automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs, background noise is injected into the audio files. Since no official evaluation of existing audio CAP TCHAs has been reported, we tested the security of audio CAP TCHAs used by many popular Web sites by running machine learning experiments designed to break them. In the next section, we provide an overview of the literature related to our project. Section 3 describes our methods for creating training data, and section 4 describes how we create classifiers that can recognize letters, digits, and noise. In section 5, we discuss how we evaluated our methods on widely used audio CAP TCHAs and we give our results. In particular, we show that the audio CAP TCHAs used by sites such as Google and Digg are susceptible to machine learning attacks. Section 6 mentions the proposed design of a new more secure audio CAP TCHA based on our findings. 2 Lit erat u r e r ev i ew To break the audio CAP TCHAs, we derive features from the CAP TCHA audio and use several machine learning techniques to perform ASR on segments of the CAPTCHA. There are many popular techniques for extracting features from speech. The three techniques we use are mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), perceptual linear prediction (PLP), and relative spectral transform-PLP (RAS TA-PLP). MFCC is one of the most popular speech feature representations used. Similar to a fast Fourier transform (FF T), MFCC transforms an audio file into frequency bands, but (unlike FF T) MFCC uses mel-frequency bands, which are better for approximating the range of frequencies humans hear. PLP was designed to extract speaker-independent features from speech [4]. Therefore, by using PLP and a variant such as RAS TA-PL P, we were able to train our classifiers to recognize letters and digits independently of who spoke them. Since many different people recorded the digits used in one of the types of audio CAP TCHAs we tested, PLP and RAS TA-PLP were needed to extract the features that were most useful for solving them. In [4]-[5], the authors conducted experiments on recognizing isolated digits in the presence of noise using both PLP and RAS TA-PL P. However, the noise used consisted of telephone or microphone static caused by recording in different locations. The audio CAP TCHAs we use contain this type of noise, as well as added vocal noise and/or music, which is supposed to make the automated recognition process much harder. The authors of [3] emphasize how many visual CAP TCHAs can be broken by successfully splitting the task into two smaller tasks: segmentation and recognition. We follow a similar approach in that we first automatically split the audio into segments, and then we classify these segments as noise or words. In early March 2008, concurrent to our work, the blog of Wintercore Labs [6] claimed to have successfully broken the Google audio CAP TCHA. After reading their Web article and viewing the video of how they solve the CAP TCHAs, we are unconvinced that the process is entirely automatic, and it is unclear what their exact pass rate is. Because we are unable to find any formal technical analysis of this program, we can neither be sure of its accuracy nor the extent of its automation. 3 Cr e at i o n of tra i n i n g dat a Since automated programs can attempt to pass a CAPTCHA repeatedly, a CAPTCHA is essentially broken when a program can pass it more than a non-trivial fraction of the time; e.g., a 5% pass rate is enough. Our approach to breaking the audio CAP TCHAs began by first splitting the audio files into segments of noise or words: for our experiments, the words were spoken letters or digits. We used manual transcriptions of the audio CAP TCHAs to get information regarding the location of each spoken word within the audio file. We were able to label our segments accurately by using this information. We gathered 1,000 audio CAP TCHAs from each of the following Web sites: google.com, digg.com, and an older version of the audio CAP TCHA in recaptcha.net. Each of the CAP TCHAs was annotated with the information regarding letter/digit locations provided by the manual transcriptions. For each type of CAPTCHA, we randomly selected 900 samples for training and used the remaining 100 for testing. Using the digit/letter location information provided in the manual CAP TCHA transcriptions, each training CAP TCHA is divided into segments of noise, the letters a-z, or the digits 0-9, and labeled as such. We ignore the annotation information of the CAP TCHAs we use for testing, and therefore we cannot identify the size of those segments. Instead, each test CAP TCHA is divided into a number of fixed-size segments. The segments with the highest energy peaks are then classified using machine learning techniques (Figure 1). Since the size of a feature vector extracted from a segment generally depends on the size of the segment, using fixed-size segments allows each segment to be described with a feature vector of the same length. We chose the window size by listening to a few training segments and adjusted accordingly to ensure that the segment contained the entire digit/letter. There is undoubtedly a more optimal way of selecting the window size, however, we were still able to break the three CAP TCHAs we tested with our method. Figure 1: A test audio CAP TCHA with the fixed-size segments containing the highest energy peaks highlighted. The information provided in the manual transcriptions of the audio CAP TCHAs contains a list of the time intervals within which words are spoken. However, these intervals are of variable size and the word might be spoken anywhere within this interval. To provide fixedsize segments for training, we developed the following heuristic. First, divide each file into variable-size segments using the time intervals provided and label each segment accordingly. Then, within each segment, detect the highest energy peak and return its fixed-size neighborhood labeled with the current segment’s label. This heuristic achieved nearly perfect labeling accuracy for the training set. Rare mistakes occurred when the highest energy peak of a digit or letter segment corresponded to noise rather than to a digit or letter. To summarize this subsection, an audio file is transformed into a set of fixed-size segments labeled as noise, a digit between 0 and 9, or a letter between a and z. These segments are then used for training. Classifiers are trained for one type of CAPTCHA at a time. 4 C l a s s i f i e r con s t ru ct i o n From the training data we extracted five sets of features using twelve MFCCs and twelfth- order spectral (SPEC) and cepstral (CEPS) coefficients from PLP Matlab functions for extracting these features were provided online Voicebox package. We use AdaBoost, SVM, and k-NN algorithms digit and letter recognition. We detail our implementation of following subsections. 4 .1 and RAS TA-PL P. The at [7] and as part of the to implement automated each algorithm in the AdaBoost Using decision stumps as weak classifiers for AdaBoost, anywhere from 11 to 37 ensemble classifiers are built. The number of classifiers built depends on which type of CAPTCHA we are solving. Each classifier trains on all the segments associated with that type of CAP TCHA, and for the purpose of building a single classifier, segments are labeled by either -1 (negative example) or +1 (positive example). Using cross-validation, we choose to use 50 iterations for our AdaBoost algorithm. A segment can then be classified as a particular letter, digit, or noise according to the ensemble classifier that outputs the number closest to 1. 4 .2 S u p p o rt v e ct o r m a c h i n e To conduct digit recognition with SVM, we used the C++ implementations of libSVM [8] version 2.85 with C-SMV and RBF kernel. First, all feature values are scaled to the range of -1 to 1 as suggested by [8]. The scale parameters are stored so that test samples can be scaled accordingly. Then, a single multiclass classifier is created for each set of features using all the segments for a particular type of CAPTCHA. We use cross-validation and grid search to discover the optimal slack penalty (C=32) and kernel parameter (γ=0.011). 4 .3 k - n e a re st n e i g h b o r ( k - N N ) We use k-NN as our final method for classifying digits. For each type of CAP TCHA, five different classifiers are created by using all of the training data and the five sets of features associated with that particular type of CAP TCHA. Again we use cross-validation to discover the optimal parameter, in this case k=1. We use Euclidian distance as our distance metric. 5 Ass e s sm e n t of cu rre n t a ud i o CAPTCHAs Our method for solving CAP TCHAs iteratively extracts an audio segment from a CAP TCHA, inputs the segment to one of our digit or letter recognizers, and outputs the label for that segment. We continue this process until the maximum solution size is reached or there are no unlabeled segments left. Some of the CAPTCHAs we evaluated have solutions that vary in length. Our method ensures that we get solutions of varying length that are never longer than the maximum solution length. A segment to be classified is identified by taking the neighborhood of the highest energy peak of an as yet unlabeled part of the CAP TCHA. Once a prediction of the solution to the CAPTCHA is computed, it is compared to the true solution. Given that at least one of the audio CAP TCHAs allows users to make a mistake in one of the digits (e.g., reCAPTCHA), we compute the pass rate for each of the different types of CAPTCHAs with all of the following conditions: • The prediction matches the true solution exactly. • Inserting one digit into the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. • Replacing one digit in the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. • Removing one digit from the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. However, since we are only sure that these conditions apply to reCAPTCHA audio CAP TCHAs, we also calculate the percentage of exact solution matches in our results for each type of audio CAP TCHA. These results are described in the following subsections. 5 .1 Goog le Google audio CAP TCHAs consist of one speaker saying random digits 0-9, the phrase “once again,” followed by the exact same recorded sequence of digits originally presented. The background noise consists of human voices speaking backwards at varying volumes. A solution can range in length from five to eight words. We set our classifier to find the 12 loudest segments and classify these segments as digits or noise. Because the phrase “once again” marks the halfway point of the CAPTCHA, we preprocessed the audio to only serve this half of the CAP TCHA to our classifiers. It is important to note, however, that the classifiers were always able to identify the segment containing “once again,” and these segments were identified before all other segments. Therefore, if necessary, we could have had our system cut the file in half after first labeling this segment. For AdaBoost, we create 12 classifiers: one classifier for each digit, one for noise, and one for the phrase “once again.” Our results ( Table 1) show that at best we achieved a 90% pass rate using the “one mistake” passing conditions and a 66% exact solution match rate. Using SVM and the “one mistake” passing conditions, at best we achieve a 92% pass rate and a 67% exact solution match. For k-NN, the “one mistake” pass rate is 62% and the exact solution match rate is 26%. Table 1: Google audio CAP TCHA results: Maximum 67% accuracy was achieved by SVM.

The background noise consists of static or what sounds like trickling water and is not continuous throughout the entire file. We noticed in our training data that the following characters were never present in a solution: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, i, o, z. Since the Digg audio CAPTCHA is also the verbal transcription of the visual CAP TCHA, we believe that these characters are excluded to avoid confusion between digits and letters that are similar in appearance. The solution length varies between three and six words. Using AdaBoost, we create 28 classifiers: one classifier for each digit or letter that appears in our training data and one classifier for noise. Perhaps because we had fewer segments to train with and there was a far higher proportion of noise segments, AdaBoost failed to produce any correct solutions. We believe that the overwhelming number of negative training examples versus the small number of positive training samples used to create each decision stump severely affected AdaBoost’s ability to classify audio segments correctly. A histogram of the training samples is provided in Figure 2 to illustrate the amount of training data available for each character. When using SVM, the best feature set passed with 96% using “one mistake” passing conditions and passed with 71% when matching the solution exactly. For k-NN, the best feature set produced a 90% “one mistake” pass rate and a 49% exact solution match. Full results can be found in Table 2.

The background noise consists of human voices speaking backwards at varying volumes. The solution is always eight digits long. For AdaBoost, we create 11 classifiers: one classifier for each digit and one classifier for noise. Because we know that the reCAPTCHA passing conditions are the “one mistake” passing conditions, SVM produces our best pass rate of 58%. Our best exact match rate is 45% ( Table 3).

Google had the next strongest CAP TCHAs followed by the strongest from reCAPTCHA. Although the Digg CAP TCHAs have the largest vocabulary, giving us less training data per label, the same woman recorded them all. More importantly, the same type of noise is used throughout the entire CAPTCHA. The noise sounds like running water and static which sounds very different from the human voice and does not produce the same energy spikes needed to locate segments, therefore making segmentation quite easy. The CAP TCHAs from Google and reCAPTCHA used other human voices for background noise, making segmentation much more difficult. Although Google used a smaller vocabulary than Digg and also only used one speaker, Google’s background noise made the CAP TCHA more difficult to solve. After listening to a few of Google’s CAP TCHAs, we noticed that although the background noise consisted of human voices, the same background noise was repeated. reCAP TCHA had similar noise to Google, but they had a larger selection of noise thus making it harder to learn. reCAP TCHA also has the longest solution length making it more difficult to get perfectly correct. Finally, reCAPTCHA used many different speakers causing it to be the strongest CAP TCHA of the three we tested. In conclusion, an audio CAP TCHA that consists of a finite vocabulary and background noise should have multiple speakers and noise similar to the speakers. 7 Recomm e n d at i o n s f or creat i n g st ro n g e r aud i o CAPTCHAs Due to our success in solving audio CAP TCHAs, we have decided to start developing new audio CAP TCHAs that our methods, and machine learning methods in general, will be less likely to solve. From our experiments, we note that CAP TCHAs containing longer solutions and multiple speakers tend to be more difficult to solve. Also, because our methods depend on the amount of training data we have, having a large vocabulary would make it more difficult to collect enough training data. Already since obtaining these results, reCAPTCHA.net has updated their audio CAP TCHA to contain more distortions and a larger vocabulary: the digits 0 through 99. In designing a new audio CAP TCHA we are also concerned with the human pass rate. The current human pass rate for the reCAPTCHA audio CAP TCHAs is only 70%. To develop an audio CAP TCHA with an improved human pass rate, we plan to take advantage of the human mind’s ability to understand distorted audio through context clues. By listening to a phrase instead of to random isolated words, humans are better able to decipher distorted utterances because they are familiar with the phrase or can use contextual clues to decipher the distorted audio. Using this idea, the audio for our new audio CAP TCHA will be taken from old-time radio programs in which the poor quality of the audio makes transcription by ASR systems difficult. Users will be presented with an audio clip consisting of a 4-6 word phrase. Half of the CAPTCHA consists of words, which validate a user to be human, while the other half of the words need to be transcribed. This is the same idea behind the visual reCAP TCHA that is currently digitizing text on which OCR fails. We expect that this new audio CAP TCHA will be more secure than the current version and easier for humans to pass. Initial experiments using this idea show this to be true [9]. 8 Co n c l u s i o n We have succeeded in “breaking” three different types of widely used audio CAP TCHAs, even though these were developed with the purpose of defeating attacks by machine learning techniques. We believe our results can be improved by selecting optimal segment sizes, but that is unnecessary given our already high success rate. For our experiments, segment sizes were not chosen in a special way; occasionally yielding results in which a segment only contained half of a word, causing our prediction to contain that particular word twice. We also believe that the AdaBoost results can be improved, particularly for the Digg audio CAP TCHAs, by ensuring that the number of negative training samples is closer to the number of positive training samples. We have shown that our approach is successful and can be used with many different audio CAP TCHAs that contain small finite vocabularies.

<p>Author: Deepak Agarwal, Bee-chung Chen, Pradheep Elango, Nitin Motgi, Seung-taek Park, Raghu Ramakrishnan, Scott Roy, Joe Zachariah</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new content publishing system that selects articles to serve to a user, choosing from an editorially programmed pool that is frequently refreshed. It is now deployed on a major Yahoo! portal, and selects articles to serve to hundreds of millions of user visits per day, signiﬁcantly increasing the number of user clicks over the original manual approach, in which editors periodically selected articles to display. Some of the challenges we face include a dynamic content pool, short article lifetimes, non-stationary click-through rates, and extremely high trafﬁc volumes. The fundamental problem we must solve is to quickly identify which items are popular (perhaps within different user segments), and to exploit them while they remain current. We must also explore the underlying pool constantly to identify promising alternatives, quickly discarding poor performers. Our approach is based on tracking per article performance in near real time through online models. We describe the characteristics and constraints of our application setting, discuss our design choices, and show the importance and effectiveness of coupling online models with a randomization procedure. We discuss the challenges encountered in a production online content-publishing environment and highlight issues that deserve careful attention. Our analysis of this application also suggests a number of future research avenues. 1</p><p>4 0.55729669 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Shared_Segmentation_of_Natural_Scenes_Using_Dependent_Pitman-Yor_Processes.html">208 nips-2008-Shared Segmentation of Natural Scenes Using Dependent Pitman-Yor Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for the simultaneous, unsupervised segmentation and discovery of visual object categories from image databases. Examining a large set of manually segmented scenes, we show that object frequencies and segment sizes both follow power law distributions, which are well modeled by the Pitman–Yor (PY) process. This nonparametric prior distribution leads to learning algorithms which discover an unknown set of objects, and segmentation methods which automatically adapt their resolution to each image. Generalizing previous applications of PY processes, we use Gaussian processes to discover spatially contiguous segments which respect image boundaries. Using a novel family of variational approximations, our approach produces segmentations which compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, while simultaneously discovering categories shared among natural scenes. 1</p><p>5 0.52899915 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Rademacher_Complexity_Bounds_for_Non-I.I.D._Processes.html">189 nips-2008-Rademacher Complexity Bounds for Non-I.I.D.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the ﬁrst Rademacher complexity-based error bounds for noni.i.d. settings, a generalization of similar existing bounds derived for the i.i.d. case. Our bounds hold in the scenario of dependent samples generated by a stationary β-mixing process, which is commonly adopted in many previous studies of noni.i.d. settings. They beneﬁt from the crucial advantages of Rademacher complexity over other measures of the complexity of hypothesis classes. In particular, they are data-dependent and measure the complexity of a class of hypotheses based on the training sample. The empirical Rademacher complexity can be estimated from such ﬁnite samples and lead to tighter generalization bounds. We also present the ﬁrst margin bounds for kernel-based classiﬁcation in this non-i.i.d. setting and brieﬂy study their convergence.</p><p>6 0.45821446 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Wong, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are emerging as promising models for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of neutrally stable states. In this study, we systematically explore how neutral stability of a CANN facilitates its tracking performance, a capacity believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus. 1</p><p>3 0.70374143 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Learning_of_Robot_Inverse_Dynamics.html">146 nips-2008-Multi-task Gaussian Process Learning of Robot Inverse Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Stefan Klanke, Sethu Vijayakumar, Kian M. Chai</p><p>Abstract: The inverse dynamics problem for a robotic manipulator is to compute the torques needed at the joints to drive it along a given trajectory; it is beneﬁcial to be able to learn this function for adaptive control. A robotic manipulator will often need to be controlled while holding different loads in its end effector, giving rise to a multi-task learning problem. By placing independent Gaussian process priors over the latent functions of the inverse dynamics, we obtain a multi-task Gaussian process prior for handling multiple loads, where the inter-task similarity depends on the underlying inertial parameters. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-task formulation is effective in sharing information among the various loads, and generally improves performance over either learning only on single tasks or pooling the data over all tasks. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.68341112 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Kernel_Change-point_Analysis.html">111 nips-2008-Kernel Change-point Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zaïd Harchaoui, Eric Moulines, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a kernel-based method for change-point analysis within a sequence of temporal observations. Change-point analysis of an unlabelled sample of observations consists in, ﬁrst, testing whether a change in the distribution occurs within the sample, and second, if a change occurs, estimating the change-point instant after which the distribution of the observations switches from one distribution to another different distribution. We propose a test statistic based upon the maximum kernel Fisher discriminant ratio as a measure of homogeneity between segments. We derive its limiting distribution under the null hypothesis (no change occurs), and establish the consistency under the alternative hypothesis (a change occurs). This allows to build a statistical hypothesis testing procedure for testing the presence of a change-point, with a prescribed false-alarm probability and detection probability tending to one in the large-sample setting. If a change actually occurs, the test statistic also yields an estimator of the change-point location. Promising experimental results in temporal segmentation of mental tasks from BCI data and pop song indexation are presented. 1</p><p>5 0.53985512 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>6 0.53932357 <a title="111-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>

Our bounds hold in the scenario of dependent samples generated by a stationary β-mixing process, which is commonly adopted in many previous studies of noni.i.d. settings. They beneﬁt from the crucial advantages of Rademacher complexity over other measures of the complexity of hypothesis classes. In particular, they are data-dependent and measure the complexity of a class of hypotheses based on the training sample. The empirical Rademacher complexity can be estimated from such ﬁnite samples and lead to tighter generalization bounds. We also present the ﬁrst margin bounds for kernel-based classiﬁcation in this non-i.i.d. setting and brieﬂy study their convergence.</p><p>5 0.12031527 <a title="250-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae-kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: We present a new co-clustering problem of images and visual features. The problem involves a set of non-object images in addition to a set of object images and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of object images from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of object images and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classiﬁers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classiﬁer is an aggregation of weak-learners, i.e. simple visual features. The obtained classiﬁers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit multimodalities, e.g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classiﬁers in object detection tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.11845972 <a title="250-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Design_of_Loss_Functions_for_Classification%3A_theory%2C_robustness_to_outliers%2C_and_SavageBoost.html">162 nips-2008-On the Design of Loss Functions for Classification: theory, robustness to outliers, and SavageBoost</a></p>

<p>Author: Massih Amini, Nicolas Usunier, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We propose two transductive bounds on the risk of majority votes that are estimated over partially labeled training sets. The ﬁrst one involves the margin distribution of the classiﬁer and a risk bound on its associate Gibbs classiﬁer. The bound is tight when so is the Gibbs’s bound and when the errors of the majority vote classiﬁer is concentrated on a zone of low margin. In semi-supervised learning, considering the margin as an indicator of conﬁdence constitutes the working hypothesis of algorithms which search the decision boundary on low density regions. Following this assumption, we propose to bound the error probability of the voted classiﬁer on the examples for whose margins are above a ﬁxed threshold. As an application, we propose a self-learning algorithm which iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training examples that have their margin above a threshold obtained from this bound. Empirical results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the same algorithm and the TSVM in which the threshold is ﬁxed manually. 1</p><p>6 0.47952402 <a title="250-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Efficient_Minimization_of_Classification_Calibrated_Surrogates.html">163 nips-2008-On the Efficient Minimization of Classification Calibrated Surrogates</a></p>

<p>Author: Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of domain adaptation with multiple sources. For each source domain, the distribution over the input points as well as a hypothesis with error at most ǫ are given. The problem consists of combining these hypotheses to derive a hypothesis with small error with respect to the target domain. We present several theoretical results relating to this problem. In particular, we prove that standard convex combinations of the source hypotheses may in fact perform very poorly and that, instead, combinations weighted by the source distributions beneﬁt from favorable theoretical guarantees. Our main result shows that, remarkably, for any ﬁxed target function, there exists a distribution weighted combining rule that has a loss of at most ǫ with respect to any target mixture of the source distributions. We further generalize the setting from a single target function to multiple consistent target functions and show the existence of a combining rule with error at most 3ǫ. Finally, we report empirical results for a multiple source adaptation problem with a real-world dataset.</p><p>2 0.9714914 <a title="250-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-MAS%3A_a_multiplicative_approximation_scheme_for_probabilistic_inference.html">129 nips-2008-MAS: a multiplicative approximation scheme for probabilistic inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Ydo Wexler, Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multiplicative approximation scheme (MAS) for inference problems in graphical models, which can be applied to various inference algorithms. The method uses -decompositions which decompose functions used throughout the inference procedure into functions over smaller sets of variables with a known error . MAS translates these local approximations into bounds on the accuracy of the results. We show how to optimize -decompositions and provide a fast closed-form solution for an L2 approximation. Applying MAS to the Variable Elimination inference algorithm, we introduce an algorithm we call DynaDecomp which is extremely fast in practice and provides guaranteed error bounds on the result. The superior accuracy and efﬁciency of DynaDecomp is demonstrated. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.94048983 <a title="250-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Weighted_Sums_of_Random_Kitchen_Sinks%3A_Replacing_minimization_with_randomization_in_learning.html">250 nips-2008-Weighted Sums of Random Kitchen Sinks: Replacing minimization with randomization in learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Benjamin Recht</p><p>Abstract: Randomized neural networks are immortalized in this AI Koan: In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6. “What are you doing?” asked Minsky. “I am training a randomly wired neural net to play tic-tac-toe,” Sussman replied. “Why is the net wired randomly?” asked Minsky. Sussman replied, “I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play.” Minsky then shut his eyes. “Why do you close your eyes?” Sussman asked his teacher. “So that the room will be empty,” replied Minsky. At that moment, Sussman was enlightened. We analyze shallow random networks with the help of concentration of measure inequalities. Speciﬁcally, we consider architectures that compute a weighted sum of their inputs after passing them through a bank of arbitrary randomized nonlinearities. We identify conditions under which these networks exhibit good classiﬁcation performance, and bound their test error in terms of the size of the dataset and the number of random nonlinearities. 1</p><p>4 0.93401504 <a title="250-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Multi-label_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">143 nips-2008-Multi-label Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuiwang Ji, Liang Sun, Rong Jin, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-label multiple kernel learning (MKL) formulation in which the data are embedded into a low-dimensional space directed by the instancelabel correlations encoded into a hypergraph. We formulate the problem in the kernel-induced feature space and propose to learn the kernel matrix as a linear combination of a given collection of kernel matrices in the MKL framework. The proposed learning formulation leads to a non-smooth min-max problem, which can be cast into a semi-inﬁnite linear program (SILP). We further propose an approximate formulation with a guaranteed error bound which involves an unconstrained convex optimization problem. In addition, we show that the objective function of the approximate formulation is differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and hence existing methods can be employed to compute the optimal solution efﬁciently. We apply the proposed formulation to the automated annotation of Drosophila gene expression pattern images, and promising results have been reported in comparison with representative algorithms.</p><p>5 0.87749249 <a title="250-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Rademacher_Complexity_Bounds_for_Non-I.I.D._Processes.html">189 nips-2008-Rademacher Complexity Bounds for Non-I.I.D.

<p>Author: Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents the ﬁrst Rademacher complexity-based error bounds for noni.i.d. settings, a generalization of similar existing bounds derived for the i.i.d. case. Our bounds hold in the scenario of dependent samples generated by a stationary β-mixing process, which is commonly adopted in many previous studies of noni.i.d. settings. They beneﬁt from the crucial advantages of Rademacher complexity over other measures of the complexity of hypothesis classes. In particular, they are data-dependent and measure the complexity of a class of hypotheses based on the training sample. The empirical Rademacher complexity can be estimated from such ﬁnite samples and lead to tighter generalization bounds. We also present the ﬁrst margin bounds for kernel-based classiﬁcation in this non-i.i.d. setting and brieﬂy study their convergence.</p><p>6 0.87644637 <a title="250-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Bounded_Treewidth_Bayesian_Networks.html">115 nips-2008-Learning Bounded Treewidth Bayesian Networks</a></p>

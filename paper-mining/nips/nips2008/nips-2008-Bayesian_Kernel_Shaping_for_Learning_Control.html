<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mark Girolami, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Identiﬁcation and comparison of nonlinear dynamical system models using noisy and sparse experimental data is a vital task in many ﬁelds, however current methods are computationally expensive and prone to error due in part to the nonlinear nature of the likelihood surfaces induced. We present an accelerated sampling procedure which enables Bayesian inference of parameters in nonlinear ordinary and delay differential equations via the novel use of Gaussian processes (GP). Our method involves GP regression over time-series data, and the resulting derivative and time delay estimates make parameter inference possible without solving the dynamical system explicitly, resulting in dramatic savings of computational time. We demonstrate the speed and statistical accuracy of our approach using examples of both ordinary and delay differential equations, and provide a comprehensive comparison with current state of the art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.15793566 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Learning_of_Robot_Inverse_Dynamics.html">146 nips-2008-Multi-task Gaussian Process Learning of Robot Inverse Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Stefan Klanke, Sethu Vijayakumar, Kian M. Chai</p><p>Abstract: The inverse dynamics problem for a robotic manipulator is to compute the torques needed at the joints to drive it along a given trajectory; it is beneﬁcial to be able to learn this function for adaptive control. A robotic manipulator will often need to be controlled while holding different loads in its end effector, giving rise to a multi-task learning problem. By placing independent Gaussian process priors over the latent functions of the inverse dynamics, we obtain a multi-task Gaussian process prior for handling multiple loads, where the inter-task similarity depends on the underlying inertial parameters. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-task formulation is effective in sharing information among the various loads, and generally improves performance over either learning only on single tasks or pooling the data over all tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.15590322 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Process_Inference_using_Control_Variables.html">71 nips-2008-Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Process Inference using Control Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>5 0.13572451 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Variational_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Process_Experts.html">249 nips-2008-Variational Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts</a></p>

Previous inference algorithms for these models are mostly based on Gibbs sampling, which can be very slow, particularly for large-scale data sets. We present a new generative mixture of experts model. Each expert is still a Gaussian process but is reformulated by a linear model. This breaks the dependency among training outputs and enables us to use a much faster variational Bayesian algorithm for training. Our gating network is more ﬂexible than previous generative approaches as inputs for each expert are modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. The number of experts and number of Gaussian components for an expert are inferred automatically. A variety of tests show the advantages of our method. 1</p><p>6 0.125879 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Convolved_Gaussian_Processes_for_Multi-output_Regression.html">213 nips-2008-Sparse Convolved Gaussian Processes for Multi-output Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated. We show results of the proposed methodology for synthetic data and real world applications on pollution prediction and a sensor network. 1</p><p>3 0.71278417 <a title="32-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Accelerating_Bayesian_Inference_over_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">12 nips-2008-Accelerating Bayesian Inference over Nonlinear Differential Equations with Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Duy Nguyen-tuong, Jan R. Peters, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-time applications, e.g., online approximation of the inverse dynamics model for model-based robot control, requires fast online regression techniques. Inspired by local learning, we propose a method to speed up standard Gaussian process regression (GPR) with local GP models (LGP). The training data is partitioned in local regions, for each an individual GP model is trained. The prediction for a query point is performed by weighted estimation using nearby local models. Unlike other GP approximations, such as mixtures of experts, we use a distance based measure for partitioning of the data and weighted prediction. The proposed method achieves online learning and prediction in real-time. Comparisons with other non-parametric regression methods show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and ν-SVR. 1</p><p>5 0.70164156 <a title="32-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Process_Inference_using_Control_Variables.html">71 nips-2008-Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Process Inference using Control Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Christoph Sawade, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers for several related tasks that may differ in their joint distribution of input and output variables. For each task, small – possibly even empty – labeled samples and large unlabeled samples are available. While the unlabeled samples reﬂect the target distribution, the labeled samples may be biased. This setting is motivated by the problem of predicting sociodemographic features for users of web portals, based on the content which they have accessed. Here, questionnaires offered to a portion of each portal’s users produce biased samples. We derive a transfer learning procedure that produces resampling weights which match the pool of all examples to the target distribution of any given task. Transfer learning enables us to make predictions even for new portals with few or no training data and improves the overall prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.63414359 <a title="32-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-DiscLDA%3A_Discriminative_Learning_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification.html">64 nips-2008-DiscLDA: Discriminative Learning for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Lacoste-julien, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have become popular as methods for dimensionality reduction in collections of text documents or images. These models are usually treated as generative models and trained using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. In this paper, we discuss an alternative: a discriminative framework in which we assume that supervised side information is present, and in which we wish to take that side information into account in ﬁnding a reduced dimensionality representation. Speciﬁcally, we present DiscLDA, a discriminative variation on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in which a class-dependent linear transformation is introduced on the topic mixture proportions. This parameter is estimated by maximizing the conditional likelihood. By using the transformed topic mixture proportions as a new representation of documents, we obtain a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that uncovers the latent structure in a document collection while preserving predictive power for the task of classiﬁcation. We compare the predictive power of the latent structure of DiscLDA with unsupervised LDA on the 20 Newsgroups document classiﬁcation task and show how our model can identify shared topics across classes as well as class-dependent topics.</p><p>5 0.53506804 <a title="32-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Local_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Real_Time_Online_Model_Learning.html">125 nips-2008-Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real Time Online Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Duy Nguyen-tuong, Jan R. Peters, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-time applications, e.g., online approximation of the inverse dynamics model for model-based robot control, requires fast online regression techniques. Inspired by local learning, we propose a method to speed up standard Gaussian process regression (GPR) with local GP models (LGP). The training data is partitioned in local regions, for each an individual GP model is trained. The prediction for a query point is performed by weighted estimation using nearby local models. Unlike other GP approximations, such as mixtures of experts, we use a distance based measure for partitioning of the data and weighted prediction. The proposed method achieves online learning and prediction in real-time. Comparisons with other non-parametric regression methods show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and ν-SVR. 1</p><p>6 0.52099109 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>

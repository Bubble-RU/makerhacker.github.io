</p><p>8 1  Introduction  In his highly inﬂuential paper, [1], Kleinberg advocates the development of a theory of clustering that will be “independent of any particular algorithm, objective function, or generative data model. [sent-11, score-0.373]
</p><p>9 ” As a step in that direction, Kleinberg sets up a set of “axioms” aimed to deﬁne what a clustering function is. [sent-12, score-0.373]
</p><p>10 Kleinberg suggests three axioms, each sounding plausible, and shows that these seemingly natural axioms lead to a contradiction - there exists no function that satisﬁes all three requirements. [sent-13, score-0.768]
</p><p>11 Kleinberg’s result is often interpreted as stating the impossibility of deﬁning what clustering is, or even of developing a general theory of clustering. [sent-14, score-0.487]
</p><p>12 Rather than attempting to deﬁne what a clustering function is, and demonstrating a failed attempt, as [1] does, we turn our attention to the closely related issue of evaluating the quality of a given data clustering. [sent-17, score-0.549]
</p><p>13 As it turns out, the clustering-quality framework is richer and more ﬂexible than that of clustering functions. [sent-19, score-0.373]
</p><p>14 In particular, it allows the postulation of axioms that capture the features that Kleinberg’s axioms aim to express, without leading to a contradiction. [sent-20, score-1.495]
</p><p>15 1  A clustering-quality measure is a function that maps pairs of the form (dataset, clustering) to some ordered set (say, the set of non-negative real numbers), so that these values reﬂect how ‘good’ or ‘cogent’ that clustering is. [sent-21, score-0.422]
</p><p>16 The need to measure the quality of a given data clustering arises naturally in many clustering issues. [sent-23, score-0.971]
</p><p>17 The aim of clustering is to uncover meaningful groups in data. [sent-24, score-0.406]
</p><p>18 Upon obtaining a clustering, usually via some algorithm, a user needs to determine whether this clustering is sufﬁciently meaningful to rely upon for further data mining analysis or practical applications. [sent-26, score-0.402]
</p><p>19 Clustering-quality measures may also be used to help in clustering model-selection by comparing different clusterings over the same data set (e. [sent-28, score-0.602]
</p><p>20 , comparing the results of a given clustering paradigm over different choices of clustering parameters, such as the number of clusters). [sent-30, score-0.746]
</p><p>21 When posed with the problem of ﬁnding a clustering-quality measure, a ﬁrst attempt may be to invoke the loss (or objective) function used by a clustering algorithm, such as k-means or k-median, as a clustering-quality measure. [sent-31, score-0.393]
</p><p>22 Namely, these measures are usually not scale-invariant, and they cannot be used to compare the quality of clusterings obtained by different algorithms aiming to minimize different clustering costs (e. [sent-33, score-0.811]
</p><p>23 We demonstrate the relevance and consistency of these axioms by showing that several natural notions satisfy these requirements. [sent-42, score-0.907]
</p><p>24 These notions all satisfy our axioms, and, given a data clustering, their value on that clustering can be computed in polynomial time. [sent-44, score-0.474]
</p><p>25 Paper outline: we begin by presenting Kleinberg’s axioms for clustering functions and discuss their failure. [sent-45, score-1.14]
</p><p>26 3 we show how these axioms can be translated into axioms pertaining clustering quality measures, and prove that the resulting set of axioms is consistent. [sent-47, score-2.766]
</p><p>27 3, we show that the quality of a clustering can be computed in polynomial time with respect to our proposed clustering-quality measures. [sent-51, score-0.572]
</p><p>28 A clustering of X is a k-clustering of X for some k ≥ 1. [sent-60, score-0.373]
</p><p>29 A clustering is trivial if i=1 each of its clusters contains just one point, or if it consists of just one cluster. [sent-61, score-0.43]
</p><p>30 For x, y ∈ X and clustering C of X, we write x ∼C y whenever x and y are in the same cluster of clustering C and x ∼C y, otherwise. [sent-62, score-0.819]
</p><p>31 A clustering function for some domain set X is a function that takes a distance function d over X, and outputs a clustering of X. [sent-63, score-0.806]
</p><p>32 2  A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that is given a clustering C over (X, d) (where d is a distance function over X) and returns a non-negative real number, as well as satisﬁes some additional requirements. [sent-64, score-0.479]
</p><p>33 3  Kleinberg’s Axioms  Kleinberg, [1], proposes the following three axioms for clustering functions. [sent-66, score-1.112]
</p><p>34 These axioms are intended to capture the meaning of clustering by determining which functions (from a domain set endowed with a distance function) are worthy of being considered clustering functions and which are not. [sent-67, score-1.635]
</p><p>35 The ﬁrst two axioms require invariance of the clustering that f deﬁnes under some changes of the input distance function. [sent-69, score-1.287]
</p><p>36 Function Scale Invariance: Scale invariance requires that the output of a clustering function be invariant to uniform scaling of the input. [sent-70, score-0.489]
</p><p>37 Function Consistency: Consistency requires that if within-cluster distances are decreased, and between-cluster distances are increased, then the output of a clustering function does not change. [sent-72, score-0.373]
</p><p>38 Formally, • Given a clustering C over (X, d), a distance function d is a C-consistent variant of d, if d (x, y) ≤ d(x, y) for all x ∼C y, and d (x, y) ≥ d(x, y) for all x ∼C y. [sent-73, score-0.43]
</p><p>39 Theorem 1 (Kleinberg, [1]) There exists no clustering function that simultaneously satisﬁes scale invariance, consistency and richness. [sent-77, score-0.491]
</p><p>40 Discussion: The intuition behind these axioms is rather clear. [sent-78, score-0.762]
</p><p>41 It seems reasonable that by pulling closer points that are in the same cluster and pushing further apart points in different clusters, our conﬁdence in the given clustering will only rise. [sent-80, score-0.47]
</p><p>42 However, while this intuition can be readily formulated in terms of clustering quality (namely, “changes as these should not decrease the quality of a clustering”), the formulation through clustering functions says more. [sent-81, score-1.149]
</p><p>43 While one may argue that the quality of the original 6-clustering has not decreased as a result of the distance changes, the quality of the 3-clustering has improved beyond that of the 6-clustering. [sent-86, score-0.431]
</p><p>44 This illustrates a signiﬁcant weakness of the consistency axiom for clustering functions. [sent-87, score-0.561]
</p><p>45 The implicit requirement that the original clustering remains the best clustering following a consistent change is at the heart of Kleinberg’s impossibility result. [sent-88, score-0.933]
</p><p>46 As we shall see below, once we relax that extra requirement the axioms are no longer unsatisﬁable. [sent-89, score-0.762]
</p><p>47 4  Axioms of Clustering-Quality Measures  In this section we change the primitive that is being deﬁned by the axioms from clustering functions to clustering-quality measures (CQM). [sent-90, score-1.282]
</p><p>48 We reformulate the above three axioms in terms of CQMs 3  Figure 1: A consistent change of a 6-clustering. [sent-91, score-0.789]
</p><p>49 and show that this revised formulation is not only consistent, but is also satisﬁed by a number of natural clustering quality measures. [sent-92, score-0.581]
</p><p>50 In addition, we extend the set of axioms by adding another axiom (of clustering-quality measures) that is required to rule out some measures that should not be counted as CQMs. [sent-93, score-0.96]
</p><p>51 Deﬁnition 2 (Consistency) A quality measure m satisﬁes consistency if for every clustering C over (X, d), whenever d is a C consistent variant of d, then m(C, X, d ) ≥ m(C, X, d). [sent-98, score-0.768]
</p><p>52 Deﬁnition 3 (Richness) A quality measure m satisﬁes richness if for each non-trivial clustering C of X, there exists a distance function d over X such that C = Argmax{m(C, X, d)}. [sent-99, score-0.825]
</p><p>53 Theorem 2 Consistency, scale invariance, and richness for clustering-quality measures form a consistent set of requirements. [sent-100, score-0.342]
</p><p>54 Proof: To show that scale-invariance, consistency, and richness form a consistent set of axioms, we present a clustering quality measure that satisﬁes the three axioms. [sent-101, score-0.804]
</p><p>55 Intuitively, the smaller this ratio is, the better the clustering (points are ‘more conﬁdent’ about their cluster membership). [sent-106, score-0.42]
</p><p>56 1 The following formalization assumes that larger values of m indicate better clustering quality. [sent-109, score-0.373]
</p><p>57 For some quality measures, smaller values indicate better clustering quality - in which case we reverse the direction of inequalities for consistency and use Argmin instead of Argmax for richness. [sent-110, score-0.801]
</p><p>58 4  A set K is a representative set of a clustering C if it consists of exactly one point from each cluster of C. [sent-111, score-0.448]
</p><p>59 Deﬁnition 5 (Representative Set) A set K is a representative set of clustering C {C1 , C2 , . [sent-112, score-0.401]
</p><p>60 =  Deﬁnition 6 (Relative Margin) The Relative Margin of a clustering C over (X, d) is RMX,d (C) =  min  K is a representative set of C  avgx∈X\K K-RMX,d (x). [sent-116, score-0.401]
</p><p>61 Smaller values of Relative Margin indicate better clustering quality. [sent-117, score-0.373]
</p><p>62 proof: Let C be a clustering of distance function (X, d). [sent-125, score-0.414]
</p><p>63 proof: Given a non-trivial clustering C over a data set X, consider the distance function d where d(x, y) = 1 for all x ∼C y, and d(x, y) = 10 for all x ∼C y. [sent-130, score-0.414]
</p><p>64 Usually, when a set of axioms is proposed for some semantic notion (or a class of objects, say clustering functions), the aim is to have both soundness and completeness. [sent-135, score-1.228]
</p><p>65 Soundness means that every element of the described class satisﬁes all axioms (so, in particular, soundness implies consistency of the axioms), and completeness means that every property shared by all objects of the class is implied by the axioms. [sent-136, score-0.984]
</p><p>66 Intuitively, ignoring logic subtleties, a set of axioms is complete for a class of objects if any element outside that class fails at least one of these axioms. [sent-137, score-0.739]
</p><p>67 In our context, there is a major difﬁculty - there exist no semantic deﬁnition of what clustering is. [sent-138, score-0.373]
</p><p>68 We wish to use the axioms as a deﬁnition of clustering functions, but then what is the meaning of soundness and completeness? [sent-139, score-1.192]
</p><p>69 While we do not have a clear deﬁnition of what is clustering and what is not, we do have some examples of functions that should be considered clustering functions, and we can come up with some examples of partitionings that are clearly not worthy of being called “clustering”. [sent-141, score-0.808]
</p><p>70 We replace soundness by the requirement that all of our axioms are satisﬁed by all these examples of common clustering functions (relaxed soundness), and we want that partitioning functions that are clearly not clusterings fail at least one of our axioms (relaxed completeness). [sent-142, score-2.174]
</p><p>71 In this respect, the axioms of [1] badly fail (the relaxed version of) soundness. [sent-143, score-0.791]
</p><p>72 For each of these axioms there are natural clustering functions that fail to satisfy it (this is implied by Kleinberg’s demonstration that any pair of axioms is satisﬁed by a natural clustering, while the three together never hold). [sent-144, score-2.052]
</p><p>73 There are functions that should not be considered “reasonable clustering quality measures” and yet they satisfy these three axioms. [sent-147, score-0.641]
</p><p>74 [3], modeling the requirement that clustering should be indifferent to the individual identity of clustered elements. [sent-153, score-0.396]
</p><p>75 Deﬁnition 8 (Isomorphism Invariance) A quality measure m is isomorphism -invariant if for all clusterings C, C over (X, d) where C ≈d C , m(C, X, d) = m(C , X, d). [sent-156, score-0.42]
</p><p>76 Theorem 3 The set of axioms consisting of Isomorphism Invariance, Scale Invariance, Consistency, and Richness, (all in their CQM formulation) is a consistent set of axioms. [sent-157, score-0.774]
</p><p>77 5  Examples of Clustering Quality Measures  In a survey of validity measures, Milligan [2] discusses examples of quality measures that satisfy our axioms (namely, scale-invariance, consistency, richness, and perturbation invariance). [sent-164, score-1.105]
</p><p>78 The weakest link quality measure focuses on the longest link in such a chain. [sent-170, score-0.414]
</p><p>79 , d(x , y))),  where C is a clustering over (X, d) and Ci is a cluster in C. [sent-177, score-0.42]
</p><p>80 Deﬁnition 10 (Weakest Link of C) The Weakest Link of a clustering C over (X, d) is W L(C) =  maxx∼C y C-W LX,d (x, y) . [sent-179, score-0.373]
</p><p>81 Deﬁnition 11 (Additive Point Margin) The K-Additive Point Margin of x is K-AMX,d (x) = d(x, cx ) − d(x, cx ), where cx ∈ K is the closest center to x, cx ∈ K is a second closest center to x, and K ⊆ X. [sent-186, score-0.406]
</p><p>82 The Additive Margin of a clustering is the average Additive Point Margin, divided by the average within-cluster distance. [sent-187, score-0.373]
</p><p>83 Deﬁnition 12 (Additive Margin) The Additive Margin of a center-based clustering C over (X, d) is 1 x∈X K-AMX,d (x) |X| AMX,d (C) = min . [sent-189, score-0.373]
</p><p>84 3  Computational complexity  For a clustering-quality measure to be useful, it is important to be able to quickly compute the quality of a clustering using that measure. [sent-192, score-0.598]
</p><p>85 The quality of a clustering using the measures presented in this paper can be computed in polynomial time in terms of n (the number of points in the data set). [sent-193, score-0.699]
</p><p>86 Using relative or Additive Margin, it takes O(nk+1 ) operations to compute the clustering quality of a data set, which is exponential in k. [sent-194, score-0.581]
</p><p>87 The weakest link of a clustering can be computed in O(n3 ) operations. [sent-196, score-0.51]
</p><p>88 4  Variants of quality measures  Given a clustering-quality measure, we can construct new quality measures with different characteristics by applying the quality measure on a subset of clusters. [sent-198, score-0.795]
</p><p>89 It sufﬁces to consider a quality measure m that is deﬁned for clusterings consisting of 2 clusters. [sent-199, score-0.345]
</p><p>90 For example, mmin (C, X, d) =  min  m(S, X, d),  S⊆C,|S|=2  measures the worst quality of a pair of clusters in C. [sent-201, score-0.388]
</p><p>91 A nice feature of these variations is that if m satisﬁes the four axioms of clustering-quality measures then so do mmin , mmax , and mavg . [sent-203, score-0.947]
</p><p>92 More generally, if m is deﬁned for clusterings on an arbitrary number of clusters, we can deﬁne a quality measure as a function of m over larger clusterings. [sent-204, score-0.345]
</p><p>93 Many such variations, which apply existing clustering-quality measures on subsets of clusters, satisfy the axioms of clustering-quality measures whenever the original quality measure satisﬁes the axioms. [sent-206, score-1.272]
</p><p>94 In this section we discuss an alternative type of clustering quality evaluation, that depends on the number of clusters. [sent-208, score-0.549]
</p><p>95 Such quality measures arise naturally from common loss functions (or, objective functions) that drive clustering algorithm, such as k-means or k-median. [sent-209, score-0.706]
</p><p>96 Deﬁnition 13 (L-normalization) The L-normalization of a clustering C over (X, d) is L-normalize(C, X, d) =  L(Call , X, d) . [sent-214, score-0.373]
</p><p>97 Deﬁnition 15 (Reﬁnement/Coarsening Preference) A measure m is reﬁnement-preferring if for every clustering C of (X, d) if it has a non-trivial reﬁnement, then there exists such a reﬁnement C of C for which m(C , X, d) > m(C, X, d). [sent-219, score-0.454]
</p><p>98 To evaluate the quality of a clustering using a reﬁnement (and coarsening) preferring measure, it is essential to ﬁx the number of clusters. [sent-223, score-0.586]
</p><p>99 We argue that a natural way to overcome these negative conclusions is by changing the primitive used to formulate the axioms from clustering functions to clustering quality measures (CQMs). [sent-227, score-1.88]
</p><p>100 We demonstrate the merits of the latter framework by providing a set of axioms for CQMs that captures the essence of all of Kleinberg’s axioms while maintaining consistency. [sent-228, score-1.492]

<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>2 0.13451444 <a title="132-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2008-Spectral_Clustering_with_Perturbed_Data.html">218 nips-2008-Spectral Clustering with Perturbed Data</a></p>

However, the computational and/or communication resources required by the method in processing large-scale data are often prohibitively high, and practitioners are often required to perturb the original data in various ways (quantization, downsampling, etc) before invoking a spectral algorithm. In this paper, we use stochastic perturbation theory to study the effects of data perturbation on the performance of spectral clustering. We show that the error under perturbation of spectral clustering is closely related to the perturbation of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. From this result we derive approximate upper bounds on the clustering error. We show that this bound is tight empirically across a wide range of problems, suggesting that it can be used in practical settings to determine the amount of data reduction allowed in order to meet a speciﬁcation of permitted loss in clustering performance. 1</p><p>3 0.13156213 <a title="132-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of unsupervised algorithms, numerical taxonomy clustering, to simultaneously cluster data, and to learn a taxonomy that encodes the relationship between the clusters. The algorithms work by maximizing the dependence between the taxonomy and the original data. The resulting taxonomy is a more informative visualization of complex data than simple clustering; in addition, taking into account the relations between different clusters is shown to substantially improve the quality of the clustering, when compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms in the literature (both spectral clustering and a previous dependence maximization approach). We demonstrate our algorithm on image and text data. 1</p><p>4 0.12500516 <a title="132-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem.

<p>Author: Markus Maier, Ulrike V. Luxburg, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Graph clustering methods such as spectral clustering are deﬁned for general weighted graphs. In machine learning, however, data often is not given in form of a graph, but in terms of similarity (or distance) values between points. In this case, ﬁrst a neighborhood graph is constructed using the similarities between the points and then a graph clustering algorithm is applied to this graph. In this paper we investigate the inﬂuence of the construction of the similarity graph on the clustering results. We ﬁrst study the convergence of graph clustering criteria such as the normalized cut (Ncut) as the sample size tends to inﬁnity. We ﬁnd that the limit expressions are different for different types of graph, for example the r-neighborhood graph or the k-nearest neighbor graph. In plain words: Ncut on a kNN graph does something systematically different than Ncut on an r-neighborhood graph! This ﬁnding shows that graph clustering criteria cannot be studied independently of the kind of graph they are applied to. We also provide examples which show that these differences can be observed for toy and real data already for rather small sample sizes. 1</p><p>6 0.081506968 <a title="132-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Cyclizing_Clusters_via_Zeta_Function_of_a_Graph.html">55 nips-2008-Cyclizing Clusters via Zeta Function of a Graph</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>2 0.82070321 <a title="132-lsi-2" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting underlying clusters from large-scale data plays a central role in machine learning research. In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering complex data of multiple distributions and multiple scales. To this end, we develop an algorithm named Zeta l-links (Zell) which consists of two parts: Zeta merging with a similarity graph and an initial set of small clusters derived from local l-links of samples. More speciﬁcally, we propose to structurize a cluster using cycles in the associated subgraph. A new mathematical tool, Zeta function of a graph, is introduced for the integration of all cycles, leading to a structural descriptor of a cluster in determinantal form. The popularity character of a cluster is conceptualized as the global fusion of variations of such a structural descriptor by means of the leave-one-out strategy in the cluster. Zeta merging proceeds, in the hierarchical agglomerative fashion, according to the maximum incremental popularity among all pairwise clusters. Experiments on toy data clustering, imagery pattern clustering, and image segmentation show the competitive performance of Zell. The 98.1% accuracy, in the sense of the normalized mutual information (NMI), is obtained on the FRGC face data of 16028 samples and 466 facial clusters. 1</p><p>4 0.74062961 <a title="132-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Fei Xu</p><p>Abstract: Before the age of 4 months, infants make inductive inferences about the motions of physical objects. Developmental psychologists have provided verbal accounts of the knowledge that supports these inferences, but often these accounts focus on categorical rather than probabilistic principles. We propose that infant object perception is guided in part by probabilistic principles like persistence: things tend to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. To illustrate this idea we develop an ideal observer model that incorporates probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia. Like previous researchers, we suggest that rigid motions are expected from an early age, but we challenge the previous claim that the inertia principle is relatively slow to develop [1]. We support these arguments by modeling several experiments from the developmental literature. Over the past few decades, ingenious experiments [1, 2] have suggested that infants rely on systematic expectations about physical objects when interpreting visual scenes. Looking time studies suggest, for example, that infants expect objects to follow continuous trajectories through time and space, and understand that two objects cannot simultaneously occupy the same location. Many of these studies have been replicated several times, but there is still no consensus about the best way to characterize the knowledge that gives rise to these ﬁndings. Two main approaches can be found in the literature. The verbal approach uses natural language to characterize principles of object perception [1, 3]: for example, Spelke [4] proposes that object perception is consistent with principles including continuity (“a moving object traces exactly one connected path over space and time”) and cohesion (“a moving object maintains its connectedness and boundaries”). The mechanistic approach proposes that physical knowledge is better characterized by describing the mechanisms that give rise to behavior, and researchers working in this tradition often develop computational models that support their theoretical proposals [5]. We pursue a third approach—the ideal observer approach [6, 7, 8]—that combines aspects of both previous traditions. Like the verbal approach, our primary goal is to characterize principles that account for infant behavior, and we will not attempt to characterize the mechanisms that produce this behavior. Like the mechanistic approach, we emphasize the importance of formal models, and suggest that these models can capture forms of knowledge that are difﬁcult for verbal accounts to handle. Ideal observer models [6, 9] specify the conclusions that normatively follow given a certain source of information and a body of background knowledge. These models can therefore address questions about the information and the knowledge that support perception. Approaches to the information question characterize the kinds of perceptual information that human observers use. For example, Geisler [9] discusses which components of the information available at the retina contribute to visual perception, and Banks and Shannon [10] use ideal observer models to study the perceptual consequences of immaturities in the retina. Approaches to the knowledge question characterize the background assumptions that are combined with the available input in order to make inductive inferences. For example, Weiss and Adelson [7] describe several empirical phenomena that are consistent with the a priori assumption that motions tend to be slow and smooth. There are few previous attempts to develop ideal observer models of infant perception, and most of them focus only on the information question [10]. This paper addresses the knowledge question, and proposes that the ideal observer approach can help to identify the minimal set of principles needed to account for the visual competence of young infants. Most verbal theories of object perception focus on categorical principles [4], or principles that make a single distinction between possible and impossible scenes. We propose that physical knowledge in infancy is also characterized by probabilistic principles, or expectations that make some possible scenes more surprising than others. We demonstrate the importance of probabilistic principles by focusing on two examples: the rigidity principle states that objects usually maintain their shape and size when they move, and the inertia principle states that objects tend to maintain the same pattern of motion over time. Both principles capture important regularities, but exceptions to these regularities are relatively common. Focusing on rigidity and inertia allows us to demonstrate two contributions that probabilistic approaches can make. First, probabilistic approaches can reinforce current proposals about infant perception. Spelke [3] suggests that rigidity is a core principle that guides object perception from a very early age, and we demonstrate how this idea can be captured by a model that also tolerates exceptions, such as non-rigid biological motion. Second, probabilistic approaches can identify places where existing proposals may need to be revised. Spelke [3] argues that the principle of inertia is slow to develop, but we suggest that a probabilistic version of this principle can help to account for inferences made early in development. 1 An ideal observer approach An ideal observer approach to object perception can be formulated in terms of a generative model for scenes. Scenes can be generated in three steps. First we choose the number n of objects that will appear in the scene, and generate the shape, visual appearance, and initial location of each object. We then choose a velocity ﬁeld for each object which speciﬁes how the object moves and changes shape over time. Finally, we create a visual scene by taking a two-dimensional projection of the moving objects generated in the two previous steps. An ideal observer approach explores the idea that the inferences made by infants approximate the optimal inferences with respect to this generative model. We work within this general framework but make two simpliﬁcations. We will not discuss how the shapes and visual appearances of objects are generated, and we make the projection step simple by working with a two-dimensional world. These simpliﬁcations allow us to focus on the expectations about velocity ﬁelds that guide motion perception in infants. The next two sections present two prior distributions that can be used to generate velocity ﬁelds. The ﬁrst is a baseline prior that does not incorporate probabilistic principles, and the second incorporates probabilistic versions of rigidity and inertia. The two priors capture different kinds of knowledge, and we argue that the second provides the more accurate characterization of the knowledge that infants bring to object perception. 1.1 A baseline prior on velocity ﬁelds Our baseline prior is founded on ﬁve categorical principles that are closely related to principles discussed by Spelke [3, 4]. The principles we consider rely on three basic notions: space, time, and matter. We also refer to particles, which are small pieces of matter that occupy space-time points. Particles satisfy several principles: C1. Temporal continuity. Particles are not created or destroyed. In other words, every particle that exists at time t1 must also exist at time t2 . C2. Spatial continuity. Each particle traces a continuous trajectory through space. C3. Exclusion. No two particles may occupy the same space-time point. An object is a collection of particles, and these collections satisfy two principles: C4. Discreteness. Each particle belongs to exactly one object. C5. Cohesion. At each point in time, the particles belonging to an object occupy a single connected region of space. Suppose that we are interested in a space-time window speciﬁed by a bounded region of space and a bounded interval of time. For simplicity, we will assume that space is two-dimensional, and that the space-time window corresponds to the unit cube. Suppose that a velocity ﬁeld v assigns a velocity (vx , vy ) to each particle in the space-time window, and let vi be the ﬁeld created by considering only particles that belong to object i. We develop a theory of object perception by deﬁning a prior distribution p(v) on velocity ﬁelds. Consider ﬁrst the distribution p(v1 ) on ﬁelds for a single object. Any ﬁeld that violates one or more of principles C1–C5 is assigned zero probability. For instance, ﬁelds where part of an object winks out of existence violate the principle of temporal continuity, and ﬁelds where an object splits into two distinct pieces violate the principle of cohesion. Many ﬁelds, however, remain, including ﬁelds that specify non-rigid motions and jagged trajectories. For now, assume that we are working with a space of ﬁelds that is bounded but very large, and that the prior distribution over this space is uniform for all ﬁelds consistent with principles C1–C5: p(v1 ) ∝ f (v1 ) = 0 1 if v1 violates C1–C5 otherwise. (1) Consider now the distribution p(v1 , v2 ) on ﬁelds for pairs of objects. Principles C1 through C5 rule out some of these ﬁelds, but again we must specify a prior distribution on those that remain. Our prior is induced by the following principle: C6. Independence. Velocity ﬁelds for multiple objects are independently generated subject to principles C1 through C5. More formally, the independence principle speciﬁes how the prior for the multiple object case is related to the prior p(v1 ) on velocity ﬁelds for a single object (Equation 1): p(v1 , . . . , vn ) ∝ f (v1 , . . . , vn ) = 0 if {vi } collectively violate C1–C5 f (v1 ) . . . f (vn ) otherwise. (2) 1.2 A smoothness prior on velocity ﬁelds We now develop a prior p(v) that incorporates probabilistic expectations about the motion of physical objects. Consider again the prior p(v1 ) on the velocity ﬁeld v1 of a single object. Principles C1–C5 make a single cut that distinguishes possible from impossible ﬁelds, but we need to consider whether infants have additional knowledge that makes some of the possible ﬁelds less surprising than others. One informal idea that seems relevant is the notion of persistence[11]: things tend to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. We focus on two versions of this idea that may guide expectations about velocity ﬁelds: S1. Spatial smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in space. S2. Temporal smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in time. A ﬁeld is “smooth in space” if neighboring particles tend to have similar velocities at any instant of time. The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where all particles have the same velocity at any instant—in other words, where an object moves rigidly. The principle of spatial smoothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain the same shape and size. A ﬁeld is “smooth in time” if any particle tends to have similar velocities at nearby instants of time. The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where each particle maintains the same velocity throughout the entire interval of interest. The principle of temporal smoothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain their initial pattern of motion. For instance, stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and a moving object following a given trajectory tends to continue along that trajectory. Principles S1 and S2 are related to two principles— rigidity and inertia—that have been discussed in the developmental literature. The rigidity principle states that objects “tend to maintain their size and shape over motion”[3], and the inertia principle states that objects move smoothly in the absence of obstacles [4]. Some authors treat these principles rather differently: for instance, Spelke suggests that rigidity is one of the core principles that guides object perception from a very early age [3], but that the principle of inertia is slow to develop and is weak or fragile once acquired. Since principles S1 and S2 seem closely related, the suggestion that one develops much later than the other seems counterintuitive. The rest of this paper explores the idea that both of these principles are needed to characterize infant perception. Our arguments will be supported by formal analyses, and we therefore need formal versions of S1 and S2. There may be different ways to formalize these principles, but we present a simple L1 L2 U b) 200 L1 L2 U 0 log “ p(H1 |v) p(H2 |v) ” a) −200 baseline smoothness Figure 1: (a) Three scenes inspired by the experiments of Spelke and colleagues [12, 13]. Each scene can be interpreted as a single object, or as a small object on top of a larger object. (b) Relative preferences for the one-object and two-object interpretations according to two models. The baseline model prefers the one-object interpretation in all three cases, but the smoothness model prefers the one-object interpretation only for scenes L1 and L2. approach that builds on existing models of motion perception in adults [7, 8]. We deﬁne measures of instantaneous roughness that capture how rapidly a velocity ﬁeld v varies in space and time: Rspace (v, t) = ∂v(x, y, t) ∂x 2 ∂v(x, y, t) ∂t 1 vol(O(t)) 2 + ∂v(x, y, t) ∂y 2 dxdy (3) O(t) Rtime (v, t) = 1 vol(O(t)) dxdy (4) O(t) where O(t) is the set of all points that are occupied by the object at time t, and vol(O(t)) is the volume of the object at time t. Rspace (v, t) will be large if neighboring particles at time t tend to have different velocities, and Rtime (v, t) will be large if many particles are accelerating at time t. We combine our two roughness measures to create a single smoothness function S(·) that measures the smoothness of a velocity ﬁeld: S(v) = −λspace Rspace (v, t)dt − λtime Rtime (v, t)dt (5) where λspace and λtime are positive weights that capture the importance of spatial smoothness and temporal smoothness. For all analyses in this paper we set λspace = 10000 and λtime = 250, which implies that violations of spatial smoothness are penalized more harshly than violations of temporal smoothness. We now replace Equation 1 with a prior on velocity ﬁelds that takes smoothness into account: 0 if v1 violates C1–C5 p(v1 ) ∝ f (v1 ) = (6) exp (S(v1 )) otherwise. Combining Equation 6 with Equation 2 speciﬁes a model of object perception that incorporates probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia. 2 Empirical ﬁndings: spatial smoothness There are many experiments where infants aged 4 months and younger appear to make inferences that are consistent with the principle of rigidity. This section suggests that the principle of spatial smoothness can account for these results. We therefore propose that a probabilistic principle (spatial smoothness) can explain all of the ﬁndings previously presented in support of a categorical principle (rigidity), and can help in addition to explain how infants perceive non-rigid motion. One set of studies explores inferences about the number of objects in a scene. When a smaller block is resting on top of a larger block (L1 in Figure 1a), 3-month-olds infer that the scene includes a single object [12]. The same result holds when the small and large blocks are both moving in the same direction (L2 in Figure 1a) [13]. When these blocks are moving in opposite directions (U in Figure 1a), however, infants appear to infer that the scene contains two objects [13]. Results like these suggest that infants may have a default expectation that objects tend to move rigidly. We compared the predictions made by two models about the scenes in Figure 1a. The smoothness model uses a prior p(v1 ) that incorporates principles S1 and S2 (Equation 6), and the baseline model is identical except that it sets λspace = λtime = 0. Both models therefore incorporate principles C1– C6, but only the smoothness model captures the principle of spatial smoothness. Given any of the scenes in Figure 1a, an infant must solve two problems: she must compute the velocity ﬁeld v for the scene and must decide whether this ﬁeld speciﬁes the motion of one or two objects. Here we focus on the second problem, and assume that the infant’s perceptual system has already computed a veridical velocity ﬁeld for each scene that we consider. In principle, however, the smoothness prior in Equation 6 can address both problems. Previous authors have shown how smoothness priors can be used to compute velocity ﬁelds given raw image data [7, 8]. Let H1 be the hypothesis that a given velocity ﬁeld corresponds to a single object, and let H2 be the hypothesis that the ﬁeld speciﬁes the motions of two objects. We assume that the prior probabilities of these hypotheses are equal, and that P (H1 ) = P (H2 ) = 0.5. An ideal observer can use the posterior odds ratio to choose between these hypotheses: P (H1 |v) P (v|H1 ) P (H1 ) = ≈ P (H2 |v) P (v|H2 ) P (H2 ) f (v) f (v1 )dv1 f (v1 , v2 )dv1 dv2 f (vA , vB ) (7) Equation 7 follows from Equations 2 and 6, and from approximating P (v|H2 ) by considering only the two object interpretation (vA , vB ) with maximum posterior probability. For each scene in Figure 1a, the best two object interpretation will specify a ﬁeld vA for the small upper block, and a ﬁeld vB for the large lower block. To approximate the posterior odds ratio in Equation 7 we compute rough approximations of f (v1 )dv1 and f (v1 , v2 )dv1 dv2 by summing over a ﬁnite space of velocity ﬁelds. As described in the supporting material, we consider all ﬁelds that can be built from objects with 5 possible shapes, 900 possible starting locations, and 10 possible trajectories. For computational tractability, we convert each continuous velocity ﬁeld to a discrete ﬁeld deﬁned over a space-time grid with 45 cells along each spatial dimension and 21 cells along the temporal dimension. Our results show that both models prefer the one-object hypothesis H1 when presented with scenes L1 and L2 (Figure 1b). Since there are many more two-object scenes than one-object scenes, any typical two-object interpretation is assigned lower prior probability than a typical one-object interpretation. This preference for simpler interpretations is a consequence of the Bayesian Occam’s razor. The baseline model makes the same kind of inference about scene U, and again prefers the one-object interpretation. Like infants, however, the smoothness model prefers the two-object interpretation of scene U. This model assigns low probability to a one-object interpretation where adjacent points on the object have very different velocities, and this preference for smooth motion is strong enough to overcome the simplicity preference that makes the difference when interpreting the other two scenes. Other experiments from the developmental literature have produced results consistent with the principle of spatial smoothness. For example, 3.5-month olds are surprised when a tall object is fully hidden behind a short screen, 4 month olds are surprised when a large object appears to pass through a small slot, and 4.5-month olds expect a swinging screen to be interrupted when an object is placed in its path [1, 2]. All three inferences appear to rely on the expectation that objects tend not to shrink or to compress like foam rubber. Many of these experiments are consistent with an account that simply rules out non-rigid motion instead of introducing a graded preference for spatial smoothness. Biological motions, however, are typically non-rigid, and experiments suggest that infants can track and make inferences about objects that follow non-rigid trajectories [14]. Findings like these call for a theory like ours that incorporates a preference for rigid motion, but recognizes that non-rigid motions are possible. 3 Empirical ﬁndings: temporal smoothness We now turn to the principle of temporal smoothness (S2) and discuss some of the experimental evidence that bears on this principle. Some researchers suggest that a closely related principle (inertia) is slow to develop, but we argue that expectations about temporal smoothness are needed to capture inferences made before the age of 4 months. Baillargeon and DeVos [15] describe one relevant experiment that explores inferences about moving objects and obstacles. During habituation, 3.5-month-old infants saw a car pass behind an occluder and emerge from the other side (habituation stimulus H in Figure 2a). An obstacle was then placed in the direct path of the car (unlikely scenes U1 and U2) or beside this direct path (likely scene L), and the infants again saw the car pass behind the occluder and emerge from the other side.

The habituation stimulus H shows a block passing behind a barrier and emerging on the other side. After habituation, a new block is added either out of the direct path of the ﬁrst block (L) or directly in the path of the ﬁrst block (U1 and U2). In U1, the ﬁrst block leaps over the second block, and in U2 the second block hops so that the ﬁrst block can pass underneath. (b) Relative probabilities of scenes L, U1 and U2 according to two models. The baseline model ﬁnds all three scenes equally likely a priori, and considers L and U2 equally likely after habituation. The smoothness model considers L more likely than the other scenes both before and after habituation. a) H1 H2 L U b) ” log p(L) p(U ) 300 log “ pH1 (L) pH1 (U ) ” 200 c) “ log “ pH2 (L) pH2 (U ) ” 100 0 −100 X X baseline smoothness Figure 3: (a) Stimuli inspired by the experiments of Spelke et al. [16]. (b) Model predictions. After habituation to H1, the smoothness model assigns roughly equal probabilities to L and U. After habituation to H2, the model considers L more likely. (c) A stronger test of the inertia principle. Now the best interpretation of stimulus U involves multiple changes of direction. time measurements suggested that the infants were more surprised to see the car emerge when the obstacle lay within the direct path of the car. This result is consistent with the principle of temporal smoothness, which suggests that infants expected the car to maintain a straight-line trajectory, and the obstacle to remain stationary. We compared the smoothness model and the baseline model on a schematic version of this task. To model this experiment, we again assume that the infant’s perceptual system has recovered a veridical velocity ﬁeld, but now we must allow for occlusion. An ideal observer approach that treats a two dimensional scene as a projection of a three dimensional world can represent the occluder as an object in its own right. Here, however, we continue to work with a two dimensional world, and treat the occluded parts of the scene as missing data. An ideal observer approach should integrate over all possible values of the missing data, but for computational simplicity we approximate this approach by considering only one or two high-probability interpretations of each occluded scene. We also need to account for habituation, and for cases where the habituation stimulus includes occlusion. We assume that an ideal observer computes a habituation ﬁeld vH , or the velocity ﬁeld with maximum posterior probability given the habituation stimulus. In Figure 2a, the inferred habituation ﬁeld vH speciﬁes a trajectory where the block moves smoothly from the left to the right of the scene. We now assume that the observer expects subsequent velocity ﬁelds to be similar to vH . Formally, we use a product-of-experts approach to deﬁne a post-habituation distribution on velocity ﬁelds: pH (v) ∝ p(v)p(v|vH ) (8) The ﬁrst expert p(v) uses the prior distribution in Equation 6, and the second expert p(v|vH ) assumes that ﬁeld v is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on vH . Intuitively, after habituation to vH the second expert expects that subsequent velocity ﬁelds will be similar to vH . More information about this model of habituation is provided in the supporting material. Given these assumptions, the black and dark gray bars in Figure 2 indicate relative a priori probabilities for scenes L, U1 and U2. The baseline model considers all three scenes equally probable, but the smoothness model prefers L. After habituation, the baseline model is still unable to account for the behavioral data, since it considers scenes L and U2 to be equally probable. The smoothness model, however, continues to prefer L. We previously mentioned three consequences of the principle of temporal smoothness: stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and moving objects tend to maintain a steady trajectory. The “car and obstacle” task addresses the ﬁrst and third of these proposals, but other tasks provide support for the second. Many authors have studied settings where one moving object comes to a stop, and a second object starts to move [17]. Compared to the case where the ﬁrst object collides with the second, infants appear to be surprised by the “no-contact” case where the two objects never touch. This ﬁnding is consistent with the temporal smoothness principle, which predicts that infants expect the ﬁrst object to continue moving until forced to stop, and expect the second object to remain stationary until forced to start. Other experiments [18] provide support for the principle of temporal smoothness, but there are also studies that appear inconsistent with this principle. In one of these studies [16], infants are initially habituated to a block that moves from one corner of an enclosure to another (H1 in Figure 3a). After habituation, infants see a block that begins from a different corner, and now the occluder is removed to reveal the block in a location consistent with a straight-line trajectory (L) or in a location that matches the ﬁnal resting place during the habituation phase (U). Looking times suggest that infants aged 4-12 months are no more surprised by the inertia-violating outcome (U) than the inertia-consistent outcome (L). The smoothness model, however, can account for this ﬁnding. The outcome in U is contrary to temporal smoothness but consistent with habituation, and the tradeoff between these factors leads the model to assign roughly the same probability to scenes L and U (Figure 3b). Only one of the inertia experiments described by Spelke et al. [16] and Spelke et al. [1] avoids this tradeoff between habituation and smoothness. This experiment considers a case where the habituation stimulus (H2 in Figure 3a) is equally similar to the two test stimuli. The results suggest that 8 month olds are now surprised by the inertia-violating outcome, and the predictions of our model are consistent with this ﬁnding (Figure 3b). 4 and 6 month olds, however, continue to look equally at the two outcomes. Note, however, that the trajectories in Figure 3 include at most one inﬂection point. Experiments that consider trajectories with many inﬂection points can provide a more powerful way of exploring whether 4 month olds have expectations about temporal smoothness. One possible experiment is sketched in Figure 3c. The task is very similar to the task in Figure 3a, except that a barrier is added after habituation. In order for the block to end up in the same location as before, it must now follow a tortuous path around the barrier (U). Based on the principle of temporal smoothness, we predict that 4-month-olds will be more surprised to see the outcome in stimulus U than the outcome in stimulus L. This experimental design is appealing in part because previous work shows that infants are surprised by a case similar to U where the barrier extends all the way from one wall to the other [16], and our proposed experiment is a minor variant of this task. Although there is room for debate about the status of temporal smoothness, we presented two reasons to revisit the conclusion that this principle develops relatively late. First, some version of this principle seems necessary to account for experiments like the car and obstacle experiment in Figure 2. Second, most of the inertia experiments that produced null results use a habituation stimulus which may have prevented infants from revealing their default expectations, and the one experiment that escapes this objection considers a relatively minor violation of temporal smoothness. Additional experiments are needed to explore this principle, but we predict that the inertia principle will turn out to be yet another example of knowledge that is available earlier than researchers once thought. 4 Discussion and Conclusion We argued that characterizations of infant knowledge should include room for probabilistic expectations, and that probabilistic expectations about spatial and temporal smoothness appear to play a role in infant object perception. To support these claims we described an ideal observer model that includes both categorical (C1 through C5) and probabilistic principles (S1 and S2), and demonstrated that the categorical principles alone are insufﬁcient to account for several experimental ﬁndings. Our two probabilistic principles are related to principles (rigidity and inertia) that have previously been described as categorical principles. Although rigidity and inertia appear to play a role in some early inferences, formulating these principles as probabilistic expectations helps to explain how infants deal with non-rigid motion and violations of inertia. Our analysis focused on some of the many existing experiments in the developmental literature, but new experiments will be needed to explore our probabilistic approach in depth. Categorical versions of a given principle (e.g. rigidity) allow room for only two kinds of behavior depending on whether the principle is violated or not. Probabilistic principles can be violated to a greater or lesser extent, and our approach predicts that violations of different magnitude may lead to different behaviors. Future studies of rigidity and inertia can consider violations of these principles that range from mild (Figure 3a) to severe (Figure 3c), and can explore whether infants respond to these violations differently. Future work should also consider whether the categorical principles we described (C1 through C5) are better characterized as probabilistic expectations. In particular, future studies can explore whether young infants consider large violations of cohesion (C5) or spatial continuity (C2) more surprising than smaller violations of these principles. Although we did not focus on learning, our approach allows us to begin thinking formally about how principles of object perception might be acquired. First, we can explore how parameters like the smoothness parameters in our model (λspace and λtime ) might be tuned by experience. Second, we can use statistical model selection to explore transitions between different sets of principles. For instance, if a learner begins with the baseline model we considered (principles C1–C6), we can explore which subsequent observations provide the strongest statistical evidence for smoothness principles S1 and S2, and how much of this evidence is required before an ideal learner would prefer our smoothness model over the baseline model. It is not yet clear which principles of object perception could be learned, but the ideal observer approach can help to resolve this question. References [1] E. S. Spelke, K. Breinlinger, J.

<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparsity pattern detection for unknown ksparse n-dimensional signals observed through m noisy, random linear measurements. Sparsity pattern recovery arises in a number of settings including statistical model selection, pattern detection, and image acquisition. The main results in this paper are necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for asymptotically-reliable sparsity pattern recovery in terms of the dimensions m, n and k as well as the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and the minimum-to-average ratio (MAR) of the nonzero entries of the signal. We show that m > 2k log(n − k)/(SNR · MAR) is necessary for any algorithm to succeed, regardless of complexity; this matches a previous sufﬁcient condition for maximum likelihood estimation within a constant factor under certain scalings of k, SNR and MAR with n. We also show a sufﬁcient condition for a computationally-trivial thresholding algorithm that is larger than the previous expression by only a factor of 4(1 + SNR) and larger than the requirement for lasso by only a factor of 4/MAR. This provides insight on the precise value and limitations of convex programming-based algorithms.</p><p>3 0.86713433 <a title="132-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Online_Prediction_on_Large_Diameter_Graphs.html">171 nips-2008-Online Prediction on Large Diameter Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Guy Lever, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We continue our study of online prediction of the labelling of a graph. We show a fundamental limitation of Laplacian-based algorithms: if the graph has a large diameter then the number of mistakes made by such algorithms may be proportional to the square root of the number of vertices, even when tackling simple problems. We overcome this drawback by means of an efﬁcient algorithm which achieves a logarithmic mistake bound. It is based on the notion of a spine, a path graph which provides a linear embedding of the original graph. In practice, graphs may exhibit cluster structure; thus in the last part, we present a modiﬁed algorithm which achieves the “best of both worlds”: it performs well locally in the presence of cluster structure, and globally on large diameter graphs. 1</p><p>4 0.83158141 <a title="132-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.77688003 <a title="132-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Measures_of_Clustering_Quality%3A_A_Working_Set_of_Axioms_for_Clustering.html">132 nips-2008-Measures of Clustering Quality: A Working Set of Axioms for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>6 0.63315105 <a title="132-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Prediction_on_a_Tree.html">84 nips-2008-Fast Prediction on a Tree</a></p>

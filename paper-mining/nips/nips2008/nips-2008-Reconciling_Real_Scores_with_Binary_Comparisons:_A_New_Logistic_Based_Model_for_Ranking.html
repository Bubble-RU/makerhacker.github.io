<p>Author: Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu, Xu-dong Zhang, De-sheng Wang, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies global ranking problem by learning to rank methods. Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for ‘local ranking’, in the sense that the ranking model is deﬁned on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to deﬁne the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is deﬁned as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two speciﬁc information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines.</p><p>3 0.17713307 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Empirical_performance_maximization_for_linear_rank_statistics.html">72 nips-2008-Empirical performance maximization for linear rank statistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: The ROC curve is known to be the golden standard for measuring performance of a test/scoring statistic regarding its capacity of discrimination between two populations in a wide variety of applications, ranging from anomaly detection in signal processing to information retrieval, through medical diagnosis. Most practical performance measures used in scoring applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be seen as summaries of the ROC curve. This paper highlights the fact that many of these empirical criteria can be expressed as (conditional) linear rank statistics. We investigate the properties of empirical maximizers of such performance criteria and provide preliminary results for the concentration properties of a novel class of random variables that we will call a linear rank process. 1</p><p>4 0.15069219 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Structured_ranking_learning_using_cumulative_distribution_networks.html">224 nips-2008-Structured ranking learning using cumulative distribution networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Jim C. Huang, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Ranking is at the heart of many information retrieval applications. Unlike standard regression or classiﬁcation in which we predict outputs independently, in ranking we are interested in predicting structured outputs so that misranking one object can signiﬁcantly affect whether we correctly rank the other objects. In practice, the problem of ranking involves a large number of objects to be ranked and either approximate structured prediction methods are required, or assumptions of independence between object scores must be made in order to make the problem tractable. We present a probabilistic method for learning to rank using the graphical modelling framework of cumulative distribution networks (CDNs), where we can take into account the structure inherent to the problem of ranking by modelling the joint cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) over multiple pairwise preferences. We apply our framework to the problem of document retrieval in the case of the OHSUMED benchmark dataset. We will show that the RankNet, ListNet and ListMLE probabilistic models can be viewed as particular instances of CDNs and that our proposed framework allows for the exploration of a broad class of ﬂexible structured loss functionals for learning to rank. 1</p><p>5 0.11361521 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Inferring_rankings_under_constrained_sensing.html">106 nips-2008-Inferring rankings under constrained sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by applications like elections, web-page ranking, revenue maximization etc., we consider the question of inferring popular rankings using constrained data. More speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of inferring a probability distribution over the group of permutations using its ﬁrst order marginals. We ﬁrst prove that it is not possible to recover more than O(n) permutations over n elements with the given information. We then provide a simple and novel algorithm that can recover up to O(n) permutations under a natural stochastic model; in this sense, the algorithm is optimal. In certain applications, the interest is in recovering only the most popular (or mode) ranking. As a second result, we provide an algorithm based on the Fourier Transform over the symmetric group to recover the mode under a natural majority condition; the algorithm turns out to be a maximum weight matching on an appropriately deﬁned weighted bipartite graph. The questions considered are also thematically related to Fourier Transforms over the symmetric group and the currently popular topic of compressed sensing. 1</p><p>6 0.096642837 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Predictive_Indexing_for_Fast_Search.html">184 nips-2008-Predictive Indexing for Fast Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated.

A statistical model for ranking predicts how humans rank subsets V of some universe U . In this work we deﬁne a statistical model for ranking that satisﬁes certain desirable properties. The model automatically gives rise to a logistic regression based approach to learning how to rank, for which the score and comparison based approaches are dual views. This offers a new generative approach to ranking which can be used for IR. There are two main contexts for this work. The ﬁrst is the theory of econometrics and study of statistical models explaining human choice of alternatives. In this context, we will compare our model with other well known models. The second context is the problem of ranking in machine learning, usually arising in the context of information retrieval. Here, much work has been done in the discriminative setting, where different heuristics are used to deﬁne ranking risk functions. Our model is built rigorously and axiomatically based on very simple desirable properties deﬁned locally for comparisons, and automatically implies the existence of a global score function serving as a natural model parameter which can be efﬁciently ﬁtted to pairwise comparison judgment data by solving a convex optimization problem. 1</p><p>3 0.64131802 <a title="190-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Influence_of_graph_construction_on_graph-based_clustering_measures.html">107 nips-2008-Influence of graph construction on graph-based clustering measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Markus Maier, Ulrike V. Luxburg, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Graph clustering methods such as spectral clustering are deﬁned for general weighted graphs. In machine learning, however, data often is not given in form of a graph, but in terms of similarity (or distance) values between points. In this case, ﬁrst a neighborhood graph is constructed using the similarities between the points and then a graph clustering algorithm is applied to this graph. In this paper we investigate the inﬂuence of the construction of the similarity graph on the clustering results. We ﬁrst study the convergence of graph clustering criteria such as the normalized cut (Ncut) as the sample size tends to inﬁnity. We ﬁnd that the limit expressions are different for different types of graph, for example the r-neighborhood graph or the k-nearest neighbor graph. In plain words: Ncut on a kNN graph does something systematically different than Ncut on an r-neighborhood graph! This ﬁnding shows that graph clustering criteria cannot be studied independently of the kind of graph they are applied to. We also provide examples which show that these differences can be observed for toy and real data already for rather small sample sizes. 1</p><p>4 0.61608303 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Unifying_the_Sensory_and_Motor_Components_of_Sensorimotor_Adaptation.html">244 nips-2008-Unifying the Sensory and Motor Components of Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Haith, Carl P. Jackson, R. C. Miall, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation of visually guided reaching movements in novel visuomotor environments (e.g. wearing prism goggles) comprises not only motor adaptation but also substantial sensory adaptation, corresponding to shifts in the perceived spatial location of visual and proprioceptive cues. Previous computational models of the sensory component of visuomotor adaptation have assumed that it is driven purely by the discrepancy introduced between visual and proprioceptive estimates of hand position and is independent of any motor component of adaptation. We instead propose a uniﬁed model in which sensory and motor adaptation are jointly driven by optimal Bayesian estimation of the sensory and motor contributions to perceived errors. Our model is able to account for patterns of performance errors during visuomotor adaptation as well as the subsequent perceptual aftereﬀects. This uniﬁed model also makes the surprising prediction that force ﬁeld adaptation will elicit similar perceptual shifts, even though there is never any discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive observations. We conﬁrm this prediction with an experiment. 1</p><p>5 0.5221113 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Global_Ranking_Using_Continuous_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">93 nips-2008-Global Ranking Using Continuous Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu, Xu-dong Zhang, De-sheng Wang, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies global ranking problem by learning to rank methods. Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for ‘local ranking’, in the sense that the ranking model is deﬁned on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to deﬁne the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is deﬁned as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two speciﬁc information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines.</p><p>6 0.51625514 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>

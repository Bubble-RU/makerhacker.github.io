While there are asymptotically correct, informative algorithms for discovering causal relationships from a single dataset, even with missing values and hidden variables, there have been no such reliable procedures for distributed data with overlapping variables.

<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Psychophysical experiments show that humans are better at perceiving rotation and expansion than translation. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with standard models of motion integration which predict best performance for translation [6]. To explain this discrepancy, our theory formulates motion perception at two levels of inference: we ﬁrst perform model selection between the competing models (e.g. translation, rotation, and expansion) and then estimate the velocity using the selected model. We deﬁne novel prior models for smooth rotation and expansion using techniques similar to those in the slow-and-smooth model [17] (e.g. Green functions of differential operators). The theory gives good agreement with the trends observed in human experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.11749155 <a title="152-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Evaluating_probabilities_under_high-dimensional_latent_variable_models.html">77 nips-2008-Evaluating probabilities under high-dimensional latent variable models</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple new Monte Carlo algorithm for evaluating probabilities of observations in complex latent variable models, such as Deep Belief Networks. While the method is based on Markov chains, estimates based on short runs are formally unbiased. In expectation, the log probability of a test set will be underestimated, and this could form the basis of a probabilistic bound. The method is much cheaper than gold-standard annealing-based methods and only slightly more expensive than the cheapest Monte Carlo methods. We give examples of the new method substantially improving simple variational bounds at modest extra cost. 1</p><p>5 0.10621329 <a title="152-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Network_Score_Approximation_using_a_Metagraph_Kernel.html">34 nips-2008-Bayesian Network Score Approximation using a Metagraph Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Yackley, Eduardo Corona, Terran Lane</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting problems, including Bayesian network structure-search, can be cast in terms of ﬁnding the optimum value of a function over the space of graphs. However, this function is often expensive to compute exactly. We here present a method derived from the study of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which takes advantage of the regular structure of the space of all graphs on a ﬁxed number of nodes to obtain approximations to the desired function quickly and with reasonable accuracy. We then test this method on both a small testing set and a real-world Bayesian network; the results suggest that not only is this method reasonably accurate, but that the BDe score itself varies quadratically over the space of all graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.10251836 <a title="152-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-On_Computational_Power_and_the_Order-Chaos_Phase_Transition_in_Reservoir_Computing.html">160 nips-2008-On Computational Power and the Order-Chaos Phase Transition in Reservoir Computing</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Stephen Gould</p><p>Abstract: With the increased availability of data for complex domains, it is desirable to learn Bayesian network structures that are sufﬁciently expressive for generalization while also allowing for tractable inference. While the method of thin junction trees can, in principle, be used for this purpose, its fully greedy nature makes it prone to overﬁtting, particularly when data is scarce. In this work we present a novel method for learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth that employs global structure modiﬁcations and that is polynomial in the size of the graph and the treewidth bound. At the heart of our method is a triangulated graph that we dynamically update in a way that facilitates the addition of chain structures that increase the bound on the model’s treewidth by at most one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our “treewidth-friendly” method on several real-life datasets. Importantly, we also show that by using global operators, we are able to achieve better generalization even when learning Bayesian networks of unbounded treewidth. 1</p><p>3 0.58553535 <a title="152-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Integrating_Locally_Learned_Causal_Structures_with_Overlapping_Variables.html">108 nips-2008-Integrating Locally Learned Causal Structures with Overlapping Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Schrauwen, Lars Buesing, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: Randomly connected recurrent neural circuits have proven to be very powerful models for online computations when a trained memoryless readout function is appended. Such Reservoir Computing (RC) systems are commonly used in two ﬂavors: with analog or binary (spiking) neurons in the recurrent circuits. Previous work showed a fundamental difference between these two incarnations of the RC idea. The performance of a RC system built from binary neurons seems to depend strongly on the network connectivity structure. In networks of analog neurons such dependency has not been observed. In this article we investigate this apparent dichotomy in terms of the in-degree of the circuit nodes. Our analyses based amongst others on the Lyapunov exponent reveal that the phase transition between ordered and chaotic network behavior of binary circuits qualitatively differs from the one in analog circuits. This explains the observed decreased computational performance of binary circuits of high node in-degree. Furthermore, a novel mean-ﬁeld predictor for computational performance is introduced and shown to accurately predict the numerically obtained results. 1</p><p>5 0.54126567 <a title="152-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Exact_Inference_in_Planar_Ising_Models.html">69 nips-2008-Efficient Exact Inference in Planar Ising Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicol N. Schraudolph, Dmitry Kamenetsky</p><p>Abstract: We give polynomial-time algorithms for the exact computation of lowest-energy states, worst margin violators, partition functions, and marginals in certain binary undirected graphical models. Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings in an expanded dual graph. Maximum-margin parameter estimation for a boundary detection task shows our approach to be efﬁcient and effective.

<p>Author: Jing Xu, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many human interactions involve pieces of information being passed from one person to another, raising the question of how this process of information transmission is affected by the capacities of the agents involved. In the 1930s, Sir Frederic Bartlett explored the inﬂuence of memory biases in “serial reproduction” of information, in which one person’s reconstruction of a stimulus from memory becomes the stimulus seen by the next person. These experiments were done using relatively uncontrolled stimuli such as pictures and stories, but suggested that serial reproduction would transform information in a way that reﬂected the biases inherent in memory. We formally analyze serial reproduction using a Bayesian model of reconstruction from memory, giving a general result characterizing the effect of memory biases on information transmission. We then test the predictions of this account in two experiments using simple one-dimensional stimuli. Our results provide theoretical and empirical justiﬁcation for the idea that serial reproduction reﬂects memory biases. 1</p><p>3 0.54435033 <a title="152-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>4 0.53870726 <a title="152-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>

This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>5 0.53850436 <a title="152-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Template_Matching_with_Shift-Invariant_Semi-NMF.html">16 nips-2008-Adaptive Template Matching with Shift-Invariant Semi-NMF</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan L. Roux, Alain D. Cheveigné, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: How does one extract unknown but stereotypical events that are linearly superimposed within a signal with variable latencies and variable amplitudes? One could think of using template matching or matching pursuit to ﬁnd the arbitrarily shifted linear components. However, traditional matching approaches require that the templates be known a priori. To overcome this restriction we use instead semi Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (semiNMF) that we extend to allow for time shifts when matching the templates to the signal. The algorithm estimates templates directly from the data along with their non-negative amplitudes. The resulting method can be thought of as an adaptive template matching procedure. We demonstrate the procedure on the task of extracting spikes from single channel extracellular recordings. On these data the algorithm essentially performs spike detection and unsupervised spike clustering. Results on simulated data and extracellular recordings indicate that the method performs well for signalto-noise ratios of 6dB or higher and that spike templates are recovered accurately provided they are suﬃciently diﬀerent. 1</p><p>6 0.53734958 <a title="152-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Mixed_Membership_Stochastic_Blockmodels.html">134 nips-2008-Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels</a></p>

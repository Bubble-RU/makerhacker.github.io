<p>Author: Peng Xu, Timothy K. Horiuchi, Pamela A. Abshire</p><p>Abstract: We report a compact realization of short-term depression (STD) in a VLSI stochastic synapse. The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single release model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redundancy in the input spike train, and the mean transmission probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural systems. 1</p><p>3 0.10251836 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Non-stationary_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">152 nips-2008-Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: A principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data is provided through structure learning of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). An important assumption of DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process—an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical models called non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data. 1</p><p>4 0.098268472 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.092358388 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>
<p>Author: Klaus Wimmer, Marcel Stimberg, Robert Martin, Lars Schwabe, Jorge Mariño, James Schummers, David C. Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>6 0.091964036 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Self-organization_using_synaptic_plasticity.html">204 nips-2008-Self-organization using synaptic plasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Graves, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Ofﬂine handwriting recognition—the automatic transcription of images of handwritten text—is a challenging task that combines computer vision with sequence learning. In most systems the two elements are handled separately, with sophisticated preprocessing techniques used to extract the image features and sequential models such as HMMs used to provide the transcriptions. By combining two recent innovations in neural networks—multidimensional recurrent neural networks and connectionist temporal classiﬁcation—this paper introduces a globally trained ofﬂine handwriting recogniser that takes raw pixel data as input. Unlike competing systems, it does not require any alphabet speciﬁc preprocessing, and can therefore be used unchanged for any language. Evidence of its generality and power is provided by data from a recent international Arabic recognition competition, where it outperformed all entries (91.4% accuracy compared to 87.2% for the competition winner) despite the fact that neither author understands a word of Arabic. 1</p><p>3 0.62982041 <a title="160-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Self-organization_using_synaptic_plasticity.html">204 nips-2008-Self-organization using synaptic plasticity</a></p>
<p>Author: Vicençc Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>4 0.62089378 <a title="160-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Wong, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are emerging as promising models for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of neutrally stable states. In this study, we systematically explore how neutral stability of a CANN facilitates its tracking performance, a capacity believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus. 1</p><p>6 0.59302318 <a title="160-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-A_Massively_Parallel_Digital_Learning_Processor.html">3 nips-2008-A Massively Parallel Digital Learning Processor</a></p>

Our characterization uses betweenness, a measure of centrality on graphs. It captures and generalizes (at least intuitively) the bottleneck concept, which has inspired many of the existing skill-discovery algorithms. Our characterization may be used directly to form a set of skills suitable for a given task. More importantly, it serves as a useful guide for developing incremental skill-discovery algorithms that do not rely on knowing or representing the interaction graph in its entirety. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66599727 <a title="160-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-On_Computational_Power_and_the_Order-Chaos_Phase_Transition_in_Reservoir_Computing.html">160 nips-2008-On Computational Power and the Order-Chaos Phase Transition in Reservoir Computing</a></p>

Our analyses based amongst others on the Lyapunov exponent reveal that the phase transition between ordered and chaotic network behavior of binary circuits qualitatively differs from the one in analog circuits. This explains the observed decreased computational performance of binary circuits of high node in-degree. Furthermore, a novel mean-ﬁeld predictor for computational performance is introduced and shown to accurately predict the numerically obtained results. 1</p><p>3 0.56305873 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-From_Online_to_Batch_Learning_with_Cutoff-Averaging.html">88 nips-2008-From Online to Batch Learning with Cutoff-Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel</p><p>Abstract: We present cutoff averaging, a technique for converting any conservative online learning algorithm into a batch learning algorithm. Most online-to-batch conversion techniques work well with certain types of online learning algorithms and not with others, whereas cutoff averaging explicitly tries to adapt to the characteristics of the online algorithm being converted. An attractive property of our technique is that it preserves the efﬁciency of the original online algorithm, making it appropriate for large-scale learning problems. We provide a statistical analysis of our technique and back our theoretical claims with experimental results. 1</p><p>4 0.52252907 <a title="160-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Tracking_Changing_Stimuli_in_Continuous_Attractor_Neural_Networks.html">240 nips-2008-Tracking Changing Stimuli in Continuous Attractor Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are emerging as promising models for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of neutrally stable states. In this study, we systematically explore how neutral stability of a CANN facilitates its tracking performance, a capacity believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus. 1</p><p>5 0.5192858 <a title="160-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Mixed_Membership_Stochastic_Blockmodels.html">134 nips-2008-Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels</a></p>
<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, David M. Blei, Stephen E. Fienberg, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: In many settings, such as protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks, the data consist of pairwise measurements, e.g., presence or absence of links between pairs of objects. Analyzing such data with probabilistic models requires non-standard assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. In this paper, we introduce a class of latent variable models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Models in this class combine a global model of dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with a local model to instantiate node-speciﬁc variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodel with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks. 1</p><p>6 0.51896119 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Spectral_Hashing.html">219 nips-2008-Spectral Hashing</a></p>

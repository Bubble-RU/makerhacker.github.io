<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>3 0.14152417 <a title="216-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Model_Selection_in_Gaussian_Graphical_Models%3A_High-Dimensional_Consistency_of_%5Cboldmath%24%5Cell_1%24-regularized_MLE.html">135 nips-2008-Model Selection in Gaussian Graphical Models: High-Dimensional Consistency of \boldmath$\ell 1$-regularized MLE</a></p>
<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the graph structure associated with a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) from i.i.d. samples. We study the performance of study the performance of the ℓ1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimator in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges in the graph s and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the number of samples n. Our main result provides sufﬁcient conditions on (n, p, d) for the ℓ1 -regularized MLE estimator to recover all the edges of the graph with high probability. Under some conditions on the model covariance, we show that model selection can be achieved for sample sizes n = Ω(d2 log(p)), with the error decaying as O(exp(−c log(p))) for some constant c. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations and show good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.</p><p>4 0.1316451 <a title="216-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>5 0.11796404 <a title="216-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>6 0.11475194 <a title="216-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Improving_on_Expectation_Propagation.html">105 nips-2008-Improving on Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has become established as one of the key tools for dimensionality reduction when dealing with real valued data. Approaches such as exponential family PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation have successfully extended PCA to non-Gaussian data types, but these techniques fail to take advantage of Bayesian inference and can suffer from problems of overﬁtting and poor generalisation. This paper presents a fully probabilistic approach to PCA, which is generalised to the exponential family, based on Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. We describe the model which is based on a factorisation of the observed data matrix, and show performance of the model on both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>3 0.55934227 <a title="216-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Posterior_Consistency_of_the_Silverman_g-prior_in_Bayesian_Model_Choice.html">182 nips-2008-Posterior Consistency of the Silverman g-prior in Bayesian Model Choice</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Michael I. Jordan, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Kernel supervised learning methods can be uniﬁed by utilizing the tools from regularization theory. The duality between regularization and prior leads to interpreting regularization methods in terms of maximum a posteriori estimation and has motivated Bayesian interpretations of kernel methods. In this paper we pursue a Bayesian interpretation of sparsity in the kernel setting by making use of a mixture of a point-mass distribution and prior that we refer to as “Silverman’s g-prior.” We provide a theoretical analysis of the posterior consistency of a Bayesian model choice procedure based on this prior. We also establish the asymptotic relationship between this procedure and the Bayesian information criterion. 1</p><p>4 0.53114754 <a title="216-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Covariance_Estimation_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Vectors_Using_the_Sparse_Matrix_Transform.html">54 nips-2008-Covariance Estimation for High Dimensional Data Vectors Using the Sparse Matrix Transform</a></p>
<p>Author: Guangzhi Cao, Charles Bouman</p><p>Abstract: Covariance estimation for high dimensional vectors is a classically difﬁcult problem in statistical analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel sparsity constraint. More speciﬁcally, the covariance is constrained to have an eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efﬁciently estimated using greedy minimization of the log likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efﬁciently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is positive deﬁnite and well-conditioned even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on standard hyperspectral data sets show that the SMT covariance estimate is consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. 1</p><p>5 0.52596796 <a title="216-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Supervised_Exponential_Family_Principal_Component_Analysis_via_Convex_Optimization.html">227 nips-2008-Supervised Exponential Family Principal Component Analysis via Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, supervised dimensionality reduction has been gaining attention, owing to the realization that data labels are often available and indicate important underlying structure in the data. In this paper, we present a novel convex supervised dimensionality reduction approach based on exponential family PCA, which is able to avoid the local optima of typical EM learning. Moreover, by introducing a sample-based approximation to exponential family models, it overcomes the limitation of the prevailing Gaussian assumptions of standard PCA, and produces a kernelized formulation for nonlinear supervised dimensionality reduction. A training algorithm is then devised based on a subgradient bundle method, whose scalability can be gained using a coordinate descent procedure. The advantage of our global optimization approach is demonstrated by empirical results over both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>6 0.51324797 <a title="216-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Stochastic_Relational_Models_for_Large-scale_Dyadic_Data_using_MCMC.html">221 nips-2008-Stochastic Relational Models for Large-scale Dyadic Data using MCMC</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex Graves, Jürgen Schmidhuber</p><p>Abstract: Ofﬂine handwriting recognition—the automatic transcription of images of handwritten text—is a challenging task that combines computer vision with sequence learning. In most systems the two elements are handled separately, with sophisticated preprocessing techniques used to extract the image features and sequential models such as HMMs used to provide the transcriptions. By combining two recent innovations in neural networks—multidimensional recurrent neural networks and connectionist temporal classiﬁcation—this paper introduces a globally trained ofﬂine handwriting recogniser that takes raw pixel data as input. Unlike competing systems, it does not require any alphabet speciﬁc preprocessing, and can therefore be used unchanged for any language. Evidence of its generality and power is provided by data from a recent international Arabic recognition competition, where it outperformed all entries (91.4% accuracy compared to 87.2% for the competition winner) despite the fact that neither author understands a word of Arabic. 1</p><p>3 0.69980788 <a title="216-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Natural_Image_Denoising_with_Convolutional_Networks.html">148 nips-2008-Natural Image Denoising with Convolutional Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Viren Jain, Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to low-level vision that combines two main ideas: the use of convolutional networks as an image processing architecture and an unsupervised learning procedure that synthesizes training samples from speciﬁc noise models. We demonstrate this approach on the challenging problem of natural image denoising. Using a test set with a hundred natural images, we ﬁnd that convolutional networks provide comparable and in some cases superior performance to state of the art wavelet and Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) methods. Moreover, we ﬁnd that a convolutional network offers similar performance in the blind denoising setting as compared to other techniques in the non-blind setting. We also show how convolutional networks are mathematically related to MRF approaches by presenting a mean ﬁeld theory for an MRF specially designed for image denoising. Although these approaches are related, convolutional networks avoid computational difﬁculties in MRF approaches that arise from probabilistic learning and inference. This makes it possible to learn image processing architectures that have a high degree of representational power (we train models with over 15,000 parameters), but whose computational expense is signiﬁcantly less than that associated with inference in MRF approaches with even hundreds of parameters. 1 Background Low-level image processing tasks include edge detection, interpolation, and deconvolution. These tasks are useful both in themselves, and as a front-end for high-level visual tasks like object recognition. This paper focuses on the task of denoising, deﬁned as the recovery of an underlying image from an observation that has been subjected to Gaussian noise. One approach to image denoising is to transform an image from pixel intensities into another representation where statistical regularities are more easily captured. For example, the Gaussian scale mixture (GSM) model introduced by Portilla and colleagues is based on a multiscale wavelet decomposition that provides an effective description of local image statistics [1, 2]. Another approach is to try and capture statistical regularities of pixel intensities directly using Markov random ﬁelds (MRFs) to deﬁne a prior over the image space. Initial work used handdesigned settings of the parameters, but recently there has been increasing success in learning the parameters of such models from databases of natural images [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Prior models can be used for tasks such as image denoising by augmenting the prior with a noise model. Alternatively, an MRF can be used to model the probability distribution of the clean image conditioned on the noisy image. This conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) approach is said to be discriminative, in contrast to the generative MRF approach. Several researchers have shown that the CRF approach can outperform generative learning on various image restoration and labeling tasks [9, 10]. CRFs have recently been applied to the problem of image denoising as well [5]. 1 The present work is most closely related to the CRF approach. Indeed, certain special cases of convolutional networks can be seen as performing maximum likelihood inference on a CRF [11]. The advantage of the convolutional network approach is that it avoids a general difﬁculty with applying MRF-based methods to image analysis: the computational expense associated with both parameter estimation and inference in probabilistic models. For example, naive methods of learning MRFbased models involve calculation of the partition function, a normalization factor that is generally intractable for realistic models and image dimensions. As a result, a great deal of research has been devoted to approximate MRF learning and inference techniques that meliorate computational difﬁculties, generally at the cost of either representational power or theoretical guarantees [12, 13]. Convolutional networks largely avoid these difﬁculties by posing the computational task within the statistical framework of regression rather than density estimation. Regression is a more tractable computation and therefore permits models with greater representational power than methods based on density estimation. This claim will be argued for with empirical results on the denoising problem, as well as mathematical connections between MRF and convolutional network approaches. 2 Convolutional Networks Convolutional networks have been extensively applied to visual object recognition using architectures that accept an image as input and, through alternating layers of convolution and subsampling, produce one or more output values that are thresholded to yield binary predictions regarding object identity [14, 15]. In contrast, we study networks that accept an image as input and produce an entire image as output. Previous work has used such architectures to produce images with binary targets in image restoration problems for specialized microscopy data [11, 16]. Here we show that similar architectures can also be used to produce images with the analog ﬂuctuations found in the intensity distributions of natural images. Network Dynamics and Architecture A convolutional network is an alternating sequence of linear ﬁltering and nonlinear transformation operations. The input and output layers include one or more images, while intermediate layers contain “hidden</p><p>4 0.58207649 <a title="216-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-High-dimensional_support_union_recovery_in_multivariate_regression.html">99 nips-2008-High-dimensional support union recovery in multivariate regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillaume R. Obozinski, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression, where a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a ﬁxed set of p covariates. The problem of support union recovery is to recover the subset of covariates that are active in at least one of the regression problems. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling (where the problem parameters as well as sample size n tend to inﬁnity simultaneously), our main result is to show that exact recovery is possible once the order parameter given by θ 1 / 2 (n, p, s) : = n/[2ψ(B ∗ ) log(p − s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the size of the union of supports, and ψ(B ∗ ) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefﬁcient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to a naive 1 -approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal relative to the design. We complement our theoretical results with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of the result, even for relatively small problems. 1</p><p>5 0.58031929 <a title="216-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Signal_Recovery_Using_Markov_Random_Fields.html">215 nips-2008-Sparse Signal Recovery Using Markov Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Volkan Cevher, Marco F. Duarte, Chinmay Hegde, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Compressive Sensing (CS) combines sampling and compression into a single subNyquist linear measurement process for sparse and compressible signals. In this paper, we extend the theory of CS to include signals that are concisely represented in terms of a graphical model. In particular, we use Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to represent sparse signals whose nonzero coefﬁcients are clustered. Our new model-based recovery algorithm, dubbed Lattice Matching Pursuit (LaMP), stably recovers MRF-modeled signals using many fewer measurements and computations than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>6 0.57825255 <a title="216-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Phase_transitions_for_high-dimensional_joint_support_recovery.html">179 nips-2008-Phase transitions for high-dimensional joint support recovery</a></p>

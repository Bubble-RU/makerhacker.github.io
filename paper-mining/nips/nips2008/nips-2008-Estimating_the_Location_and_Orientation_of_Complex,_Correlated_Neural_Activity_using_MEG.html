Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2008-74-reference" href="../nips2008_reference/nips-2008-Estimating_the_Location_and_Orientation_of_Complex%2C_Correlated_Neural_Activity_using_MEG_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>3 0.14219315 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Understanding_Brain_Connectivity_Patterns_during_Motor_Imagery_for_Brain-Computer_Interfacing.html">243 nips-2008-Understanding Brain Connectivity Patterns during Motor Imagery for Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></p>
<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>4 0.12272394 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Domain_Adaptation_with_Multiple_Sources.html">65 nips-2008-Domain Adaptation with Multiple Sources</a></p>
<p>Author: Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of domain adaptation with multiple sources. For each source domain, the distribution over the input points as well as a hypothesis with error at most ǫ are given. The problem consists of combining these hypotheses to derive a hypothesis with small error with respect to the target domain. We present several theoretical results relating to this problem. In particular, we prove that standard convex combinations of the source hypotheses may in fact perform very poorly and that, instead, combinations weighted by the source distributions beneﬁt from favorable theoretical guarantees. Our main result shows that, remarkably, for any ﬁxed target function, there exists a distribution weighted combining rule that has a loss of at most ǫ with respect to any target mixture of the source distributions. We further generalize the setting from a single target function to multiple consistent target functions and show the existence of a combining rule with error at most 3ǫ. Finally, we report empirical results for a multiple source adaptation problem with a real-world dataset.</p><p>5 0.12063742 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Domain_Adaptation_Algorithms_for_Genomic_Sequence_Analysis.html">19 nips-2008-An Empirical Analysis of Domain Adaptation Algorithms for Genomic Sequence Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>2 0.83541584 <a title="74-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Playing_Pinball_with_non-invasive_BCI.html">180 nips-2008-Playing Pinball with non-invasive BCI</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Krauledat, Konrad Grzeska, Max Sagebaum, Benjamin Blankertz, Carmen Vidaurre, Klaus-Robert Müller, Michael Schröder</p><p>Abstract: Compared to invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), non-invasive BCI systems based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have not been applied successfully for precisely timed control tasks. In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. 1</p><p>3 0.7499007 <a title="74-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Inference_in_Phylogenetic_InDel_Trees.html">70 nips-2008-Efficient Inference in Phylogenetic InDel Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandre Bouchard-côté, Dan Klein, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Accurate and efﬁcient inference in evolutionary trees is a central problem in computational biology. While classical treatments have made unrealistic site independence assumptions, ignoring insertions and deletions, realistic approaches require tracking insertions and deletions along the phylogenetic tree—a challenging and unsolved computational problem. We propose a new ancestry resampling procedure for inference in evolutionary trees. We evaluate our method in two problem domains—multiple sequence alignment and reconstruction of ancestral sequences—and show substantial improvement over the current state of the art. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.71350974 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_the_Location_and_Orientation_of_Complex%2C_Correlated_Neural_Activity_using_MEG.html">74 nips-2008-Estimating the Location and Orientation of Complex, Correlated Neural Activity using MEG</a></p>
<p>Author: Julia Owen, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>5 0.54995883 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>6 0.5411886 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>

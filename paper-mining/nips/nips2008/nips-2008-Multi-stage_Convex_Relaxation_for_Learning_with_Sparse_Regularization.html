<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust least-squares regression with feature-wise disturbance. We show that this formulation leads to tractable convex optimization problems, and we exhibit a particular uncertainty set for which the robust problem is equivalent to 1 regularized regression (Lasso). This provides an interpretation of Lasso from a robust optimization perspective. We generalize this robust formulation to consider more general uncertainty sets, which all lead to tractable convex optimization problems. Therefore, we provide a new methodology for designing regression algorithms, which generalize known formulations. The advantage is that robustness to disturbance is a physical property that can be exploited: in addition to obtaining new formulations, we use it directly to show sparsity properties of Lasso, as well as to prove a general consistency result for robust regression problems, including Lasso, from a uniﬁed robustness perspective. 1</p><p>3 0.25573584 <a title="145-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-An_Homotopy_Algorithm_for_the_Lasso_with_Online_Observations.html">21 nips-2008-An Homotopy Algorithm for the Lasso with Online Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre Garrigues, Laurent E. Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: It has been shown that the problem of 1 -penalized least-square regression commonly referred to as the Lasso or Basis Pursuit DeNoising leads to solutions that are sparse and therefore achieves model selection. We propose in this paper RecLasso, an algorithm to solve the Lasso with online (sequential) observations. We introduce an optimization problem that allows us to compute an homotopy from the current solution to the solution after observing a new data point. We compare our method to Lars and Coordinate Descent, and present an application to compressive sensing with sequential observations. Our approach can easily be extended to compute an homotopy from the current solution to the solution that corresponds to removing a data point, which leads to an efﬁcient algorithm for leave-one-out cross-validation. We also propose an algorithm to automatically update the regularization parameter after observing a new data point. 1</p><p>4 0.22997841 <a title="145-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss. This method has several essential properties. First, the degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically. We apply it to several datasets and ﬁnd for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable. 1</p><p>5 0.2053123 <a title="145-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Phase_transitions_for_high-dimensional_joint_support_recovery.html">179 nips-2008-Phase transitions for high-dimensional joint support recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Given a collection of r ≥ 2 linear regression problems in p dimensions, suppose that the regression coefﬁcients share partially common supports. This set-up suggests the use of 1 / ∞ -regularized regression for joint estimation of the p × r matrix of regression coefﬁcients. We analyze the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularized quadratic programming, considering both consistency rates in ∞ -norm, and also how the minimal sample size n required for performing variable selection grows as a function of the model dimension, sparsity, and overlap between the supports. We begin by establishing bounds on the ∞ error as well sufﬁcient conditions for exact variable selection for ﬁxed design matrices, as well as designs drawn randomly from general Gaussian matrices. These results show that the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularization is qualitatively similar to that of ordinary 1 -regularization. Our second set of results applies to design matrices drawn from standard Gaussian ensembles, for which we provide a sharp set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions: the 1 / ∞ -regularized method undergoes a phase transition characterized by the rescaled sample size θ1,∞ (n, p, s, α) = n/{(4 − 3α)s log(p − (2 − α) s)}. More precisely, for any δ > 0, the probability of successfully recovering both supports converges to 1 for scalings such that θ1,∞ ≥ 1 + δ, and converges to 0 for scalings for which θ1,∞ ≤ 1 − δ. An implication of this threshold is that use of 1,∞ -regularization yields improved statistical efﬁciency if the overlap parameter is large enough (α > 2/3), but performs worse than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small overlap (α < 2/3). We illustrate the close agreement between these theoretical predictions, and the actual behavior in simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.18989451 <a title="145-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Model_Selection_in_Gaussian_Graphical_Models%3A_High-Dimensional_Consistency_of_%5Cboldmath%24%5Cell_1%24-regularized_MLE.html">135 nips-2008-Model Selection in Gaussian Graphical Models: High-Dimensional Consistency of \boldmath$\ell 1$-regularized MLE</a></p>

<p>Author: Guillaume R. Obozinski, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression, where a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a ﬁxed set of p covariates. The problem of support union recovery is to recover the subset of covariates that are active in at least one of the regression problems. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling (where the problem parameters as well as sample size n tend to inﬁnity simultaneously), our main result is to show that exact recovery is possible once the order parameter given by θ 1 / 2 (n, p, s) : = n/[2ψ(B ∗ ) log(p − s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the size of the union of supports, and ψ(B ∗ ) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefﬁcient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to a naive 1 -approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal relative to the design. We complement our theoretical results with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of the result, even for relatively small problems. 1</p><p>6 0.69230646 <a title="145-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Phase_transitions_for_high-dimensional_joint_support_recovery.html">179 nips-2008-Phase transitions for high-dimensional joint support recovery</a></p>

Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression, where a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a ﬁxed set of p covariates. The problem of support union recovery is to recover the subset of covariates that are active in at least one of the regression problems. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling (where the problem parameters as well as sample size n tend to inﬁnity simultaneously), our main result is to show that exact recovery is possible once the order parameter given by θ 1 / 2 (n, p, s) : = n/[2ψ(B ∗ ) log(p − s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the size of the union of supports, and ψ(B ∗ ) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefﬁcient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to a naive 1 -approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal relative to the design. We complement our theoretical results with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of the result, even for relatively small problems. 1</p><p>3 0.87183285 <a title="145-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Probabilistic_detection_of_short_events%2C_with_application_to_critical_care_monitoring.html">186 nips-2008-Probabilistic detection of short events, with application to critical care monitoring</a></p>
<p>Author: Norm Aleks, Stuart Russell, Michael G. Madden, Diane Morabito, Kristan Staudenmayer, Mitchell Cohen, Geoffrey T. Manley</p><p>Abstract: We describe an application of probabilistic modeling and inference technology to the problem of analyzing sensor data in the setting of an intensive care unit (ICU). In particular, we consider the arterial-line blood pressure sensor, which is subject to frequent data artifacts that cause false alarms in the ICU and make the raw data almost useless for automated decision making. The problem is complicated by the fact that the sensor data are averaged over ﬁxed intervals whereas the events causing data artifacts may occur at any time and often have durations signiﬁcantly shorter than the data collection interval. We show that careful modeling of the sensor, combined with a general technique for detecting sub-interval events and estimating their duration, enables detection of artifacts and accurate estimation of the underlying blood pressure values. Our model’s performance identifying artifacts is superior to two other classiﬁers’ and about as good as a physician’s. 1</p><p>4 0.86639732 <a title="145-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Signal_Recovery_Using_Markov_Random_Fields.html">215 nips-2008-Sparse Signal Recovery Using Markov Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Volkan Cevher, Marco F. Duarte, Chinmay Hegde, Richard Baraniuk</p><p>Abstract: Compressive Sensing (CS) combines sampling and compression into a single subNyquist linear measurement process for sparse and compressible signals. In this paper, we extend the theory of CS to include signals that are concisely represented in terms of a graphical model. In particular, we use Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to represent sparse signals whose nonzero coefﬁcients are clustered. Our new model-based recovery algorithm, dubbed Lattice Matching Pursuit (LaMP), stably recovers MRF-modeled signals using many fewer measurements and computations than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>5 0.86423111 <a title="145-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Phase_transitions_for_high-dimensional_joint_support_recovery.html">179 nips-2008-Phase transitions for high-dimensional joint support recovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Given a collection of r ≥ 2 linear regression problems in p dimensions, suppose that the regression coefﬁcients share partially common supports. This set-up suggests the use of 1 / ∞ -regularized regression for joint estimation of the p × r matrix of regression coefﬁcients. We analyze the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularized quadratic programming, considering both consistency rates in ∞ -norm, and also how the minimal sample size n required for performing variable selection grows as a function of the model dimension, sparsity, and overlap between the supports. We begin by establishing bounds on the ∞ error as well sufﬁcient conditions for exact variable selection for ﬁxed design matrices, as well as designs drawn randomly from general Gaussian matrices. These results show that the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularization is qualitatively similar to that of ordinary 1 -regularization. Our second set of results applies to design matrices drawn from standard Gaussian ensembles, for which we provide a sharp set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions: the 1 / ∞ -regularized method undergoes a phase transition characterized by the rescaled sample size θ1,∞ (n, p, s, α) = n/{(4 − 3α)s log(p − (2 − α) s)}. More precisely, for any δ > 0, the probability of successfully recovering both supports converges to 1 for scalings such that θ1,∞ ≥ 1 + δ, and converges to 0 for scalings for which θ1,∞ ≤ 1 − δ. An implication of this threshold is that use of 1,∞ -regularization yields improved statistical efﬁciency if the overlap parameter is large enough (α > 2/3), but performs worse than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small overlap (α < 2/3). We illustrate the close agreement between these theoretical predictions, and the actual behavior in simulations. 1</p><p>6 0.85778064 <a title="145-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Covariance_Estimation_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Vectors_Using_the_Sparse_Matrix_Transform.html">54 nips-2008-Covariance Estimation for High Dimensional Data Vectors Using the Sparse Matrix Transform</a></p>

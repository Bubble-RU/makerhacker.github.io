We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction.

<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Polysemy is a problem for methods that exploit image search engines to build object category models. Existing unsupervised approaches do not take word sense into consideration. We propose a new method that uses a dictionary to learn models of visual word sense from a large collection of unlabeled web data. The use of LDA to discover a latent sense space makes the model robust despite the very limited nature of dictionary deﬁnitions. The deﬁnitions are used to learn a distribution in the latent space that best represents a sense. The algorithm then uses the text surrounding image links to retrieve images with high probability of a particular dictionary sense. An object classiﬁer is trained on the resulting sense-speciﬁc images. We evaluate our method on a dataset obtained by searching the web for polysemous words. Category classiﬁcation experiments show that our dictionarybased approach outperforms baseline methods. 1</p><p>4 0.17432982 <a title="142-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Weakly-Related_Unlabeled_Data_%3A_Towards_Better_Text_Categorization.html">205 nips-2008-Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data : Towards Better Text Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Liu Yang, Rong Jin, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption is exploited by most semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, if the unlabeled data is merely weakly related to the target classes, it becomes questionable whether driving the decision boundary to the low density regions of the unlabeled data will help the classiﬁcation. In such case, the cluster assumption may not be valid; and consequently how to leverage this type of unlabeled data to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy becomes a challenge. We introduce “Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data” (SSLW), an inductive method that builds upon the maximum-margin approach, towards a better usage of weakly-related unlabeled information. Although the SSLW could improve a wide range of classiﬁcation tasks, in this paper, we focus on text categorization with a small training pool. The key assumption behind this work is that, even with different topics, the word usage patterns across different corpora tends to be consistent. To this end, SSLW estimates the optimal wordcorrelation matrix that is consistent with both the co-occurrence information derived from the weakly-related unlabeled documents and the labeled documents. For empirical evaluation, we present a direct comparison with a number of stateof-the-art methods for inductive semi-supervised learning and text categorization. We show that SSLW results in a signiﬁcant improvement in categorization accuracy, equipped with a small training set and an unlabeled resource that is weakly related to the test domain.</p><p>5 0.16115351 <a title="142-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Shared_Segmentation_of_Natural_Scenes_Using_Dependent_Pitman-Yor_Processes.html">208 nips-2008-Shared Segmentation of Natural Scenes Using Dependent Pitman-Yor Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for the simultaneous, unsupervised segmentation and discovery of visual object categories from image databases. Examining a large set of manually segmented scenes, we show that object frequencies and segment sizes both follow power law distributions, which are well modeled by the Pitman–Yor (PY) process. This nonparametric prior distribution leads to learning algorithms which discover an unknown set of objects, and segmentation methods which automatically adapt their resolution to each image. Generalizing previous applications of PY processes, we use Gaussian processes to discover spatially contiguous segments which respect image boundaries. Using a novel family of variational approximations, our approach produces segmentations which compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, while simultaneously discovering categories shared among natural scenes. 1</p><p>6 0.16066001 <a title="142-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>

<p>Author: Doug Downey, Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Is accurate classiﬁcation possible in the absence of hand-labeled data? This paper introduces the Monotonic Feature (MF) abstraction—where the probability of class membership increases monotonically with the MF’s value. The paper proves that when an MF is given, PAC learning is possible with no hand-labeled data under certain assumptions. We argue that MFs arise naturally in a broad range of textual classiﬁcation applications. On the classic “20 Newsgroups” data set, a learner given an MF and unlabeled data achieves classiﬁcation accuracy equal to that of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learner relying on 160 hand-labeled examples. Even when MFs are not given as input, their presence or absence can be determined from a small amount of hand-labeled data, which yields a new semi-supervised learning method that reduces error by 15% on the 20 Newsgroups data. 1</p><p>3 0.72735584 <a title="142-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Stephen Gould, Ashutosh Saxena, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difﬁcult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classiﬁers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited “black box” interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classiﬁers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction. 1</p><p>4 0.70636636 <a title="142-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Weakly-Related_Unlabeled_Data_%3A_Towards_Better_Text_Categorization.html">205 nips-2008-Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data : Towards Better Text Categorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Phil Long, Rocco Servedio</p><p>Abstract: In recent work Long and Servedio [LS05] presented a “martingale boosting” algorithm that works by constructing a branching program over weak classiﬁers and has a simple analysis based on elementary properties of random walks. [LS05] showed that this martingale booster can tolerate random classiﬁcation noise when it is run with a noise-tolerant weak learner; however, a drawback of the algorithm is that it is not adaptive, i.e. it cannot effectively take advantage of variation in the quality of the weak classiﬁers it receives. We present an adaptive variant of the martingale boosting algorithm. This adaptiveness is achieved by modifying the original algorithm so that the random walks that arise in its analysis have different step size depending on the quality of the weak learner at each stage. The new algorithm inherits the desirable properties of the original [LS05] algorithm, such as random classiﬁcation noise tolerance, and has other advantages besides adaptiveness: it requires polynomially fewer calls to the weak learner than the original algorithm, and it can be used with conﬁdencerated weak hypotheses that output real values rather than Boolean predictions.</p><p>3 0.73613083 <a title="142-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Dynamics_of_Cognitive_Control.html">231 nips-2008-Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Reynolds, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Cognitive control refers to the ﬂexible deployment of memory and attention in response to task demands and current goals. Control is often studied experimentally by presenting sequences of stimuli, some demanding a response, and others modulating the stimulus-response mapping. In these tasks, participants must maintain information about the current stimulus-response mapping in working memory. Prominent theories of cognitive control use recurrent neural nets to implement working memory, and optimize memory utilization via reinforcement learning. We present a novel perspective on cognitive control in which working memory representations are intrinsically probabilistic, and control operations that maintain and update working memory are dynamically determined via probabilistic inference. We show that our model provides a parsimonious account of behavioral and neuroimaging data, and suggest that it offers an elegant conceptualization of control in which behavior can be cast as optimal, subject to limitations on learning and the rate of information processing. Moreover, our model provides insight into how task instructions can be directly translated into appropriate behavior and then efﬁciently reﬁned with subsequent task experience. 1</p><p>4 0.73373473 <a title="142-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.72708541 <a title="142-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Sense_Models_for_Polysemous_Words.html">246 nips-2008-Unsupervised Learning of Visual Sense Models for Polysemous Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Polysemy is a problem for methods that exploit image search engines to build object category models. Existing unsupervised approaches do not take word sense into consideration. We propose a new method that uses a dictionary to learn models of visual word sense from a large collection of unlabeled web data. The use of LDA to discover a latent sense space makes the model robust despite the very limited nature of dictionary deﬁnitions. The deﬁnitions are used to learn a distribution in the latent space that best represents a sense. The algorithm then uses the text surrounding image links to retrieve images with high probability of a particular dictionary sense. An object classiﬁer is trained on the resulting sense-speciﬁc images. We evaluate our method on a dataset obtained by searching the web for polysemous words. Category classiﬁcation experiments show that our dictionarybased approach outperforms baseline methods. 1</p><p>6 0.72524613 <a title="142-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>

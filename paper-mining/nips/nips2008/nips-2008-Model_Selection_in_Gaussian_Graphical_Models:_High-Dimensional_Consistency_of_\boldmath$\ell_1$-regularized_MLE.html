<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: Given a collection of r ≥ 2 linear regression problems in p dimensions, suppose that the regression coefﬁcients share partially common supports. This set-up suggests the use of 1 / ∞ -regularized regression for joint estimation of the p × r matrix of regression coefﬁcients. We analyze the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularized quadratic programming, considering both consistency rates in ∞ -norm, and also how the minimal sample size n required for performing variable selection grows as a function of the model dimension, sparsity, and overlap between the supports. We begin by establishing bounds on the ∞ error as well sufﬁcient conditions for exact variable selection for ﬁxed design matrices, as well as designs drawn randomly from general Gaussian matrices. These results show that the high-dimensional scaling of 1 / ∞ -regularization is qualitatively similar to that of ordinary 1 -regularization. Our second set of results applies to design matrices drawn from standard Gaussian ensembles, for which we provide a sharp set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions: the 1 / ∞ -regularized method undergoes a phase transition characterized by the rescaled sample size θ1,∞ (n, p, s, α) = n/{(4 − 3α)s log(p − (2 − α) s)}. More precisely, for any δ > 0, the probability of successfully recovering both supports converges to 1 for scalings such that θ1,∞ ≥ 1 + δ, and converges to 0 for scalings for which θ1,∞ ≤ 1 − δ. An implication of this threshold is that use of 1,∞ -regularization yields improved statistical efﬁciency if the overlap parameter is large enough (α > 2/3), but performs worse than a naive Lasso-based approach for moderate to small overlap (α < 2/3). We illustrate the close agreement between these theoretical predictions, and the actual behavior in simulations. 1</p><p>3 0.27657911 <a title="135-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-High-dimensional_support_union_recovery_in_multivariate_regression.html">99 nips-2008-High-dimensional support union recovery in multivariate regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillaume R. Obozinski, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression, where a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a ﬁxed set of p covariates. The problem of support union recovery is to recover the subset of covariates that are active in at least one of the regression problems. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling (where the problem parameters as well as sample size n tend to inﬁnity simultaneously), our main result is to show that exact recovery is possible once the order parameter given by θ 1 / 2 (n, p, s) : = n/[2ψ(B ∗ ) log(p − s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the size of the union of supports, and ψ(B ∗ ) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefﬁcient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to a naive 1 -approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal relative to the design. We complement our theoretical results with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of the result, even for relatively small problems. 1</p><p>4 0.18989451 <a title="135-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Multi-stage_Convex_Relaxation_for_Learning_with_Sparse_Regularization.html">145 nips-2008-Multi-stage Convex Relaxation for Learning with Sparse Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We study learning formulations with non-convex regularizaton that are natural for sparse linear models. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to sub-optimal sparsity in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we investigate a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex regularization. Theoretically, we analyze the behavior of a resulting two-stage relaxation scheme for the capped-L1 regularization. Our performance bound shows that the procedure is superior to the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets. Experiments conﬁrm the effectiveness of this method on some simulation and real data. 1</p><p>5 0.18025281 <a title="135-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Regression_and_Lasso.html">202 nips-2008-Robust Regression and Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust least-squares regression with feature-wise disturbance. We show that this formulation leads to tractable convex optimization problems, and we exhibit a particular uncertainty set for which the robust problem is equivalent to 1 regularized regression (Lasso). This provides an interpretation of Lasso from a robust optimization perspective. We generalize this robust formulation to consider more general uncertainty sets, which all lead to tractable convex optimization problems. Therefore, we provide a new methodology for designing regression algorithms, which generalize known formulations. The advantage is that robustness to disturbance is a physical property that can be exploited: in addition to obtaining new formulations, we use it directly to show sparsity properties of Lasso, as well as to prove a general consistency result for robust regression problems, including Lasso, from a uniﬁed robustness perspective. 1</p><p>6 0.17961942 <a title="135-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>

<p>Author: Benjamin Yackley, Eduardo Corona, Terran Lane</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting problems, including Bayesian network structure-search, can be cast in terms of ﬁnding the optimum value of a function over the space of graphs. However, this function is often expensive to compute exactly. We here present a method derived from the study of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which takes advantage of the regular structure of the space of all graphs on a ﬁxed number of nodes to obtain approximations to the desired function quickly and with reasonable accuracy. We then test this method on both a small testing set and a real-world Bayesian network; the results suggest that not only is this method reasonably accurate, but that the BDe score itself varies quadratically over the space of all graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.61434501 <a title="135-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Covariance_Estimation_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Vectors_Using_the_Sparse_Matrix_Transform.html">54 nips-2008-Covariance Estimation for High Dimensional Data Vectors Using the Sparse Matrix Transform</a></p>

We study the performance of study the performance of the ℓ1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimator in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges in the graph s and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the number of samples n. Our main result provides sufﬁcient conditions on (n, p, d) for the ℓ1 -regularized MLE estimator to recover all the edges of the graph with high probability. Under some conditions on the model covariance, we show that model selection can be achieved for sample sizes n = Ω(d2 log(p)), with the error decaying as O(exp(−c log(p))) for some constant c. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations and show good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.</p><p>2 0.96700418 <a title="135-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Resolution_Limits_of_Sparse_Coding_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2008-Resolution Limits of Sparse Coding in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparsity pattern detection for unknown ksparse n-dimensional signals observed through m noisy, random linear measurements. Sparsity pattern recovery arises in a number of settings including statistical model selection, pattern detection, and image acquisition. The main results in this paper are necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for asymptotically-reliable sparsity pattern recovery in terms of the dimensions m, n and k as well as the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and the minimum-to-average ratio (MAR) of the nonzero entries of the signal. We show that m > 2k log(n − k)/(SNR · MAR) is necessary for any algorithm to succeed, regardless of complexity; this matches a previous sufﬁcient condition for maximum likelihood estimation within a constant factor under certain scalings of k, SNR and MAR with n. We also show a sufﬁcient condition for a computationally-trivial thresholding algorithm that is larger than the previous expression by only a factor of 4(1 + SNR) and larger than the requirement for lasso by only a factor of 4/MAR. This provides insight on the precise value and limitations of convex programming-based algorithms.</p><p>3 0.9387148 <a title="135-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_a_discriminative_hidden_part_model_for_human_action_recognition.html">119 nips-2008-Learning a discriminative hidden part model for human action recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We present a discriminative part-based approach for human action recognition from video sequences using motion features. Our model is based on the recently proposed hidden conditional random ﬁeld (hCRF) for object recognition. Similar to hCRF for object recognition, we model a human action by a ﬂexible constellation of parts conditioned on image observations. Different from object recognition, our model combines both large-scale global features and local patch features to distinguish various actions. Our experimental results show that our model is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition. In particular, our experimental results demonstrate that combining large-scale global features and local patch features performs signiﬁcantly better than directly applying hCRF on local patches alone. 1</p><p>4 0.93041539 <a title="135-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Liqing Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A visual attention system should respond placidly when common stimuli are presented, while at the same time keep alert to anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return. 1</p><p>5 0.88972247 <a title="135-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Signal-to-Noise_Ratio_Analysis_of_Policy_Gradient_Algorithms.html">210 nips-2008-Signal-to-Noise Ratio Analysis of Policy Gradient Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: John W. Roberts, Russ Tedrake</p><p>Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) reinforcement learning algorithms have strong (local) convergence guarantees, but their learning performance is typically limited by a large variance in the estimate of the gradient. In this paper, we formulate the variance reduction problem by describing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradient algorithms, and evaluate this SNR carefully for the popular Weight Perturbation (WP) algorithm. We conﬁrm that SNR is a good predictor of long-term learning performance, and that in our episodic formulation, the cost-to-go function is indeed the optimal baseline. We then propose two modiﬁcations to traditional model-free policy gradient algorithms in order to optimize the SNR. First, we examine WP using anisotropic sampling distributions, which introduces a bias into the update but increases the SNR; this bias can be interpreted as following the natural gradient of the cost function. Second, we show that non-Gaussian distributions can also increase the SNR, and argue that the optimal isotropic distribution is a ‘shell’ distribution with a constant magnitude and uniform distribution in direction. We demonstrate that both modiﬁcations produce substantial improvements in learning performance in challenging policy gradient experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.85157043 <a title="135-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Covariance_Estimation_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Vectors_Using_the_Sparse_Matrix_Transform.html">54 nips-2008-Covariance Estimation for High Dimensional Data Vectors Using the Sparse Matrix Transform</a></p>

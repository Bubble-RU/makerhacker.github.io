<p>Author: Jan Gasthaus, Frank Wood, Dilan Gorur, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new incremental spike sorting model that automatically eliminates refractory period violations, accounts for action potential waveform drift, and can handle “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons. Our approach is to augment a known time-varying Dirichlet process that ties together a sequence of inﬁnite Gaussian mixture models, one per action potential waveform observation, with an interspike-interval-dependent likelihood that prohibits refractory period violations. We demonstrate this model by showing results from sorting two publicly available neural data recordings for which a partial ground truth labeling is known. 1</p><p>4 0.20823887 <a title="16-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Using_Bayesian_Dynamical_Systems_for_Motion_Template_Libraries.html">247 nips-2008-Using Bayesian Dynamical Systems for Motion Template Libraries</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvia Chiappa, Jens Kober, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Motor primitives or motion templates have become an important concept for both modeling human motor control as well as generating robot behaviors using imitation learning. Recent impressive results range from humanoid robot movement generation to timing models of human motions. The automatic generation of skill libraries containing multiple motion templates is an important step in robot learning. Such a skill learning system needs to cluster similar movements together and represent each resulting motion template as a generative model which is subsequently used for the execution of the behavior by a robot system. In this paper, we show how human trajectories captured as multi-dimensional time-series can be clustered using Bayesian mixtures of linear Gaussian state-space models based on the similarity of their dynamics. The appropriate number of templates is automatically determined by enforcing a parsimonious parametrization. As the resulting model is intractable, we introduce a novel approximation method based on variational Bayes, which is especially designed to enable the use of efﬁcient inference algorithms. On recorded human Balero movements, this method is not only capable of ﬁnding reasonable motion templates but also yields a generative model which works well in the execution of this complex task on a simulated anthropomorphic SARCOS arm.</p><p>5 0.19030005 <a title="16-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Extracting_State_Transition_Dynamics_from_Multiple_Spike_Trains_with_Correlated_Poisson_HMM.html">81 nips-2008-Extracting State Transition Dynamics from Multiple Spike Trains with Correlated Poisson HMM</a></p>
<p>Author: Kentaro Katahira, Jun Nishikawa, Kazuo Okanoya, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity is non-stationary and varies across time. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used to track the state transition among quasi-stationary discrete neural states. Within this context, independent Poisson models have been used for the output distribution of HMMs; hence, the model is incapable of tracking the change in correlation without modulating the ﬁring rate. To achieve this, we applied a multivariate Poisson distribution with correlation terms for the output distribution of HMMs. We formulated a Variational Bayes (VB) inference for the model. The VB could automatically determine the appropriate number of hidden states and correlation types while avoiding the overlearning problem. We developed an efﬁcient algorithm for computing posteriors using the recursive relationship of a multivariate Poisson distribution. We demonstrated the performance of our method on synthetic data and a real spike train recorded from a songbird. 1</p><p>6 0.18827541 <a title="16-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Peng Xu, Timothy K. Horiuchi, Pamela A. Abshire</p><p>Abstract: We report a compact realization of short-term depression (STD) in a VLSI stochastic synapse. The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single release model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redundancy in the input spike train, and the mean transmission probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural systems. 1</p><p>5 0.59605634 <a title="16-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Extracting_State_Transition_Dynamics_from_Multiple_Spike_Trains_with_Correlated_Poisson_HMM.html">81 nips-2008-Extracting State Transition Dynamics from Multiple Spike Trains with Correlated Poisson HMM</a></p>

<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.74150538 <a title="16-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Template_Matching_with_Shift-Invariant_Semi-NMF.html">16 nips-2008-Adaptive Template Matching with Shift-Invariant Semi-NMF</a></p>

<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The machine learning problem of classiﬁer design is studied from the perspective of probability elicitation, in statistics. This shows that the standard approach of proceeding from the speciﬁcation of a loss, to the minimization of conditional risk is overly restrictive. It is shown that a better alternative is to start from the speciﬁcation of a functional form for the minimum conditional risk, and derive the loss function. This has various consequences of practical interest, such as showing that 1) the widely adopted practice of relying on convex loss functions is unnecessary, and 2) many new losses can be derived for classiﬁcation problems. These points are illustrated by the derivation of a new loss which is not convex, but does not compromise the computational tractability of classiﬁer design, and is robust to the contamination of data with outliers. A new boosting algorithm, SavageBoost, is derived for the minimization of this loss. Experimental results show that it is indeed less sensitive to outliers than conventional methods, such as Ada, Real, or LogitBoost, and converges in fewer iterations. 1</p><p>4 0.61095899 <a title="16-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Forward-Backward_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Learning_with_Linear_Models.html">14 nips-2008-Adaptive Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithm for Sparse Learning with Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Consider linear prediction models where the target function is a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefﬁcients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneﬁcial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory. 1</p><p>5 0.55871803 <a title="16-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_asymptotic_equivalence_between_differential_Hebbian_and_temporal_difference_learning_using_a_local_third_factor.html">166 nips-2008-On the asymptotic equivalence between differential Hebbian and temporal difference learning using a local third factor</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Kolodziejski, Bernd Porr, Minija Tamosiunaite, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this theoretical contribution we provide mathematical proof that two of the most important classes of network learning - correlation-based differential Hebbian learning and reward-based temporal difference learning - are asymptotically equivalent when timing the learning with a local modulatory signal. This opens the opportunity to consistently reformulate most of the abstract reinforcement learning framework from a correlation based perspective that is more closely related to the biophysics of neurons. 1</p><p>6 0.53656554 <a title="16-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Agent_Filtering_with_Infinitely_Nested_Beliefs.html">141 nips-2008-Multi-Agent Filtering with Infinitely Nested Beliefs</a></p>

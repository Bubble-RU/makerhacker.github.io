<p>Author: Julia Owen, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>3 0.054308277 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Learning_of_Switching_Linear_Dynamical_Systems.html">154 nips-2008-Nonparametric Bayesian Learning of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan, Emily B. Fox</p><p>Abstract: Many nonlinear dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efﬁcient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences. The utility and ﬂexibility of our model are demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, and the IBOVESPA stock index.</p><p>4 0.051998898 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-An_improved_estimator_of_Variance_Explained_in_the_presence_of_noise.html">24 nips-2008-An improved estimator of Variance Explained in the presence of noise</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf M. Haefner, Bruce G. Cumming</p><p>Abstract: A crucial part of developing mathematical models of information processing in the brain is the quantiﬁcation of their success. One of the most widely-used metrics yields the percentage of the variance in the data that is explained by the model. Unfortunately, this metric is biased due to the intrinsic variability in the data. We derive a simple analytical modiﬁcation of the traditional formula that signiﬁcantly improves its accuracy (as measured by bias) with similar or better precision (as measured by mean-square error) in estimating the true underlying Variance Explained by the model class. Our estimator advances on previous work by a) accounting for overﬁtting due to free model parameters mitigating the need for a separate validation data set, b) adjusting for the uncertainty in the noise estimate and c) adding a conditioning term. We apply our new estimator to binocular disparity tuning curves of a set of macaque V1 neurons and ﬁnd that on a population level almost all of the variance unexplained by Gabor functions is attributable to noise. 1</p><p>5 0.042214092 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>6 0.038091641 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Near-minimax_recursive_density_estimation_on_the_binary_hypercube.html">149 nips-2008-Near-minimax recursive density estimation on the binary hypercube</a></p>

<p>Author: Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: Semantic hashing[1] seeks compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with semantic similarity. In this paper, we show that the problem of ﬁnding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to eﬃciently calculate the code of a novel datapoint. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art. 1</p><p>3 0.45367354 <a title="167-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-An_improved_estimator_of_Variance_Explained_in_the_presence_of_noise.html">24 nips-2008-An improved estimator of Variance Explained in the presence of noise</a></p>

<p>Author: Jean-philippe Pellet, AndrÄ&sbquo;Ĺ  Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: Causal structure-discovery techniques usually assume that all causes of more than one variable are observed. This is the so-called causal sufficiency assumption. In practice, it is untestable, and often violated. In this paper, we present an efficient causal structure-learning algorithm, suited for causally insufficient data. Similar to algorithms such as IC* and FCI, the proposed approach drops the causal sufficiency assumption and learns a structure that indicates (potential) latent causes for pairs of observed variables. Assuming a constant local density of the data-generating graph, our algorithm makes a quadratic number of conditionalindependence tests w.r.t. the number of variables. We show with experiments that our algorithm is comparable to the state-of-the-art FCI algorithm in accuracy, while being several orders of magnitude faster on large problems. We conclude that MBCS* makes a new range of causally insufficient problems computationally tractable. Keywords: Graphical Models, Structure Learning, Causal Inference. 1 Introduction: Task Definition & Related Work The statistical definition of causality pioneered by Pearl (2000) and Spirtes et al. (2001) has shed new light on how to detect causation. Central in this approach is the automated detection of causeeffect relationships using observational (i.e., non-experimental) data. This can be a necessary task, as in many situations, performing randomized controlled experiments to unveil causation can be impossible, unethical , or too costly. When the analysis deals with variables that cannot be manipulated, being able to learn from data collected by observing the running system is the only possibility. It turns out that learning the full causal structure of a set of variables is, in its most general form , impossible.

<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efﬁciently computing pairwise (l2 , l1 ) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modiﬁes the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reﬂect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage in that it is “one-sketch-for-all.” In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efﬁciently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the χ2 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances. We recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval. 1</p><p>3 0.57790518 <a title="167-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-The_Conjoint_Effect_of_Divisive_Normalization_and_Orientation_Selectivity_on_Redundancy_Reduction.html">232 nips-2008-The Conjoint Effect of Divisive Normalization and Orientation Selectivity on Redundancy Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Bandpass ﬁltering, orientation selectivity, and contrast gain control are prominent features of sensory coding at the level of V1 simple cells. While the effect of bandpass ﬁltering and orientation selectivity can be assessed within a linear model, contrast gain control is an inherently nonlinear computation. Here we employ the class of Lp elliptically contoured distributions to investigate the extent to which the two features—orientation selectivity and contrast gain control—are suited to model the statistics of natural images. Within this framework we ﬁnd that contrast gain control can play a signiﬁcant role for the removal of redundancies in natural images. Orientation selectivity, in contrast, has only a very limited potential for redundancy reduction. 1</p><p>4 0.46522152 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.46387824 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Data_in_Multiple_Feature_Representations.html">63 nips-2008-Dimensionality Reduction for Data in Multiple Feature Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-yu Lin, Tyng-luh Liu, Chiou-shann Fuh</p><p>Abstract: In solving complex visual learning tasks, adopting multiple descriptors to more precisely characterize the data has been a feasible way for improving performance. These representations are typically high dimensional and assume diverse forms. Thus ﬁnding a way to transform them into a uniﬁed space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks, such as object recognition or clustering. We describe an approach that incorporates multiple kernel learning with dimensionality reduction (MKL-DR). While the proposed framework is ﬂexible in simultaneously tackling data in various feature representations, the formulation itself is general in that it is established upon graph embedding. It follows that any dimensionality reduction techniques explainable by graph embedding can be generalized by our method to consider data in multiple feature representations.</p><p>6 0.46361998 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

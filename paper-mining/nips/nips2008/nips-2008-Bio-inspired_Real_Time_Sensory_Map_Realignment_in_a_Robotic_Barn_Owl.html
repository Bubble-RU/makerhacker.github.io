</p><p>2 However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. [sent-8, score-1.113]
</p><p>3 The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). [sent-9, score-0.486]
</p><p>4 In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). [sent-11, score-0.327]
</p><p>5 We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. [sent-12, score-0.189]
</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Barn owl is a nocturnal predator with strong able auditory and visual localization system. [sent-13, score-0.917]
</p><p>7 During localization, the sensory stimuli are translated into neuron response, the visual and auditory maps are formed. [sent-14, score-0.866]
</p><p>8 In the deep Superior Colliculus (SC), visual and auditory information are integrated together. [sent-15, score-0.563]
</p><p>9 Normally, the object localization of visual map and auditory map are aligned with each other. [sent-16, score-0.802]
</p><p>10 But this alignment can be disrupted by wearing a prism or blindness [1, 2]. [sent-17, score-0.303]
</p><p>11 The juvenile barn owl is able to adapt so that it can foveates correctly on the source of auditory stimuli. [sent-18, score-0.896]
</p><p>12 A model based on the newest biological discoveries and account for a large amount of biological observations has been developed to explore the adaptation in map alignment [3]. [sent-19, score-0.221]
</p><p>13 This model is applied to a robotic system emulating the behavior of heading of the barn owl, so as to provide a real-time visual and auditory information integration and map realignment. [sent-20, score-0.929]
</p><p>14 As a hub of sensory information, SC neurons access the auditory stimuli from Inferior Colliculus (IC) [4, 1], which includes external Inferior Colliculus (ICx) and central Inferior Colliculus (ICc). [sent-24, score-0.543]
</p><p>15 As revealed by anatomical and physiological experiments, the main site of map adaptation is in two areas, one is axon connection between ICc and ICx, the other area is an inhibitory network in SC. [sent-26, score-0.557]
</p><p>16 Large amounts of evidence has shown axon sprouting and retraction between ICc and ICx are guided by inhibitory network in SC during prism learning [5, 6, 7]. [sent-27, score-0.43]
</p><p>17 they’re promoted by neurotrophin (one kind of nerve growth factor) release and electrical activity of the cell body [8]. [sent-30, score-0.38]
</p><p>18 The release of neurotrophin is triggered by guiding signal from SC. [sent-31, score-0.361]
</p><p>19 In the inhibitory network, MAC is assumed to be introduced by inter neuron, which is plausible to be bimodal neuron [7]. [sent-34, score-0.475]
</p><p>20 Bimodal neuron can be potentiated by both visual input (from retina) and auditory input (from ICx). [sent-35, score-0.745]
</p><p>21 Its neuron response is obviously strenthened when visual and auditory input are correlated [9]. [sent-36, score-0.745]
</p><p>22 Previous work has pointed out Hebbian Learning plays a main role in sensory information integration on bimodal neuron [4]. [sent-37, score-0.42]
</p><p>23 As the neuron response in visual map (retina layer) and auditory map (ICx layer) has a center surround proﬁle, the receptive center has the highest ﬁring rate, e. [sent-43, score-1.053]
</p><p>24 The spike patterns of visual center and auditory center, corresponding to a same target, are highly correlated with each other. [sent-46, score-0.744]
</p><p>25 Adjacent neurons respond with template spike trains of low ﬁring rate. [sent-47, score-0.204]
</p><p>26 The spike patterns of center neuron and ajacent neuron are independent with each other. [sent-48, score-0.545]
</p><p>27 3  Neural Model  The simulation is to emulate a virtual barn owl at the center of a ﬁxed, head-centered reference system with the origin centered on the perch as in Fig. [sent-51, score-0.545]
</p><p>28 The single pathway is composed of two basic sections shown in Fig. [sent-56, score-0.227]
</p><p>29 Block I comprises the ICc, ICx and the axon connections that map between them. [sent-58, score-0.285]
</p><p>30 Block II is both the detector of any shift between visual and auditory cues and the controller of the ICx/ICc mapping in block I. [sent-59, score-0.599]
</p><p>31 The connection between ICc and ICx in block I is instructed by Map Adaptation Cue (MAC), which is generated by the inter neuron in block II. [sent-60, score-0.407]
</p><p>32 In block II, both bimodal and inter neurons in this model are Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron (Equation 1). [sent-61, score-0.481]
</p><p>33 ge is the excitatory synaptic conductance, which is associated with excitatory reversal potential Vexc . [sent-62, score-0.222]
</p><p>34 Similarly, gi , the inhibitory conductance, is associated with inhibitory reversal 2  (a)  (b)  Figure 2: (a) Schematic of the auditory and visual signal processing pathway. [sent-63, score-0.792]
</p><p>35 The visual stimulus arrives in the retina at N42 , N22 receives the strongest MAC. [sent-66, score-0.241]
</p><p>36 The dashed line is the new connection built when the growthcone reaches its threshold. [sent-68, score-0.217]
</p><p>37 The old connection between N13 and N23 is thus eliminated due to lack of alignment between the auditory and visual stimuli. [sent-69, score-0.778]
</p><p>38 Cm  dV (t) = −gl (V (t) − Vrest ) − ge (V (t) − Vexc ) − gi (V (t) − Vinh ) dt  (1)  The synapses connecting the sensory signals with the bimodel neuron are excitatory while the synapse between bimodal neuron and inter neuron is inhibitory. [sent-75, score-1.001]
</p><p>39 STDP is a learning rule in which the synaptic weight is strengthened or weakened by the paired presynaptic spikes and postsynaptic spikes in a time window [14]. [sent-77, score-0.255]
</p><p>40 2(b), neuron Nij indicates the neuron location in layer i and pathway j. [sent-79, score-0.663]
</p><p>41 The developing of axon growthcone is activated by presynaptic spikes from its source layer ICc (layer 1). [sent-80, score-0.516]
</p><p>42 The target layer ICx (layer 2) releases neurotrophin when it is excited by MAC spikes. [sent-81, score-0.368]
</p><p>43 The concentration of neurotrophin c2j is set to be linearly proportional to the total MAC induced synaptic activity, P2j , which sums the MAC spikes of ICx layer neurons. [sent-82, score-0.445]
</p><p>44 2(b), N2j (cen) is the ICx neuron that receives strongest stimulation from the visual signal, via the retina and SC. [sent-84, score-0.423]
</p><p>45 The concentrations of neurotrophin released by neurons N2j depend upon the distance between neuron N2j and N2j (cen), N2j − N2j (cen) . [sent-85, score-0.56]
</p><p>46 The concentration of neurotrophin also decays with time step . [sent-89, score-0.253]
</p><p>47 3  c(N2j (cen))  P (N2j )D(N2j − N2j (cen))  (2)  P (N2j )e−λ  =  (3)  N2j  =  N2j −N2j (cen)  N2j  When there is neurotrophin released, the growth cone begins to grow induced by neural activity. [sent-90, score-0.351]
</p><p>48 The growth cone activity is bounded by the presynaptic factor which is a summation ﬁlter representing the linear sum of the presynaptic spikes of the corresponding neuron N1j . [sent-91, score-0.471]
</p><p>49 The most active growth cone from source neuron N1j (sou) has the highest possibility to be extended. [sent-92, score-0.28]
</p><p>50 If N2j (tag) is the target direction of growth cone, N2j (tag) is identiﬁed when the accumulated neurotrophin c2j (tag) exceeds the threshold, the new connection between N1j (sou) and N2j (tag) is validated, meanwhile the neurotrophin is reset to the initial state. [sent-93, score-0.755]
</p><p>51 When the new connection is completed, the old connection which is bifurcated from the same neuron is blocked [15, 16]. [sent-94, score-0.406]
</p><p>52 1  (4)  Real-time Learning and Adaptation Experiments  To analyze the capability of the model in a real-time robotic system, an e-puck robot equipped with two lateral microphones, and a camera with a 30◦ prism is shown in Fig. [sent-96, score-0.245]
</p><p>53 The visual and auditory target (LED and loudspeaker) was ﬁxed in one location and the owl-head robot moves into different directions manually or by motor command. [sent-100, score-0.685]
</p><p>54 The high ﬁring rate spike pattern was fed into center neurons, which correspond to the target localization in space, in ICc or retina layer. [sent-101, score-0.406]
</p><p>55 In the network model, each pathway represents 18◦ ﬁeld in space. [sent-102, score-0.251]
</p><p>56 We label the neurons corresponding to the azimuth angle −90◦ ∼ −72◦ , pathway 1, so that azimuth angle 0◦ ∼ 18◦ is represented by pathway 6. [sent-103, score-0.673]
</p><p>57 For every stimulation, a visual or an audiovisual target was presented at one of the 10 available locations. [sent-111, score-0.203]
</p><p>58 Secondly, the owl-head robot wearing prism with azimuth angle 36◦ was presented to randomly selected direction in azimuth. [sent-112, score-0.346]
</p><p>59 Since visual and auditory signals are registered with each other, both the visual excitatory synapse (the arrow between N4j and N3j in Fig. [sent-119, score-0.887]
</p><p>60 2(b)) and auditory excitatory synapse (the arrow between N2j and N3j in Fig. [sent-120, score-0.492]
</p><p>61 We get the visual direction from the luminous image by identifying the position of the brightest pixel. [sent-126, score-0.184]
</p><p>62 The auditory signal is processed by FFT to identify the phase difference between left and right ear, so as to ﬁnd the auditory direction. [sent-127, score-0.838]
</p><p>63 the inhibitory relationship between bimodal neuron and the interneuron, the interneuron is strongly inhibited and its output is close to zero. [sent-128, score-0.455]
</p><p>64 Therefore, no neurotrophin is released in the ICx neuron, as shown in Fig. [sent-129, score-0.321]
</p><p>65 The growthcone does not grow in the auditory layer, so there is no change to the original axon connection, Fig. [sent-131, score-0.737]
</p><p>66 Because of the prism wearing, the visual receptive center and auditory receptive center are in different pathways, pathway 8 and pathway 6. [sent-136, score-1.342]
</p><p>67 Visual and auditory input spike trains are independent of each other in pathway 8. [sent-137, score-0.777]
</p><p>68 Thus both visual and auditory synapses connected to the bimodal neuron are weakened. [sent-138, score-0.941]
</p><p>69 With high neurotrophin value and high ﬁring rate spike train input, the pathway 6 growthcone is the most active one at the source layer. [sent-141, score-0.72]
</p><p>70 When the growthcone grows to certain level, the axon connection is updated, as shown in Fig. [sent-142, score-0.433]
</p><p>71 For the camera is limited by its visual angle −30◦ ∼ 30◦ , the real-time robot experiment only tested pathway 4 ∼ 7. [sent-144, score-0.496]
</p><p>72 The rest of the pathway test is simulated in PC in terms of data accessed from pathway 4 ∼ 7. [sent-145, score-0.454]
</p><p>73 In this paper, we demonstrate a robust model to eliminate the visual and auditory localization disparity. [sent-149, score-0.664]
</p><p>74 This model explains the mechanism behind visual and auditory signal integration. [sent-150, score-0.62]
</p><p>75 The real-time application in a robotic barn owl head shows the model can work in real world which the brains of animals have to face. [sent-153, score-0.522]
</p><p>76 By studying the brain wiring mechanism in superior colliculus, we can better understand the maps alignment in brain. [sent-154, score-0.184]

</p><p>79 (b) The axon connection between ICc and ICx doesn’t change. [sent-159, score-0.315]

<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>2 0.12076697 <a title="38-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>
<p>Author: Klaus Wimmer, Marcel Stimberg, Robert Martin, Lars Schwabe, Jorge Mariño, James Schummers, David C. Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>3 0.11257765 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Spike_Feature_Extraction_Using_Informative_Samples.html">220 nips-2008-Spike Feature Extraction Using Informative Samples</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicençc Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>5 0.10681402 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Short-Term_Depression_in_VLSI_Stochastic_Synapse.html">209 nips-2008-Short-Term Depression in VLSI Stochastic Synapse</a></p>

<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>2 0.67854863 <a title="38-lsi-2" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>
<p>Author: Klaus Wimmer, Marcel Stimberg, Robert Martin, Lars Schwabe, Jorge Mariño, James Schummers, David C. Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>3 0.58129972 <a title="38-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Short-Term_Depression_in_VLSI_Stochastic_Synapse.html">209 nips-2008-Short-Term Depression in VLSI Stochastic Synapse</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicençc Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>5 0.53681362 <a title="38-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Cell_Assemblies_in_Large_Sparse_Inhibitory_Networks_of_Biologically_Realistic_Spiking_Neurons.html">43 nips-2008-Cell Assemblies in Large Sparse Inhibitory Networks of Biologically Realistic Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Ponzi, Jeff Wickens</p><p>Abstract: Cell assemblies exhibiting episodes of recurrent coherent activity have been observed in several brain regions including the striatum[1] and hippocampus CA3[2]. Here we address the question of how coherent dynamically switching assemblies appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons interacting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmetric inhibitory networks with ﬁxed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bifurcation between a quiescent and ﬁring state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and assemblies switch between ﬁring and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental studies. The deterministic dynamical behaviour is related to winner-less competition[3], shown in small closed loop inhibitory networks with heteroclinic cycles connecting saddle-points. 1</p><p>6 0.48748586 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>

<p>Author: Chao Yuan, Claus Neubauer</p><p>Abstract: Mixture of Gaussian processes models extended a single Gaussian process with ability of modeling multi-modal data and reduction of training complexity. Previous inference algorithms for these models are mostly based on Gibbs sampling, which can be very slow, particularly for large-scale data sets. We present a new generative mixture of experts model. Each expert is still a Gaussian process but is reformulated by a linear model. This breaks the dependency among training outputs and enables us to use a much faster variational Bayesian algorithm for training. Our gating network is more ﬂexible than previous generative approaches as inputs for each expert are modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. The number of experts and number of Gaussian components for an expert are inferred automatically. A variety of tests show the advantages of our method. 1</p><p>3 0.40342587 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>4 0.29948089 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>5 0.29553291 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>6 0.29422891 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Regression_and_Lasso.html">202 nips-2008-Robust Regression and Lasso</a></p>

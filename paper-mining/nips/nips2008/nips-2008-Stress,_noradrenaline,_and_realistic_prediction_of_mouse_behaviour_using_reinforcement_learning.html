</p><p>3 Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. [sent-10, score-1.085]
</p><p>4 1  Introduction  Animal behaviour is guided by rewards that can be received in different situations and by modulatory factors, such as stress and motivation. [sent-11, score-0.72]
</p><p>5 It is known that acute stress can affect learning and memory by modulating plasticity through stress hormones and neuromodulators [1, 2, 3], but their role in highlevel processes such as learning, memory, and action selection is not well understood. [sent-12, score-0.694]
</p><p>6 While such models provide great mechanistic insights, they alone are often unable to accurately predict animal behaviour in a realistic situation due to a great number of diverse modulatory factors. [sent-14, score-0.567]
</p><p>7 Instead, we propose a method which could account for the inﬂuence of arbitrary modulatory factors on behaviour as control parameters of a general behavioural model. [sent-16, score-0.525]
</p><p>8 In modeling reward-based behavioural learning, approaches based on the formal theory of reinforcement learning (RL) have been the most successful. [sent-17, score-0.158]
</p><p>9 The basic idea of RL is that animals (or artiﬁcial agents) select their actions based on predicted future rewards that could be acquired upon taking these actions. [sent-18, score-0.273]
</p><p>10 The expected values of future rewards for different actions (Q-values) can be gradually learned by observing rewards received under different state-action combinations. [sent-19, score-0.305]
</p><p>11 TD models have been successfully applied to explain a wide range of experimental data, including animal conditioning [8], human decision-making [12], and even addiction [13]. [sent-21, score-0.356]
</p><p>12 Learning and action selection in TD models can be strongly inﬂuenced by the choice of model metaparameters such as the learning rate, the future reward discounting, and the exploitation-exploration balance. [sent-22, score-0.197]
</p><p>13 Modulatory factors such as stress, anxiety, and impulsivity often act through the same brain systems, which suggests that in RL models their effects could be expressed through changes in meta-parameter values. [sent-24, score-0.33]
</p><p>14 In the present study, we tested mouse behaviour in a simple conditioning task - the hole-box, and showed how various modulatory factors could control a simple RL model to accurately predict animal behaviour. [sent-25, score-0.812]
</p><p>15 We used food deprived mice of two genetic strains - ’calm’ C57BL/6 and ’anxious’ DBA/2 [6], half of which were exposed to an additional stressor - sitting on an elevated platform before each experimental session. [sent-26, score-0.81]
</p><p>16 We formalized animal behaviour using a simple RL model, and trained an artiﬁcial neural network that could control RL meta-parameters using information about stress, motivation, individual affective traits, and previous learning success. [sent-27, score-0.513]
</p><p>17 Finally, using systemic manipulations of the noradrenergic system we show how noradrenaline interacts with stress and anxiety in regulating performance accuracy and temporal discounting. [sent-29, score-0.953]
</p><p>18 2  Description of the hole-box experiment  In our hole-box experiments, we used 64 male mice (32 of C57BL/6 strain and 32 of DBA/2 strain) that were 10-week old at the beginning of the experiment. [sent-30, score-0.541]
</p><p>19 During an experimental session, each animal was placed into the hole-box (Figure 1a). [sent-31, score-0.292]
</p><p>20 The mice had to learn to make a nose poke into the hole upon the onset of lights and not to make it under the condition of no light. [sent-32, score-0.743]
</p><p>21 After a response to light, the animals (which were food deprived to 87. [sent-33, score-0.285]
</p><p>22 0% of their initial weight) received a reward in form of a food pellet (Figure 1b). [sent-35, score-0.318]
</p><p>23 The total session duration was 500 sec, equivalent to 1000 time steps. [sent-38, score-0.128]
</p><p>24 During 2 days of habituation (when the food delivery was not paired with light) the mice learned that food could be delivered from the boxes. [sent-46, score-0.787]
</p><p>25 After this, they were trained for 8 consecutive days, during 2  which half of the mice were exposed to extrinsic stress (30min on the elevated platform) before each training session. [sent-47, score-0.887]

</p><p>28 Mice of each strain were treated equivalently with respect to pharmacological and stress conditions. [sent-52, score-0.505]
</p><p>29 3  Challenges of behavioural analysis  To quantify animal performance in the hole-box experiment, we used 7 different performance measures (PMs). [sent-54, score-0.379]
</p><p>30 These were behavioural statistics, calculated for each daily session: number of trials (within 500 sec), number of ITI pokes, mean response time (after light onset), mean nose poke duration, number of uneaten food pellets, ”TimePreference”1 , and ”DurationPreference”2 . [sent-55, score-0.738]
</p><p>31 Different PMs reﬂected different aspects of behaviour - learning to respond, associating responses with light, overcoming anxiety to make sufﬁciently long nose pokes, etc. [sent-56, score-0.535]
</p><p>32 In some cases, performing a principal component analysis (PCA) or similar tools may be suitable for reducing the behavioural measures to few main components that could be easily interpreted [16]. [sent-63, score-0.117]
</p><p>33 Conceptually, the model had 4 states: [ITI, trial] x [animal outside, making a nose poke], and 2 actions: move (in or out) and stay. [sent-67, score-0.142]
</p><p>34 Secondly, we observed that when our animals made too short trial responses (with nose poke duration under 0. [sent-70, score-0.448]

</p><p>36 5 sec, animals nearly always managed to pick up the delivered food immediately. [sent-73, score-0.278]
</p><p>37 To account for this, the state making a nose poke was divided into 5 states, representing different nose poke durations, with the increasing probability of picking up the reward (to keep things simple, we chose a linear increase: from p = 0. [sent-74, score-0.699]
</p><p>38 Note that a food pellet is delivered at the start of each trial response, irrespectively of whether the animal picks it up during that nose poke or not. [sent-77, score-0.797]

</p><p>41 High γ values (close to 1) signiﬁed that future rewards were given high weight, while low γ values (0-0. [sent-83, score-0.134]

</p><p>43 To evaluate whether our model is sufﬁciently ﬂexible to ﬁt a wide range of animal behaviours (including effects of stress, strain, and noradrenaline), we performed an estimation procedure of daily meta-parameters. [sent-90, score-0.494]
</p><p>44 Even if our RL model with estimated meta-parameters is capable of reproducing behaviour of different experimental groups in the hole-box, this does not tell us how, given a new animal in an arbitrary experimental condition, we should set daily meta-parameters to predict its behaviour. [sent-99, score-0.695]
</p><p>45 Its target outputs were the daily estimated meta-parameter sets, and after normalizing inputs and targets to zero mean and unit variance, the network was trained (100 times) using the Levenberg-Marquardt method [18]. [sent-104, score-0.206]
</p><p>46 Using 10 trained networks with lowest MSEs, we performed simulations to analyze how much different input factors affect each meta-parameter. [sent-106, score-0.17]
</p><p>47 Finally, to predict the performance of selected animals and the differences between experimental groups, we simulated the NN with input values of each animal and analyzed the resulting meta-parameters. [sent-110, score-0.417]

</p><p>53 During the process of learning, estimated exploitation-exploration factors β and future reward discount factors γ showed progressive increase (Figure 4a,b; regression p < 0. [sent-132, score-0.544]
</p><p>54 In addition, extrinsic stress increases exploitation factors β for calm C57BL/6 mice (ANOVA p < 0. [sent-134, score-1.131]
</p><p>55 Reward discount factors γ were higher for C57BL/6 mice (Figure 4b, ANOVA p < 0. [sent-136, score-0.664]
</p><p>56 Dynamics of the learning rates and effects of stress on future reward discounting showed certain trends, however, for these daily estimated values they were not signiﬁcant. [sent-138, score-0.793]
</p><p>57 For the pharmacological manipulations, two results were signiﬁcant (Figure 4c): a decrease in noradrenaline led to reduced exploitation factors for the anxious DBA/2 mice (ANOVA p < 0. [sent-139, score-1.087]
</p><p>58 001), and to increased reward discount factors for C57BL/6 mice (on day 3, t-test p < 0. [sent-140, score-0.825]
</p><p>59 01), suggesting that decreasing NA levels counteracts anxiety and impulsivity. [sent-141, score-0.267]
</p><p>60 A problem of daily estimated meta-parameters is their excessive ﬂexibility, allowing them to follow everyday ups and downs of individual animal behaviour, many of which happen because of factors unknown to the experimenter. [sent-142, score-0.543]
</p><p>61 This ”noise” often makes it difﬁcult to see the effects that known factors (such as stress and strain) have on meta-parameter dynamics. [sent-143, score-0.555]
</p><p>62 Results of the trained NN model for prediction of daily meta-parameters indicated that only about 25% of their variation could be explained. [sent-144, score-0.213]
</p><p>63 However, the resulting meta-parameter averages for experimental groups indicated a very good ﬁt with estimated daily meta-parameters (Figure 3c). [sent-145, score-0.25]

</p><p>71 Future reward discounting is mainly affected by received rewards, while for exploitation factors misses also have a signiﬁcant effect, supporting an observation that well trained animals (who receive many rewards and make few misses) decrease their effort to perform quickly and accurately (Fig. [sent-164, score-0.771]
</p><p>72 While all meta-parameter effects observed when comparing daily estimated values are reproduced, excluding unpredicted variability makes some additional effects statistically signiﬁcant. [sent-169, score-0.321]
</p><p>73 For instance, it is evident (Figure 6a) that extrinsic stress decreases future reward discount factors for the DBA/2 mice (ANOVA p < 0. [sent-170, score-1.219]
</p><p>74 01) and that the learning rates slightly decrease with learning, particularly for the C57BL/6 mice (regression p < 0. [sent-171, score-0.427]
</p><p>75 The effects of the pharmacological manipulations of the noradrenergic system have been ”denoised” as well, and several additional effects become evident (Figure 6b). [sent-173, score-0.465]
</p><p>76 For C57BL/6 mice, stress plays an important role in modulating effects of NA: non-stressed mice increase their exploitation upon increased NA level (ANOVA p < 0. [sent-174, score-0.987]
</p><p>77 Stressed mice do not show signiﬁcant changes in exploitation factors. [sent-176, score-0.57]
</p><p>78 For DBA/2 mice, stimulating noradrenergic function does not lead to higher exploitation factors (similarly to stressed C57BL/6 mice), but their future reward discounting is sensitive to NA changes - the lower NA, the higher their γ values (ANOVA, p < 0. [sent-177, score-0.668]
</p><p>79 Effects of noradrenergic manipulations (on days 3, 6, and 8). [sent-184, score-0.237]
</p><p>80 7  Discussion  In this paper, we demonstrated that a simple RL model, whose parameters are controlled by a neural network that uses the information about various modulatory inﬂuences, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the hole-box conditioning task. [sent-185, score-0.412]
</p><p>81 Compared to the conventional performance measures, the resulting meta-parameters of our model showed more pronounced effects between experimental groups and they have the additional advantage of being easier to relate to cognitive processes. [sent-186, score-0.187]
</p><p>82 Moreover, the results of pharmacological manipulations provided supporting evidence that RL meta-parameters are indeed related to neuromodulators such as noradrenaline. [sent-187, score-0.173]
</p><p>83 The progressive increase of exploitation factors β and the decrease of learning rates α are consistent with how the meta-parameters of artiﬁcial agents should presumably be controlled to achieve optimal performance [14]. [sent-188, score-0.281]
</p><p>84 The increase in reward discount factors γ may have fundamental reasons too, e. [sent-189, score-0.368]
</p><p>85 when exposed to a new environment, hungry animals may become anxious about the uncertainty in the situation (whether they will be able to ﬁnd food to survive), which makes them prefer immediate rewards to delayed ones. [sent-191, score-0.505]
</p><p>86 However, it may also be related to the speciﬁc reward structure in the model. [sent-192, score-0.131]
</p><p>87 In addition, to avoid making unnecessary ITI pokes (given that food is usually picked up during the trial response) γ values close to 1. [sent-195, score-0.294]
</p><p>88 when the mice start making sufﬁciently long nose pokes, and when, if at all, they learn to avoid making ITI pokes) could determine (or be determined by) the prevailing dynamics of γ-s. [sent-199, score-0.595]
</p><p>89 Our speciﬁc results provide insights into biological mechanisms of stress, anxiety, behavioural performance, and how they relate to formal RL quantities. [sent-200, score-0.147]
</p><p>90 Stress increased performance accuracy (β factors) for the calm C57BL/6 mice, but not for the anxious DBA/2 mice. [sent-201, score-0.189]
</p><p>91 Similarly, increasing noradrenaline levels had a positive effect on β-s only for the non-stressed C57BL/6 mice, but not for 7  the other groups, while decreasing NA levels had the strongest negative effect on β-s for the anxious DBA/2 mice. [sent-202, score-0.376]
</p><p>92 Outside this range, NA effects get saturated or may even get reversed, as suggested by the inverse-U-shaped-relation theory of arousal/stress effects on cognition [4]. [sent-204, score-0.178]
</p><p>93 The effects of stress, strain, and NA on future reward discounting indicate that stress, high anxiety, and elevated noradrenaline are all detrimental for learning delayed future rewards. [sent-205, score-0.618]
</p><p>94 However, since the effects of NA and stress on reward discount factors are more pronounced for DBA/2 mice, γ-s might be sensitive to noradrenaline at higher levels than β-s are. [sent-206, score-1.005]
</p><p>95 It is also likely that serotonin, mPFC, and other brain systems often implicated in processing of delayed rewards [15, 19] may be interacting with stress and NA in controlling future reward discounting. [sent-207, score-0.66]
</p><p>96 Although the basis of our hole-box behavioural prediction is a simple RL model with discrete states and actions, it is not obvious that such a model could predict animal behaviour in other signiﬁcantly more complex tasks. [sent-208, score-0.57]
</p><p>97 ), a RL-like module is likely to be central to their performance, and a similar approach could be applied for controlling its meta-parameters based on numerous modulatory inﬂuences. [sent-210, score-0.114]
</p><p>98 Further studies relating such meta-parameters to other neuromodulatory systems and activation patterns of speciﬁc brain areas could provide interesting insights and may prove to be an ultimate test-box for the biological relevance of such an approach. [sent-211, score-0.108]

<p>Author: Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner, Gediminas Lukšys</p><p>Abstract: Suppose we train an animal in a conditioning experiment. Can one predict how a given animal, under given experimental conditions, would perform the task? Since various factors such as stress, motivation, genetic background, and previous errors in task performance can inﬂuence animal behaviour, this appears to be a very challenging aim. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been successful in modeling animal (and human) behaviour, but their success has been limited because of uncertainty as to how to set meta-parameters (such as learning rate, exploitation-exploration balance and future reward discount factor) that strongly inﬂuence model performance. We show that a simple RL model whose metaparameters are controlled by an artiﬁcial neural network, fed with inputs such as stress, affective phenotype, previous task performance, and even neuromodulatory manipulations, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the ”hole-box” - a simple conditioning task. Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. 1</p><p>2 0.1257761 <a title="222-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2008-Biasing_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_with_a_Lower_Discount_Factor.html">37 nips-2008-Biasing Approximate Dynamic Programming with a Lower Discount Factor</a></p>
<p>Author: Marek Petrik, Bruno Scherrer</p><p>Abstract: Most algorithms for solving Markov decision processes rely on a discount factor, which ensures their convergence. It is generally assumed that using an artiﬁcially low discount factor will improve the convergence rate, while sacriﬁcing the solution quality. We however demonstrate that using an artiﬁcially low discount factor may signiﬁcantly improve the solution quality, when used in approximate dynamic programming. We propose two explanations of this phenomenon. The ﬁrst justiﬁcation follows directly from the standard approximation error bounds: using a lower discount factor may decrease the approximation error bounds. However, we also show that these bounds are loose, thus their decrease does not entirely justify the improved solution quality. We thus propose another justiﬁcation: when the rewards are received only sporadically (as in the case of Tetris), we can derive tighter bounds, which support a signiﬁcant improvement in the solution quality with a decreased discount factor. 1</p><p>3 0.10319617 <a title="222-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Structure_Learning_in_Human_Sequential_Decision-Making.html">223 nips-2008-Structure Learning in Human Sequential Decision-Making</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Acuna, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: We use graphical models and structure learning to explore how people learn policies in sequential decision making tasks. Studies of sequential decision-making in humans frequently ﬁnd suboptimal performance relative to an ideal actor that knows the graph model that generates reward in the environment. We argue that the learning problem humans face also involves learning the graph structure for reward generation in the environment. We formulate the structure learning problem using mixtures of reward models, and solve the optimal action selection problem using Bayesian Reinforcement Learning. We show that structure learning in one and two armed bandit problems produces many of the qualitative behaviors deemed suboptimal in previous studies. Our argument is supported by the results of experiments that demonstrate humans rapidly learn and exploit new reward structure. 1</p><p>4 0.089666449 <a title="222-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_asymptotic_equivalence_between_differential_Hebbian_and_temporal_difference_learning_using_a_local_third_factor.html">166 nips-2008-On the asymptotic equivalence between differential Hebbian and temporal difference learning using a local third factor</a></p>

<p>Author: Quentin J. Huys, Joshua Vogelstein, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Decision making lies at the very heart of many psychiatric diseases. It is also a central theoretical concern in a wide variety of ﬁelds and has undergone detailed, in-depth, analyses. We take as an example Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), applying insights from a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework. We focus on anhedonia and helplessness. Helplessness—a core element in the conceptualizations of MDD that has lead to major advances in its treatment, pharmacological and neurobiological understanding—is formalized as a simple prior over the outcome entropy of actions in uncertain environments. Anhedonia, which is an equally fundamental aspect of the disease, is related to the effective reward size. These formulations allow for the design of speciﬁc tasks to measure anhedonia and helplessness behaviorally. We show that these behavioral measures capture explicit, questionnaire-based cognitions. We also provide evidence that these tasks may allow classiﬁcation of subjects into healthy and MDD groups based purely on a behavioural measure and avoiding any verbal reports. There are strong ties between decision making and psychiatry, with maladaptive decisions and behaviors being very prominent in people with psychiatric disorders. Depression is classically seen as following life events such as divorces and job losses. Longitudinal studies, however, have revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of the stressors associated with depression do in fact follow MDD onset, and that they are likely due to maladaptive behaviors prominent in MDD (Kendler et al., 1999). Clinically effective ’talking’ therapies for MDD such as cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies (DeRubeis et al., 1999; Bortolotti et al., 2008; Gotlib and Hammen, 2002; Power, 2005) explicitly concentrate on altering patients’ maladaptive behaviors and decision making processes. Decision making is a promising avenue into psychiatry for at least two more reasons. First, it offers powerful analytical tools. Control problems related to decision making are prevalent in a huge diversity of ﬁelds, ranging from ecology to economics, computer science and engineering. These ﬁelds have produced well-founded and thoroughly characterized frameworks within which many issues in decision making can be framed. Here, we will focus on framing issues identiﬁed in psychiatric settings within a normative decision making framework. Its second major strength comes from its relationship to neurobiology, and particularly those neuromodulatory systems which are powerfully affected by all major clinically effective pharmacotherapies in psychiatry. The understanding of these systems has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from theoretical accounts of optimal control such as reinforcement learning (Montague et al., 1996; Kapur and Remington, 1996; Smith et al., 1999; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Dayan and Yu, 2006). Such accounts may be useful to identify in more speciﬁc terms the roles of the neuromodulators in psychiatry (Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008; Dayan and Huys, 2008). ∗ qhuys@cantab.net, joshuav@jhu.edu, dayan@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk; www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/∼qhuys/pub.html 1 Master Yoked Control Figure 1: The learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. Three sets of rats are used in a sequence of two tasks. In the ﬁrst task, rats are exposed to escapable or inescapable shocks. Shocks come on at random times. The master rat is given escapable shocks: it can switch off the shock by performing an action, usually turning a wheel mounted in front of it. The yoked rat is exposed to precisely the same shocks as the master rat, i.e its shocks are terminated when the master rat terminates the shock. Thus its shocks are inescapable, there is nothing it can do itself to terminate them. A third set of rats is not exposed to shocks. Then, all three sets of rats are exposed to a shuttlebox escape task. Shocks again come on at random times, and rats have to shuttle to the other side of the box to terminate the shock. Only yoked rats fail to acquire the escape response. Yoked rats generally fail to acquire a wide variety of instrumental behaviours, either determined by reward or, as here, by punishment contingencies. This paper represents an initial attempt at validating this approach experimentally. We will frame core notions of MDD in a reinforcement learning framework and use it to design behavioral decision making experiments. More speciﬁcally, we will concentrate on two concepts central to current thinking about MDD: anhedonia and learned helplessness (LH, Maier and Seligman 1976; Maier and Watkins 2005). We formulate helplessness parametrically as prior beliefs on aspects of decision trees, and anhedonia as the effective reward size. This allows us to use choice behavior to infer the degree to which subjects’ behavioral choices are characterized by either of these. For validation, we correlate the parameters inferred from subjects’ behavior with standard, questionnaire-based measures of hopelessness and anhedonia, and ﬁnally use the inferred parameters alone to attempt to recover the diagnostic classiﬁcation. 1 Core concepts: helplessness and anhedonia The basic LH paradigm is explained in ﬁgure 1. Its importance is manifold: the effect of inescapable shock on subsequent learning is sensitive to most classes of clinically effective antidepressants; it has arguably been a motivation framework for the development of the main talking therapies for depression (cognitive behavioural therapy, Williams (1992), it has motivated the development of further, yet more speciﬁc animal models (Willner, 1997), and it has been the basis of very speciﬁc research into the cognitive basis of depression (Peterson et al., 1993). Behavioral control is the central concept in LH: yoked and master rat do not differ in terms of the amount of shock (stress) they have experienced, only in terms of the behavioural control over it. It is not a standard notion in reinforcement learning, and there are several ways one could translate the concept into RL terms. At a simple level, there is intuitively more behavioural control if, when repeating one action, the same outcome occurs again and again, than if this were not true. Thus, at a very ﬁrst level, control might be related to the outcome entropy of actions (see Maier and Seligman 1976 for an early formulation). Of course, this is too simple. If all available actions deterministically led to the same outcome, the agent has very little control. Finally, if one were able to achieve all outcomes except for the one one cares about (in the rats’ case switching off or avoiding the shock), we would again not say that there is much control (see Huys (2007); Huys and Dayan (2007) for a more detailed discussion). Despite its obvious limitations, we will here concentrate on the simplest notion for reasons of mathematical expediency. 2 0.6 0.5 Exploration vs Exploitation Predictive Distributions Q(aknown)−Q(aunknown) P(reward a known ) 0.7 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 0.4 0.3 0.2 Choose blue slot machine 0.5 0 −0.5 0.1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 Reward −1 Choose orange slot machine 1 High control Low control 2 3 4 5 Tree depth Figure 2: Effect of γ on predictions, Q-values and exploration behaviour. Assume a slot machine (blue) has been chosen ﬁve times, with possible rewards 1-5, and that reward 2 has been obtained twice, and reward 4 three times (inset in left panel). Left: Predictive distribution for a prior with negative γ (low control) in light gray, and large γ (extensive control) in dark gray. We see that, if the agent believes he has much control (and outcome distributions have low entropy), the predictive distribution puts all mass on the observations. Right: Assume now the agent gets up to 5 more pulls (tree depth 1-5) between the blue slot machine and a new, orange slot machine. The orange slot machine’s predictive distribution is ﬂat as it has never been tried, and its expected value is therefore 3. The plot shows the difference between the values for the two slot machines. First consider the agent only has one more pull to take. In this case, independently of the priors about control, the agent will choose the blue machine, because it is just slightly better than average. Note though that the difference is more pronounced if the agent has a high control prior. But things change if the agent has two or more choices. Now, it is worth trying out the new machine if the agent has a high-control prior. For in that case, if the new machine turns out to yield a large reward on the ﬁrst try, it is likely to do so again for the second and subsequent times. Thus, the prior about control determines the exploration bonus. The second central concept in current conceptions of MDD is that of reward sensitivity. Anhedonia, an inability to enjoy previously enjoyable things, is one of two symptoms necessary for the diagnosis of depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A number of tasks in the literature have attempted to measure reward sensitivity behaviourally. While these generally concur in ﬁnding decreased reward sensitivity in subjects with MDD, these results need further clariﬁcation. Some studies show interactions between reward and punishment sensitivities with respect to MDD, but important aspects of the tasks are not clearly understood. For instance, Henriques et al. (1994); Henriques and Davidson (2000) show decreased resonsiveness of MDD subjects to rewards, but equally show decreased resonsiveness of healthy subjects to punishments. Pizzagalli et al. (2005) introduced an asymmetrically rewarded perceptual discrimination task and show that the rate of change of the response bias is anticorrelated with subjects’ anhedonic symptoms. Exactly how decreased reward responsivity can account for this is at pressent not clear. Great care has to be taken to disentangle these two concepts. Anhedonia and helplessness both provide good reasons for not taking an action: either because the reinforcements associated with the action are insufﬁcient (anhedonia), or because the outcome is not judged a likely result of taking some particular action (if actions are thought to have large outcome entropy). 2 A Bayesian formulation of control We consider a scenario where subjects have no knowledge of the outcome distributions of actions, but rather learn about them. This means that their prior beliefs about the outcome distributions are not overwhelmed by the likelihood of observations, and may thus have measurable effects on their action choices. In terms of RL, this means that agents do not know the decision tree of the problem they face. Control is formulated as a prior distribution on the outcome distributions, and thereby as a prior distribution on the decision trees. The concentration parameter α of a Dirichlet process can very simply parametrise entropy, and, if used as a prior, allow for very efﬁcient updates of the predictive distributions of actions. Let us assume we have actions A which have as outcomes rewards R, and keep count Nt (r, a) = 3 k:k < 0. Here, we included a regressor for the AGE as that was a confounding variable in our subject sample. Furthermore, if it is true that anhedonia, as expressed by the questionnaire, relates to reward sensitivity speciﬁcally, we should be able to write a similar regression for the learning rate ǫ (from equation 5) ǫ(BDIa, AGE) = θǫ BDIa + cǫ AGE + ζǫ but ﬁnd that θǫ is not different from zero. Figure 4 shows the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations) and conﬁrms that people who express higher levels of anhedonia do indeed show less reward sensitivity, but do not differ in terms of learning rate. If it were the case that subjects with higher BDIa score were just less attentive to the task, one might also expect an effect of BDIa on learning rate. 3.2 Control Validation: The control task is new, and we ﬁrst need to ascertain that subjects were indeed sensitive to main features of the task. We thus ﬁt both a RW-learning rule (as in the previous section, but adjusted for the varying number of available actions), and the full control model. Importantly, both these models have two parameters, but only the full control model has a notion of outcome entropy, and evaluations a tree. The chance probability of subjects’ actions was 0.37, meaning that, on average, there were just under three machines on the screen. The probability of the actions under the RW-learning rule was better at 0.48, and that of the full control model 0.54. These differences are highly signiﬁcant as the total number of choices is 29600. Thus, we conclude that subjects were indeed sensitive to the manipulation of outcome entropy, and that they did look ahead in a tree. Prior belief about control: Applying the procedure from the previous task to the main task, we write the main parameters of equations 2 and 4 as functions of the questionnaire measures and infer linear parameters: γ1 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ1 BHS + θγ1 BDIa + cγ1 AGE + ζγ1 γ2 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ2 BHS + θγ2 BDIa + cγ2 AGE + ζγ2 β(BDIa, BHS, age) = χβ BHS + θβ BDIa + cβ AGE + ζβ Importantly, because the BDIa scores and the BHS scores are correlated in our sample (they tend to be large for the subjects with MDD), we include the cross-terms (θγ1 , θγ2 , χγ ), as we are interested in the speciﬁc effects of BDIa on β, as before, and of BHS on γ. 6 3 control γ 2 Figure 6: Classiﬁcation. Controls are shown as black dots, and depressed subjects as red crosses. The blue line is a linear classiﬁer. Thus, the patients and controls can be approximately classiﬁed purely on the basis of behaviour. 1 0 83% correct 69% sensitivity 94% specificity −1 −2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 reward sensitivity β We here infer and display two separate values γ1 and γ2 . These correspond to the level of control in the ﬁrst and the second half of the experiment. In fact, to parallel the LH experiments better, the slot machines in the ﬁrst 50 rooms were actually very noisy (low true γ), which means that subjects were here exposed to low levels of control just like the yoked rats in the original experiment. In the second half of the experiment on the other hand, slot machines tended to be quite reliable (high true γ). Figure 5 shows again the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations). Again, we ﬁnd that our parameter estimate are very signiﬁcantly different from zero (> three standard deviations). The effect of the BHS score on the prior beliefs about control γ is much stronger in the second half than of the experiment in the ﬁrst half, i.e. the effect of BHS on the prior belief about control is particularly prominent when subjects are in a high-control environment and have previously been exposed to a low-control environment. This is an interesting parallel to the learned helplessness experiments in animals. 3.3 Classiﬁcation Finally we combine the two tasks. We integrate out the learning rate ǫ, which we had found not be related to the questionnaire measures (c.f. ﬁgure 4), and use the distribution over β from the ﬁrst task as a prior distribution on β for the second task. We also put weak priors on γ and infer both β and γ for the second task on a subject-by-subject basis. Figure 6 shows the posterior values for γ and β for MDD and healthy subjects and the ability of a linear classiﬁer to classify them. 4 Discussion In this paper, we have attempted to provide a speciﬁc formulation of core psychiatric concepts in reinforcement learning terms, i.e. hopelessness as a prior belief about controllability, and anhedonia as reward sensitivity. We have brieﬂy explained how we expect these formulations to have effect in a behavioural situation, have presented a behavioral task explicitly designed to be sensitive to our formulations, and shown that people’s verbal expression of hopelessness and anhedonia do have speciﬁc behavioral impacts. Subjects who express anhedonia display insensitivity to rewards and those expressing hopelessness behave as if they had prior beliefs that outcome distributions of actions (slot machines) are very broad. Finally, we have shown that these purely behavioural measures are also predictive of their psychiatric status, in that we were able to classify patients and healthy controls purely on the basis of performance. Several aspects of this work are novel. There have been previous attempts to map aspects of psychiatric dysfunction onto speciﬁc parametrizations (Cohen et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008), but we believe that our work represents the ﬁrst attempt to a) apply it to MDD; b) make formal predictions about subject behavior c) present strong evidence linking anhedonia speciﬁcally to reward insensitivity across two tasks d) combine tasks to tease helplessness and anhedonia apart and e) to use the behavioral inferences for classiﬁcation. The latter point is particularly important, as it will determine any potential clinical signiﬁcance (Veiel, 1997). In the future, rather than cross-validating with respect to say DSM-IV criteria, it may also be important to validate measures such as ours in their own right in longitudinal studies. 7 Several important caveats do remain. First, the populations are not fully matched for age. We included age as an additional regressor and found all results to be robust. Secondly, only the healthy subjects were remunerated. However, repeating the analyses presented using only the MDD subjects yields the same results (data not shown). Thirdly, we have not yet fully mirrored the LH experiments. We have so far only tested the transfer from a low-control environment to a high-control environment. To make statements like those in animal learned helplessness experiments, the transfer from high-control to low-control environments will need to be examined, too. Fourth, the notion of control we have used is very simple, and more complex notions should certainly be tested (see Dayan and Huys 2008). Fifth, and maybe most importantly, we have so far only attempted to classify MDD and healthy subjects, and can thus not yet make any statements about the speciﬁcity of these effects with respect to MDD. Finally, it will be important to replicate these results independently, and possibly in a different modality. Nevertheless, we believe these results to be very encouraging.

<p>Author: Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner, Gediminas Lukšys</p><p>Abstract: Suppose we train an animal in a conditioning experiment. Can one predict how a given animal, under given experimental conditions, would perform the task? Since various factors such as stress, motivation, genetic background, and previous errors in task performance can inﬂuence animal behaviour, this appears to be a very challenging aim. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been successful in modeling animal (and human) behaviour, but their success has been limited because of uncertainty as to how to set meta-parameters (such as learning rate, exploitation-exploration balance and future reward discount factor) that strongly inﬂuence model performance. We show that a simple RL model whose metaparameters are controlled by an artiﬁcial neural network, fed with inputs such as stress, affective phenotype, previous task performance, and even neuromodulatory manipulations, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the ”hole-box” - a simple conditioning task. Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. 1</p><p>2 0.75610054 <a title="222-lsi-2" href="./nips-2008-Psychiatry%3A_Insights_into_depression_through_normative_decision-making_models.html">187 nips-2008-Psychiatry: Insights into depression through normative decision-making models</a></p>
<p>Author: Quentin J. Huys, Joshua Vogelstein, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Decision making lies at the very heart of many psychiatric diseases. It is also a central theoretical concern in a wide variety of ﬁelds and has undergone detailed, in-depth, analyses. We take as an example Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), applying insights from a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework. We focus on anhedonia and helplessness. Helplessness—a core element in the conceptualizations of MDD that has lead to major advances in its treatment, pharmacological and neurobiological understanding—is formalized as a simple prior over the outcome entropy of actions in uncertain environments. Anhedonia, which is an equally fundamental aspect of the disease, is related to the effective reward size. These formulations allow for the design of speciﬁc tasks to measure anhedonia and helplessness behaviorally. We show that these behavioral measures capture explicit, questionnaire-based cognitions. We also provide evidence that these tasks may allow classiﬁcation of subjects into healthy and MDD groups based purely on a behavioural measure and avoiding any verbal reports. There are strong ties between decision making and psychiatry, with maladaptive decisions and behaviors being very prominent in people with psychiatric disorders. Depression is classically seen as following life events such as divorces and job losses. Longitudinal studies, however, have revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of the stressors associated with depression do in fact follow MDD onset, and that they are likely due to maladaptive behaviors prominent in MDD (Kendler et al., 1999). Clinically effective ’talking’ therapies for MDD such as cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies (DeRubeis et al., 1999; Bortolotti et al., 2008; Gotlib and Hammen, 2002; Power, 2005) explicitly concentrate on altering patients’ maladaptive behaviors and decision making processes. Decision making is a promising avenue into psychiatry for at least two more reasons. First, it offers powerful analytical tools. Control problems related to decision making are prevalent in a huge diversity of ﬁelds, ranging from ecology to economics, computer science and engineering. These ﬁelds have produced well-founded and thoroughly characterized frameworks within which many issues in decision making can be framed. Here, we will focus on framing issues identiﬁed in psychiatric settings within a normative decision making framework. Its second major strength comes from its relationship to neurobiology, and particularly those neuromodulatory systems which are powerfully affected by all major clinically effective pharmacotherapies in psychiatry. The understanding of these systems has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from theoretical accounts of optimal control such as reinforcement learning (Montague et al., 1996; Kapur and Remington, 1996; Smith et al., 1999; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Dayan and Yu, 2006). Such accounts may be useful to identify in more speciﬁc terms the roles of the neuromodulators in psychiatry (Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008; Dayan and Huys, 2008). ∗ qhuys@cantab.net, joshuav@jhu.edu, dayan@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk; www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/∼qhuys/pub.html 1 Master Yoked Control Figure 1: The learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. Three sets of rats are used in a sequence of two tasks. In the ﬁrst task, rats are exposed to escapable or inescapable shocks. Shocks come on at random times. The master rat is given escapable shocks: it can switch off the shock by performing an action, usually turning a wheel mounted in front of it. The yoked rat is exposed to precisely the same shocks as the master rat, i.e its shocks are terminated when the master rat terminates the shock. Thus its shocks are inescapable, there is nothing it can do itself to terminate them. A third set of rats is not exposed to shocks. Then, all three sets of rats are exposed to a shuttlebox escape task. Shocks again come on at random times, and rats have to shuttle to the other side of the box to terminate the shock. Only yoked rats fail to acquire the escape response. Yoked rats generally fail to acquire a wide variety of instrumental behaviours, either determined by reward or, as here, by punishment contingencies. This paper represents an initial attempt at validating this approach experimentally. We will frame core notions of MDD in a reinforcement learning framework and use it to design behavioral decision making experiments. More speciﬁcally, we will concentrate on two concepts central to current thinking about MDD: anhedonia and learned helplessness (LH, Maier and Seligman 1976; Maier and Watkins 2005). We formulate helplessness parametrically as prior beliefs on aspects of decision trees, and anhedonia as the effective reward size. This allows us to use choice behavior to infer the degree to which subjects’ behavioral choices are characterized by either of these. For validation, we correlate the parameters inferred from subjects’ behavior with standard, questionnaire-based measures of hopelessness and anhedonia, and ﬁnally use the inferred parameters alone to attempt to recover the diagnostic classiﬁcation. 1 Core concepts: helplessness and anhedonia The basic LH paradigm is explained in ﬁgure 1. Its importance is manifold: the effect of inescapable shock on subsequent learning is sensitive to most classes of clinically effective antidepressants; it has arguably been a motivation framework for the development of the main talking therapies for depression (cognitive behavioural therapy, Williams (1992), it has motivated the development of further, yet more speciﬁc animal models (Willner, 1997), and it has been the basis of very speciﬁc research into the cognitive basis of depression (Peterson et al., 1993). Behavioral control is the central concept in LH: yoked and master rat do not differ in terms of the amount of shock (stress) they have experienced, only in terms of the behavioural control over it. It is not a standard notion in reinforcement learning, and there are several ways one could translate the concept into RL terms. At a simple level, there is intuitively more behavioural control if, when repeating one action, the same outcome occurs again and again, than if this were not true. Thus, at a very ﬁrst level, control might be related to the outcome entropy of actions (see Maier and Seligman 1976 for an early formulation). Of course, this is too simple. If all available actions deterministically led to the same outcome, the agent has very little control. Finally, if one were able to achieve all outcomes except for the one one cares about (in the rats’ case switching off or avoiding the shock), we would again not say that there is much control (see Huys (2007); Huys and Dayan (2007) for a more detailed discussion). Despite its obvious limitations, we will here concentrate on the simplest notion for reasons of mathematical expediency. 2 0.6 0.5 Exploration vs Exploitation Predictive Distributions Q(aknown)−Q(aunknown) P(reward a known ) 0.7 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 0.4 0.3 0.2 Choose blue slot machine 0.5 0 −0.5 0.1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 Reward −1 Choose orange slot machine 1 High control Low control 2 3 4 5 Tree depth Figure 2: Effect of γ on predictions, Q-values and exploration behaviour. Assume a slot machine (blue) has been chosen ﬁve times, with possible rewards 1-5, and that reward 2 has been obtained twice, and reward 4 three times (inset in left panel). Left: Predictive distribution for a prior with negative γ (low control) in light gray, and large γ (extensive control) in dark gray. We see that, if the agent believes he has much control (and outcome distributions have low entropy), the predictive distribution puts all mass on the observations. Right: Assume now the agent gets up to 5 more pulls (tree depth 1-5) between the blue slot machine and a new, orange slot machine. The orange slot machine’s predictive distribution is ﬂat as it has never been tried, and its expected value is therefore 3. The plot shows the difference between the values for the two slot machines. First consider the agent only has one more pull to take. In this case, independently of the priors about control, the agent will choose the blue machine, because it is just slightly better than average. Note though that the difference is more pronounced if the agent has a high control prior. But things change if the agent has two or more choices. Now, it is worth trying out the new machine if the agent has a high-control prior. For in that case, if the new machine turns out to yield a large reward on the ﬁrst try, it is likely to do so again for the second and subsequent times. Thus, the prior about control determines the exploration bonus. The second central concept in current conceptions of MDD is that of reward sensitivity. Anhedonia, an inability to enjoy previously enjoyable things, is one of two symptoms necessary for the diagnosis of depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A number of tasks in the literature have attempted to measure reward sensitivity behaviourally. While these generally concur in ﬁnding decreased reward sensitivity in subjects with MDD, these results need further clariﬁcation. Some studies show interactions between reward and punishment sensitivities with respect to MDD, but important aspects of the tasks are not clearly understood. For instance, Henriques et al. (1994); Henriques and Davidson (2000) show decreased resonsiveness of MDD subjects to rewards, but equally show decreased resonsiveness of healthy subjects to punishments. Pizzagalli et al. (2005) introduced an asymmetrically rewarded perceptual discrimination task and show that the rate of change of the response bias is anticorrelated with subjects’ anhedonic symptoms. Exactly how decreased reward responsivity can account for this is at pressent not clear. Great care has to be taken to disentangle these two concepts. Anhedonia and helplessness both provide good reasons for not taking an action: either because the reinforcements associated with the action are insufﬁcient (anhedonia), or because the outcome is not judged a likely result of taking some particular action (if actions are thought to have large outcome entropy). 2 A Bayesian formulation of control We consider a scenario where subjects have no knowledge of the outcome distributions of actions, but rather learn about them. This means that their prior beliefs about the outcome distributions are not overwhelmed by the likelihood of observations, and may thus have measurable effects on their action choices. In terms of RL, this means that agents do not know the decision tree of the problem they face. Control is formulated as a prior distribution on the outcome distributions, and thereby as a prior distribution on the decision trees. The concentration parameter α of a Dirichlet process can very simply parametrise entropy, and, if used as a prior, allow for very efﬁcient updates of the predictive distributions of actions. Let us assume we have actions A which have as outcomes rewards R, and keep count Nt (r, a) = 3 k:k < 0. Here, we included a regressor for the AGE as that was a confounding variable in our subject sample. Furthermore, if it is true that anhedonia, as expressed by the questionnaire, relates to reward sensitivity speciﬁcally, we should be able to write a similar regression for the learning rate ǫ (from equation 5) ǫ(BDIa, AGE) = θǫ BDIa + cǫ AGE + ζǫ but ﬁnd that θǫ is not different from zero. Figure 4 shows the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations) and conﬁrms that people who express higher levels of anhedonia do indeed show less reward sensitivity, but do not differ in terms of learning rate. If it were the case that subjects with higher BDIa score were just less attentive to the task, one might also expect an effect of BDIa on learning rate. 3.2 Control Validation: The control task is new, and we ﬁrst need to ascertain that subjects were indeed sensitive to main features of the task. We thus ﬁt both a RW-learning rule (as in the previous section, but adjusted for the varying number of available actions), and the full control model. Importantly, both these models have two parameters, but only the full control model has a notion of outcome entropy, and evaluations a tree. The chance probability of subjects’ actions was 0.37, meaning that, on average, there were just under three machines on the screen. The probability of the actions under the RW-learning rule was better at 0.48, and that of the full control model 0.54. These differences are highly signiﬁcant as the total number of choices is 29600. Thus, we conclude that subjects were indeed sensitive to the manipulation of outcome entropy, and that they did look ahead in a tree. Prior belief about control: Applying the procedure from the previous task to the main task, we write the main parameters of equations 2 and 4 as functions of the questionnaire measures and infer linear parameters: γ1 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ1 BHS + θγ1 BDIa + cγ1 AGE + ζγ1 γ2 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ2 BHS + θγ2 BDIa + cγ2 AGE + ζγ2 β(BDIa, BHS, age) = χβ BHS + θβ BDIa + cβ AGE + ζβ Importantly, because the BDIa scores and the BHS scores are correlated in our sample (they tend to be large for the subjects with MDD), we include the cross-terms (θγ1 , θγ2 , χγ ), as we are interested in the speciﬁc effects of BDIa on β, as before, and of BHS on γ. 6 3 control γ 2 Figure 6: Classiﬁcation. Controls are shown as black dots, and depressed subjects as red crosses. The blue line is a linear classiﬁer. Thus, the patients and controls can be approximately classiﬁed purely on the basis of behaviour. 1 0 83% correct 69% sensitivity 94% specificity −1 −2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 reward sensitivity β We here infer and display two separate values γ1 and γ2 . These correspond to the level of control in the ﬁrst and the second half of the experiment. In fact, to parallel the LH experiments better, the slot machines in the ﬁrst 50 rooms were actually very noisy (low true γ), which means that subjects were here exposed to low levels of control just like the yoked rats in the original experiment. In the second half of the experiment on the other hand, slot machines tended to be quite reliable (high true γ). Figure 5 shows again the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations). Again, we ﬁnd that our parameter estimate are very signiﬁcantly different from zero (> three standard deviations). The effect of the BHS score on the prior beliefs about control γ is much stronger in the second half than of the experiment in the ﬁrst half, i.e. the effect of BHS on the prior belief about control is particularly prominent when subjects are in a high-control environment and have previously been exposed to a low-control environment. This is an interesting parallel to the learned helplessness experiments in animals. 3.3 Classiﬁcation Finally we combine the two tasks. We integrate out the learning rate ǫ, which we had found not be related to the questionnaire measures (c.f. ﬁgure 4), and use the distribution over β from the ﬁrst task as a prior distribution on β for the second task. We also put weak priors on γ and infer both β and γ for the second task on a subject-by-subject basis. Figure 6 shows the posterior values for γ and β for MDD and healthy subjects and the ability of a linear classiﬁer to classify them. 4 Discussion In this paper, we have attempted to provide a speciﬁc formulation of core psychiatric concepts in reinforcement learning terms, i.e. hopelessness as a prior belief about controllability, and anhedonia as reward sensitivity. We have brieﬂy explained how we expect these formulations to have effect in a behavioural situation, have presented a behavioral task explicitly designed to be sensitive to our formulations, and shown that people’s verbal expression of hopelessness and anhedonia do have speciﬁc behavioral impacts. Subjects who express anhedonia display insensitivity to rewards and those expressing hopelessness behave as if they had prior beliefs that outcome distributions of actions (slot machines) are very broad. Finally, we have shown that these purely behavioural measures are also predictive of their psychiatric status, in that we were able to classify patients and healthy controls purely on the basis of performance. Several aspects of this work are novel. There have been previous attempts to map aspects of psychiatric dysfunction onto speciﬁc parametrizations (Cohen et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008), but we believe that our work represents the ﬁrst attempt to a) apply it to MDD; b) make formal predictions about subject behavior c) present strong evidence linking anhedonia speciﬁcally to reward insensitivity across two tasks d) combine tasks to tease helplessness and anhedonia apart and e) to use the behavioral inferences for classiﬁcation. The latter point is particularly important, as it will determine any potential clinical signiﬁcance (Veiel, 1997). In the future, rather than cross-validating with respect to say DSM-IV criteria, it may also be important to validate measures such as ours in their own right in longitudinal studies. 7 Several important caveats do remain. First, the populations are not fully matched for age. We included age as an additional regressor and found all results to be robust. Secondly, only the healthy subjects were remunerated. However, repeating the analyses presented using only the MDD subjects yields the same results (data not shown). Thirdly, we have not yet fully mirrored the LH experiments. We have so far only tested the transfer from a low-control environment to a high-control environment. To make statements like those in animal learned helplessness experiments, the transfer from high-control to low-control environments will need to be examined, too. Fourth, the notion of control we have used is very simple, and more complex notions should certainly be tested (see Dayan and Huys 2008). Fifth, and maybe most importantly, we have so far only attempted to classify MDD and healthy subjects, and can thus not yet make any statements about the speciﬁcity of these effects with respect to MDD. Finally, it will be important to replicate these results independently, and possibly in a different modality. Nevertheless, we believe these results to be very encouraging.

<p>Author: Michael T. Todd, Yael Niv, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Working memory is a central topic of cognitive neuroscience because it is critical for solving real-world problems in which information from multiple temporally distant sources must be combined to generate appropriate behavior. However, an often neglected fact is that learning to use working memory effectively is itself a difficult problem. The Gating framework [14] is a collection of psychological models that show how dopamine can train the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex to form useful working memory representations in certain types of problems. We unite Gating with machine learning theory concerning the general problem of memory-based optimal control [5-6]. We present a normative model that learns, by online temporal difference methods, to use working memory to maximize discounted future reward in partially observable settings. The model successfully solves a benchmark working memory problem, and exhibits limitations similar to those observed in humans. Our purpose is to introduce a concise, normative definition of high level cognitive concepts such as working memory and cognitive control in terms of maximizing discounted future rewards. 1 I n t ro d u c t i o n Working memory is loosely defined in cognitive neuroscience as information that is (1) internally maintained on a temporary or short term basis, and (2) required for tasks in which immediate observations cannot be mapped to correct actions. It is widely assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in maintaining and updating working memory. However, relatively little is known about how PFC develops useful working memory representations for a new task. Furthermore, current work focuses on describing the structure and limitations of working memory, but does not ask why, or in what general class of tasks, is it necessary. Borrowing from the theory of optimal control in partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs), we frame the psychological concept of working memory as an internal state representation, developed and employed to maximize future reward in partially observable environments. We combine computational insights from POMDPs and neurobiologically plausible models from cognitive neuroscience to suggest a simple reinforcement learning (RL) model of working memory function that can be implemented through dopaminergic training of the basal ganglia and PFC. The Gating framework is a series of cognitive neuroscience models developed to explain how dopaminergic RL signals can shape useful working memory representations [1-4]. Computationally this framework models working memory as a collection of past observations, each of which can occasionally be replaced with the current observation, and addresses the problem of learning when to update each memory element versus maintaining it. In the original Gating model [1-2] the PFC contained a unitary working memory representation that was updated whenever a phasic dopamine (DA) burst occurred (e.g., due to unexpected reward or novelty). That model was the first to connect working memory and RL via the temporal difference (TD) model of DA firing [7-8], and thus to suggest how working memory might serve a normative purpose. However, that model had limited computational flexibility due to the unitary nature of the working memory (i.e., a singleobservation memory controlled by a scalar DA signal). More recent work [3-4] has partially repositioned the Gating framework within the Actor/Critic model of mesostriatal RL [9-10], positing memory updating as but another cortical action controlled by the dorsal striatal</p><p>4 0.60419637 <a title="222-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Goal-directed_decision_making_in_prefrontal_cortex%3A_a_computational_framework.html">94 nips-2008-Goal-directed decision making in prefrontal cortex: a computational framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Botvinick, James An</p><p>Abstract: Research in animal learning and behavioral neuroscience has distinguished between two forms of action control: a habit-based form, which relies on stored action values, and a goal-directed form, which forecasts and compares action outcomes based on a model of the environment. While habit-based control has been the subject of extensive computational research, the computational principles underlying goal-directed control in animals have so far received less attention. In the present paper, we advance a computational framework for goal-directed control in animals and humans. We take three empirically motivated points as founding premises: (1) Neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex represent action policies, (2) Neurons in orbitofrontal cortex represent rewards, and (3) Neural computation, across domains, can be appropriately understood as performing structured probabilistic inference. On a purely computational level, the resulting account relates closely to previous work using Bayesian inference to solve Markov decision problems, but extends this work by introducing a new algorithm, which provably converges on optimal plans. On a cognitive and neuroscientific level, the theory provides a unifying framework for several different forms of goal-directed action selection, placing emphasis on a novel form, within which orbitofrontal reward representations directly drive policy selection. 1 G oal- d irect ed act i on cont rol In the study of human and animal behavior, it is a long-standing idea that reward-based decision making may rely on two qualitatively different mechanisms. In habit-based decision making, stimuli elicit reflex-like responses, shaped by past reinforcement [1]. In goal-directed or purposive decision making, on the other hand, actions are selected based on a prospective consideration of possible outcomes and future lines of action [2]. Over the past twenty years or so, the attention of cognitive neuroscientists and computationally minded psychologists has tended to focus on habit-based control, due in large part to interest in potential links between dopaminergic function and temporal-difference algorithms for reinforcement learning. However, a resurgence of interest in purposive action selection is now being driven by innovations in animal behavior research, which have yielded powerful new behavioral assays [3], and revealed specific effects of focal neural damage on goaldirected behavior [4]. In discussing some of the relevant data, Daw, Niv and Dayan [5] recently pointed out the close relationship between purposive decision making, as understood in the behavioral sciences, and model-based methods for the solution of Markov decision problems (MDPs), where action policies are derived from a joint analysis of a transition function (a mapping from states and actions to outcomes) and a reward function (a mapping from states to rewards). Beyond this important insight, little work has yet been done to characterize the computations underlying goal-directed action selection (though see [6, 7]). As discussed below, a great deal of evidence indicates that purposive action selection depends critically on a particular region of the brain, the prefrontal cortex. However, it is currently a critical, and quite open, question what the relevant computations within this part of the brain might be. Of course, the basic computational problem of formulating an optimal policy given a model of an MDP has been extensively studied, and there is no shortage of algorithms one might consider as potentially relevant to prefrontal function (e.g., value iteration, policy iteration, backward induction, linear programming, and others). However, from a cognitive and neuroscientific perspective, there is one approach to solving MDPs that it seems particularly appealing to consider. In particular, several researchers have suggested methods for solving MDPs through probabilistic inference [8-12]. The interest of this idea, in the present context, derives from a recent movement toward framing human and animal information processing, as well as the underlying neural computations, in terms of structured probabilistic inference [13, 14]. Given this perspective, it is inviting to consider whether goal-directed action selection, and the neural mechanisms that underlie it, might be understood in those same terms. One challenge in investigating this possibility is that previous research furnishes no ‘off-theshelf’ algorithm for solving MDPs through probabilistic inference that both provably yields optimal policies and aligns with what is known about action selection in the brain. We endeavor here to start filling in that gap. In the following section, we introduce an account of how goal-directed action selection can be performed based on probabilisitic inference, within a network whose components map grossly onto specific brain structures. As part of this account, we introduce a new algorithm for solving MDPs through Bayesian inference, along with a convergence proof. We then present results from a set of simulations illustrating how the framework would account for a variety of behavioral phenomena that are thought to involve purposive action selection. 2 Co m p u t a t i o n a l m o d el As noted earlier, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) is believed to play a pivotal role in purposive behavior. This is indicated by a broad association between prefrontal lesions and impairments in goal-directed action in both humans (see [15]) and animals [4]. Single-unit recording and other data suggest that different sectors of PFC make distinct contributions. In particular, neurons in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) appear to encode taskspecific mappings from stimuli to responses (e.g., [16]): “task representations,” in the language of psychology, or “policies” in the language of dynamic programming. Although there is some understanding of how policy representations in DLPFC may guide action execution [15], little is yet known about how these representations are themselves selected. Our most basic proposal is that DLPFC policy representations are selected in a prospective, model-based fashion, leveraging information about action-outcome contingencies (i.e., the transition function) and about the incentive value associated with specific outcomes or states (the reward function). There is extensive evidence to suggest that state-reward associations are represented in another area of the PFC, the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) [17, 18]. As for the transition function, although it is clear that the brain contains detailed representations of action-outcome associations [19], their anatomical localization is not yet entirely clear. However, some evidence suggests that the enviromental effects of simple actions may be represented in inferior fronto-parietal cortex [20], and there is also evidence suggesting that medial temporal structures may be important in forecasting action outcomes [21]. As detailed in the next section, our model assumes that policy representations in DLPFC, reward representations in OFC, and representations of states and actions in other brain regions, are coordinated within a network structure that represents their causal or statistical interdependencies, and that policy selection occurs, within this network, through a process of probabilistic inference. 2.1 A rc h i t e c t u re The implementation takes the form of a directed graphical model [22], with the layout shown in Figure 1. Each node represents a discrete random variable. State variables (s), representing the set of m possible world states, serve the role played by parietal and medial temporal cortices in representing action outcomes. Action variables (a) representing the set of available actions, play the role of high-level cortical motor areas involved in the programming of action sequences. Policy variables ( ), each repre-senting the set of all deterministic policies associated with a specific state, capture the representational role of DLPFC. Local and global utility variables, described further Fig 1. Left: Single-step decision. Right: Sequential decision. below, capture the role of OFC in Each time-slice includes a set of m policy nodes. representing incentive value. A separate set of nodes is included for each discrete time-step up to the planning horizon. The conditional probabilities associated with each variable are represented in tabular form. State probabilities are based on the state and action variables in the preceding time-step, and thus encode the transition function. Action probabilities depend on the current state and its associated policy variable. Utilities depend only on the current state. Rather than representing reward magnitude as a continuous variable, we adopt an approach introduced by [23], representing reward through the posterior probability of a binary variable (u). States associated with large positive reward raise p(u) (i.e, p(u=1|s)) near to one; states associated with large negative rewards reduce p(u) to near zero. In the simulations reported below, we used a simple linear transformation to map from scalar reward values to p(u): p (u si ) = 1 R ( si ) +1 , rmax 2 rmax max j R ( s j ) (1) In situations involving sequential actions, expected returns from different time-steps must be integrated into a global representation of expected value. In order to accomplish this, we employ a technique proposed by [8], introducing a “global” utility variable (u G). Like u, this 1 is a binary random variable, but associated with a posterior probability determined as: p (uG ) = 1 N p(u i ) (2) i where N is the number of u nodes. The network as whole embodies a generative model for instrumental action. The basic idea is to use this model as a substrate for probabilistic inference, in order to arrive at optimal policies. There are three general methods for accomplishing this, which correspond three forms of query. First, a desired outcome state can be identified, by treating one of the state variables (as well as the initial state variable) as observed (see [9] for an application of this approach). Second, the expected return for specific plans can be evaluated and compared by conditioning on specific sets of values over the policy nodes (see [5, 21]). However, our focus here is on a less obvious possibility, which is to condition directly on the utility variable u G , as explained next. 2.2 P o l i c y s e l e c t i o n b y p ro b a b i l i s t i c i n f e re n c e : a n i t e r a t i v e a l g o r i t h m Cooper [23] introduced the idea of inferring optimal decisions in influence diagrams by treating utility nodes into binary random variables and then conditioning on these variables. Although this technique has been adopted in some more recent work [9, 12], we are aware of no application that guarantees optimal decisions, in the expected-reward sense, in multi-step tasks. We introduce here a simple algorithm that does furnish such a guarantee. The procedure is as follows: (1) Initialize the policy nodes with any set of non-deterministic 2 priors. (2) Treating the initial state and u G as observed variables (u G = 1), use standard belief 1 Note that temporal discounting can be incorporated into the framework through minimal modifications to Equation 2. 2 In the single-action situation, where there is only one u node, it is this variable that is treated as observed (u = 1). propagation (or a comparable algorithm) to infer the posterior distributions over all policy nodes. (3) Set the prior distributions over the policy nodes to the values (posteriors) obtained in step 2. (4) Go to step 2. The next two sections present proofs of monotonicity and convergence for this algorithm. 2.2.1 Monotonicity We show first that, at each policy node, the probability associated with the optimal policy will rise on every iteration. Define * as follows: ( * p uG , + ) > p (u + , G ), * (3) where + is the current set of probability distributions at all policy nodes on subsequent time-steps. (Note that we assume here, for simplicity, that there is a unique optimal policy.) The objective is to establish that: p ( t* ) > p ( t* 1 ) (4) where t indexes processing iterations. The dynamics of the network entail that p( ) = p( t t 1 uG ) (5) where represents any value (i.e., policy) of the decision node being considered. Substituting this into (4) gives p t* 1 uG > p ( t* 1 ) (6) ( ) From this point on the focus is on a single iteration, which permits us to omit the relevant subscripts. Applying Bayes’ law to (6) yields p (uG * p (uG ) p( ) > p * )p ( ) ( ) * (7) Canceling, and bringing the denominator up, this becomes p (uG * )> p (uG ) p( ) (8) Rewriting the left hand side, we obtain p ( uG * ) p( ) > p (uG ) p( ) (9) Subtracting and further rearranging: p (uG p (uG * ) p ( uG * * * ) p (uG ) p( ) + p (uG * * ) * p ( uG ) p( ) > 0 p (uG * ) p (uG ) p( ) > 0 (10) ) p( ) > 0 (11) (12) Note that this last inequality (12) follows from the definition of *. Remark: Of course, the identity of * depends on +. In particular, the policy * will only be part of a globally optimal plan if the set of choices + is optimal. Fortunately, this requirement is guaranteed to be met, as long as no upper bound is placed on the number of processing cycles. Recalling that we are considering only finite-horizon problems, note that for policies leading to states with no successors, + is empty. Thus * at the relevant policy nodes is fixed, and is guaranteed to be part of the optimal policy. The proof above shows that * will continuously rise. Once it reaches a maximum, * at immediately preceding decisions will perforce fit with the globally optimal policy. The process works backward, in the fashion of backward induction. 2.2.2 Convergence Continuing with the same notation, we show now that pt ( limt uG ) = 1 * (13) Note that, if we apply Bayes’ law recursively, pt ( uG ) = ( ) p ( ) = p (u p uG t ) G pi (uG ) 2 pt pi (uG ) pt 1 ( ( )= ) p uG 1 ( uG ) pt (uG ) pt 3 pt 2 ( ) 1 ( u G ) pt 2 ( u G ) … (14) Thus, p1 ( uG ) = ( p uG ) p ( ), p ( p (u ) 1 uG ) = 2 1 G 2 ( ) p ( ), p uG 1 p2 (uG ) p1 (uG ) p3 ( 3 ( ) p( ) p uG uG ) = 1 p3 (uG ) p2 (uG ) p1 (uG ) , (15) and so forth. Thus, what we wish to prove is ( * p uG ) p ( ) =1 * 1 (16) pt (uG ) t =1 or, rearranging, pt (uG ) ( = p1 ( ) p uG t =1 (17) ). Note that, given the stipulated relationship between p( ) on each processing iteration and p( | uG) on the previous iteration, p (uG pt (uG ) = )p ( ) = p ( uG = pt 1 )p ( p (uG t uG ) = t 1 3 )p ( ) 4 p (uG t 1 = (uG ) pt 2 (uG ) pt 1 ) pt 2 p (uG )p ( ) t 1 pt 1 1 ( ) (uG ) pt 2 (uG ) pt 3 (uG ) ( uG ) (18) … With this in mind, we can rewrite the left hand side product in (17) as follows: p ( uG p1 (uG ) ( p uG ) p (u G 2 )p( ) ) p (u 1 G ) 3 p (uG 1 ( p uG )p( ) ) p (u 1 G 4 p (uG 1 ( ) p2 (uG ) p uG ) p (u 1 ) p( ) 1 G ) p2 (uG ) p3 (uG ) … (19) Note that, given (18), the numerator in each factor of (19) cancels with the denominator in the subsequent factor, leaving only p(uG| *) in that denominator. The expression can thus be rewritten as 1 ( p uG 1 ) p (u G ) p (u G 4 p (uG 1 ) ) p( ) 1 ( p uG ) … = p (uG ( p uG ) ) p1 ( ). (20) The objective is then to show that the above equals p( *). It proceeds directly from the definition of * that, for all other than *, p ( uG ( p uG ) ) <1 (21) Thus, all but one of the terms in the sum above approach zero, and the remaining term equals p1( *). Thus, p (uG ( p uG ) ) p1 ( ) = p1 ( ) (22) 3 Simulations 3.1 Binary choice We begin with a simulation of a simple incentive choice situation. Here, an animal faces two levers. Pressing the left lever reliably yields a preferred food (r = 2), the right a less preferred food (r = 1). Representing these contingencies in a network structured as in Fig. 1 (left) and employing the iterative algorithm described in section 2.2 yields the results in Figure 2A. Shown here are the posterior probabilities for the policies press left and press right, along with the marginal value of p(u = 1) under these posteriors (labeled EV for expected value). The dashed horizontal line indicates the expected value for the optimal plan, to which the model obviously converges. A key empirical assay for purposive behavior involves outcome devaluation. Here, actions yielding a previously valued outcome are abandoned after the incentive value of the outcome is reduced, for example by pairing with an aversive event (e.g., [4]). To simulate this within the binary choice scenario just described, we reduced to zero the reward value of the food yielded by the left lever (fL), by making the appropriate change to p(u|fL). This yielded a reversal in lever choice (Fig. 2B). Another signature of purposive actions is that they are abandoned when their causal connection with rewarding outcomes is removed (contingency degradation, see [4]). We simulated this by starting with the model from Fig. 2A and changing conditional probabilities at s for t=2 to reflect a decoupling of the left action from the fL outcome. The resulting behavior is shown in Fig. 2C. Fig 2. Simulation results, binary choice. 3.2 Stochastic outcomes A critical aspect of the present modeling paradigm is that it yields reward-maximizing choices in stochastic domains, a property that distinguishes it from some other recent approaches using graphical models to do planning (e.g., [9]). To illustrate, we used the architecture in Figure 1 (left) to simulate a choice between two fair coins. A ‘left’ coin yields $1 for heads, $0 for tails; a ‘right’ coin $2 for heads but for tails a $3 loss. As illustrated in Fig. 2D, the model maximizes expected value by opting for the left coin. Fig 3. Simulation results, two-step sequential choice. 3.3 Sequential decision Here, we adopt the two-step T-maze scenario used by [24] (Fig. 3A). Representing the task contingencies in a graphical model based on the template from Fig 1 (right), and using the reward values indicated in Fig. 3A, yields the choice behavior shown in Figure 3B. Following [24], a shift in motivational state from hunger to thirst can be represented in the graphical model by changing the reward function (R(cheese) = 2, R(X) = 0, R(water) = 4, R(carrots) = 1). Imposing this change at the level of the u variables yields the choice behavior shown in Fig. 3C. The model can also be used to simulate effort-based decision. Starting with the scenario in Fig. 2A, we simulated the insertion of an effort-demanding scalable barrier at S 2 (R(S 2 ) = -2) by making appropriate changes p(u|s). The resulting behavior is shown in Fig. 3D. A famous empirical demonstration of purposive control involves detour behavior. Using a maze like the one shown in Fig. 4A, with a food reward placed at s5 , Tolman [2] found that rats reacted to a barrier at location A by taking the upper route, but to a barrier at B by taking the longer lower route. We simulated this experiment by representing the corresponding 3 transition and reward functions in a graphical model of the form shown in Fig. 1 (right), representing the insertion of barriers by appropriate changes to the transition function. The resulting choice behavior at the critical juncture s2 is shown in Fig. 4. Fig 4. Simulation results, detour behavior. B: No barrier. C: Barrier at A. D: Barrier at B. Another classic empirical demonstration involves latent learning. Blodgett [25] allowed rats to explore the maze shown in Fig. 5. Later insertion of a food reward at s13 was followed immediately by dramatic reductions in the running time, reflecting a reduction in entries into blind alleys. We simulated this effect in a model based on the template in Fig. 1 (right), representing the maze layout via an appropriate transition function. In the absence of a reward at s12 , random choices occurred at each intersection. However, setting R(s13 ) = 1 resulted in the set of choices indicated by the heavier arrows in Fig. 5. 4 Fig 5. Latent learning. Rel a t i o n t o p revi o u s work Initial proposals for how to solve decision problems through probabilistic inference in graphical models, including the idea of encoding reward as the posterior probability of a random utility variable, were put forth by Cooper [23]. Related ideas were presented by Shachter and Peot [12], including the use of nodes that integrate information from multiple utility nodes. More recently, Attias [11] and Verma and Rao [9] have used graphical models to solve shortest-path problems, leveraging probabilistic representations of rewards, though not in a way that guaranteed convergence on optimal (reward maximizing) plans. More closely related to the present research is work by Toussaint and Storkey [10], employing the EM algorithm. The iterative approach we have introduced here has a certain resemblance to the EM procedure, which becomes evident if one views the policy variables in our models as parameters on the mapping from states to actions. It seems possible that there may be a formal equivalence between the algorithm we have proposed and the one reported by [10]. As a cognitive and neuroscientific proposal, the present work bears a close relation to recent work by Hasselmo [6], addressing the prefrontal computations underlying goal-directed action selection (see also [7]). The present efforts are tied more closely to normative principles of decision-making, whereas the work in [6] is tied more closely to the details of neural circuitry. In this respect, the two approaches may prove complementary, and it will be interesting to further consider their interrelations. 3 In this simulation and the next, the set of states associated with each state node was limited to the set of reachable states for the relevant time-step, assuming an initial state of s1 .

<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.54992795 <a title="222-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-A_computational_model_of_hippocampal_function_in_trace_conditioning.html">7 nips-2008-A computational model of hippocampal function in trace conditioning</a></p>

<p>Author: Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner, Gediminas Lukšys</p><p>Abstract: Suppose we train an animal in a conditioning experiment. Can one predict how a given animal, under given experimental conditions, would perform the task? Since various factors such as stress, motivation, genetic background, and previous errors in task performance can inﬂuence animal behaviour, this appears to be a very challenging aim. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been successful in modeling animal (and human) behaviour, but their success has been limited because of uncertainty as to how to set meta-parameters (such as learning rate, exploitation-exploration balance and future reward discount factor) that strongly inﬂuence model performance. We show that a simple RL model whose metaparameters are controlled by an artiﬁcial neural network, fed with inputs such as stress, affective phenotype, previous task performance, and even neuromodulatory manipulations, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the ”hole-box” - a simple conditioning task. Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. 1</p><p>2 0.95058858 <a title="222-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Bounded_Treewidth_Bayesian_Networks.html">115 nips-2008-Learning Bounded Treewidth Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Stephen Gould</p><p>Abstract: With the increased availability of data for complex domains, it is desirable to learn Bayesian network structures that are sufﬁciently expressive for generalization while also allowing for tractable inference. While the method of thin junction trees can, in principle, be used for this purpose, its fully greedy nature makes it prone to overﬁtting, particularly when data is scarce. In this work we present a novel method for learning Bayesian networks of bounded treewidth that employs global structure modiﬁcations and that is polynomial in the size of the graph and the treewidth bound. At the heart of our method is a triangulated graph that we dynamically update in a way that facilitates the addition of chain structures that increase the bound on the model’s treewidth by at most one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our “treewidth-friendly” method on several real-life datasets. Importantly, we also show that by using global operators, we are able to achieve better generalization even when learning Bayesian networks of unbounded treewidth. 1</p><p>3 0.94929856 <a title="222-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Reconciling_Real_Scores_with_Binary_Comparisons%3A_A_New_Logistic_Based_Model_for_Ranking.html">190 nips-2008-Reconciling Real Scores with Binary Comparisons: A New Logistic Based Model for Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Nir Ailon</p><p>Abstract: The problem of ranking arises ubiquitously in almost every aspect of life, and in particular in Machine Learning/Information Retrieval. A statistical model for ranking predicts how humans rank subsets V of some universe U . In this work we deﬁne a statistical model for ranking that satisﬁes certain desirable properties. The model automatically gives rise to a logistic regression based approach to learning how to rank, for which the score and comparison based approaches are dual views. This offers a new generative approach to ranking which can be used for IR. There are two main contexts for this work. The ﬁrst is the theory of econometrics and study of statistical models explaining human choice of alternatives. In this context, we will compare our model with other well known models. The second context is the problem of ranking in machine learning, usually arising in the context of information retrieval. Here, much work has been done in the discriminative setting, where different heuristics are used to deﬁne ranking risk functions. Our model is built rigorously and axiomatically based on very simple desirable properties deﬁned locally for comparisons, and automatically implies the existence of a global score function serving as a natural model parameter which can be efﬁciently ﬁtted to pairwise comparison judgment data by solving a convex optimization problem. 1</p><p>4 0.94923174 <a title="222-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.9492256 <a title="222-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of unsupervised algorithms, numerical taxonomy clustering, to simultaneously cluster data, and to learn a taxonomy that encodes the relationship between the clusters. The algorithms work by maximizing the dependence between the taxonomy and the original data. The resulting taxonomy is a more informative visualization of complex data than simple clustering; in addition, taking into account the relations between different clusters is shown to substantially improve the quality of the clustering, when compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms in the literature (both spectral clustering and a previous dependence maximization approach). We demonstrate our algorithm on image and text data. 1</p><p>6 0.94865763 <a title="222-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Empirical_performance_maximization_for_linear_rank_statistics.html">72 nips-2008-Empirical performance maximization for linear rank statistics</a></p>

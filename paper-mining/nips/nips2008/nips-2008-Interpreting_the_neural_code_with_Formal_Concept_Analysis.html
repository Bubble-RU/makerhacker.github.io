<p>Author: Masafumi Oizumi, Toshiyuki Ishii, Kazuya Ishibashi, Toshihiko Hosoya, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: “How is information decoded in the brain?” is one of the most difﬁcult and important questions in neuroscience. Whether neural correlation is important or not in decoding neural activities is of special interest. We have developed a general framework for investigating how far the decoding process in the brain can be simpliﬁed. First, we hierarchically construct simpliﬁed probabilistic models of neural responses that ignore more than Kth-order correlations by using a maximum entropy principle. Then, we compute how much information is lost when information is decoded using the simpliﬁed models, i.e., “mismatched decoders”. We introduce an information theoretically correct quantity for evaluating the information obtained by mismatched decoders. We applied our proposed framework to spike data for vertebrate retina. We used 100-ms natural movies as stimuli and computed the information contained in neural activities about these movies. We found that the information loss is negligibly small in population activities of ganglion cells even if all orders of correlation are ignored in decoding. We also found that if we assume stationarity for long durations in the information analysis of dynamically changing stimuli like natural movies, pseudo correlations seem to carry a large portion of the information. 1</p><p>3 0.2294032 <a title="109-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Dynamics_of_Cognitive_Control.html">231 nips-2008-Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Reynolds, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Cognitive control refers to the ﬂexible deployment of memory and attention in response to task demands and current goals. Control is often studied experimentally by presenting sequences of stimuli, some demanding a response, and others modulating the stimulus-response mapping. In these tasks, participants must maintain information about the current stimulus-response mapping in working memory. Prominent theories of cognitive control use recurrent neural nets to implement working memory, and optimize memory utilization via reinforcement learning. We present a novel perspective on cognitive control in which working memory representations are intrinsically probabilistic, and control operations that maintain and update working memory are dynamically determined via probabilistic inference. We show that our model provides a parsimonious account of behavioral and neuroimaging data, and suggest that it offers an elegant conceptualization of control in which behavior can be cast as optimal, subject to limitations on learning and the rate of information processing. Moreover, our model provides insight into how task instructions can be directly translated into appropriate behavior and then efﬁciently reﬁned with subsequent task experience. 1</p><p>4 0.20679049 <a title="109-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Effects_of_Stimulus_Type_and_of_Error-Correcting_Code_Design_on_BCI_Speller_Performance.html">67 nips-2008-Effects of Stimulus Type and of Error-Correcting Code Design on BCI Speller Performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Hill, Jason Farquhar, Suzanna Martens, Felix Biessmann, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: From an information-theoretic perspective, a noisy transmission system such as a visual Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller could beneﬁt from the use of errorcorrecting codes. However, optimizing the code solely according to the maximal minimum-Hamming-distance criterion tends to lead to an overall increase in target frequency of target stimuli, and hence a signiﬁcantly reduced average target-to-target interval (TTI), leading to difﬁculties in classifying the individual event-related potentials (ERPs) due to overlap and refractory effects. Clearly any change to the stimulus setup must also respect the possible psychophysiological consequences. Here we report new EEG data from experiments in which we explore stimulus types and codebooks in a within-subject design, ﬁnding an interaction between the two factors. Our data demonstrate that the traditional, rowcolumn code has particular spatial properties that lead to better performance than one would expect from its TTIs and Hamming-distances alone, but nonetheless error-correcting codes can improve performance provided the right stimulus type is used. 1</p><p>5 0.15554139 <a title="109-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Cell_Assemblies_in_Large_Sparse_Inhibitory_Networks_of_Biologically_Realistic_Spiking_Neurons.html">43 nips-2008-Cell Assemblies in Large Sparse Inhibitory Networks of Biologically Realistic Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Ponzi, Jeff Wickens</p><p>Abstract: Cell assemblies exhibiting episodes of recurrent coherent activity have been observed in several brain regions including the striatum[1] and hippocampus CA3[2]. Here we address the question of how coherent dynamically switching assemblies appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons interacting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmetric inhibitory networks with ﬁxed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bifurcation between a quiescent and ﬁring state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and assemblies switch between ﬁring and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental studies. The deterministic dynamical behaviour is related to winner-less competition[3], shown in small closed loop inhibitory networks with heteroclinic cycles connecting saddle-points. 1</p><p>6 0.15236989 <a title="109-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Sequential_effects%3A_Superstition_or_rational_behavior%3F.html">206 nips-2008-Sequential effects: Superstition or rational behavior?</a></p>

<p>Author: K. Wong, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are emerging as promising models for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of neutrally stable states. In this study, we systematically explore how neutral stability of a CANN facilitates its tracking performance, a capacity believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus. 1</p><p>6 0.62578416 <a title="109-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-A_computational_model_of_hippocampal_function_in_trace_conditioning.html">7 nips-2008-A computational model of hippocampal function in trace conditioning</a></p>

Mozer</p><p>Abstract: In most cognitive and motor tasks, speed-accuracy tradeoffs are observed: Individuals can respond slowly and accurately, or quickly yet be prone to errors. Control mechanisms governing the initiation of behavioral responses are sensitive not only to task instructions and the stimulus being processed, but also to the recent stimulus history. When stimuli can be characterized on an easy-hard dimension (e.g., word frequency in a naming task), items preceded by easy trials are responded to more quickly, and with more errors, than items preceded by hard trials. We propose a rationally motivated mathematical model of this sequential adaptation of control, based on a diffusion model of the decision process in which difﬁculty corresponds to the drift rate for the correct response. The model assumes that responding is based on the posterior distribution over which response is correct, conditioned on the accumulated evidence. We derive this posterior as a function of the drift rate, and show that higher estimates of the drift rate lead to (normatively) faster responding. Trial-by-trial tracking of difﬁculty thus leads to sequential effects in speed and accuracy. Simulations show the model explains a variety of phenomena in human speeded decision making. We argue this passive statistical mechanism provides a more elegant and parsimonious account than extant theories based on elaborate control structures. 1</p><p>3 0.93477857 <a title="109-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_response_behavior_in_multisensory_perception_with_conflicting_cues.html">46 nips-2008-Characterizing response behavior in multisensory perception with conflicting cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Rama Natarajan, Iain Murray, Ladan Shams, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: We explore a recently proposed mixture model approach to understanding interactions between conﬂicting sensory cues. Alternative model formulations, differing in their sensory noise models and inference methods, are compared based on their ﬁt to experimental data. Heavy-tailed sensory likelihoods yield a better description of the subjects’ response behavior than standard Gaussian noise models. We study the underlying cause for this result, and then present several testable predictions of these models. 1</p><p>4 0.92768264 <a title="109-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>
<p>Author: Klaus Wimmer, Marcel Stimberg, Robert Martin, Lars Schwabe, Jorge Mariño, James Schummers, David C. Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>5 0.88958412 <a title="109-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>6 0.86481053 <a title="109-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-PSDBoost%3A_Matrix-Generation_Linear_Programming_for_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices_Learning.html">175 nips-2008-PSDBoost: Matrix-Generation Linear Programming for Positive Semidefinite Matrices Learning</a></p>

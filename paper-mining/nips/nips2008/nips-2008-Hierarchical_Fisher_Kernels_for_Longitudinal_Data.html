<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: For supervised and unsupervised learning, positive deﬁnite kernels allow to use large and potentially inﬁnite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the ℓ1 -norm or the block ℓ1 -norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efﬁciently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p><p>3 0.1577459 <a title="97-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Data_in_Multiple_Feature_Representations.html">63 nips-2008-Dimensionality Reduction for Data in Multiple Feature Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Yen-yu Lin, Tyng-luh Liu, Chiou-shann Fuh</p><p>Abstract: In solving complex visual learning tasks, adopting multiple descriptors to more precisely characterize the data has been a feasible way for improving performance. These representations are typically high dimensional and assume diverse forms. Thus ﬁnding a way to transform them into a uniﬁed space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks, such as object recognition or clustering. We describe an approach that incorporates multiple kernel learning with dimensionality reduction (MKL-DR). While the proposed framework is ﬂexible in simultaneously tackling data in various feature representations, the formulation itself is general in that it is established upon graph embedding. It follows that any dimensionality reduction techniques explainable by graph embedding can be generalized by our method to consider data in multiple feature representations.</p><p>4 0.13659227 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Performance_analysis_for_L%5C_2_kernel_classification.html">178 nips-2008-Performance analysis for L\ 2 kernel classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jooseuk Kim, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: We provide statistical performance guarantees for a recently introduced kernel classiﬁer that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a difference of densities. The classiﬁer is similar to a support vector machine (SVM) in that it is the solution of a quadratic program and yields a sparse classiﬁer. Unlike SVMs, however, the L2 kernel classiﬁer does not involve a regularization parameter. We prove a distribution free concentration inequality for a cross-validation based estimate of the ISE, and apply this result to deduce an oracle inequality and consistency of the classiﬁer on the sense of both ISE and probability of error. Our results also specialize to give performance guarantees for an existing method of L2 kernel density estimation. 1</p><p>5 0.13326442 <a title="97-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Extended_Grassmann_Kernels_for_Subspace-Based_Learning.html">80 nips-2008-Extended Grassmann Kernels for Subspace-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jihun Hamm, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Subspace-based learning problems involve data whose elements are linear subspaces of a vector space. To handle such data structures, Grassmann kernels have been proposed and used previously. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Grassmann kernels and probabilistic similarity measures. Firstly, we show that the KL distance in the limit yields the Projection kernel on the Grassmann manifold, whereas the Bhattacharyya kernel becomes trivial in the limit and is suboptimal for subspace-based problems. Secondly, based on our analysis of the KL distance, we propose extensions of the Projection kernel which can be extended to the set of afﬁne as well as scaled subspaces. We demonstrate the advantages of these extended kernels for classiﬁcation and recognition tasks with Support Vector Machines and Kernel Discriminant Analysis using synthetic and real image databases. 1</p><p>6 0.11962603 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Haixuan Yang, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithms have the ability to avoid over-ﬁtting problems and to express solutions as kernel expansions. However, we observe that the current RLS algorithms cannot provide a satisfactory interpretation even on the penalty of a constant function. Based on the intuition that a good kernelbased inductive function should be consistent with both the data and the kernel, a novel learning scheme is proposed. The advantages of this scheme lie in its corresponding Representer Theorem, its strong interpretation ability about what kind of functions should not be penalized, and its promising accuracy improvements shown in a number of experiments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed technical description about heat kernels, which serves as an example for the readers to apply similar techniques for other kernels. Our work provides a preliminary step in a new direction to explore the varying consistency between inductive functions and kernels under various distributions. 1</p><p>6 0.6544767 <a title="97-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Characteristic_Kernels_on_Groups_and_Semigroups.html">44 nips-2008-Characteristic Kernels on Groups and Semigroups</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Michael I. Jordan, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Kernel supervised learning methods can be uniﬁed by utilizing the tools from regularization theory. The duality between regularization and prior leads to interpreting regularization methods in terms of maximum a posteriori estimation and has motivated Bayesian interpretations of kernel methods. In this paper we pursue a Bayesian interpretation of sparsity in the kernel setting by making use of a mixture of a point-mass distribution and prior that we refer to as “Silverman’s g-prior.” We provide a theoretical analysis of the posterior consistency of a Bayesian model choice procedure based on this prior. We also establish the asymptotic relationship between this procedure and the Bayesian information criterion. 1</p><p>2 0.65788013 <a title="97-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-QUIC-SVD%3A_Fast_SVD_Using_Cosine_Trees.html">188 nips-2008-QUIC-SVD: Fast SVD Using Cosine Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael P. Holmes, Jr. Isbell, Charles Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The Singular Value Decomposition is a key operation in many machine learning methods. Its computational cost, however, makes it unscalable and impractical for applications involving large datasets or real-time responsiveness, which are becoming increasingly common. We present a new method, QUIC-SVD, for fast approximation of the whole-matrix SVD based on a new sampling mechanism called the cosine tree. Our empirical tests show speedups of several orders of magnitude over exact SVD. Such scalability should enable QUIC-SVD to accelerate and enable a wide array of SVD-based methods and applications. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.64944804 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Hierarchical_Fisher_Kernels_for_Longitudinal_Data.html">97 nips-2008-Hierarchical Fisher Kernels for Longitudinal Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Guangzhi Cao, Charles Bouman</p><p>Abstract: Covariance estimation for high dimensional vectors is a classically difﬁcult problem in statistical analysis and machine learning. In this paper, we propose a maximum likelihood (ML) approach to covariance estimation, which employs a novel sparsity constraint. More speciﬁcally, the covariance is constrained to have an eigen decomposition which can be represented as a sparse matrix transform (SMT). The SMT is formed by a product of pairwise coordinate rotations known as Givens rotations. Using this framework, the covariance can be efﬁciently estimated using greedy minimization of the log likelihood function, and the number of Givens rotations can be efﬁciently computed using a cross-validation procedure. The resulting estimator is positive deﬁnite and well-conditioned even when the sample size is limited. Experiments on standard hyperspectral data sets show that the SMT covariance estimate is consistently more accurate than both traditional shrinkage estimates and recently proposed graphical lasso estimates for a variety of different classes and sample sizes. 1</p><p>5 0.47148809 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Data_in_Multiple_Feature_Representations.html">63 nips-2008-Dimensionality Reduction for Data in Multiple Feature Representations</a></p>

These representations are typically high dimensional and assume diverse forms. Thus ﬁnding a way to transform them into a uniﬁed space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks, such as object recognition or clustering. We describe an approach that incorporates multiple kernel learning with dimensionality reduction (MKL-DR). While the proposed framework is ﬂexible in simultaneously tackling data in various feature representations, the formulation itself is general in that it is established upon graph embedding. It follows that any dimensionality reduction techniques explainable by graph embedding can be generalized by our method to consider data in multiple feature representations.</p><p>6 0.46703139 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>

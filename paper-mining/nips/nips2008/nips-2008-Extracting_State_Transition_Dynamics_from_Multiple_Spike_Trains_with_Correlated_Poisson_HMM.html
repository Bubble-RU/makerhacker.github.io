<p>Author: Zhi Yang, Qi Zhao, Wentai Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a spike feature extraction algorithm that targets real-time spike sorting and facilitates miniaturized microchip implementation. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on synthesized waveforms and experimentally recorded sequences. When compared with many spike sorting approaches our algorithm demonstrates improved speed, accuracy and allows unsupervised execution. A preliminary hardware implementation has been realized using an integrated microchip interfaced with a personal computer. 1</p><p>3 0.37084821 <a title="81-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Arno Onken, Steffen Grünewälder, Matthias Munk, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Correlations between spike counts are often used to analyze neural coding. The noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian. Yet, this assumption is often inappropriate, especially for low spike counts. In this study, we present copulas as an alternative approach. With copulas it is possible to use arbitrary marginal distributions such as Poisson or negative binomial that are better suited for modeling noise distributions of spike counts. Furthermore, copulas place a wide range of dependence structures at the disposal and can be used to analyze higher order interactions. We develop a framework to analyze spike count data by means of copulas. Methods for parameter inference based on maximum likelihood estimates and for computation of mutual information are provided. We apply the method to our data recorded from macaque prefrontal cortex. The data analysis leads to three ﬁndings: (1) copula-based distributions provide signiﬁcantly better ﬁts than discretized multivariate normal distributions; (2) negative binomial margins ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly better than Poisson margins; and (3) the dependence structure carries 12% of the mutual information between stimuli and responses. 1</p><p>4 0.26698682 <a title="81-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Dependent_Dirichlet_Process_Spike_Sorting.html">59 nips-2008-Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting</a></p>

Teh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new incremental spike sorting model that automatically eliminates refractory period violations, accounts for action potential waveform drift, and can handle “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons. Our approach is to augment a known time-varying Dirichlet process that ties together a sequence of inﬁnite Gaussian mixture models, one per action potential waveform observation, with an interspike-interval-dependent likelihood that prohibits refractory period violations. We demonstrate this model by showing results from sorting two publicly available neural data recordings for which a partial ground truth labeling is known. 1</p><p>5 0.19563854 <a title="81-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Short-Term_Depression_in_VLSI_Stochastic_Synapse.html">209 nips-2008-Short-Term Depression in VLSI Stochastic Synapse</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Xu, Timothy K. Horiuchi, Pamela A. Abshire</p><p>Abstract: We report a compact realization of short-term depression (STD) in a VLSI stochastic synapse. The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single release model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redundancy in the input spike train, and the mean transmission probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural systems. 1</p><p>6 0.19030005 <a title="81-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Template_Matching_with_Shift-Invariant_Semi-NMF.html">16 nips-2008-Adaptive Template Matching with Shift-Invariant Semi-NMF</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Mark Schmidt, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: The stochastic approximation method is behind the solution to many important, actively-studied problems in machine learning. Despite its farreaching application, there is almost no work on applying stochastic approximation to learning problems with general constraints. The reason for this, we hypothesize, is that no robust, widely-applicable stochastic approximation method exists for handling such problems. We propose that interior-point methods are a natural solution. We establish the stability of a stochastic interior-point approximation method both analytically and empirically, and demonstrate its utility by deriving an on-line learning algorithm that also performs feature selection via L1 regularization. 1</p><p>3 0.70222187 <a title="81-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Signal_Recovery_Using_Markov_Random_Fields.html">215 nips-2008-Sparse Signal Recovery Using Markov Random Fields</a></p>

In this paper, we extend the theory of CS to include signals that are concisely represented in terms of a graphical model. In particular, we use Markov Random Fields (MRFs) to represent sparse signals whose nonzero coefﬁcients are clustered. Our new model-based recovery algorithm, dubbed Lattice Matching Pursuit (LaMP), stably recovers MRF-modeled signals using many fewer measurements and computations than the current state-of-the-art algorithms.</p><p>4 0.6104309 <a title="81-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_low-dimensional_single-trial_analysis_of_neural_population_activity.html">90 nips-2008-Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity</a></p>

Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from tens to hundreds of neurons on individual experimental trials. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the data are ﬁrst “denoised” by smoothing over time, then a static dimensionality reduction technique is applied. We ﬁrst describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way, and account for spiking variability that may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), which uniﬁes the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-ﬁt metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that GPFA provided a better characterization of the population activity than the two-stage methods. 1</p><p>5 0.60845113 <a title="81-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>6 0.60820955 <a title="81-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Shape-Based_Object_Localization_for_Descriptive_Classification.html">207 nips-2008-Shape-Based Object Localization for Descriptive Classification</a></p>

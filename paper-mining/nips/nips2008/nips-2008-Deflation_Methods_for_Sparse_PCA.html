<p>Author: Angela J. Yu, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In a variety of behavioral tasks, subjects exhibit an automatic and apparently suboptimal sequential effect: they respond more rapidly and accurately to a stimulus if it reinforces a local pattern in stimulus history, such as a string of repetitions or alternations, compared to when it violates such a pattern. This is often the case even if the local trends arise by chance in the context of a randomized design, such that stimulus history has no real predictive power. In this work, we use a normative Bayesian framework to examine the hypothesis that such idiosyncrasies may reﬂect the inadvertent engagement of mechanisms critical for adapting to a changing environment. We show that prior belief in non-stationarity can induce experimentally observed sequential effects in an otherwise Bayes-optimal algorithm. The Bayesian algorithm is shown to be well approximated by linear-exponential ﬁltering of past observations, a feature also apparent in the behavioral data. We derive an explicit relationship between the parameters and computations of the exact Bayesian algorithm and those of the approximate linear-exponential ﬁlter. Since the latter is equivalent to a leaky-integration process, a commonly used model of neuronal dynamics underlying perceptual decision-making and trial-to-trial dependencies, our model provides a principled account of why such dynamics are useful. We also show that parameter-tuning of the leaky-integration process is possible, using stochastic gradient descent based only on the noisy binary inputs. This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal prediction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities. 1</p><p>3 0.27307731 <a title="57-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenyuan Dai, Yuqiang Chen, Gui-rong Xue, Qiang Yang, Yong Yu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new machine learning strategy called translated learning. Unlike many previous learning tasks, we focus on how to use labeled data from one feature space to enhance the classiﬁcation of other entirely different learning spaces. For example, we might wish to use labeled text data to help learn a model for classifying image data, when the labeled images are difﬁcult to obtain. An important aspect of translated learning is to build a “bridge” to link one feature space (known as the “source space”) to another space (known as the “target space”) through a translator in order to migrate the knowledge from source to target. The translated learning solution uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Finally, this chain of linkages is completed by tracing back to the instances in the target spaces. We show that this path of linkage can be modeled using a Markov chain and risk minimization. Through experiments on the text-aided image classiﬁcation and cross-language classiﬁcation tasks, we demonstrate that our translated learning framework can greatly outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods. 1</p><p>4 0.21123755 <a title="57-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Kernel_Measures_of_Independence_for_non-iid_Data.html">112 nips-2008-Kernel Measures of Independence for non-iid Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Le Song, Arthur Gretton, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated in the framework of statistical independence such as the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. In this paper, we extend this criterion to deal with structured and interdependent observations. This is achieved by modeling the structures using undirected graphical models and comparing the Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. We apply this new criterion to independent component analysis and sequence clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.18442446 <a title="57-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Particle_Filter-based_Policy_Gradient_in_POMDPs.html">177 nips-2008-Particle Filter-based Policy Gradient in POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Our setting is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with continuous state, observation and action spaces. Decisions are based on a Particle Filter for estimating the belief state given past observations. We consider a policy gradient approach for parameterized policy optimization. For that purpose, we investigate sensitivity analysis of the performance measure with respect to the parameters of the policy, focusing on Finite Difference (FD) techniques. We show that the naive FD is subject to variance explosion because of the non-smoothness of the resampling procedure. We propose a more sophisticated FD method which overcomes this problem and establish its consistency. 1</p><p>6 0.1479961 <a title="57-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Policy_Iteration.html">195 nips-2008-Regularized Policy Iteration</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Ponzi, Jeff Wickens</p><p>Abstract: Cell assemblies exhibiting episodes of recurrent coherent activity have been observed in several brain regions including the striatum[1] and hippocampus CA3[2]. Here we address the question of how coherent dynamically switching assemblies appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons interacting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmetric inhibitory networks with ﬁxed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bifurcation between a quiescent and ﬁring state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and assemblies switch between ﬁring and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental studies. The deterministic dynamical behaviour is related to winner-less competition[3], shown in small closed loop inhibitory networks with heteroclinic cycles connecting saddle-points. 1</p><p>3 0.61844569 <a title="57-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>

Through experiments on the text-aided image classiﬁcation and cross-language classiﬁcation tasks, we demonstrate that our translated learning framework can greatly outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods. 1</p><p>4 0.55158269 <a title="57-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Shape-Based_Object_Localization_for_Descriptive_Classification.html">207 nips-2008-Shape-Based Object Localization for Descriptive Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Benjamin Packer, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative tasks, including object categorization and detection, are central components of high-level computer vision. Sometimes, however, we are interested in more reﬁned aspects of the object in an image, such as pose or particular regions. In this paper we develop a method (LOOPS) for learning a shape and image feature model that can be trained on a particular object class, and used to outline instances of the class in novel images. Furthermore, while the training data consists of uncorresponded outlines, the resulting LOOPS model contains a set of landmark points that appear consistently across instances, and can be accurately localized in an image. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in precisely outlining objects that exhibit large deformations and articulations in cluttered natural images. These localizations can then be used to address a range of tasks, including descriptive classiﬁcation, search, and clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.46649998 <a title="57-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Liqing Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A visual attention system should respond placidly when common stimuli are presented, while at the same time keep alert to anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return. 1</p><p>6 0.46383026 <a title="57-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-High-dimensional_support_union_recovery_in_multivariate_regression.html">99 nips-2008-High-dimensional support union recovery in multivariate regression</a></p>

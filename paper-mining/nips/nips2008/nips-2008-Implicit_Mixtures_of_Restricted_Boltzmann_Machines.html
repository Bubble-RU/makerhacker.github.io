<p>Author: Tanya Schmah, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Steven L. Small, Stephen Strother, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Neuroimaging datasets often have a very large number of voxels and a very small number of training cases, which means that overﬁtting of models for this data can become a very serious problem. Working with a set of fMRI images from a study on stroke recovery, we consider a classiﬁcation task for which logistic regression performs poorly, even when L1- or L2- regularized. We show that much better discrimination can be achieved by ﬁtting a generative model to each separate condition and then seeing which model is most likely to have generated the data. We compare discriminative training of exactly the same set of models, and we also consider convex blends of generative and discriminative training. 1</p><p>3 0.2556937 <a title="103-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Evaluating_probabilities_under_high-dimensional_latent_variable_models.html">77 nips-2008-Evaluating probabilities under high-dimensional latent variable models</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple new Monte Carlo algorithm for evaluating probabilities of observations in complex latent variable models, such as Deep Belief Networks. While the method is based on Markov chains, estimates based on short runs are formally unbiased. In expectation, the log probability of a test set will be underestimated, and this could form the basis of a probabilistic bound. The method is much cheaper than gold-standard annealing-based methods and only slightly more expensive than the cheapest Monte Carlo methods. We give examples of the new method substantially improving simple variational bounds at modest extra cost. 1</p><p>4 0.16479909 <a title="103-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-The_Recurrent_Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">237 nips-2008-The Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) is a probabilistic model for sequences that is able to successfully model (i.e., generate nice-looking samples of) several very high dimensional sequences, such as motion capture data and the pixels of low resolution videos of balls bouncing in a box. The major disadvantage of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difﬁculty has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent TRBM, which is a very slight modiﬁcation of the TRBM for which exact inference is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable. We demonstrate that the RTRBM is better than an analogous TRBM at generating motion capture and videos of bouncing balls. 1</p><p>5 0.15961334 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Spectral_Hashing.html">219 nips-2008-Spectral Hashing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: Semantic hashing[1] seeks compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with semantic similarity. In this paper, we show that the problem of ﬁnding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to eﬃciently calculate the code of a novel datapoint. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art. 1</p><p>6 0.13769361 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Domain_Adaptation_with_Multiple_Sources.html">65 nips-2008-Domain Adaptation with Multiple Sources</a></p>

<p>Author: Chao Yuan, Claus Neubauer</p><p>Abstract: Mixture of Gaussian processes models extended a single Gaussian process with ability of modeling multi-modal data and reduction of training complexity. Previous inference algorithms for these models are mostly based on Gibbs sampling, which can be very slow, particularly for large-scale data sets. We present a new generative mixture of experts model. Each expert is still a Gaussian process but is reformulated by a linear model. This breaks the dependency among training outputs and enables us to use a much faster variational Bayesian algorithm for training. Our gating network is more ﬂexible than previous generative approaches as inputs for each expert are modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. The number of experts and number of Gaussian components for an expert are inferred automatically. A variety of tests show the advantages of our method. 1</p><p>6 0.40091071 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">234 nips-2008-The Infinite Factorial Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Rui M. Castro, Charles Kalish, Robert Nowak, Ruichen Qian, Tim Rogers, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a topic at the interface of machine learning and cognitive science. Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study comparing human category learning in active versus passive settings. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.98486131 <a title="103-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Implicit_Mixtures_of_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines.html">103 nips-2008-Implicit Mixtures of Restricted Boltzmann Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Jeremy Lewi, Robert Butera, David M. Schneider, Sarah Woolley, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Sequential optimal design methods hold great promise for improving the efﬁciency of neurophysiology experiments. However, previous methods for optimal experimental design have incorporated only weak prior information about the underlying neural system (e.g., the sparseness or smoothness of the receptive ﬁeld). Here we describe how to use stronger prior information, in the form of parametric models of the receptive ﬁeld, in order to construct optimal stimuli and further improve the efﬁciency of our experiments. For example, if we believe that the receptive ﬁeld is well-approximated by a Gabor function, then our method constructs stimuli that optimally constrain the Gabor parameters (orientation, spatial frequency, etc.) using as few experimental trials as possible. More generally, we may believe a priori that the receptive ﬁeld lies near a known sub-manifold of the full parameter space; in this case, our method chooses stimuli in order to reduce the uncertainty along the tangent space of this sub-manifold as rapidly as possible. Applications to simulated and real data indicate that these methods may in many cases improve the experimental efﬁciency. 1</p><p>4 0.9762938 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Asynchronous_Distributed_Learning_of_Topic_Models.html">28 nips-2008-Asynchronous Distributed Learning of Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: Distributed learning is a problem of fundamental interest in machine learning and cognitive science. In this paper, we present asynchronous distributed learning algorithms for two well-known unsupervised learning frameworks: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP). In the proposed approach, the data are distributed across P processors, and processors independently perform Gibbs sampling on their local data and communicate their information in a local asynchronous manner with other processors. We demonstrate that our asynchronous algorithms are able to learn global topic models that are statistically as accurate as those learned by the standard LDA and HDP samplers, but with signiﬁcant improvements in computation time and memory. We show speedup results on a 730-million-word text corpus using 32 processors, and we provide perplexity results for up to 1500 virtual processors. As a stepping stone in the development of asynchronous HDP, a parallel HDP sampler is also introduced. 1</p><p>5 0.97479987 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Counting_Solution_Clusters_in_Graph_Coloring_Problems_Using_Belief_Propagation.html">53 nips-2008-Counting Solution Clusters in Graph Coloring Problems Using Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukas Kroc, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We show that an important and computationally challenging solution space feature of the graph coloring problem (COL), namely the number of clusters of solutions, can be accurately estimated by a technique very similar to one for counting the number of solutions. This cluster counting approach can be naturally written in terms of a new factor graph derived from the factor graph representing the COL instance. Using a variant of the Belief Propagation inference framework, we can efﬁciently approximate cluster counts in random COL problems over a large range of graph densities. We illustrate the algorithm on instances with up to 100, 000 vertices. Moreover, we supply a methodology for computing the number of clusters exactly using advanced techniques from the knowledge compilation literature. This methodology scales up to several hundred variables. 1</p><p>6 0.97035193 <a title="103-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Correlated_Bigram_LSA_for_Unsupervised_Language_Model_Adaptation.html">52 nips-2008-Correlated Bigram LSA for Unsupervised Language Model Adaptation</a></p>

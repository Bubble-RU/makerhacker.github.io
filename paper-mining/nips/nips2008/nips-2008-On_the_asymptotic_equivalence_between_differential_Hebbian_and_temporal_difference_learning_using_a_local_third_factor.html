<p>Author: Bernhard Nessler, Michael Pfeiffer, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: Uncertainty is omnipresent when we perceive or interact with our environment, and the Bayesian framework provides computational methods for dealing with it. Mathematical models for Bayesian decision making typically require datastructures that are hard to implement in neural networks. This article shows that even the simplest and experimentally best supported type of synaptic plasticity, Hebbian learning, in combination with a sparse, redundant neural code, can in principle learn to infer optimal Bayesian decisions. We present a concrete Hebbian learning rule operating on log-probability ratios. Modulated by reward-signals, this Hebbian plasticity rule also provides a new perspective for understanding how Bayesian inference could support fast reinforcement learning in the brain. In particular we show that recent experimental results by Yang and Shadlen [1] on reinforcement learning of probabilistic inference in primates can be modeled in this way. 1</p><p>3 0.36666793 <a title="166-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.25043407 <a title="166-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Near-Isometric_Matching_via_Structured_Learning_of_Graphical_Models.html">201 nips-2008-Robust Near-Isometric Matching via Structured Learning of Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption. However, real shapes from image datasets, even when expected to be related by “almost isometric” transformations, are actually subject not only to noise but also, to some limited degree, to variations in appearance and scale. In this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction. The outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is robust in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations. Our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models, while maintaining similar running times. 1</p><p>5 0.19220077 <a title="166-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Fitted_Q-iteration_by_Advantage_Weighted_Regression.html">87 nips-2008-Fitted Q-iteration by Advantage Weighted Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerhard Neumann, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Recently, ﬁtted Q-iteration (FQI) based methods have become more popular due to their increased sample efﬁciency, a more stable learning process and the higher quality of the resulting policy. However, these methods remain hard to use for continuous action spaces which frequently occur in real-world tasks, e.g., in robotics and other technical applications. The greedy action selection commonly used for the policy improvement step is particularly problematic as it is expensive for continuous actions, can cause an unstable learning process, introduces an optimization bias and results in highly non-smooth policies unsuitable for real-world systems. In this paper, we show that by using a soft-greedy action selection the policy improvement step used in FQI can be simpliﬁed to an inexpensive advantageweighted regression. With this result, we are able to derive a new, computationally efﬁcient FQI algorithm which can even deal with high dimensional action spaces. 1</p><p>6 0.15754151 <a title="166-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Near-optimal_Regret_Bounds_for_Reinforcement_Learning.html">150 nips-2008-Near-optimal Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner, Gediminas Lukšys</p><p>Abstract: Suppose we train an animal in a conditioning experiment. Can one predict how a given animal, under given experimental conditions, would perform the task? Since various factors such as stress, motivation, genetic background, and previous errors in task performance can inﬂuence animal behaviour, this appears to be a very challenging aim. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been successful in modeling animal (and human) behaviour, but their success has been limited because of uncertainty as to how to set meta-parameters (such as learning rate, exploitation-exploration balance and future reward discount factor) that strongly inﬂuence model performance. We show that a simple RL model whose metaparameters are controlled by an artiﬁcial neural network, fed with inputs such as stress, affective phenotype, previous task performance, and even neuromodulatory manipulations, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the ”hole-box” - a simple conditioning task. Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. 1</p><p>6 0.46086684 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Near-Isometric_Matching_via_Structured_Learning_of_Graphical_Models.html">201 nips-2008-Robust Near-Isometric Matching via Structured Learning of Graphical Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan L. Roux, Alain D. Cheveigné, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: How does one extract unknown but stereotypical events that are linearly superimposed within a signal with variable latencies and variable amplitudes? One could think of using template matching or matching pursuit to ﬁnd the arbitrarily shifted linear components. However, traditional matching approaches require that the templates be known a priori. To overcome this restriction we use instead semi Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (semiNMF) that we extend to allow for time shifts when matching the templates to the signal. The algorithm estimates templates directly from the data along with their non-negative amplitudes. The resulting method can be thought of as an adaptive template matching procedure. We demonstrate the procedure on the task of extracting spikes from single channel extracellular recordings. On these data the algorithm essentially performs spike detection and unsupervised spike clustering. Results on simulated data and extracellular recordings indicate that the method performs well for signalto-noise ratios of 6dB or higher and that spike templates are recovered accurately provided they are suﬃciently diﬀerent. 1</p><p>4 0.69481206 <a title="166-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Design_of_Loss_Functions_for_Classification%3A_theory%2C_robustness_to_outliers%2C_and_SavageBoost.html">162 nips-2008-On the Design of Loss Functions for Classification: theory, robustness to outliers, and SavageBoost</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The machine learning problem of classiﬁer design is studied from the perspective of probability elicitation, in statistics. This shows that the standard approach of proceeding from the speciﬁcation of a loss, to the minimization of conditional risk is overly restrictive. It is shown that a better alternative is to start from the speciﬁcation of a functional form for the minimum conditional risk, and derive the loss function. This has various consequences of practical interest, such as showing that 1) the widely adopted practice of relying on convex loss functions is unnecessary, and 2) many new losses can be derived for classiﬁcation problems. These points are illustrated by the derivation of a new loss which is not convex, but does not compromise the computational tractability of classiﬁer design, and is robust to the contamination of data with outliers. A new boosting algorithm, SavageBoost, is derived for the minimization of this loss. Experimental results show that it is indeed less sensitive to outliers than conventional methods, such as Ada, Real, or LogitBoost, and converges in fewer iterations. 1</p><p>5 0.69448388 <a title="166-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Forward-Backward_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Learning_with_Linear_Models.html">14 nips-2008-Adaptive Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithm for Sparse Learning with Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Consider linear prediction models where the target function is a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefﬁcients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneﬁcial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory. 1</p><p>6 0.67097402 <a title="166-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-A_Convergent_%24O%28n%29%24_Temporal-difference_Algorithm_for_Off-policy_Learning_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">1 nips-2008-A Convergent $O(n)$ Temporal-difference Algorithm for Off-policy Learning with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>3 0.16724582 <a title="194-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>4 0.16562121 <a title="194-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Network_Score_Approximation_using_a_Metagraph_Kernel.html">34 nips-2008-Bayesian Network Score Approximation using a Metagraph Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Yackley, Eduardo Corona, Terran Lane</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting problems, including Bayesian network structure-search, can be cast in terms of ﬁnding the optimum value of a function over the space of graphs. However, this function is often expensive to compute exactly. We here present a method derived from the study of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which takes advantage of the regular structure of the space of all graphs on a ﬁxed number of nodes to obtain approximations to the desired function quickly and with reasonable accuracy. We then test this method on both a small testing set and a real-world Bayesian network; the results suggest that not only is this method reasonably accurate, but that the BDe score itself varies quadratically over the space of all graphs. 1</p><p>5 0.1454635 <a title="194-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Model_Selection_in_Gaussian_Graphical_Models%3A_High-Dimensional_Consistency_of_%5Cboldmath%24%5Cell_1%24-regularized_MLE.html">135 nips-2008-Model Selection in Gaussian Graphical Models: High-Dimensional Consistency of \boldmath$\ell 1$-regularized MLE</a></p>
<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the graph structure associated with a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) from i.i.d. samples. We study the performance of study the performance of the ℓ1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimator in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges in the graph s and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the number of samples n. Our main result provides sufﬁcient conditions on (n, p, d) for the ℓ1 -regularized MLE estimator to recover all the edges of the graph with high probability. Under some conditions on the model covariance, we show that model selection can be achieved for sample sizes n = Ω(d2 log(p)), with the error decaying as O(exp(−c log(p))) for some constant c. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations and show good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.</p><p>6 0.1451215 <a title="194-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Co-Clustering_with_Dual_Supervision.html">193 nips-2008-Regularized Co-Clustering with Dual Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Liu Yang, Rong Jin, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption is exploited by most semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, if the unlabeled data is merely weakly related to the target classes, it becomes questionable whether driving the decision boundary to the low density regions of the unlabeled data will help the classiﬁcation. In such case, the cluster assumption may not be valid; and consequently how to leverage this type of unlabeled data to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy becomes a challenge. We introduce “Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data” (SSLW), an inductive method that builds upon the maximum-margin approach, towards a better usage of weakly-related unlabeled information. Although the SSLW could improve a wide range of classiﬁcation tasks, in this paper, we focus on text categorization with a small training pool. The key assumption behind this work is that, even with different topics, the word usage patterns across different corpora tends to be consistent. To this end, SSLW estimates the optimal wordcorrelation matrix that is consistent with both the co-occurrence information derived from the weakly-related unlabeled documents and the labeled documents. For empirical evaluation, we present a direct comparison with a number of stateof-the-art methods for inductive semi-supervised learning and text categorization. We show that SSLW results in a signiﬁcant improvement in categorization accuracy, equipped with a small training set and an unlabeled resource that is weakly related to the test domain.</p><p>3 0.70811701 <a title="194-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Co-Clustering_with_Dual_Supervision.html">193 nips-2008-Regularized Co-Clustering with Dual Supervision</a></p>
<p>Author: Vikas Sindhwani, Jianying Hu, Aleksandra Mojsilovic</p><p>Abstract: By attempting to simultaneously partition both the rows (examples) and columns (features) of a data matrix, Co-clustering algorithms often demonstrate surprisingly impressive performance improvements over traditional one-sided row clustering techniques. A good clustering of features may be seen as a combinatorial transformation of the data matrix, effectively enforcing a form of regularization that may lead to a better clustering of examples (and vice-versa). In many applications, partial supervision in the form of a few row labels as well as column labels may be available to potentially assist co-clustering. In this paper, we develop two novel semi-supervised multi-class classiﬁcation algorithms motivated respectively by spectral bipartite graph partitioning and matrix approximation formulations for co-clustering. These algorithms (i) support dual supervision in the form of labels for both examples and/or features, (ii) provide principled predictive capability on out-of-sample test data, and (iii) arise naturally from the classical Representer theorem applied to regularization problems posed on a collection of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.70579028 <a title="194-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>

For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.72055125 <a title="194-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>4 0.71017408 <a title="194-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>5 0.70213223 <a title="194-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss. This method has several essential properties. First, the degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically. We apply it to several datasets and ﬁnd for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable. 1</p><p>6 0.70213103 <a title="194-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Inferring_rankings_under_constrained_sensing.html">106 nips-2008-Inferring rankings under constrained sensing</a></p>

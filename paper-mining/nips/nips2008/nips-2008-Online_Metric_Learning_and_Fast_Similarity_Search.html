<p>Author: Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: Semantic hashing[1] seeks compact binary codes of data-points so that the Hamming distance between codewords correlates with semantic similarity. In this paper, we show that the problem of ﬁnding a best code for a given dataset is closely related to the problem of graph partitioning and can be shown to be NP hard. By relaxing the original problem, we obtain a spectral method whose solutions are simply a subset of thresholded eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. By utilizing recent results on convergence of graph Laplacian eigenvectors to the Laplace-Beltrami eigenfunctions of manifolds, we show how to eﬃciently calculate the code of a novel datapoint. Taken together, both learning the code and applying it to a novel point are extremely simple. Our experiments show that our codes outperform the state-of-the art. 1</p><p>3 0.18697366 <a title="168-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We describe a primal-dual framework for the design and analysis of online strongly convex optimization algorithms. Our framework yields the tightest known logarithmic regret bounds for Follow-The-Leader and for the gradient descent algorithm proposed in Hazan et al. [2006]. We then show that one can interpolate between these two extreme cases. In particular, we derive a new algorithm that shares the computational simplicity of gradient descent but achieves lower regret in many practical situations. Finally, we further extend our framework for generalized strongly convex functions. 1</p><p>4 0.14908691 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Predictive_Indexing_for_Fast_Search.html">184 nips-2008-Predictive Indexing for Fast Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Sharad Goel, John Langford, Alexander L. Strehl</p><p>Abstract: We tackle the computational problem of query-conditioned search. Given a machine-learned scoring rule and a query distribution, we build a predictive index by precomputing lists of potential results sorted based on an expected score of the result over future queries. The predictive index datastructure supports an anytime algorithm for approximate retrieval of the top elements. The general approach is applicable to webpage ranking, internet advertisement, and approximate nearest neighbor search. It is particularly effective in settings where standard techniques (e.g., inverted indices) are intractable. We experimentally ﬁnd substantial improvement over existing methods for internet advertisement and approximate nearest neighbors. 1</p><p>5 0.13689505 <a title="168-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Learning_of_Switching_Linear_Dynamical_Systems.html">154 nips-2008-Nonparametric Bayesian Learning of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></p>

We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efﬁcient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences.

Kakade, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the generalization properties of online convex programming algorithms when the loss function is Lipschitz and strongly convex. Our main result is a sharp bound, that holds with high probability, on the excess risk of the output of an online algorithm in terms of the average regret. This allows one to use recent algorithms with logarithmic cumulative regret guarantees to achieve fast convergence rates for the excess risk with high probability. As a corollary, we characterize the convergence rate of P EGASOS (with high probability), a recently proposed method for solving the SVM optimization problem. 1</p><p>4 0.43005675 <a title="168-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Learning_of_Switching_Linear_Dynamical_Systems.html">154 nips-2008-Nonparametric Bayesian Learning of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efﬁciently computing pairwise (l2 , l1 ) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modiﬁes the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reﬂect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage in that it is “one-sketch-for-all.” In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efﬁciently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the χ2 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances. We recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval. 1</p><p>6 0.41437325 <a title="168-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) is a probabilistic model for sequences that is able to successfully model (i.e., generate nice-looking samples of) several very high dimensional sequences, such as motion capture data and the pixels of low resolution videos of balls bouncing in a box. The major disadvantage of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difﬁculty has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent TRBM, which is a very slight modiﬁcation of the TRBM for which exact inference is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable. We demonstrate that the RTRBM is better than an analogous TRBM at generating motion capture and videos of bouncing balls. 1</p><p>3 0.60040337 <a title="168-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Fast_High-dimensional_Kernel_Summations_Using_the_Monte_Carlo_Multipole_Method.html">83 nips-2008-Fast High-dimensional Kernel Summations Using the Monte Carlo Multipole Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Dongryeol Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new fast Gaussian summation algorithm for high-dimensional datasets with high accuracy. First, we extend the original fast multipole-type methods to use approximation schemes with both hard and probabilistic error. Second, we utilize a new data structure called subspace tree which maps each data point in the node to its lower dimensional mapping as determined by any linear dimension reduction method such as PCA. This new data structure is suitable for reducing the cost of each pairwise distance computation, the most dominant cost in many kernel methods. Our algorithm guarantees probabilistic relative error on each kernel sum, and can be applied to high-dimensional Gaussian summations which are ubiquitous inside many kernel methods as the key computational bottleneck. We provide empirical speedup results on low to high-dimensional datasets up to 89 dimensions. 1 Fast Gaussian Kernel Summation In this paper, we propose new computational techniques for efﬁciently approximating the following sum for each query point qi ∈ Q: Φ(qi , R) = e−||qi −rj || 2 /(2h2 ) (1) rj ∈R where R is the reference set; each reference point is associated with a Gaussian function with a smoothing parameter h (the ’bandwidth’). This form of summation is ubiquitous in many statistical learning methods, including kernel density estimation, kernel regression, Gaussian process regression, radial basis function networks, spectral clustering, support vector machines, and kernel PCA [1, 4]. Cross-validation in all of these methods require evaluating Equation 1 for multiple values of h. Kernel density estimation, for example, requires |R| density estimate based on |R| − 1 points, yielding a brute-force computational cost scaling quadratically (that is O(|R| 2 )). Error bounds. Due to its expensive computational cost, many algorithms approximate the Gaussian kernel sums at the expense of reduced precision. Therefore, it is natural to discuss error bound criteria which measure the quality of the approximations with respect to their corresponding true values. The following error bound criteria are common in literature: Deﬁnition 1.1. An algorithm guarantees absolute error bound, if for each exact value Φ(q i , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) such that Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ . Deﬁnition 1.2. An algorithm guarantees relative error bound, if for each exact value Φ(q i , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) ∈ R such that Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ |Φ(qi , R)|. 1 Bounding the relative error (e.g., the percentage deviation) is much harder because the error bound criterion is in terms of the initially unknown exact quantity. As a result, many previous methods [7] have focused on bounding the absolute error. The relative error bound criterion is preferred to the absolute error bound criterion in statistical applications in which high accuracy is desired. Our new algorithm will enforce the following “relaxed” form of the relative error bound criterion, whose motivation will be discussed shortly. Deﬁnition 1.3. An algorithm guarantees (1 − α) probabilistic relative error bound, if for each exact value Φ(qi , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) ∈ R, such that with at least probability 0 < 1 − α < 1, Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ |Φ(qi , R)|. Previous work. The most successful class of acceleration methods employ “higher-order divide and conquer” or generalized N -body algorithms (GNA) [4]. This approach can use any spatial partioning tree such as kd-trees or ball-trees for both the query set Q and reference data R and performs a simulataneous recursive descent on both trees. GNA with relative error bounds (Deﬁnition 1.2) [5, 6, 11, 10] utilized bounding boxes and additional cached-sufﬁcient statistics such as higher-order moments needed for series-expansion. [5, 6] utilized bounding-box based error bounds which tend to be very loose, which resulted in slow empirical performance around suboptimally small and large bandwidths. [11, 10] extended GNA-based Gaussian summations with series-expansion which provided tighter bounds; it showed enormous performance improvements, but only up to low dimensional settings (up to D = 5) since the number of required terms in series expansion increases exponentially with respect to D. [9] introduces an iterative sampling based GNA for accelerating the computation of nested sums (a related easier problem). Its speedup is achieved by replacing pessimistic error bounds provided by bounding boxes with normal-based conﬁdence interval from Monte Carlo sampling. [9] demonstrates the speedup many orders of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art in the context of computing aggregates over the queries (such as the LSCV score for selecting the optimal bandwidth). However, the authors did not discuss the sampling-based approach for computations that require per-query estimates, such as those required for kernel density estimation. None of the previous approaches for kernel summations addresses the issue of reducing the computational cost of each distance computation which incurs O(D) cost. However, the intrinsic dimensionality d of most high-dimensional datasets is much smaller than the explicit dimension D (that is, d << D). [12] proposed tree structures using a global dimension reduction method, such as random projection, as a preprocessing step for efﬁcient (1 + ) approximate nearest neighbor search. Similarly, we develop a new data structure for kernel summations; our new data structure is constructed in a top-down fashion to perform the initial spatial partitioning in the original input space R D and performs a local dimension reduction to a localized subset of the data in a bottom-up fashion. This paper. We propose a new fast Gaussian summation algorithm that enables speedup in higher dimensions. Our approach utilizes: 1) probabilistic relative error bounds (Deﬁnition 1.3) on kernel sums provided by Monte Carlo estimates 2) a new tree structure called subspace tree for reducing the computational cost of each distance computation. The former can be seen as relaxing the strict requirement of guaranteeing hard relative bound on very small quantities, as done in [5, 6, 11, 10]. The latter was mentioned as a possible way of ameliorating the effects of the curse of dimensionality in [14], a pioneering paper in this area. Notations. Each query point and reference point (a D-dimensional vector) is indexed by natural numbers i, j ∈ N, and denoted qi and rj respectively. For any set S, |S| denotes the number of elements in S. The entities related to the left and the right child are denoted with superscripts L and R; an internal node N has the child nodes N L and N R . 2 Gaussian Summation by Monte Carlo Sampling Here we describe the extension needed for probabilistic computation of kernel summation satisfying Deﬁnition 1.3. The main routine for the probabilistic kernel summation is shown in Algorithm 1. The function MCMM takes the query node Q and the reference node R (each initially called with the roots of the query tree and the reference tree, Qroot and Rroot ) and β (initially called with α value which controls the probability guarantee that each kernel sum is within relative error). 2 Algorithm 1 The core dual-tree routine for probabilistic Gaussian kernel summation. MCMM(Q, R, β) if C AN S UMMARIZE E XACT(Q, R, ) then S UMMARIZE E XACT(Q, R) else if C AN S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , β) then 5: S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , β) else if Q is a leaf node then if R is a leaf node then MCMMBASE(Q, R) 10: else MCMM Q, RL , β , MCMM Q, RR , β 2 2 else if R is a leaf node then MCMM(QL , R, β), MCMM(QR , R, β) 15: else MCMM QL , RL , β , MCMM QL , RR , β 2 2 MCMM QR , RL , β , MCMM QR , RR , β 2 2 The idea of Monte Carlo sampling used in the new algorithm is similar to the one in [9], except the sampling is done per query and we use approximations that provide hard error bounds as well (i.e. ﬁnite difference, exhaustive base case: MCMMBASE). This means that the approximation has less variance than a pure Monte Carlo approach used in [9]. Algorithm 1 ﬁrst attempts approximations with hard error bounds, which are computationally cheaper than sampling-based approximations. For example, ﬁnite-difference scheme [5, 6] can be used for the C AN S UMMARIZE E XACT and S UMMARIZE E XACT functions in any general dimension. The C AN S UMMARIZE MC function takes two parameters that specify the accuracy: the relative error and its probability guarantee and decides whether to use Monte Carlo sampling for the given pair of nodes. If the reference node R contains too few points, it may be more efﬁcient to process it using exact methods that use error bounds based on bounding primitives on the node pair or exhaustive pair-wise evaluations, which is determined by the condition: τ · minitial ≤ |R| where τ > 1 controls the minimum number of reference points needed for Monte Carlo sampling to proceed. If the reference node does contain enough points, then for each query point q ∈ Q, the S AMPLE routine samples minitial terms over the terms in the summation Φ(q, R) = Kh (||q − rjn ||) rjn ∈R where Φ(q, R) denotes the exact contribution of R to q’s kernel sum. Basically, we are interested in estimating Φ(q, R) by Φ(q, R) = |R|µS , where µS is the sample mean of S. From the Central 2 Limit Theorem, given enough m samples, µS N (µ, σS /m) where Φ(q, R) = |R|µ (i.e. µ is the average of the kernel value between q and any reference point r ∈ R); this implies that √ |µS − µ| ≤ zβ/2 σS / m with probability 1 − β. The pruning rule we have to enforce for each query point for the contribution of R is: σS Φ(q, R) zβ/2 √ ≤ |R| m where σS the sample standard deviation of S. Since Φ(q, R) is one of the unknown quanities we want to compute, we instead enforce the following: σS zβ/2 √ ≤ m Φl (q, R) + |R| µS − |R| zβ/2 σS √ m (2) where Φl (q, R) is the currently running lower bound on the sum computed using exact methods z σ √ and |R| µS − β/2 S is the probabilistic component contributed by R. Denoting Φl,new (q, R) = m zβ/2 σ Φl (q, R) + |R| µS − √ S , the minimum number of samples for q needed to achieve the |S| 3 target error the right side of the inequality in Equation 2 with at least probability of 1 − β is: 2 2 m ≥ zβ/2 σS (|R| + |R|)2 2 (Φl (q, R) + |R|µ )2 S If the given query node and reference node pair cannot be pruned using either nonprobabilistic/probabilistic approximations, then we recurse on a smaller subsets of two sets. In particular, when dividing over the reference node R, we recurse with half of the β value 1 . We now state the probablistic error guarantee of our algorithm as a theorem. Theorem 2.1. After calling MCMM with Q = Qroot , R = Rroot , and β = α, Algorithm 1 approximates each Φ(q, R) with Φ(q, R) such that Deﬁnition 1.3 holds. Proof. For a query/reference (Q, R) pair and 0 < β < 1, MCMMBASE and S UMMARIZE E XACT compute estimates for q ∈ Q such that Φ(q, R) − Φ(q, R) < Φ(q,R)|R| with probability at |R| least 1 > 1 − β. By Equation 2, S UMMARIZE MC computes estimates for q ∈ Q such that Φ(q, R) − Φ(q, R) < Φ(q,R)|R| with probability 1 − β. |R| We now induct on |Q ∪ R|. Line 11 of Algorithm 1 divides over the reference whose subcalls compute estimates that satisfy Φ(q, RL ) − Φ(q, RL ) ≤ Φ(q,R)|RR | |R| L each with at least 1 − β 2 Φ(q,R)|RL | |R| and Φ(q, RR ) − Φ(q, RR ) ≤ probability by induction hypothesis. For q ∈ Q, Φ(q, R) = Φ(q, R )+ Φ(q, R ) which means |Φ(q, R)−Φ(q, R)| ≤ Φ(q,R)|R| with probability at least 1−β. |R| Line 14 divides over the query and each subcall computes estimates that hold with at least probability 1 − β for q ∈ QL and q ∈ QR . Line 16 and 17 divides both over the query and the reference, and the correctness can be proven similarly. Therefore, M CM M (Qroot , Rroot , α) computes estimates satisfying Deﬁnition 1.3. R “Reclaiming” probability. We note that the assigned probability β for the query/reference pair computed with exact bounds (S UMMARIZE E XACT and MCMMBASE) is not used. This portion of the probability can be “reclaimed” in a similar fashion as done in [10] and re-used to prune more aggressively in the later stages of the algorithm. All experiments presented in this paper were beneﬁted by this simple modiﬁcation. 3 Subspace Tree A subspace tree is basically a space-partitioning tree with a set of orthogonal bases associated with each node N : N.Ω = (µ, U, Λ, d) where µ is the mean, U is a D×d matrix whose columns consist of d eigenvectors, and Λ the corresponding eigenvalues. The orthogonal basis set is constructed using a linear dimension reduction method such as PCA. It is constructed in the top-down manner using the PARTITION S ET function dividing the given set of points into two (where the PARTITION S ET function divides along the dimension with the highest variance in case of a kd-tree for example), with the subspace in each node formed in the bottom-up manner. Algorithm 3 shows a PCA tree (a subspace tree using PCA as a dimension reduction) for a 3-D dataset. The subspace of each leaf node is computed using P CA BASE which can use the exact PCA [3] or a stochastic one [2]. For an internal node, the subspaces of the child nodes, N L .Ω = (µL , U L , ΛL , dL ) and N R .Ω = (µR , U R , ΛR , dR ), are approximately merged using the M ERGE S UBSPACES function which involves solving an (d L + dR + 1) × (dL + dR + 1) eigenvalue problem [8], which runs in O((dL + dR + 1)3 ) << O(D 3 ) given that the dataset is sparse. In addition, each data point x in each node N is mapped to its new lower-dimensional coordinate using the orthogonal basis set of N : xproj = U T (x − µ). The L2 norm reconstruction error is given by: ||xrecon − x||2 = ||(U xproj + µ) − x||2 . 2 2 Monte Carlo sampling using a subspace tree. Consider C AN S UMMARIZE MC function in Algorithm 2. The “outer-loop” over this algorithm is over the query set Q, and it would make sense to project each query point q ∈ Q to the subspace owned by the reference node R. Let U and µ be the orthogonal basis system for R consisting of d basis. For each q ∈ Q, consider the squared distance 1 We could also divide β such that the node that may be harder to approximate gets a lower value. 4 Algorithm 2 Monte Carlo sampling based approximation routines. C AN S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , α) S AMPLE(q, R, , α, S, m) return τ · minitial ≤ |R| for k = 1 to m do r ← random point in R S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , α) S ← S ∪ {Kh (||q − r||)} 2 for qi ∈ Q do µS ← M EAN(S), σS ← VARIANCE(S) S ← ∅, m ← minitial zα/2 σS Φl,new (q, R) ← Φl (q, R) + |R| µS − √ repeat |S| 2 S AMPLE(qi , R, , α, S, m) 2 2 mthresh ← zα/2 σS 2 (Φ(|R|+ |R|) S )2 l (q,R)+|R|µ until m ≤ 0 m ← mthresh − |S| Φ(qi , R) ← Φ(qi , R) + |R| · M EAN(S) ||(q − µ) − rproj ||2 (where (q − µ) is q’s coordinates expressed in terms of the coordinate system of R) as shown in Figure 1. For the Gaussian kernel, each pairwise kernel value is approximated as: e−||q−r|| 2 /(2h2 ) ≈ e−||q−qrecon || 2 (3) /(2h2 ) −||qproj −rproj ||2 /(2h2 ) e where qrecon = U qproj +µ and qproj = U (q−µ). For a ﬁxed query point q, e can be precomputed (which takes d dot products between two D-dimensional vectors) and re-used for every distance computation between q and any reference point r ∈ R whose cost is now O(d) << O(D). Therefore, we can take more samples efﬁciently. For a total of sufﬁciently large m samples, the computational cost is O(d(D + m)) << O(D · m) for each query point. −||q−qrecon ||2 /(2h2 ) T Increased variance comes at the cost of inexact distance computations, however. Each distance computation incurs at most squared L2 norm of ||rrecon − r||2 error. That is, 2 ||q − rrecon ||2 − ||q − r||2 ≤ ||rrecon − r||2 . Neverhteless, the sample variance for each query 2 2 2 point plus the inexactness due to dimension reduction τS can be shown to be bounded for the Gaus2 2 sian kernel as: (where each s = e−||q−rrecon || /(2h ) ): 1 m−1 ≤ 1 m−1 s∈S s2 − m · µ 2 S s2 + τS 2 min 1, max e||rrecon −r||2 /h s∈S r∈R 2 2 − m µS min e−||rrecon −r||2 /(2h 2 2 ) r∈R Exhaustive computations using a subspace tree. Now suppose we have built subspace trees for the query and the reference sets. We can project either each query point onto the reference subspace, or each reference point onto the query subspace, depending on which subspace has a smaller dimension and the number of points in each node. The subspaces formed in the leaf nodes usually are highly numerically accurate since it contains very few points compared to the extrinsic dimensionality D. 4 Experimental Results We empirically evaluated the runtime performance of our algorithm on seven real-world datasets, scaled to ﬁt in [0, 1]D hypercube, for approximating the Gaussian sum at every query point with a range of bandwidths. This experiment is motivated by many kernel methods that require computing the Gaussian sum at different bandwidth values (according to the standard least-sqares crossvalidation scores [15]). Nevertheless, we emphasize that the acceleration results are applicable to other kernel methods that require efﬁcient Gaussian summation. In this paper, the reference set equals the query set. All datasets have 50K points so that the exact exhaustive method can be tractably computed. All times are in seconds and include the time needed to build the trees. Codes are in C/C++ and run on a dual Intel Xeon 3GHz with 8 Gb of main memory. The measurements in second to eigth columns are obtained by running the algorithms at the bandwidth kh∗ where 10−3 ≤ k ≤ 103 is the constant in the corresponding column header. The last columns denote the total time needed to run on all seven bandwidth values. Each table has results for ﬁve algorithms: the naive algorithm and four algorithms. The algorithms with p = 1 denote the previous state-of-the-art (ﬁnite-difference with error redistribution) [10], 5 Algorithm 3 PCA tree building routine.

Each entry has the running time and the percentage of the query points that did not satisfy the relative error . Analysis. Readers should focus on the last columns containing the total time needed for evaluating Gaussian sum at all points for seven different bandwidth values. This is indicated by boldfaced numbers for our probabilistic algorithm. As expected, On low-dimensional datasets (below 6 dimensions), the algorithm using series-expansion based bounds gives two to three times speedup compared to our approach that uses Monte Carlo sampling. Multipole moments are an effective form of compression in low dimensions with analytical error bounds that can be evaluated; our Monte Carlo-based method has an asymptotic error bound which must be “learned” through sampling. As we go from 7 dimensions and beyond, series-expansion cannot be done efﬁciently because of its slow convergence. Our probabilistic algorithm (p = 0.9) using Monte Carlo consistently performs better than the algorithm using exact bounds (p = 1) by at least a factor of two. Compared to naive, it achieves the maximum speedup of about nine times on an 16-dimensional dataset; on an 89-dimensional dataset, it is at least three times as fast as the naive. Note that all the datasets contain only 50K points, and the speedup will be more dramatic as we increase the number of points. 5 Conclusion We presented an extension to fast multipole methods to use approximation methods with both hard and probabilistic bounds. Our experimental results show speedup over the previous state-of-the-art on high-dimensional datasets. Our future work will include possible improvements inspired by a recent work done in the FMM community using a matrix-factorization formulation [13]. Figure 1: Left: A PCA-tree for a 3-D dataset. Right: The squared Euclidean distance between a given query point and a reference point projected onto a subspace can be decomposed into two components: the orthogonal component and the component in the subspace. 6 Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Σ mockgalaxy-D-1M-rnd (cosmology: positions), D = 3, N = 50000, h ∗ = 0.000768201 Naive 182 182 182 182 182 182 182 1274 MCMM 3 3 5 10 26 48 2 97 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 1% 5% DFGT 2 2 2 2 6 19 3 36 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 3 3 4 11 27 58 21 127 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 1% 1% 1% 1% 7% DFGT 2 2 2 2 7 30 5 50 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Σ bio5-rnd (biology: drug activity), D = 5, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.000567161 Naive 214 214 214 214 214 214 214 1498 MCMM 4 4 6 144 149 65 1 373 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 0% 0% 1% 0% 1% DFGT 4 4 5 24 96 65 2 200 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 4 4 6 148 165 126 1 454 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 0% 0% 1% 0% 1% DFGT 4 4 5 25 139 126 4 307 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Σ pall7 − rnd , D = 7, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.00131865 Naive 327 327 327 327 327 327 327 2289 MCMM 3 3 3 3 63 224 <1 300 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 0% 1% 1% 12 % 0% DFGT 10 10 11 14 84 263 223 615 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 3 3 3 3 70 265 5 352 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 0% 1% 2% 1% 8% DFGT 10 10 11 14 85 299 374 803 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Σ covtype − rnd , D = 10, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.0154758 Naive 380 380 380 380 380 380 380 2660 MCMM 11 11 13 39 318 <1 <1 381 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 0% 1% 0% 0% 0% DFGT 26 27 38 177 390 244 <1 903 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 11 11 13 77 362 2 <1 477 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 0% 1% 1% 10 % 0% DFGT 26 27 38 180 427 416 <1 1115 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 Σ CoocTexture − rnd , D = 16, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.0263958 Naive 472 472 472 472 472 472 472 3304 MCMM 10 11 22 189 109 <1 <1 343 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 0% 1% 8% 0% 0% DFGT 22 26 82 240 452 66 <1 889 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 10 11 22 204 285 <1 <1 534 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 1% 1% 10 % 4% 0% DFGT 22 26 83 254 543 230 <1 1159 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 7 Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 LayoutHistogram − rnd , D = 32, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.0609892 Naive 757 757 757 757 757 757 757 MCMM 32 32 54 168 583 8 8 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 1% 1% 1% 0% 0% DFGT 153 159 221 492 849 212 <1 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 32 45 60 183 858 8 8 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 1% 6% 1% 0% 0% DFGT 153 159 222 503 888 659 <1 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Algorithm \ scale 0.001 0.01 0.1 1 10 100 1000 CorelCombined − rnd , D = 89, N = 50000, h∗ = 0.0512583 Naive 1716 1716 1716 1716 1716 1716 1716 MCMM 384 418 575 428 1679 17 17 ( = 0.1, p = 0.9) 0% 0% 0% 1% 10 % 0% 0% DFGT 659 677 864 1397 1772 836 17 ( = 0.1, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% MCMM 401 419 575 437 1905 17 17 ( = 0.01, p = 0.9) 0 % 0% 0% 1% 2% 0% 0% DFGT 659 677 865 1425 1794 1649 17 ( = 0.01, p = 1) 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% 0% Σ 5299 885 2087 1246 2585 Σ 12012 3518 6205 3771 7086 References [1] Nando de Freitas, Yang Wang, Maryam Mahdaviani, and Dustin Lang.

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted (CW) learning [6], an online learning method for linear classiﬁers, maintains a Gaussian distributions over weight vectors, with a covariance matrix that represents uncertainty about weights and correlations. Conﬁdence constraints ensure that a weight vector drawn from the hypothesis distribution correctly classiﬁes examples with a speciﬁed probability. Within this framework, we derive a new convex form of the constraint and analyze it in the mistake bound model. Empirical evaluation with both synthetic and text data shows our version of CW learning achieves lower cumulative and out-of-sample errors than commonly used ﬁrst-order and second-order online methods. 1</p><p>5 0.44823879 <a title="168-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>6 0.4454591 <a title="168-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Tracking_Changing_Stimuli_in_Continuous_Attractor_Neural_Networks.html">240 nips-2008-Tracking Changing Stimuli in Continuous Attractor Neural Networks</a></p>

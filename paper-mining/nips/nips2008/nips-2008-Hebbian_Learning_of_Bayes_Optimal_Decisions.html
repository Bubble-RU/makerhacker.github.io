<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss. This method has several essential properties. First, the degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically. We apply it to several datasets and ﬁnd for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable. 1</p><p>4 0.16828576 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.12253753 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-MAS%3A_a_multiplicative_approximation_scheme_for_probabilistic_inference.html">129 nips-2008-MAS: a multiplicative approximation scheme for probabilistic inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Ydo Wexler, Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multiplicative approximation scheme (MAS) for inference problems in graphical models, which can be applied to various inference algorithms. The method uses -decompositions which decompose functions used throughout the inference procedure into functions over smaller sets of variables with a known error . MAS translates these local approximations into bounds on the accuracy of the results. We show how to optimize -decompositions and provide a fast closed-form solution for an L2 approximation. Applying MAS to the Variable Elimination inference algorithm, we introduce an algorithm we call DynaDecomp which is extremely fast in practice and provides guaranteed error bounds on the result. The superior accuracy and efﬁciency of DynaDecomp is demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.12184014 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Kernel_Shaping_for_Learning_Control.html">32 nips-2008-Bayesian Kernel Shaping for Learning Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Mehmet K. Muezzinoglu, Alexander Vergara, Ramon Huerta, Thomas Nowotny, Nikolai Rulkov, Henry Abarbanel, Allen Selverston, Mikhail Rabinovich</p><p>Abstract: The odor transduction process has a large time constant and is susceptible to various types of noise. Therefore, the olfactory code at the sensor/receptor level is in general a slow and highly variable indicator of the input odor in both natural and artiﬁcial situations. Insects overcome this problem by using a neuronal device in their Antennal Lobe (AL), which transforms the identity code of olfactory receptors to a spatio-temporal code. This transformation improves the decision of the Mushroom Bodies (MBs), the subsequent classiﬁer, in both speed and accuracy. Here we propose a rate model based on two intrinsic mechanisms in the insect AL, namely integration and inhibition. Then we present a MB classiﬁer model that resembles the sparse and random structure of insect MB. A local Hebbian learning procedure governs the plasticity in the model. These formulations not only help to understand the signal conditioning and classiﬁcation methods of insect olfactory systems, but also can be leveraged in synthetic problems. Among them, we consider here the discrimination of odor mixtures from pure odors. We show on a set of records from metal-oxide gas sensors that the cascade of these two new models facilitates fast and accurate discrimination of even highly imbalanced mixtures from pure odors. 1</p><p>5 0.52352536 <a title="96-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Fitted_Q-iteration_by_Advantage_Weighted_Regression.html">87 nips-2008-Fitted Q-iteration by Advantage Weighted Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerhard Neumann, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Recently, ﬁtted Q-iteration (FQI) based methods have become more popular due to their increased sample efﬁciency, a more stable learning process and the higher quality of the resulting policy. However, these methods remain hard to use for continuous action spaces which frequently occur in real-world tasks, e.g., in robotics and other technical applications. The greedy action selection commonly used for the policy improvement step is particularly problematic as it is expensive for continuous actions, can cause an unstable learning process, introduces an optimization bias and results in highly non-smooth policies unsuitable for real-world systems. In this paper, we show that by using a soft-greedy action selection the policy improvement step used in FQI can be simpliﬁed to an inexpensive advantageweighted regression. With this result, we are able to derive a new, computationally efﬁcient FQI algorithm which can even deal with high dimensional action spaces. 1</p><p>6 0.46710142 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Selective attention is a most intensively studied psychological phenomenon, rife with theoretical suggestions and schisms. A critical idea is that of limited capacity, the allocation of which has produced continual conﬂict about such phenomena as early and late selection. An inﬂuential resolution of this debate is based on the notion of perceptual load (Lavie, 2005), which suggests that low-load, easy tasks, because they underuse the total capacity of attention, mandatorily lead to the processing of stimuli that are irrelevant to the current attentional set; whereas high-load, difﬁcult tasks grab all resources for themselves, leaving distractors high and dry. We argue that this theory presents a challenge to Bayesian theories of attention, and suggest an alternative, statistical, account of key supporting data. 1</p><p>2 0.87442535 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Near-optimal_Regret_Bounds_for_Reinforcement_Learning.html">150 nips-2008-Near-optimal Regret Bounds for Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Auer, Thomas Jaksch, Ronald Ortner</p><p>Abstract: For undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) we consider the total regret of a learning algorithm with respect to an optimal policy. In order to describe the transition structure of an MDP we propose a new parameter: An MDP has diameter D if for any pair of states s, s there is a policy which moves from s to s in at most D steps (on average). We present a rein√ ˜ forcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DS AT ) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. This bound holds with high probability. We also present a corresponding lower bound of √ Ω( DSAT ) on the total regret of any learning algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.85090142 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-A_mixture_model_for_the_evolution_of_gene_expression_in_non-homogeneous_datasets.html">9 nips-2008-A mixture model for the evolution of gene expression in non-homogeneous datasets</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerald Quon, Yee W. Teh, Esther Chan, Timothy Hughes, Michael Brudno, Quaid D. Morris</p><p>Abstract: We address the challenge of assessing conservation of gene expression in complex, non-homogeneous datasets. Recent studies have demonstrated the success of probabilistic models in studying the evolution of gene expression in simple eukaryotic organisms such as yeast, for which measurements are typically scalar and independent. Models capable of studying expression evolution in much more complex organisms such as vertebrates are particularly important given the medical and scientiﬁc interest in species such as human and mouse. We present Brownian Factor Phylogenetic Analysis, a statistical model that makes a number of signiﬁcant extensions to previous models to enable characterization of changes in expression among highly complex organisms. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our method on a microarray dataset proﬁling diverse tissues from multiple vertebrate species. We anticipate that the model will be invaluable in the study of gene expression patterns in other diverse organisms as well, such as worms and insects. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.83405018 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Hebbian_Learning_of_Bayes_Optimal_Decisions.html">96 nips-2008-Hebbian Learning of Bayes Optimal Decisions</a></p>

In particular we show that recent experimental results by Yang and Shadlen [1] on reinforcement learning of probabilistic inference in primates can be modeled in this way. 1</p><p>5 0.75630927 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-From_Online_to_Batch_Learning_with_Cutoff-Averaging.html">88 nips-2008-From Online to Batch Learning with Cutoff-Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel</p><p>Abstract: We present cutoff averaging, a technique for converting any conservative online learning algorithm into a batch learning algorithm. Most online-to-batch conversion techniques work well with certain types of online learning algorithms and not with others, whereas cutoff averaging explicitly tries to adapt to the characteristics of the online algorithm being converted. An attractive property of our technique is that it preserves the efﬁciency of the original online algorithm, making it appropriate for large-scale learning problems. We provide a statistical analysis of our technique and back our theoretical claims with experimental results. 1</p><p>6 0.75390387 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Smith, Hongyuan Zha, Xiao-ming Wu</p><p>Abstract: We study the convergence and the rate of convergence of a local manifold learning algorithm: LTSA [13]. The main technical tool is the perturbation analysis on the linear invariant subspace that corresponds to the solution of LTSA. We derive a worst-case upper bound of errors for LTSA which naturally leads to a convergence result. We then derive the rate of convergence for LTSA in a special case. 1</p><p>3 0.054318503 <a title="126-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Non-parametric_Regression_Between_Manifolds.html">151 nips-2008-Non-parametric Regression Between Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: This paper discusses non-parametric regression between Riemannian manifolds. This learning problem arises frequently in many application areas ranging from signal processing, computer vision, over robotics to computer graphics. We present a new algorithmic scheme for the solution of this general learning problem based on regularized empirical risk minimization. The regularization functional takes into account the geometry of input and output manifold, and we show that it implements a prior which is particularly natural. Moreover, we demonstrate that our algorithm performs well in a difﬁcult surface registration problem. 1</p><p>4 0.053887796 <a title="126-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Learning_with_Networks_of_Features.html">194 nips-2008-Regularized Learning with Networks of Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ted Sandler, John Blitzer, Partha P. Talukdar, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature’s weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.05314086 <a title="126-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Generative_versus_discriminative_training_of_RBMs_for_classification_of_fMRI_images.html">92 nips-2008-Generative versus discriminative training of RBMs for classification of fMRI images</a></p>
<p>Author: Tanya Schmah, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Steven L. Small, Stephen Strother, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Neuroimaging datasets often have a very large number of voxels and a very small number of training cases, which means that overﬁtting of models for this data can become a very serious problem. Working with a set of fMRI images from a study on stroke recovery, we consider a classiﬁcation task for which logistic regression performs poorly, even when L1- or L2- regularized. We show that much better discrimination can be achieved by ﬁtting a generative model to each separate condition and then seeing which model is most likely to have generated the data. We compare discriminative training of exactly the same set of models, and we also consider convex blends of generative and discriminative training. 1</p><p>6 0.05269257 <a title="126-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Designing_neurophysiology_experiments_to_optimally_constrain_receptive_field_models_along_parametric_submanifolds.html">60 nips-2008-Designing neurophysiology experiments to optimally constrain receptive field models along parametric submanifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Walder, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach to constructing meaningful lower dimensional representations of sets of data points. We argue that constraining the mapping between the high and low dimensional spaces to be a diffeomorphism is a natural way of ensuring that pairwise distances are approximately preserved. Accordingly we develop an algorithm which diffeomorphically maps the data near to a lower dimensional subspace and then projects onto that subspace. The problem of solving for the mapping is transformed into one of solving for an Eulerian ﬂow ﬁeld which we compute using ideas from kernel methods. We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of our approach on various real world data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.58110911 <a title="126-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Designing_neurophysiology_experiments_to_optimally_constrain_receptive_field_models_along_parametric_submanifolds.html">60 nips-2008-Designing neurophysiology experiments to optimally constrain receptive field models along parametric submanifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Lewi, Robert Butera, David M. Schneider, Sarah Woolley, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Sequential optimal design methods hold great promise for improving the efﬁciency of neurophysiology experiments. However, previous methods for optimal experimental design have incorporated only weak prior information about the underlying neural system (e.g., the sparseness or smoothness of the receptive ﬁeld). Here we describe how to use stronger prior information, in the form of parametric models of the receptive ﬁeld, in order to construct optimal stimuli and further improve the efﬁciency of our experiments. For example, if we believe that the receptive ﬁeld is well-approximated by a Gabor function, then our method constructs stimuli that optimally constrain the Gabor parameters (orientation, spatial frequency, etc.) using as few experimental trials as possible. More generally, we may believe a priori that the receptive ﬁeld lies near a known sub-manifold of the full parameter space; in this case, our method chooses stimuli in order to reduce the uncertainty along the tangent space of this sub-manifold as rapidly as possible. Applications to simulated and real data indicate that these methods may in many cases improve the experimental efﬁciency. 1</p><p>6 0.57282811 <a title="126-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-QUIC-SVD%3A_Fast_SVD_Using_Cosine_Trees.html">188 nips-2008-QUIC-SVD: Fast SVD Using Cosine Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Our setting is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with continuous state, observation and action spaces. Decisions are based on a Particle Filter for estimating the belief state given past observations. We consider a policy gradient approach for parameterized policy optimization. For that purpose, we investigate sensitivity analysis of the performance measure with respect to the parameters of the policy, focusing on Finite Difference (FD) techniques. We show that the naive FD is subject to variance explosion because of the non-smoothness of the resampling procedure. We propose a more sophisticated FD method which overcomes this problem and establish its consistency. 1</p><p>2 0.63583481 <a title="126-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Reducing_statistical_dependencies_in_natural_signals_using_radial_Gaussianization.html">192 nips-2008-Reducing statistical dependencies in natural signals using radial Gaussianization</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of transforming a signal to a representation in which the components are statistically independent. When the signal is generated as a linear transformation of independent Gaussian or non-Gaussian sources, the solution may be computed using a linear transformation (PCA or ICA, respectively). Here, we consider a complementary case, in which the source is non-Gaussian but elliptically symmetric. Such a source cannot be decomposed into independent components using a linear transform, but we show that a simple nonlinear transformation, which we call radial Gaussianization (RG), is able to remove all dependencies. We apply this methodology to natural signals, demonstrating that the joint distributions of nearby bandpass ﬁlter responses, for both sounds and images, are closer to being elliptically symmetric than linearly transformed factorial sources. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the reduction in dependency achieved by applying RG to either pairs or blocks of bandpass ﬁlter responses is signiﬁcantly greater than that achieved by PCA or ICA.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.61300409 <a title="126-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Localized_Sliced_Inverse_Regression.html">126 nips-2008-Localized Sliced Inverse Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Xu, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we aim to train deep neural networks for rapid visual recognition. The task is highly challenging, largely due to the lack of a meaningful regularizer on the functions realized by the networks. We propose a novel regularization method that takes advantage of kernel methods, where an oracle kernel function represents prior knowledge about the recognition task of interest. We derive an efﬁcient algorithm using stochastic gradient descent, and demonstrate encouraging results on a wide range of recognition tasks, in terms of both accuracy and speed. 1</p><p>5 0.47969678 <a title="126-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.47333091 <a title="126-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Mixed_Membership_Stochastic_Blockmodels.html">134 nips-2008-Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels</a></p>

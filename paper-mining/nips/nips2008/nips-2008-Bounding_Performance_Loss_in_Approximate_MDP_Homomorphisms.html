<p>Author: Peter Auer, Thomas Jaksch, Ronald Ortner</p><p>Abstract: For undiscounted reinforcement learning in Markov decision processes (MDPs) we consider the total regret of a learning algorithm with respect to an optimal policy. In order to describe the transition structure of an MDP we propose a new parameter: An MDP has diameter D if for any pair of states s, s there is a policy which moves from s to s in at most D steps (on average). We present a rein√ ˜ forcement learning algorithm with total regret O(DS AT ) after T steps for any unknown MDP with S states, A actions per state, and diameter D. This bound holds with high probability. We also present a corresponding lower bound of √ Ω( DSAT ) on the total regret of any learning algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.15018946 <a title="39-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-MDPs_with_Non-Deterministic_Policies.html">131 nips-2008-MDPs with Non-Deterministic Policies</a></p>
<p>Author: Mahdi M. Fard, Joelle Pineau</p><p>Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been extensively studied and used in the context of planning and decision-making, and many methods exist to ﬁnd the optimal policy for problems modelled as MDPs. Although ﬁnding the optimal policy is sufﬁcient in many domains, in certain applications such as decision support systems where the policy is executed by a human (rather than a machine), ﬁnding all possible near-optimal policies might be useful as it provides more ﬂexibility to the person executing the policy. In this paper we introduce the new concept of non-deterministic MDP policies, and address the question of ﬁnding near-optimal non-deterministic policies. We propose two solutions to this problem, one based on a Mixed Integer Program and the other one based on a search algorithm. We include experimental results obtained from applying this framework to optimize treatment choices in the context of a medical decision support system. 1</p><p>4 0.086267561 <a title="39-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Multi-resolution_Exploration_in_Continuous_Spaces.html">144 nips-2008-Multi-resolution Exploration in Continuous Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Nouri, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: The essence of exploration is acting to try to decrease uncertainty. We propose a new methodology for representing uncertainty in continuous-state control problems. Our approach, multi-resolution exploration (MRE), uses a hierarchical mapping to identify regions of the state space that would beneﬁt from additional samples. We demonstrate MRE’s broad utility by using it to speed up learning in a prototypical model-based and value-based reinforcement-learning method. Empirical results show that MRE improves upon state-of-the-art exploration approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.081566684 <a title="39-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Empirical_performance_maximization_for_linear_rank_statistics.html">72 nips-2008-Empirical performance maximization for linear rank statistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: The ROC curve is known to be the golden standard for measuring performance of a test/scoring statistic regarding its capacity of discrimination between two populations in a wide variety of applications, ranging from anomaly detection in signal processing to information retrieval, through medical diagnosis. Most practical performance measures used in scoring applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be seen as summaries of the ROC curve. This paper highlights the fact that many of these empirical criteria can be expressed as (conditional) linear rank statistics. We investigate the properties of empirical maximizers of such performance criteria and provide preliminary results for the concentration properties of a novel class of random variables that we will call a linear rank process. 1</p><p>6 0.080244407 <a title="39-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Policy_Iteration.html">195 nips-2008-Regularized Policy Iteration</a></p>

In order to implement a ﬂexible function approximation scheme we propose the use of non-parametric methods with regularization, providing a convenient way to control the complexity of the function approximator. We propose two novel regularized policy iteration algorithms by adding L2 -regularization to two widely-used policy evaluation methods: Bellman residual minimization (BRM) and least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). We derive efﬁcient implementation for our algorithms when the approximate value-functions belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.

<p>Author: Richard S. Sutton, Hamid R. Maei, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the ﬁrst temporal-difference learning algorithm that is stable with linear function approximation and off-policy training, for any ﬁnite Markov decision process, behavior policy, and target policy, and whose complexity scales linearly in the number of parameters. We consider an i.i.d. policy-evaluation setting in which the data need not come from on-policy experience. The gradient temporal-difference (GTD) algorithm estimates the expected update vector of the TD(0) algorithm and performs stochastic gradient descent on its L2 norm. We prove that this algorithm is stable and convergent under the usual stochastic approximation conditions to the same least-squares solution as found by the LSTD, but without LSTD’s quadratic computational complexity. GTD is online and incremental, and does not involve multiplying by products of likelihood ratios as in importance-sampling methods. 1 Off-policy learning methods Off-policy methods have an important role to play in the larger ambitions of modern reinforcement learning. In general, updates to a statistic of a dynamical process are said to be “off-policy” if their distribution does not match the dynamics of the process, particularly if the mismatch is due to the way actions are chosen. The prototypical example in reinforcement learning is the learning of the value function for one policy, the target policy, using data obtained while following another policy, the behavior policy. For example, the popular Q-learning algorithm (Watkins 1989) is an offpolicy temporal-difference algorithm in which the target policy is greedy with respect to estimated action values, and the behavior policy is something more exploratory, such as a corresponding greedy policy. Off-policy methods are also critical to reinforcement-learning-based efforts to model human-level world knowledge and state representations as predictions of option outcomes (e.g., Sutton, Precup & Singh 1999; Sutton, Rafols & Koop 2006). Unfortunately, off-policy methods such as Q-learning are not sound when used with approximations that are linear in the learned parameters—the most popular form of function approximation in reinforcement learning. Counterexamples have been known for many years (e.g., Baird 1995) in which Q-learning’s parameters diverge to inﬁnity for any positive step size. This is a severe problem in so far as function approximation is widely viewed as necessary for large-scale applications of reinforcement learning. The need is so great that practitioners have often simply ignored the problem and continued to use Q-learning with linear function approximation anyway. Although no instances ∗ Csaba Szepesv´ ri is on leave from MTA SZTAKI. a 1 of absolute divergence in applications have been reported in the literature, the potential for instability is disturbing and probably belies real but less obvious problems. The stability problem is not speciﬁc to reinforcement learning. Classical dynamic programming methods such as value and policy iteration are also off-policy methods and also diverge on some problems when used with linear function approximation. Reinforcement learning methods are actually an improvement over conventional dynamic programming methods in that at least they can be used stably with linear function approximation in their on-policy form. The stability problem is also not due to the interaction of control and prediction, or to stochastic approximation effects; the simplest counterexamples are for deterministic, expected-value-style, synchronous policy evaluation (see Baird 1995; Sutton & Barto 1998). Prior to the current work, the possibility of instability could not be avoided whenever four individually desirable algorithmic features were combined: 1) off-policy updates, 2) temporal-difference learning, 3) linear function approximation, and 4) linear complexity in memory and per-time-step computation. If any one of these four is abandoned, then stable methods can be obtained relatively easily. But each feature brings value and practitioners are loath to give any of them up, as we discuss later in a penultimate related-work section. In this paper we present the ﬁrst algorithm to achieve all four desirable features and be stable and convergent for all ﬁnite Markov decision processes, all target and behavior policies, and all feature representations for the linear approximator. Moreover, our algorithm does not use importance sampling and can be expected to be much better conditioned and of lower variance than importance sampling methods. Our algorithm can be viewed as performing stochastic gradient-descent in a novel objective function whose optimum is the least-squares TD solution. Our algorithm is also incremental and suitable for online use just as are simple temporaldifference learning algorithms such as Q-learning and TD(λ) (Sutton 1988). Our algorithm can be broadly characterized as a gradient-descent version of TD(0), and accordingly we call it GTD(0). 2 Sub-sampling and i.i.d. formulations of temporal-difference learning In this section we formulate the off-policy policy-evaluation problem for one-step temporaldifference learning such that the data consists of independent, identically-distributed (i.i.d.) samples. We start by considering the standard reinforcement learning framework, in which a learning agent interacts with an environment consisting of a ﬁnite Markov decision process (MDP). At each of a sequence of discrete time steps, t = 1, 2, . . ., the environment is in a state st ∈ S, the agent chooses an action at ∈ A, and then the environment emits a reward rt ∈ R, and transitions to its next state st+1 ∈ S. The state and action sets are ﬁnite. State transitions are stochastic and dependent on the immediately preceding state and action. Rewards are stochastic and dependent on the preceding state and action, and on the next state. The agent process generating the actions is termed the behavior policy. To start, we assume a deterministic target policy π : S → A. The objective is to learn an approximation to its state-value function: ∞ V π (s) = Eπ γ t−1 rt |s1 = s , (1) t=1 where γ ∈ [0, 1) is the discount rate. The learning is to be done without knowledge of the process dynamics and from observations of a single continuous trajectory with no resets. In many problems of interest the state set is too large for it to be practical to approximate the value of each state individually. Here we consider linear function approximation, in which states are mapped to feature vectors with fewer components than the number of states. That is, for each state s ∈ S there is a corresponding feature vector φ(s) ∈ Rn , with n |S|. The approximation to the value function is then required to be linear in the feature vectors and a corresponding parameter vector θ ∈ Rn : V π (s) ≈ θ φ(s). (2) Further, we assume that the states st are not visible to the learning agent in any way other than through the feature vectors. Thus this function approximation formulation can include partialobservability formulations such as POMDPs as a special case. The environment and the behavior policy together generate a stream of states, actions and rewards, s1 , a1 , r1 , s2 , a2 , r2 , . . ., which we can break into causally related 4-tuples, (s1 , a1 , r1 , s1 ), 2 (s2 , a2 , r2 , s2 ), . . . , where st = st+1 . For some tuples, the action will match what the target policy would do in that state, and for others it will not. We can discard all of the latter as not relevant to the target policy. For the former, we can discard the action because it can be determined from the state via the target policy. With a slight abuse of notation, let sk denote the kth state in which an on-policy action was taken, and let rk and sk denote the associated reward and next state. The kth on-policy transition, denoted (sk , rk , sk ), is a triple consisting of the starting state of the transition, the reward on the transition, and the ending state of the transition. The corresponding data available to the learning algorithm is the triple (φ(sk ), rk , φ(sk )). The MDP under the behavior policy is assumed to be ergodic, so that it determines a stationary state-occupancy distribution µ(s) = limk→∞ P r{sk = s}. For any state s, the MDP and target policy together determine an N × N state-transition-probability matrix P , where pss = P r{sk = s |sk = s}, and an N × 1 expected-reward vector R, where Rs = E[rk |sk = s]. These two together completely characterize the statistics of on-policy transitions, and all the samples in the sequence of (φ(sk ), rk , φ(sk )) respect these statistics. The problem still has a Markov structure in that there are temporal dependencies between the sample transitions. In our analysis we ﬁrst consider a formulation without such dependencies, the i.i.d. case, and then prove that our results extend to the original case. In the i.i.d. formulation, the states sk are generated independently and identically distributed according to an arbitrary probability distribution µ. From each sk , a corresponding sk is generated according to the on-policy state-transition matrix, P , and a corresponding rk is generated according to an arbitrary bounded distribution with expected value Rsk . The ﬁnal i.i.d. data sequence, from which an approximate value function is to be learned, is then the sequence (φ(sk ), rk , φ(sk )), for k = 1, 2, . . . Further, because each sample is i.i.d., we can remove the indices and talk about a single tuple of random variables (φ, r, φ ) drawn from µ. It remains to deﬁne the objective of learning. The TD error for the linear setting is δ = r + γθ φ − θ φ. (3) Given this, we deﬁne the one-step linear TD solution as any value of θ at which 0 = E[δφ] = −Aθ + b, (4) where A = E φ(φ − γφ ) and b = E[rφ]. This is the parameter value to which the linear TD(0) algorithm (Sutton 1988) converges under on-policy training, as well as the value found by LSTD(0) (Bradtke & Barto 1996) under both on-policy and off-policy training. The TD solution is always a ﬁxed-point of the linear TD(0) algorithm, but under off-policy training it may not be stable; if θ does not exactly satisfy (4), then the TD(0) algorithm may cause it to move away in expected value and eventually diverge to inﬁnity. 3 The GTD(0) algorithm We next present the idea and gradient-descent derivation leading to the GTD(0) algorithm. As discussed above, the vector E[δφ] can be viewed as an error in the current solution θ. The vector should be zero, so its norm is a measure of how far we are away from the TD solution. A distinctive feature of our gradient-descent analysis of temporal-difference learning is that we use as our objective function the L2 norm of this vector: J(θ) = E[δφ] E[δφ] . (5) This objective function is quadratic and unimodal; it’s minimum value of 0 is achieved when E[δφ] = 0, which can always be achieved. The gradient of this objective function is θ J(θ) = 2( = 2E φ( θ E[δφ])E[δφ] θ δ) E[δφ] = −2E φ(φ − γφ ) E[δφ] . (6) This last equation is key to our analysis. We would like to take a stochastic gradient-descent approach, in which a small change is made on each sample in such a way that the expected update 3 is the direction opposite to the gradient. This is straightforward if the gradient can be written as a single expected value, but here we have a product of two expected values. One cannot sample both of them because the sample product will be biased by their correlation. However, one could store a long-term, quasi-stationary estimate of either of the expectations and then sample the other. The question is, which expectation should be estimated and stored, and which should be sampled? Both ways seem to lead to interesting learning algorithms. First let us consider the algorithm obtained by forming and storing a separate estimate of the ﬁrst expectation, that is, of the matrix A = E φ(φ − γφ ) . This matrix is straightforward to estimate from experience as a simple arithmetic average of all previously observed sample outer products φ(φ − γφ ) . Note that A is a stationary statistic in any ﬁxed-policy policy-evaluation problem; it does not depend on θ and would not need to be re-estimated if θ were to change. Let Ak be the estimate of A after observing the ﬁrst k samples, (φ1 , r1 , φ1 ), . . . , (φk , rk , φk ). Then this algorithm is deﬁned by k 1 Ak = φi (φi − γφi ) (7) k i=1 along with the gradient descent rule: θk+1 = θk + αk Ak δk φk , k ≥ 1, (8) where θ1 is arbitrary, δk = rk + γθk φk − θk φk , and αk > 0 is a series of step-size parameters, possibly decreasing over time. We call this algorithm A TD(0) because it is essentially conventional TD(0) preﬁxed by an estimate of the matrix A . Although we ﬁnd this algorithm interesting, we do not consider it further here because it requires O(n2 ) memory and computation per time step. The second path to a stochastic-approximation algorithm for estimating the gradient (6) is to form and store an estimate of the second expectation, the vector E[δφ], and to sample the ﬁrst expectation, E φ(φ − γφ ) . Let uk denote the estimate of E[δφ] after observing the ﬁrst k − 1 samples, with u1 = 0. The GTD(0) algorithm is deﬁned by uk+1 = uk + βk (δk φk − uk ) (9) and θk+1 = θk + αk (φk − γφk )φk uk , (10) where θ1 is arbitrary, δk is as in (3) using θk , and αk > 0 and βk > 0 are step-size parameters, possibly decreasing over time. Notice that if the product is formed right-to-left, then the entire computation is O(n) per time step. 4 Convergence The purpose of this section is to establish that GTD(0) converges with probability one to the TD solution in the i.i.d. problem formulation under standard assumptions. In particular, we have the following result: Theorem 4.1 (Convergence of GTD(0)). Consider the GTD(0) iteration (9,10) with step-size se∞ ∞ 2 quences αk and βk satisfying βk = ηαk , η > 0, αk , βk ∈ (0, 1], k=0 αk = ∞, k=0 αk < ∞. Further assume that (φk , rk , φk ) is an i.i.d. sequence with uniformly bounded second moments. Let A = E φk (φk − γφk ) and b = E[rk φk ] (note that A and b are well-deﬁned because the distribution of (φk , rk , φk ) does not depend on the sequence index k). Assume that A is non-singular. Then the parameter vector θk converges with probability one to the TD solution (4). Proof. We use the ordinary-differential-equation (ODE) approach (Borkar & Meyn 2000). First, we rewrite the algorithm’s two iterations as a single iteration in a combined parameter vector with √ 2n components ρk = (vk , θk ), where vk = uk / η, and a new reward-related vector with 2n components gk+1 = (rk φk , 0 ): √ ρk+1 = ρk + αk η (Gk+1 ρk + gk+1 ) , where Gk+1 = √ − ηI (φk − γφk )φk 4 φk (γφk − φk ) 0 . Let G = E[Gk ] and g = E[gk ]. Note that G and g are well-deﬁned as by the assumption the process {φk , rk , φk }k is i.i.d. In particular, √ − η I −A b G= , g= . 0 A 0 Further, note that (4) follows from Gρ + g = 0, (11) where ρ = (v , θ ). Now we apply Theorem 2.2 of Borkar & Meyn (2000). For this purpose we write ρk+1 = ρk + √ √ αk η(Gρk +g+(Gk+1 −G)ρk +(gk+1 −g)) = ρk +αk (h(ρk )+Mk+1 ), where αk = αk η, h(ρ) = g + Gρ and Mk+1 = (Gk+1 − G)ρk + gk+1 − g. Let Fk = σ(ρ1 , M1 , . . . , ρk−1 , Mk ). Theorem 2.2 requires the veriﬁcation of the following conditions: (i) The function h is Lipschitz and h∞ (ρ) = limr→∞ h(rρ)/r is well-deﬁned for every ρ ∈ R2n ; (ii-a) The sequence (Mk , Fk ) is a martingale difference sequence, and (ii-b) for some C0 > 0, E Mk+1 2 | Fk ≤ C0 (1 + ρk 2 ) holds for ∞ any initial parameter vector ρ1 ; (iii) The sequence αk satisﬁes 0 < αk ≤ 1, k=1 αk = ∞, ∞ 2 ˙ k=1 (αk ) < +∞; and (iv) The ODE ρ = h(ρ) has a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Clearly, h(ρ) is Lipschitz with coefﬁcient G and h∞ (ρ) = Gρ. By construction, (Mk , Fk ) satisﬁes E[Mk+1 |Fk ] = 0 and Mk ∈ Fk , i.e., it is a martingale difference sequence. Condition (ii-b) can be shown to hold by a simple application of the triangle inequality and the boundedness of the the second moments of (φk , rk , φk ). Condition (iii) is satisﬁed by our conditions on the step-size sequences αk , βk . Finally, the last condition (iv) will follow from the elementary theory of linear differential equations if we can show that the real parts of all the eigenvalues of G are negative. First, let us show that G is non-singular. Using the determinant rule for partitioned matrices1 we get det(G) = det(A A) = 0. This indicates that all the eigenvalues of G are non-zero. Now, let λ ∈ C, λ = 0 be an eigenvalue of G with corresponding normalized eigenvector x ∈ C2n ; 2 that is, x = x∗ x = 1, where x∗ is the complex conjugate of x. Hence x∗ Gx = λ. Let √ 2 x = (x1 , x2 ), where x1 , x2 ∈ Cn . Using the deﬁnition of G, λ = x∗ Gx = − η x1 + x∗ Ax2 − x∗ A x1 . Because A is real, A∗ = A , and it follows that (x∗ Ax2 )∗ = x∗ A x1 . Thus, 1 2 1 2 √ 2 Re(λ) = Re(x∗ Gx) = − η x1 ≤ 0. We are now done if we show that x1 cannot be zero. If x1 = 0, then from λ = x∗ Gx we get that λ = 0, which contradicts with λ = 0. The next result concerns the convergence of GTD(0) when (φk , rk , φk ) is obtained by the off-policy sub-sampling process described originally in Section 2. We make the following assumption: Assumption A1 The behavior policy πb (generator of the actions at ) selects all actions of the target policy π with positive probability in every state, and the target policy is deterministic. This assumption is needed to ensure that the sub-sampled process sk is well-deﬁned and that the obtained sample is of “high quality”. Under this assumption it holds that sk is again a Markov chain by the strong Markov property of Markov processes (as the times selected when actions correspond to those of the behavior policy form Markov times with respect to the ﬁltration deﬁned by the original process st ). The following theorem shows that the conclusion of the previous result continues to hold in this case: Theorem 4.2 (Convergence of GTD(0) with a sub-sampled process.). Assume A1. Let the parameters θk , uk be updated by (9,10). Further assume that (φk , rk , φk ) is such that E φk 2 |sk−1 , 2 E rk |sk−1 , E φk 2 |sk−1 are uniformly bounded. Assume that the Markov chain (sk ) is aperiodic and irreducible, so that limk→∞ P(sk = s |s0 = s) = µ(s ) exists and is unique. Let s be a state randomly drawn from µ, and let s be a state obtained by following π for one time step in the MDP from s. Further, let r(s, s ) be the reward incurred. Let A = E φ(s)(φ(s) − γφ(s )) and b = E[r(s, s )φ(s)]. Assume that A is non-singular. Then the parameter vector θk converges with probability one to the TD solution (4), provided that s1 ∼ µ. Proof. The proof of Theorem 4.1 goes through without any changes once we observe that G = E[Gk+1 |Fk ] and g = E[gk+1 | Fk ]. 1 R According to this rule, if A ∈ Rn×n , B ∈ Rn×m , C ∈ Rm×n , D ∈ Rm×m then for F = [A B; C D] ∈ , det(F ) = det(A) det(D − CA−1 B). (n+m)×(n+m) 5 The condition that (sk ) is aperiodic and irreducible guarantees the existence of the steady state distribution µ. Further, the aperiodicity and irreducibility of (sk ) follows from the same property of the original process (st ). For further discussion of these conditions cf. Section 6.3 of Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996). With considerable more work the result can be extended to the case when s1 follows an arbitrary distribution. This requires an extension of Theorem 2.2 of Borkar and Meyn (2000) to processes of the form ρk+1 + ρk (h(ρk ) + Mk+1 + ek+1 ), where ek+1 is a fast decaying perturbation (see, e.g., the proof of Proposition 4.8 of Bertsekas and Tsitsiklis (1996)). 5 Extensions to action values, stochastic target policies, and other sample weightings The GTD algorithm extends immediately to the case of off-policy learning of action-value functions. For this assume that a behavior policy πb is followed that samples all actions in every state with positive probability. Let the target policy to be evaluated be π. In this case the basis functions are dependent on both the states and actions: φ : S × A → Rn . The learning equations are unchanged, except that φt and φt are redeﬁned as follows: φt = φ(st , at ), (12) φt = (13) π(st+1 , a)φ(st+1 , a). a (We use time indices t denoting physical time.) Here π(s, a) is the probability of selecting action a in state s under the target policy π. Let us call the resulting algorithm “one-step gradient-based Q-evaluation,” or GQE(0). Theorem 5.1 (Convergence of GQE(0)). Assume that st is a state sequence generated by following some stationary policy πb in a ﬁnite MDP. Let rt be the corresponding sequence of rewards and let φt , φt be given by the respective equations (12) and (13), and assume that E φt 2 |st−1 , 2 E rt |st−1 , E φt 2 |st−1 are uniformly bounded. Let the parameters θt , ut be updated by Equations (9) and (10). Assume that the Markov chain (st ) is aperiodic and irreducible, so that limt→∞ P(st = s |s0 = s) = µ(s ) exists and is unique. Let s be a state randomly drawn from µ, a be an action chosen by πb in s, let s be the next state obtained and let a = π(s ) be the action chosen by the target policy in state s . Further, let r(s, a, s ) be the reward incurred in this transition. Let A = E φ(s, a)(φ(s, a) − γφ(s , a )) and b = E[r(s, a, s )φ(s, a)]. Assume that A is non-singular. Then the parameter vector θt converges with probability one to a TD solution (4), provided that s1 is selected from the steady-state distribution µ. The proof is almost identical to that of Theorem 4.2, and hence it is omitted. Our main convergence results are also readily generalized to stochastic target policies by replacing the sub-sampling process described in Section 2 with a sample-weighting process. That is, instead of including or excluding transitions depending upon whether the action taken matches a deterministic policy, we include all transitions but give each a weight. For example, we might let the weight wt for time step t be equal to the probability π(st , at ) of taking the action actually taken under the target policy. We can consider the i.i.d. samples now to have four components (φk , rk , φk , wk ), with the update rules (9) and (10) replaced by uk+1 = uk + βk (δk φk − uk )wk , (14) θk+1 = θk + αk (φk − γφk )φk uk wk . (15) and Each sample is also weighted by wk in the expected values, such as that deﬁning the TD solution (4). With these changes, Theorems 4.1 and 4.2 go through immediately for stochastic policies. The reweighting is, in effect, an adjustment to the i.i.d. sampling distribution, µ, and thus our results hold because they hold for all µ. The choice wt = π(st , at ) is only one possibility, notable for its equivalence to our original case if the target policy is deterministic. Another natural weighting is wt = π(st , at )/πb (st , at ), where πb is the behavior policy. This weighting may result in the TD solution (4) better matching the target policy’s value function (1). 6 6 Related work There have been several prior attempts to attain the four desirable algorithmic features mentioned at the beginning this paper (off-policy stability, temporal-difference learning, linear function approximation, and O(n) complexity) but none has been completely successful. One idea for retaining all four desirable features is to use importance sampling techniques to reweight off-policy updates so that they are in the same direction as on-policy updates in expected value (Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta 2001; Precup, Sutton & Singh 2000). Convergence can sometimes then be assured by existing results on the convergence of on-policy methods (Tsitsiklis & Van Roy 1997; Tadic 2001). However, the importance sampling weights are cumulative products of (possibly many) target-to-behavior-policy likelihood ratios, and consequently they and the corresponding updates may be of very high variance. The use of “recognizers” to construct the target policy directly from the behavior policy (Precup, Sutton, Paduraru, Koop & Singh 2006) is one strategy for limiting the variance; another is careful choice of the target policies (see Precup, Sutton & Dasgupta 2001). However, it remains the case that for all of such methods to date there are always choices of problem, behavior policy, and target policy for which the variance is inﬁnite, and thus for which there is no guarantee of convergence. Residual gradient algorithms (Baird 1995) have also been proposed as a way of obtaining all four desirable features. These methods can be viewed as gradient descent in the expected squared TD error, E δ 2 ; thus they converge stably to the solution that minimizes this objective for arbitrary differentiable function approximators. However, this solution has always been found to be much inferior to the TD solution (exempliﬁed by (4) for the one-step linear case). In the literature (Baird 1995; Sutton & Barto 1998), it is often claimed that residual-gradient methods are guaranteed to ﬁnd the TD solution in two special cases: 1) systems with deterministic transitions and 2) systems in which two samples can be drawn for each next state (e.g., for which a simulation model is available). Our own analysis indicates that even these two special requirements are insufﬁcient to guarantee convergence to the TD solution.2 Gordon (1995) and others have questioned the need for linear function approximation. He has proposed replacing linear function approximation with a more restricted class of approximators, known as averagers, that never extrapolate outside the range of the observed data and thus cannot diverge. Rightly or wrongly, averagers have been seen as being too constraining and have not been used on large applications involving online learning. Linear methods, on the other hand, have been widely used (e.g., Baxter, Tridgell & Weaver 1998; Sturtevant & White 2006; Schaeffer, Hlynka & Jussila 2001). The need for linear complexity has also been questioned. Second-order methods for linear approximators, such as LSTD (Bradtke & Barto 1996; Boyan 2002) and LSPI (Lagoudakis & Parr 2003; see also Peters, Vijayakumar & Schaal 2005), can be effective on moderately sized problems. If the number of features in the linear approximator is n, then these methods require memory and per-timestep computation that is O(n2 ). Newer incremental methods such as iLSTD (Geramifard, Bowling & Sutton 2006) have reduced the per-time-complexity to O(n), but are still O(n2 ) in memory. Sparsiﬁcation methods may reduce the complexity further, they do not help in the general case, and may apply to O(n) methods as well to further reduce their complexity. Linear function approximation is most powerful when very large numbers of features are used, perhaps millions of features (e.g., as in Silver, Sutton & M¨ ller 2007). In such cases, O(n2 ) methods are not feasible. u 7 Conclusion GTD(0) is the ﬁrst off-policy TD algorithm to converge under general conditions with linear function approximation and linear complexity. As such, it breaks new ground in terms of important, 2 For a counterexample, consider that given in Dayan’s (1992) Figure 2, except now consider that state A is actually two states, A and A’, which share the same feature vector. The two states occur with 50-50 probability, and when one occurs the transition is always deterministically to B followed by the outcome 1, whereas when the other occurs the transition is always deterministically to the outcome 0. In this case V (A) and V (B) will converge under the residual-gradient algorithm to the wrong answers, 1/3 and 2/3, even though the system is deterministic, and even if multiple samples are drawn from each state (they will all be the same). 7 absolute abilities not previous available in existing algorithms. We have conducted empirical studies with the GTD(0) algorithm and have conﬁrmed that it converges reliably on standard off-policy counterexamples such as Baird’s (1995) “star” problem. On on-policy problems such as the n-state random walk (Sutton 1988; Sutton & Barto 1998), GTD(0) does not seem to learn as efﬁciently as classic TD(0), although we are still exploring different ways of setting the step-size parameters, and other variations on the algorithm. It is not clear that the GTD(0) algorithm in its current form will be a fully satisfactory solution to the off-policy learning problem, but it is clear that is breaks new ground and achieves important abilities that were previously unattainable.

<p>Author: Jonathan Taylor, Doina Precup, Prakash Panagaden</p><p>Abstract: We deﬁne a metric for measuring behavior similarity between states in a Markov decision process (MDP), which takes action similarity into account. We show that the kernel of our metric corresponds exactly to the classes of states deﬁned by MDP homomorphisms (Ravindran & Barto, 2003). We prove that the difference in the optimal value function of different states can be upper-bounded by the value of this metric, and that the bound is tighter than previous bounds provided by bisimulation metrics (Ferns et al. 2004, 2005). Our results hold both for discrete and for continuous actions. We provide an algorithm for constructing approximate homomorphisms, by using this metric to identify states that can be grouped together, as well as actions that can be matched. Previous research on this topic is based mainly on heuristics.</p><p>2 0.44937515 <a title="39-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Arno Onken, Steffen Grünewälder, Matthias Munk, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Correlations between spike counts are often used to analyze neural coding. The noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian. Yet, this assumption is often inappropriate, especially for low spike counts. In this study, we present copulas as an alternative approach. With copulas it is possible to use arbitrary marginal distributions such as Poisson or negative binomial that are better suited for modeling noise distributions of spike counts. Furthermore, copulas place a wide range of dependence structures at the disposal and can be used to analyze higher order interactions. We develop a framework to analyze spike count data by means of copulas. Methods for parameter inference based on maximum likelihood estimates and for computation of mutual information are provided. We apply the method to our data recorded from macaque prefrontal cortex. The data analysis leads to three ﬁndings: (1) copula-based distributions provide signiﬁcantly better ﬁts than discretized multivariate normal distributions; (2) negative binomial margins ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly better than Poisson margins; and (3) the dependence structure carries 12% of the mutual information between stimuli and responses. 1</p><p>3 0.44640201 <a title="39-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-A_Massively_Parallel_Digital_Learning_Processor.html">3 nips-2008-A Massively Parallel Digital Learning Processor</a></p>
<p>Author: Hans P. Graf, Srihari Cadambi, Venkata Jakkula, Murugan Sankaradass, Eric Cosatto, Srimat Chakradhar, Igor Dourdanovic</p><p>Abstract: We present a new, massively parallel architecture for accelerating machine learning algorithms, based on arrays of vector processing elements (VPEs) with variable-resolution arithmetic. Groups of VPEs operate in SIMD (single instruction multiple data) mode, and each group is connected to an independent memory bank. The memory bandwidth thus scales with the number of VPEs, while the main data flows are local, keeping power dissipation low. With 256 VPEs, implemented on two FPGAs (field programmable gate array) chips, we obtain a sustained speed of 19 GMACS (billion multiplyaccumulate per sec.) for SVM training, and 86 GMACS for SVM classification. This performance is more than an order of magnitude higher than that of any FPGA implementation reported so far. The speed on one FPGA is similar to the fastest speeds published on a Graphics Processor for the MNIST problem, despite a clock rate that is an order of magnitude lower. Tests with Convolutional Neural Networks show similar compute performances. This massively parallel architecture is particularly attractive for embedded applications, where low power dissipation is critical. 1 I n trod u cti on Machine learning demands higher and higher compute-performance, but serial processors are not improving that much anymore - at least not as quickly as they used to. Mainstream processor development is moving to multi-core systems, using shared memory technology to hide the parallel nature of the processors. But shared memory technology does not scale to hundreds or thousands of cores. In order to reach such levels of parallelization alternative approaches have to be developed. Massively parallel general-purpose computers had limited success so far, because of difficulties programming these machines, and they remain a niche market, mostly in highperformance computing. Yet processors specialized for certain application domains, such as graphics processors or routing processors 1, have been parallelized to several hundred cores and are successful mass products. They improve performance over general-purpose processors by focusing on a few key algorithmic elements, yet still maintain enough flexibility that they can be programmed for a variety of applications. We explore in this paper if a similar approach can lead to efficient machine learning processors. 1 e.g. Nvidia, Quadro FX 5600 graphics processor; Cisco, CRS-1 routing processor Several processors optimized for machine learning, in particular for neural networks, were developed during the 1980’s and 90’s. Examples are the Synapse-1 architecture [1], or the Connectionist Network Supercomputer, CNS1 [2]. Recently there has been less activity in this field, but some accelerators are sold today for specific applications, such as the Axeon [3] processor for power train control of cars. Beside digital processors a large number of analog circuits were built, emulating neural network structures. Extremely high performance with low power dissipation is achievable, see e.g. [4][5], but these networks have little flexibility. SVM implementations on FPGA have been demonstrated in recent years [6-8], yet reached only low compute-performances. All machine learning processors had only limited success so far, indicating how difficult it is to find a good combination of performance, flexibility, price and ease of use. An important consideration is that many applications of machine learning, such as video analysis, data mining, or personalization of services, show the most promise in embedded systems. Embedded learning requires high compute performance while dissipating little power, a combination that is difficult to achieve, and so far required application specific IC (ASIC). Our aim is to develop architectures that meet the requirements for embedded learning, but are programmable and therefore can be used in a wide range of applications. With the goal of analyzing different architectures we designed a development and testing environment where the parallel computation is mapped onto FPGA’s. Initially this system was intended only for experimentation, but its performance is so high that this platform is useful in its own right as accelerator for high-performance systems. While the experiments shown here emphasize high performance, the architecture has been designed from the start for low power dissipation. The main features for achieving this goal are: low-resolution arithmetic, keeping the main data flow local, low operating frequencies, and a modular design, so that unused parts can be powered down dynamically. All results shown here are from the test platform; migration to lowpower FPGA or chip designs are done in a later stage. 2 Al gori th ms - A ri th meti c - A rch i te ctu re For a substantial improvement over a general purpose processor, the algorithms, the arithmetic units, as well as the architecture have to be optimized simultaneously. This is not just an exercise in hardware design, but algorithms and their software implementations have to be developed concurrently. Most machine learning algorithms have not been developed with parallelization in mind. Therefore, we first need to find good parallel versions, identify their performance bottlenecks, and then extract common computational patterns that can be mapped into accelerator hardware. 2.1 Algorithms Characteristic for machine learning is that large amounts of data need to be processed, often with predictable data access patterns and no dependency between operations over large segments of the computation. This is why data-parallelization can often provide good accelerations on multi-core chips, clusters of machines, or even on loosely coupled networks of machines. Using MapReduce, speedups linear with the number of processors have been reported in [9] for several machine learning algorithms. Up to 16 cores were tested, and simulations indicate good scaling to more processors in some cases. Many algorithms, such as KNN, K-means clustering, LVQ, and Neural Networks can be reduced to forms where the computation is dominated by vector-matrix multiplications, which are easily parallelizable. For Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) the data flow can be complex, yet the core of the computation is a convolution, an operation which has been studied extensively for parallel implementations. For Support Vector Machines (SVM), several parallel algorithms were described, but most saturate quickly for more than 16 processors. Scaling to larger numbers of processors has been demonstrated, applying MapReduce on a graphics processor with 128 cores [10]. Another implementation on a cluster of 48 dual-core machines (with 384 MMX units) [11] scales even super-linearly, and, according to simulations, scales to thousands of cores. Based on this analysis it is clear that vector-matrix and matrix-matrix multiplications for large vector dimensionalities and large numbers of vectors must be handled efficiently. Yet this alone is not sufficient since data access patterns vary greatly between algorithms. We analyze this here in more detail for SVM and CNN. These algorithms were chosen, because they are widely used for industrial applications and cover a broad range of computation, I/O, and memory requirements. The characteristics of the SVM training are summarized in Table 1. We use an approach similar to the one described in [11] to split different parts of the computation between a host CPU and the FPGA accelerator. For large dimensions d of the vectors the calculation of the columns of the kernel matrix dominates by far. This is needed to update the gradients, and in the present implementation, only this part is mapped onto the FPGA. If the dimensionality d is smaller than around 100, operations 2 and 5 can become bottlenecks and should also be mapped onto the accelerator. Challenging is that for each kernel computation a new data vector has to be loaded 4 into the processor, leading to very high I/O requirements. We consider here dimensions of 10 - 10 5 7 and numbers of training data of 10 - 10 , resulting easily in Gigabytes that need to be transferred to the processors at each iteration. 1 2 3 4 5 6 Operation Initialize all αx, Gx Do Find working set αi, αj Update αi, αj Get 2 columns of kernel matrix Update gradients Gx While not converged Computation 2n IO 2n Unit CPU I I I I I * 2n I*2 I * (2d+2dn) I*n CPU CPU FPGA CPU * * * * 2n 10 2nd n Table 1: Compute- and IO-requirements of each step for SVM training (SMO algorithm). n: number of training data; d: dimension of the vectors; G: gradients; α: support vector factors; I: number of iterations. The last column indicates whether the execution happens on the host CPU or the accelerator FPGA. It is assumed that the kernel computation requires a dot product between vectors (e.g. rbf, polynomial, tanh kernels). Neural network algorithms are essentially sequences of vector-matrix multiplications, but networks with special connectivity patterns, such as convolutional networks have very different IO characteristics than fully connected networks. Table 2 shows the computation and IO requirements for scanning several convolution kernels over one input plane. A full network requires multiple of these operations for one layer, with nonlinearities between layers. We map all operations onto the FPGA accelerator, since intermediate results are re-used right away. The most significant 2 difference to between the SVM and CNN is the Compute/IO ratio: SVM: ~ 1; CNN: ~ L*k > 100. Therefore the requirements for these two algorithms are very different, and handling both cases efficiently is quite a challenge for an architecture design.

This is representative for implementations with kernel unrolling (kernel pixels processed in parallel). Internal shifts, computation of the non-linearity, and border effects not shown. 2.2 Arithmetic Hardware can be built much more compactly and runs with lower power dissipation, if it uses fixed-point instead of floating-point operations. Fortunately, many learning algorithms tolerate a low resolution in most of the computations. This has been investigated extensively for neural networks [12][13], but less so for other learning algorithms. Learning from data is inherently a noisy process, because we see only a sparse sampling of the true probability distributions. A different type of noise is introduced in gradient descent algorithms, when only a few training data are used at a time to move the optimization forward iteratively. This noise is particularly pronounced for stochastic gradient descent. There is no point in representing noisy variables with high resolution, and it is therefore a property inherent to many algorithms that low-resolution computation can be used. It is important, not to confuse this tolerance to low resolution with the resolution required to avoid numeric instabilities. Some of the computations have to be performed with a high resolution, in particular for variables that are updated incrementally. They maintain the state of the optimization and may change in very small steps. But usually by far the largest part of the computation can be executed at a low resolution. Key is that the hardware is flexible enough and can take advantage of reduced resolution while handling high resolution where necessary.

(4b in) NA NA 99.11 92.78 Table 3: Comparison of the results of SVM training when the kernels are represented with floating point numbers (32 or 64 bits) (left half) and with 16 bit fixed point (right half). The last column shows the results when the resolution of the training data is reduced from 8 bit to 4 bit. For NORB this reduces the accuracy; all other differences in accuracy are not significant. All are two class problems: Adult: n=32,562, d=122; Forest: n=522,000, d=54 (2 against the rest); MNIST: n=60,000, d=784 (odd–even); NORB: n=48,560, d=5,184. We developed a simulator that allows running the training algorithms with various resolutions in each of the variables. A few examples for SVM training are shown in Table 3. Reducing the resolution of the kernel values from double or float to 16 bit fixed point representations does not affect the accuracy for any of the problems. Therefore all the multiplications in the dot products for the kernel computation can be done in low resolutions (4–16 bit in the factors), but the accumulator needs sufficient resolution to avoid over/under flow (48 bit). Once the calculation of the kernel value is completed, it can be reduced to 16 bit. A low resolution of 16 bit is also tolerable for the α values, but a high resolution is required for the gradients (double). For Neural Networks, including CNN, several studies have confirmed that states and gradients can be kept at low resolutions (<16 bit), but the weights must be maintained at a high resolution (float) (see e.g. [12]). In our own evaluations 24 bits in the weights tend to be sufficient. Once the network is trained, for the classification low resolutions can be used for the weights as well (<16 bit). 2.3 A rc h i t e c t u re Figure 1: Left: Schematic of the architecture with the main data flows; on one FPGA 128 VPE are configured into four SIMD groups; L-S: Load-store units. Right: Picture of an FPGA board; in our experiments one or two of them are used, connected via PCI bus to a host CPU. Based on the analysis above, it is clear that the architecture must be optimized for processing massive amounts of data with relatively low precision. Most of the time, data access patterns are predictable and data are processed in blocks that can be stored contiguously. This type of computation is well suited for vector processing, and simple vector processing elements (VPE) with fixed-point arithmetic can handle the operations. Since typically large blocks of data are processed with the same operation, groups of VPE can work in SIMD (single instruction multiple data) mode. Algorithms must then be segmented to map the highvolume, low precision parts onto the vector accelerators and parts requiring high precision arithmetic onto the CPU. The most important design decision is the organization of the memory. Most memory accesses are done in large blocks, so that the data can be streamed, making complex caching unnecessary. This is fortunate, since the amounts of data to be loaded onto the processor are so large that conventional caching strategies would be overwhelmed anyway. Because the blocks tend to be large, a high data bandwidth is crucial, but latency for starting a block transfer is less critical. Therefore we can use regular DDR memories and still get high IO rates. This led to the design shown schematically in Figure 1, where independent memory banks are connected via separate IO ports for each group of 32 VPE. By connecting multiple of the units shown in Figure 1 to a CPU, this architecture scales to larger numbers of VPE. Parallel data IO and parallel memory access scale simultaneously with the number of parallel cores, and we therefore refer to this as the P3 (P-cube) architecture. Notice also that the main data flow is only local between a group of VPE and its own memory block. Avoiding movements of data over long distances is crucial for low power dissipation. How far this architecture can reasonably scale with one CPU depends on the algorithms, the amount of data and the vector dimensionality (see below). A few hundred VPE per CPU have provided good accelerations in all our tests, and much higher numbers are possible with multi-core CPUs and faster CPU-FPGA connections. 3 I mp l e men tati on of th e P 3 A rch i t ectu re This architecture fits surprisingly well onto some of the recent FPGA chips that are available with several hundred Digital Signal Processors (DSP) units and over 1,000 IO pins for data transfers. The boards used here contain each one Xilinx Virtex 5 LX330T-2 FPGA coupled to 4 independent DDR2 SDRAM with a total of 1GB, and 2 independent 4MB SSRAM memory banks (commercial board from AlphaData). One FPGA chip contains 192 DSP with a maximum speed of 550MHz, which corresponds to a theoretical compute-performance of 105.6 GMACS (18 bit and 25 bit operands). There is a total of 14 Mbit of on-chip memory, and the chip incorporates 960 pins for data IO. Due to routing overhead, not all DSP units can be used and the actual clock frequencies tend to be considerably lower than what is advertised for such chips (typically 230MHz or less for our designs). Nevertheless, we obtain high performances because we can use a large number of DSP units for executing the main computation. The main architecture features are: • Parallel processing (on one chip): 128 VPE (hardware DSP) are divided into 4 blocks of 32, each group controlled by one sequencer with a vector instruction set. • Custom Precision: Data are represented with 1 to 16 bit resolution. Higher resolutions are possible by operating multiple DSP as one processor. • Overlapping Computation and Communication: CPU-FPGA communication is overlapped with the FPGA computation. • Overlap Memory Operations with Computation: All loads and stores from the FPGA to off-chip memory are performed concurrently with computations. • High Off-chip Memory Bandwidth: 6 independent data ports, each 32 bits wide, access banked memories concurrently (12GB/s per chip). • • Streaming Data Flow, Simple Access Patterns: Load/store units are tailored for streaming input and output data, and for simple, bursty access patterns. Caching is done under application control with dual-port memory on chip. Load/store with (de)compression: For an increase of effective IO bandwidth the load/store units provide compression and decompression in hardware. Figure 2 shows the configuration of the VPEs for vector dot product computation used for SVM training and classification. For training, the main computation is the calculation of one column of the kernel matrix. One vector is pre-fetched and stored in on-chip memory. All other vectors are streamed in from off-chip memory banks 1-4. Since this is a regular and predictable access pattern, we can utilize burst-mode, achieving a throughput of close to one memory word per cycle. But the speed is nevertheless IO bound. When several vectors can be stored on-chip, as is the case for classification, then the speed becomes compute-bound. Figure 2: Architecture for vector dot-product computation. The left side shows a high-level schematic with the main data flow. The data are streamed from memory banks 1-4 to the VPE arrays, while memory banks 5 and 6, alternatively receive results or stream them back to the host. The right side shows how a group of VPE is pipelined to improve clock speed. The operation for SVM training on the FPGA corresponds to a vector-matrix multiplication and the one for classification to a matrix-matrix multiplication. Therefore the configuration of Figure 2 is useful for many other algorithms as well, where operations with large vectors and matrices are needed, such as Neural Networks. We implemented a specialized configuration for Convolutional Neural Networks, for more efficiency and lower power dissipation. The VPE are daisy-chained and operate as systolic array. In this way we can take advantage of the high computation to IO ratio (Table 2) to reduce the data transfers from memory. 4 E val u ati on s We evaluated SVM training and classification with the NORB and MNIST problems, the latter with up to 2 million training samples (data from [11]). Both are benchmarks with vectors of high dimensionality, representative for applications in image and video analysis. The computation is split between CPU and FPGA as indicated by Table 1. The DDR2 memory banks are clocked at 230MHz, providing double that rate for data transfers. The data may be compressed to save IO bandwidth. On the FPGA they are decompressed first and distributed to the VPE. In our case, a 32 bit word contains eight 4-bit vector components. Four 32 bit words are needed to feed all 32 VPEs of a group; therefore clocking the VPE faster than 115MHz does not improve performance. A VPE executes a multiplication plus add operation in one clock cycle, resulting in a theoretical maximum of 14.7 GMACS per chip. The sustained compute-rate is lower, about 9.4 GMACS, due to overhead (see Table 4). The computation on the host CPU overlaps with that on the FPGA, and has no effect on the speed in the experiments shown here. For the classification the VPE can be clocked higher, at 230 MHz. By using 4-bit operands we can execute 2 multiply-accumulates simultaneously on one DSP, resulting in speed that is more than four times higher and a sustained 43.0 GMACS limited by the number and speed of the VPE. Adding a second FPGA card doubles the speed, showing little saturation effects yet, but for more FPGA per CPU there will be saturation (see Fig. 3). The compute speed in GMACS obtained for NORB is almost identical. # 60k 2M Iterations 8,000 266,900 CPU time 754s -- speed 0.5 -- CPU+MMX time speed 240 s 1.57 531,534 s 1.58 CPU+FPGA time speed 40 s 9.42 88,589 s 9.48 CPU+2 FPGA time speed 21 s 17.9 48,723 s 17.2 Table 4: Training times and average compute speed for SVM training. Systems tested: CPU, Opteron, 2.2GHz; CPU using MMX; CPU with one FPGA; CPU with two FPGA boards. Results are shown for training sizes of 60k and 2M samples. Compute speed is in GMACS (just kernel computations). Training algorithm: SMO with second order working set selection. Parallelizations of SVM training have been reported recently for a GPU [10] and for a cluster [11], both using the MNIST data. In [10] different bounds for stopping were used than here and in [11]. Nevertheless, a comparison of the compute performance is possible, because based on the number of iterations we can compute the average GMACS for the kernel computations. As can be seen in Table 5 a single FPGA is similar in speed to a GPU with 128 stream processors, despite a clock rate that is about 5.5 times lower for I/O and 11 times lower for the VPE. The cluster with 384 MMX units is about 6 times faster than one FPGA with 128 VPE, but dissipates about two orders of magnitude more electric power. For the FPGA this calculation includes only the computation of the kernel values while the part on the CPU is neglected. This is justified for this study, because the rest of the calculations can be mapped on the FPGA as well and will increase the power dissipation only minimally.

Processor Figure 3: Acceleration of SVM training as a function of the number of VPE. MNIST n: 2,000,000, d=784; NORB: n=48,560, d=5,184. The points for 128 and 256 VPE are experimental, the higher ones are simulations. Curves MNIST, NORB: Multiple FPGA are attached to one CPU. Curve MNIST C: Each FPGA is attached to a separate host CPU. Scaling of the acceleration with the number of VPEs is shown in Figure 3. The reference speed is that of one FPGA attached to a CPU. The evaluation has been done experimentally for 128 and 256 VPEs, and beyond that with a simulator. The onset of saturation depends on the dimensionality of the vectors, but to a much lesser extent on the number of training vectors (up to the limit of the memory on the FPGA card). MNIST saturates for more than two FPGAs because then the CPU and FPGA computation times become comparable. For the larger vectors of NORB (d=5,184) this saturation starts to be noticeable for more than 4 FPGA. Alternatively, a system can be scaled by grouping multiple CPU, each with one attached FPGA accelerator. Then the scaling follows a linear or even super-linear acceleration (MNIST C) to several thousand VPE. If the CPUs are working in a cluster arrangement, the scaling is similar to the one described in [11]. For convolutional neural networks, the architecture of Figure 2 is modified to allow a block of VPE to operate as systolic array. In this way convolutions can be implemented with minimal data movements. In addition to the convolution, also sub-sampling and non-linear functions plus the logistics to handle multiple layers with arbitrary numbers of kernels in each layer are done on the FPGA. Four separate blocks of such convolvers are packed onto one FPGA, using 100 VPE. Clocked at 115MHz, this architecture provides a maximum of 11.5 GMACS. Including all the overhead the sustained speed is about 10 GMACS. 5 Con cl u s i on s By systematically exploiting characteristic properties of machine learning algorithms, we developed a new massively parallel processor architecture that is very efficient and can be scaled to thousands of processing elements. The implementation demonstrated here is more than an order of magnitude higher in performance than previous FPGA implementations of SVM or CNN. For the MNIST problem it is comparable to the fastest GPU implementations reported so far. These results underline the importance of flexibility over raw compute-speed for massively parallel systems. The flexibility of the FPGA allows more efficient routing and packing of the data and the use of computations with the lowest resolution an algorithm permits. The results of Table 5 indicate the potential of this architecture for low-power operation in embedded applications. R e f e re n c e s [1] Ramacher, et al.

Our main result is a sharp bound, that holds with high probability, on the excess risk of the output of an online algorithm in terms of the average regret. This allows one to use recent algorithms with logarithmic cumulative regret guarantees to achieve fast convergence rates for the excess risk with high probability. As a corollary, we characterize the convergence rate of P EGASOS (with high probability), a recently proposed method for solving the SVM optimization problem. 1</p><p>5 0.30098826 <a title="39-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Network_Score_Approximation_using_a_Metagraph_Kernel.html">34 nips-2008-Bayesian Network Score Approximation using a Metagraph Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin Yackley, Eduardo Corona, Terran Lane</p><p>Abstract: Many interesting problems, including Bayesian network structure-search, can be cast in terms of ﬁnding the optimum value of a function over the space of graphs. However, this function is often expensive to compute exactly. We here present a method derived from the study of Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces which takes advantage of the regular structure of the space of all graphs on a ﬁxed number of nodes to obtain approximations to the desired function quickly and with reasonable accuracy. We then test this method on both a small testing set and a real-world Bayesian network; the results suggest that not only is this method reasonably accurate, but that the BDe score itself varies quadratically over the space of all graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.26491785 <a title="39-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_neural_dependencies_with_copula_models.html">45 nips-2008-Characterizing neural dependencies with copula models</a></p>

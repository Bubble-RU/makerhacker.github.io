<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: We present the Gaussian Process Density Sampler (GPDS), an exchangeable generative model for use in nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Samples drawn from the GPDS are consistent with exact, independent samples from a ﬁxed density function that is a transformation of a function drawn from a Gaussian process prior. Our formulation allows us to infer an unknown density from data using Markov chain Monte Carlo, which gives samples from the posterior distribution over density functions and from the predictive distribution on data space. We can also infer the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We compare this density modeling technique to several existing techniques on a toy problem and a skullreconstruction task. 1</p><p>3 0.13166511 <a title="228-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Design_of_Loss_Functions_for_Classification%3A_theory%2C_robustness_to_outliers%2C_and_SavageBoost.html">162 nips-2008-On the Design of Loss Functions for Classification: theory, robustness to outliers, and SavageBoost</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The machine learning problem of classiﬁer design is studied from the perspective of probability elicitation, in statistics. This shows that the standard approach of proceeding from the speciﬁcation of a loss, to the minimization of conditional risk is overly restrictive. It is shown that a better alternative is to start from the speciﬁcation of a functional form for the minimum conditional risk, and derive the loss function. This has various consequences of practical interest, such as showing that 1) the widely adopted practice of relying on convex loss functions is unnecessary, and 2) many new losses can be derived for classiﬁcation problems. These points are illustrated by the derivation of a new loss which is not convex, but does not compromise the computational tractability of classiﬁer design, and is robust to the contamination of data with outliers. A new boosting algorithm, SavageBoost, is derived for the minimization of this loss. Experimental results show that it is indeed less sensitive to outliers than conventional methods, such as Ada, Real, or LogitBoost, and converges in fewer iterations. 1</p><p>4 0.12198025 <a title="228-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Transfer_Learning_by_Distribution_Matching_for_Targeted_Advertising.html">241 nips-2008-Transfer Learning by Distribution Matching for Targeted Advertising</a></p>
<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Christoph Sawade, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers for several related tasks that may differ in their joint distribution of input and output variables. For each task, small – possibly even empty – labeled samples and large unlabeled samples are available. While the unlabeled samples reﬂect the target distribution, the labeled samples may be biased. This setting is motivated by the problem of predicting sociodemographic features for users of web portals, based on the content which they have accessed. Here, questionnaires offered to a portion of each portal’s users produce biased samples. We derive a transfer learning procedure that produces resampling weights which match the pool of all examples to the target distribution of any given task. Transfer learning enables us to make predictions even for new portals with few or no training data and improves the overall prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.1123105 <a title="228-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Tighter_Bounds_for_Structured_Estimation.html">239 nips-2008-Tighter Bounds for Structured Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Chuong B. Do, Choon H. Teo, Quoc V. Le, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Large-margin structured estimation methods minimize a convex upper bound of loss functions. While they allow for efﬁcient optimization algorithms, these convex formulations are not tight and sacriﬁce the ability to accurately model the true loss. We present tighter non-convex bounds based on generalizing the notion of a ramp loss from binary classiﬁcation to structured estimation. We show that a small modiﬁcation of existing optimization algorithms sufﬁces to solve this modiﬁed problem. On structured prediction tasks such as protein sequence alignment and web page ranking, our algorithm leads to improved accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.10798784 <a title="228-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Complexity_of_Linear_Prediction%3A_Risk_Bounds%2C_Margin_Bounds%2C_and_Regularization.html">161 nips-2008-On the Complexity of Linear Prediction: Risk Bounds, Margin Bounds, and Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Richard Nock, Frank Nielsen</p><p>Abstract: Bartlett et al (2006) recently proved that a ground condition for convex surrogates, classiﬁcation calibration, ties up the minimization of the surrogates and classiﬁcation risks, and left as an important problem the algorithmic questions about the minimization of these surrogates. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which provably minimizes any classiﬁcation calibrated surrogate strictly convex and differentiable — a set whose losses span the exponential, logistic and squared losses —, with boosting-type guaranteed convergence rates under a weak learning assumption. A particular subclass of these surrogates, that we call balanced convex surrogates, has a key rationale that ties it to maximum likelihood estimation, zerosum games and the set of losses that satisfy some of the most common requirements for losses in supervised learning. We report experiments on more than 50 readily available domains of 11 ﬂavors of the algorithm, that shed light on new surrogates, and the potential of data dependent strategies to tune surrogates. 1</p><p>5 0.5593555 <a title="228-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Privacy-preserving_logistic_regression.html">185 nips-2008-Privacy-preserving logistic regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the important tradeoff between privacy and learnability, when designing algorithms for learning from private databases. We focus on privacy-preserving logistic regression. First we apply an idea of Dwork et al. [6] to design a privacy-preserving logistic regression algorithm. This involves bounding the sensitivity of regularized logistic regression, and perturbing the learned classiﬁer with noise proportional to the sensitivity. We then provide a privacy-preserving regularized logistic regression algorithm based on a new privacy-preserving technique: solving a perturbed optimization problem. We prove that our algorithm preserves privacy in the model due to [6]. We provide learning guarantees for both algorithms, which are tighter for our new algorithm, in cases in which one would typically apply logistic regression. Experiments demonstrate improved learning performance of our method, versus the sensitivity method. Our privacy-preserving technique does not depend on the sensitivity of the function, and extends easily to a class of convex loss functions. Our work also reveals an interesting connection between regularization and privacy. 1</p><p>6 0.55647326 <a title="228-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Rates_for_Regularized_Objectives.html">85 nips-2008-Fast Rates for Regularized Objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepayan Chakrabarti, Ravi Kumar, Filip Radlinski, Eli Upfal</p><p>Abstract: We formulate and study a new variant of the k-armed bandit problem, motivated by e-commerce applications. In our model, arms have (stochastic) lifetime after which they expire. In this setting an algorithm needs to continuously explore new arms, in contrast to the standard k-armed bandit model in which arms are available indeﬁnitely and exploration is reduced once an optimal arm is identiﬁed with nearcertainty. The main motivation for our setting is online-advertising, where ads have limited lifetime due to, for example, the nature of their content and their campaign budgets. An algorithm needs to choose among a large collection of ads, more than can be fully explored within the typical ad lifetime. We present an optimal algorithm for the state-aware (deterministic reward function) case, and build on this technique to obtain an algorithm for the state-oblivious (stochastic reward function) case. Empirical studies on various reward distributions, including one derived from a real-world ad serving application, show that the proposed algorithms signiﬁcantly outperform the standard multi-armed bandit approaches applied to these settings. 1</p><p>2 0.69610608 <a title="228-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Artificial_Olfactory_Brain_for_Mixture_Identification.html">27 nips-2008-Artificial Olfactory Brain for Mixture Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Mehmet K. Muezzinoglu, Alexander Vergara, Ramon Huerta, Thomas Nowotny, Nikolai Rulkov, Henry Abarbanel, Allen Selverston, Mikhail Rabinovich</p><p>Abstract: The odor transduction process has a large time constant and is susceptible to various types of noise. Therefore, the olfactory code at the sensor/receptor level is in general a slow and highly variable indicator of the input odor in both natural and artiﬁcial situations. Insects overcome this problem by using a neuronal device in their Antennal Lobe (AL), which transforms the identity code of olfactory receptors to a spatio-temporal code. This transformation improves the decision of the Mushroom Bodies (MBs), the subsequent classiﬁer, in both speed and accuracy. Here we propose a rate model based on two intrinsic mechanisms in the insect AL, namely integration and inhibition. Then we present a MB classiﬁer model that resembles the sparse and random structure of insect MB. A local Hebbian learning procedure governs the plasticity in the model. These formulations not only help to understand the signal conditioning and classiﬁcation methods of insect olfactory systems, but also can be leveraged in synthetic problems. Among them, we consider here the discrimination of odor mixtures from pure odors. We show on a set of records from metal-oxide gas sensors that the cascade of these two new models facilitates fast and accurate discrimination of even highly imbalanced mixtures from pure odors. 1</p><p>3 0.68152326 <a title="228-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Hierarchical_Semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Recursive_Sequential_Data.html">98 nips-2008-Hierarchical Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Recursive Sequential Data</a></p>

Importantly, we develop efﬁcient algorithms for learning and constrained inference in a partially-supervised setting, which is important issue in practice where labels can only be obtained sparsely. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.65970683 <a title="228-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Support_Vector_Machines_with_a_Reject_Option.html">228 nips-2008-Support Vector Machines with a Reject Option</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Joseph Keshet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation where the classiﬁer may abstain instead of classifying each observation. The Bayes decision rule for this setup, known as Chow’s rule, is deﬁned by two thresholds on posterior probabilities. From simple desiderata, namely the consistency and the sparsity of the classiﬁer, we derive the double hinge loss function that focuses on estimating conditional probabilities only in the vicinity of the threshold points of the optimal decision rule. We show that, for suitable kernel machines, our approach is universally consistent. We cast the problem of minimizing the double hinge loss as a quadratic program akin to the standard SVM optimization problem and propose an active set method to solve it efﬁciently. We ﬁnally provide preliminary experimental results illustrating the interest of our constructive approach to devising loss functions. 1</p><p>5 0.5295288 <a title="228-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae-kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: We present a new co-clustering problem of images and visual features. The problem involves a set of non-object images in addition to a set of object images and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of object images from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of object images and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classiﬁers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classiﬁer is an aggregation of weak-learners, i.e. simple visual features. The obtained classiﬁers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit multimodalities, e.g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classiﬁers in object detection tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.52471948 <a title="228-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>

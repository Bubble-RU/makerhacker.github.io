<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex. In experiments, we demonstrate efﬁcient ﬁltering in a range of multi-agent domains. 1</p><p>3 0.10361792 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Policy_Search_for_Motor_Primitives_in_Robotics.html">181 nips-2008-Policy Search for Motor Primitives in Robotics</a></p>
<p>Author: Jens Kober, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Many motor skills in humanoid robotics can be learned using parametrized motor primitives as done in imitation learning. However, most interesting motor learning problems are high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems often beyond the reach of current methods. In this paper, we extend previous work on policy learning from the immediate reward case to episodic reinforcement learning. We show that this results in a general, common framework also connected to policy gradient methods and yielding a novel algorithm for policy learning that is particularly well-suited for dynamic motor primitives. The resulting algorithm is an EM-inspired algorithm applicable to complex motor learning tasks. We compare this algorithm to several well-known parametrized policy search methods and show that it outperforms them. We apply it in the context of motor learning and show that it can learn a complex Ball-in-a-Cup task using a real Barrett WAMTM robot arm. 1</p><p>4 0.098315023 <a title="211-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_to_Use_Working_Memory_in_Partially_Observable_Environments_through_Dopaminergic_Reinforcement.html">121 nips-2008-Learning to Use Working Memory in Partially Observable Environments through Dopaminergic Reinforcement</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael T. Todd, Yael Niv, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Working memory is a central topic of cognitive neuroscience because it is critical for solving real-world problems in which information from multiple temporally distant sources must be combined to generate appropriate behavior. However, an often neglected fact is that learning to use working memory effectively is itself a difficult problem. The Gating framework [14] is a collection of psychological models that show how dopamine can train the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex to form useful working memory representations in certain types of problems. We unite Gating with machine learning theory concerning the general problem of memory-based optimal control [5-6]. We present a normative model that learns, by online temporal difference methods, to use working memory to maximize discounted future reward in partially observable settings. The model successfully solves a benchmark working memory problem, and exhibits limitations similar to those observed in humans. Our purpose is to introduce a concise, normative definition of high level cognitive concepts such as working memory and cognitive control in terms of maximizing discounted future rewards. 1 I n t ro d u c t i o n Working memory is loosely defined in cognitive neuroscience as information that is (1) internally maintained on a temporary or short term basis, and (2) required for tasks in which immediate observations cannot be mapped to correct actions. It is widely assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in maintaining and updating working memory. However, relatively little is known about how PFC develops useful working memory representations for a new task. Furthermore, current work focuses on describing the structure and limitations of working memory, but does not ask why, or in what general class of tasks, is it necessary. Borrowing from the theory of optimal control in partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs), we frame the psychological concept of working memory as an internal state representation, developed and employed to maximize future reward in partially observable environments. We combine computational insights from POMDPs and neurobiologically plausible models from cognitive neuroscience to suggest a simple reinforcement learning (RL) model of working memory function that can be implemented through dopaminergic training of the basal ganglia and PFC. The Gating framework is a series of cognitive neuroscience models developed to explain how dopaminergic RL signals can shape useful working memory representations [1-4]. Computationally this framework models working memory as a collection of past observations, each of which can occasionally be replaced with the current observation, and addresses the problem of learning when to update each memory element versus maintaining it. In the original Gating model [1-2] the PFC contained a unitary working memory representation that was updated whenever a phasic dopamine (DA) burst occurred (e.g., due to unexpected reward or novelty). That model was the first to connect working memory and RL via the temporal difference (TD) model of DA firing [7-8], and thus to suggest how working memory might serve a normative purpose. However, that model had limited computational flexibility due to the unitary nature of the working memory (i.e., a singleobservation memory controlled by a scalar DA signal). More recent work [3-4] has partially repositioned the Gating framework within the Actor/Critic model of mesostriatal RL [9-10], positing memory updating as but another cortical action controlled by the dorsal striatal</p><p>5 0.092103645 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Performance_analysis_for_L%5C_2_kernel_classification.html">178 nips-2008-Performance analysis for L\ 2 kernel classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jooseuk Kim, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: We provide statistical performance guarantees for a recently introduced kernel classiﬁer that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a difference of densities. The classiﬁer is similar to a support vector machine (SVM) in that it is the solution of a quadratic program and yields a sparse classiﬁer. Unlike SVMs, however, the L2 kernel classiﬁer does not involve a regularization parameter. We prove a distribution free concentration inequality for a cross-validation based estimate of the ISE, and apply this result to deduce an oracle inequality and consistency of the classiﬁer on the sense of both ISE and probability of error. Our results also specialize to give performance guarantees for an existing method of L2 kernel density estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.085227571 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Domain_Adaptation_with_Multiple_Sources.html">65 nips-2008-Domain Adaptation with Multiple Sources</a></p>

<p>Author: Ozgur Simsek, Andre S. Barreto</p><p>Abstract: We present a characterization of a useful class of skills based on a graphical representation of an agent’s interaction with its environment. Our characterization uses betweenness, a measure of centrality on graphs. It captures and generalizes (at least intuitively) the bottleneck concept, which has inspired many of the existing skill-discovery algorithms. Our characterization may be used directly to form a set of skills suitable for a given task. More importantly, it serves as a useful guide for developing incremental skill-discovery algorithms that do not rely on knowing or representing the interaction graph in its entirety. 1</p><p>4 0.49776831 <a title="211-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-A_rational_model_of_preference_learning_and_choice_prediction_by_children.html">10 nips-2008-A rational model of preference learning and choice prediction by children</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher G. Lucas, Thomas L. Griffiths, Fei Xu, Christine Fawcett</p><p>Abstract: Young children demonstrate the ability to make inferences about the preferences of other agents based on their choices. However, there exists no overarching account of what children are doing when they learn about preferences or how they use that knowledge. We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. Speciﬁcally, we show how a simple econometric model can be extended to capture two- to four-year-olds’ use of statistical information in inferring preferences, and their generalization of these preferences. 1</p><p>5 0.47211486 <a title="211-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_to_Use_Working_Memory_in_Partially_Observable_Environments_through_Dopaminergic_Reinforcement.html">121 nips-2008-Learning to Use Working Memory in Partially Observable Environments through Dopaminergic Reinforcement</a></p>

We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods. 1</p><p>2 0.65210456 <a title="211-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We describe a primal-dual framework for the design and analysis of online strongly convex optimization algorithms. Our framework yields the tightest known logarithmic regret bounds for Follow-The-Leader and for the gradient descent algorithm proposed in Hazan et al. [2006]. We then show that one can interpolate between these two extreme cases. In particular, we derive a new algorithm that shares the computational simplicity of gradient descent but achieves lower regret in many practical situations. Finally, we further extend our framework for generalized strongly convex functions. 1</p><p>3 0.62127709 <a title="211-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>4 0.62006831 <a title="211-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Stephen Gould, Ashutosh Saxena, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difﬁcult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classiﬁers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited “black box” interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classiﬁers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction. 1</p><p>5 0.6183244 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>6 0.61813337 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>

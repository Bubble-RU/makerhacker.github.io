<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>3 0.12651162 <a title="175-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>4 0.12527612 <a title="175-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>5 0.12376124 <a title="175-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Reliability_of_Clustering_Stability_in_the_Large_Sample_Regime.html">165 nips-2008-On the Reliability of Clustering Stability in the Large Sample Regime</a></p>

<p>Author: Shuiwang Ji, Liang Sun, Rong Jin, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-label multiple kernel learning (MKL) formulation in which the data are embedded into a low-dimensional space directed by the instancelabel correlations encoded into a hypergraph. We formulate the problem in the kernel-induced feature space and propose to learn the kernel matrix as a linear combination of a given collection of kernel matrices in the MKL framework. The proposed learning formulation leads to a non-smooth min-max problem, which can be cast into a semi-inﬁnite linear program (SILP). We further propose an approximate formulation with a guaranteed error bound which involves an unconstrained convex optimization problem. In addition, we show that the objective function of the approximate formulation is differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and hence existing methods can be employed to compute the optimal solution efﬁciently. We apply the proposed formulation to the automated annotation of Drosophila gene expression pattern images, and promising results have been reported in comparison with representative algorithms.</p><p>3 0.5339852 <a title="175-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-An_Extended_Level_Method_for_Efficient_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">20 nips-2008-An Extended Level Method for Efficient Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL), which can be formulated as a convex-concave problem. In the past, two efﬁcient methods, i.e., Semi-Inﬁnite Linear Programming (SILP) and Subgradient Descent (SD), have been proposed for large-scale multiple kernel learning. Despite their success, both methods have their own shortcomings: (a) the SD method utilizes the gradient of only the current solution, and (b) the SILP method does not regularize the approximate solution obtained from the cutting plane model. In this work, we extend the level method, which was originally designed for optimizing non-smooth objective functions, to convex-concave optimization, and apply it to multiple kernel learning. The extended level method overcomes the drawbacks of SILP and SD by exploiting all the gradients computed in past iterations and by regularizing the solution via a projection to a level set. Empirical study with eight UCI datasets shows that the extended level method can signiﬁcantly improve efﬁciency by saving on average 91.9% of computational time over the SILP method and 70.3% over the SD method. 1</p><p>4 0.50876439 <a title="175-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Reliability_of_Clustering_Stability_in_the_Large_Sample_Regime.html">165 nips-2008-On the Reliability of Clustering Stability in the Large Sample Regime</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Torr, M. P. Kumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining the approximate maximum a posteriori estimate of a discrete random ﬁeld characterized by pairwise potentials that form a truncated convex model. For this problem, we propose an improved st-MINCUT based move making algorithm. Unlike previous move making approaches, which either provide a loose bound or no bound on the quality of the solution (in terms of the corresponding Gibbs energy), our algorithm achieves the same guarantees as the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation. Compared to previous approaches based on the LP relaxation, e.g. interior-point algorithms or treereweighted message passing (TRW), our method is faster as it uses only the efﬁcient st-MINCUT algorithm in its design. Furthermore, it directly provides us with a primal solution (unlike TRW and other related methods which solve the dual of the LP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and standard real data problems. Our analysis also opens up an interesting question regarding the relationship between move making algorithms (such as α-expansion and the algorithms presented in this paper) and the randomized rounding schemes used with convex relaxations. We believe that further explorations in this direction would help design efﬁcient algorithms for more complex relaxations.</p><p>6 0.48055458 <a title="175-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-An_interior-point_stochastic_approximation_method_and_an_L1-regularized_delta_rule.html">25 nips-2008-An interior-point stochastic approximation method and an L1-regularized delta rule</a></p>

<p>Author: Dominik Endres, Peter Foldiak</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to neural decoding: instead of just trying to ﬁgure out which stimulus was presented, we demonstrate how to explore the semantic relationships in the neural representation of large sets of stimuli. FCA provides a way of displaying and interpreting such relationships via concept lattices. We explore the effects of neural code sparsity on the lattice. We then analyze neurophysiological data from high-level visual cortical area STSa, using an exact Bayesian approach to construct the formal context needed by FCA. Prominent features of the resulting concept lattices are discussed, including hierarchical face representation and indications for a product-of-experts code in real neurons. 1</p><p>2 0.96674585 <a title="175-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Optimal_Response_Initiation%3A_Why_Recent_Experience_Matters.html">172 nips-2008-Optimal Response Initiation: Why Recent Experience Matters</a></p>
<p>Author: Matt Jones, Sachiko Kinoshita, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: In most cognitive and motor tasks, speed-accuracy tradeoffs are observed: Individuals can respond slowly and accurately, or quickly yet be prone to errors. Control mechanisms governing the initiation of behavioral responses are sensitive not only to task instructions and the stimulus being processed, but also to the recent stimulus history. When stimuli can be characterized on an easy-hard dimension (e.g., word frequency in a naming task), items preceded by easy trials are responded to more quickly, and with more errors, than items preceded by hard trials. We propose a rationally motivated mathematical model of this sequential adaptation of control, based on a diffusion model of the decision process in which difﬁculty corresponds to the drift rate for the correct response. The model assumes that responding is based on the posterior distribution over which response is correct, conditioned on the accumulated evidence. We derive this posterior as a function of the drift rate, and show that higher estimates of the drift rate lead to (normatively) faster responding. Trial-by-trial tracking of difﬁculty thus leads to sequential effects in speed and accuracy. Simulations show the model explains a variety of phenomena in human speeded decision making. We argue this passive statistical mechanism provides a more elegant and parsimonious account than extant theories based on elaborate control structures. 1</p><p>3 0.9450931 <a title="175-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_response_behavior_in_multisensory_perception_with_conflicting_cues.html">46 nips-2008-Characterizing response behavior in multisensory perception with conflicting cues</a></p>

Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>5 0.90532422 <a title="175-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.89135206 <a title="175-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-PSDBoost%3A_Matrix-Generation_Linear_Programming_for_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices_Learning.html">175 nips-2008-PSDBoost: Matrix-Generation Linear Programming for Positive Semidefinite Matrices Learning</a></p>

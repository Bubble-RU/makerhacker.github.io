<p>Author: Michael Isard, John MacCormick, Kannan Achan</p><p>Abstract: Continuously-Adaptive Discretization for Message-Passing (CAD-MP) is a new message-passing algorithm for approximate inference. Most message-passing algorithms approximate continuous probability distributions using either: a family of continuous distributions such as the exponential family; a particle-set of discrete samples; or a ﬁxed, uniform discretization. In contrast, CAD-MP uses a discretization that is (i) non-uniform, and (ii) adaptive to the structure of the marginal distributions. Non-uniformity allows CAD-MP to localize interesting features (such as sharp peaks) in the marginal belief distributions with time complexity that scales logarithmically with precision, as opposed to uniform discretization which scales at best linearly. We give a principled method for altering the non-uniform discretization according to information-based measures. CAD-MP is shown in experiments to estimate marginal beliefs much more precisely than competing approaches for the same computational expense. 1</p><p>3 0.16380374 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>4 0.16074628 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_response_behavior_in_multisensory_perception_with_conflicting_cues.html">46 nips-2008-Characterizing response behavior in multisensory perception with conflicting cues</a></p>
<p>Author: Rama Natarajan, Iain Murray, Ladan Shams, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: We explore a recently proposed mixture model approach to understanding interactions between conﬂicting sensory cues. Alternative model formulations, differing in their sensory noise models and inference methods, are compared based on their ﬁt to experimental data. Heavy-tailed sensory likelihoods yield a better description of the subjects’ response behavior than standard Gaussian noise models. We study the underlying cause for this result, and then present several testable predictions of these models. 1</p><p>5 0.14766707 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Counting_Solution_Clusters_in_Graph_Coloring_Problems_Using_Belief_Propagation.html">53 nips-2008-Counting Solution Clusters in Graph Coloring Problems Using Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lukas Kroc, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We show that an important and computationally challenging solution space feature of the graph coloring problem (COL), namely the number of clusters of solutions, can be accurately estimated by a technique very similar to one for counting the number of solutions. This cluster counting approach can be naturally written in terms of a new factor graph derived from the factor graph representing the COL instance. Using a variant of the Belief Propagation inference framework, we can efﬁciently approximate cluster counts in random COL problems over a large range of graph densities. We illustrate the algorithm on instances with up to 100, 000 vertices. Moreover, we supply a methodology for computing the number of clusters exactly using advanced techniques from the knowledge compilation literature. This methodology scales up to several hundred variables. 1</p><p>6 0.12919898 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Gates.html">89 nips-2008-Gates</a></p>

<p>Author: Tom Minka, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Gates are a new notation for representing mixture models and context-sensitive independence in factor graphs. Factor graphs provide a natural representation for message-passing algorithms, such as expectation propagation. However, message passing in mixture models is not well captured by factor graphs unless the entire mixture is represented by one factor, because the message equations have a containment structure. Gates capture this containment structure graphically, allowing both the independences and the message-passing equations for a model to be readily visualized. Different variational approximations for mixture models can be understood as different ways of drawing the gates in a model. We present general equations for expectation propagation and variational message passing in the presence of gates. 1</p><p>4 0.6435734 <a title="40-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-MAS%3A_a_multiplicative_approximation_scheme_for_probabilistic_inference.html">129 nips-2008-MAS: a multiplicative approximation scheme for probabilistic inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Ydo Wexler, Christopher Meek</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multiplicative approximation scheme (MAS) for inference problems in graphical models, which can be applied to various inference algorithms. The method uses -decompositions which decompose functions used throughout the inference procedure into functions over smaller sets of variables with a known error . MAS translates these local approximations into bounds on the accuracy of the results. We show how to optimize -decompositions and provide a fast closed-form solution for an L2 approximation. Applying MAS to the Variable Elimination inference algorithm, we introduce an algorithm we call DynaDecomp which is extremely fast in practice and provides guaranteed error bounds on the result. The superior accuracy and efﬁciency of DynaDecomp is demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.58881795 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>

<p>Author: Mahdi M. Fard, Joelle Pineau</p><p>Abstract: Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) have been extensively studied and used in the context of planning and decision-making, and many methods exist to ﬁnd the optimal policy for problems modelled as MDPs. Although ﬁnding the optimal policy is sufﬁcient in many domains, in certain applications such as decision support systems where the policy is executed by a human (rather than a machine), ﬁnding all possible near-optimal policies might be useful as it provides more ﬂexibility to the person executing the policy. In this paper we introduce the new concept of non-deterministic MDP policies, and address the question of ﬁnding near-optimal non-deterministic policies. We propose two solutions to this problem, one based on a Mixed Integer Program and the other one based on a search algorithm. We include experimental results obtained from applying this framework to optimize treatment choices in the context of a medical decision support system. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82532966 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Bounds_on_marginal_probability_distributions.html">40 nips-2008-Bounds on marginal probability distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.79098415 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>

<p>Author: Yen-yu Lin, Tyng-luh Liu, Chiou-shann Fuh</p><p>Abstract: In solving complex visual learning tasks, adopting multiple descriptors to more precisely characterize the data has been a feasible way for improving performance. These representations are typically high dimensional and assume diverse forms. Thus ﬁnding a way to transform them into a uniﬁed space of lower dimension generally facilitates the underlying tasks, such as object recognition or clustering. We describe an approach that incorporates multiple kernel learning with dimensionality reduction (MKL-DR). While the proposed framework is ﬂexible in simultaneously tackling data in various feature representations, the formulation itself is general in that it is established upon graph embedding. It follows that any dimensionality reduction techniques explainable by graph embedding can be generalized by our method to consider data in multiple feature representations.</p><p>6 0.78528464 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Inferring_rankings_under_constrained_sensing.html">106 nips-2008-Inferring rankings under constrained sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Recently, supervised dimensionality reduction has been gaining attention, owing to the realization that data labels are often available and indicate important underlying structure in the data. In this paper, we present a novel convex supervised dimensionality reduction approach based on exponential family PCA, which is able to avoid the local optima of typical EM learning. Moreover, by introducing a sample-based approximation to exponential family models, it overcomes the limitation of the prevailing Gaussian assumptions of standard PCA, and produces a kernelized formulation for nonlinear supervised dimensionality reduction. A training algorithm is then devised based on a subgradient bundle method, whose scalability can be gained using a coordinate descent procedure. The advantage of our global optimization approach is demonstrated by empirical results over both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>3 0.095606968 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Kernel_Principal_Component_Analysis.html">200 nips-2008-Robust Kernel Principal Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Minh H. Nguyen, Fernando Torre</p><p>Abstract: Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is a popular generalization of linear PCA that allows non-linear feature extraction. In KPCA, data in the input space is mapped to higher (usually) dimensional feature space where the data can be linearly modeled. The feature space is typically induced implicitly by a kernel function, and linear PCA in the feature space is performed via the kernel trick. However, due to the implicitness of the feature space, some extensions of PCA such as robust PCA cannot be directly generalized to KPCA. This paper presents a technique to overcome this problem, and extends it to a uniﬁed framework for treating noise, missing data, and outliers in KPCA. Our method is based on a novel cost function to perform inference in KPCA. Extensive experiments, in both synthetic and real data, show that our algorithm outperforms existing methods. 1</p><p>4 0.088122793 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_probabilistic_projections.html">216 nips-2008-Sparse probabilistic projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Cédric Archambeau, Francis R.

Sparsity is enforced by means of automatic relevance determination or by imposing appropriate prior distributions, such as generalised hyperbolic distributions. We derive a variational Expectation-Maximisation algorithm for the estimation of the hyperparameters and show that our novel probabilistic approach compares favourably to existing techniques. We illustrate how the proposed method can be applied in the context of cryptoanalysis as a preprocessing tool for the construction of template attacks. 1</p><p>5 0.068393819 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Deflation_Methods_for_Sparse_PCA.html">57 nips-2008-Deflation Methods for Sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey</p><p>Abstract: In analogy to the PCA setting, the sparse PCA problem is often solved by iteratively alternating between two subtasks: cardinality-constrained rank-one variance maximization and matrix deﬂation. While the former has received a great deal of attention in the literature, the latter is seldom analyzed and is typically borrowed without justiﬁcation from the PCA context. In this work, we demonstrate that the standard PCA deﬂation procedure is seldom appropriate for the sparse PCA setting. To rectify the situation, we ﬁrst develop several deﬂation alternatives better suited to the cardinality-constrained context. We then reformulate the sparse PCA optimization problem to explicitly reﬂect the maximum additional variance objective on each round. The result is a generalized deﬂation procedure that typically outperforms more standard techniques on real-world datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.06395831 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Stochastic_Relational_Models_for_Large-scale_Dyadic_Data_using_MCMC.html">221 nips-2008-Stochastic Relational Models for Large-scale Dyadic Data using MCMC</a></p>

<p>Author: Zakria Hussain, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: We analyse matching pursuit for kernel principal components analysis (KPCA) by proving that the sparse subspace it produces is a sample compression scheme. We show that this bound is tighter than the KPCA bound of Shawe-Taylor et al [7] and highly predictive of the size of the subspace needed to capture most of the variance in the data. We analyse a second matching pursuit algorithm called kernel matching pursuit (KMP) which does not correspond to a sample compression scheme. However, we give a novel bound that views the choice of subspace of the KMP algorithm as a compression scheme and hence provide a VC bound to upper bound its future loss. Finally we describe how the same bound can be applied to other matching pursuit related algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.50130713 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Stochastic_Relational_Models_for_Large-scale_Dyadic_Data_using_MCMC.html">221 nips-2008-Stochastic Relational Models for Large-scale Dyadic Data using MCMC</a></p>

<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of multiple kernel learning (MKL), which can be formulated as a convex-concave problem. In the past, two efﬁcient methods, i.e., Semi-Inﬁnite Linear Programming (SILP) and Subgradient Descent (SD), have been proposed for large-scale multiple kernel learning. Despite their success, both methods have their own shortcomings: (a) the SD method utilizes the gradient of only the current solution, and (b) the SILP method does not regularize the approximate solution obtained from the cutting plane model. In this work, we extend the level method, which was originally designed for optimizing non-smooth objective functions, to convex-concave optimization, and apply it to multiple kernel learning. The extended level method overcomes the drawbacks of SILP and SD by exploiting all the gradients computed in past iterations and by regularizing the solution via a projection to a level set. Empirical study with eight UCI datasets shows that the extended level method can signiﬁcantly improve efﬁciency by saving on average 91.9% of computational time over the SILP method and 70.3% over the SD method. 1</p><p>4 0.52031273 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Global_Ranking_Using_Continuous_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">93 nips-2008-Global Ranking Using Continuous Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu, Xu-dong Zhang, De-sheng Wang, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies global ranking problem by learning to rank methods. Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for ‘local ranking’, in the sense that the ranking model is deﬁned on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to deﬁne the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is deﬁned as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two speciﬁc information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines.</p><p>5 0.51921773 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.51587135 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimation_of_Information_Theoretic_Measures_for_Continuous_Random_Variables.html">76 nips-2008-Estimation of Information Theoretic Measures for Continuous Random Variables</a></p>

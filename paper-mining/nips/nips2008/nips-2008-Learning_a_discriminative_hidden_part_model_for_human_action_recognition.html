<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex. In experiments, we demonstrate efﬁcient ﬁltering in a range of multi-agent domains. 1</p><p>3 0.13595565 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Partially_Observed_Maximum_Entropy_Discrimination_Markov_Networks.html">176 nips-2008-Partially Observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing, Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Learning graphical models with hidden variables can offer semantic insights to complex data and lead to salient structured predictors without relying on expensive, sometime unattainable fully annotated training data. While likelihood-based methods have been extensively explored, to our knowledge, learning structured prediction models with latent variables based on the max-margin principle remains largely an open problem. In this paper, we present a partially observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Network (PoMEN) model that attempts to combine the advantages of Bayesian and margin based paradigms for learning Markov networks from partially labeled data. PoMEN leads to an averaging prediction rule that resembles a Bayes predictor that is more robust to overﬁtting, but is also built on the desirable discriminative laws resemble those of the M3 N. We develop an EM-style algorithm utilizing existing convex optimization algorithms for M3 N as a subroutine. We demonstrate competent performance of PoMEN over existing methods on a real-world web data extraction task. 1</p><p>4 0.12411872 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Liqing Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A visual attention system should respond placidly when common stimuli are presented, while at the same time keep alert to anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return. 1</p><p>5 0.12072825 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>6 0.12060081 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Tanya Schmah, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Steven L. Small, Stephen Strother, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Neuroimaging datasets often have a very large number of voxels and a very small number of training cases, which means that overﬁtting of models for this data can become a very serious problem. Working with a set of fMRI images from a study on stroke recovery, we consider a classiﬁcation task for which logistic regression performs poorly, even when L1- or L2- regularized. We show that much better discrimination can be achieved by ﬁtting a generative model to each separate condition and then seeing which model is most likely to have generated the data. We compare discriminative training of exactly the same set of models, and we also consider convex blends of generative and discriminative training. 1</p><p>5 0.48061633 <a title="119-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenyuan Dai, Yuqiang Chen, Gui-rong Xue, Qiang Yang, Yong Yu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new machine learning strategy called translated learning. Unlike many previous learning tasks, we focus on how to use labeled data from one feature space to enhance the classiﬁcation of other entirely different learning spaces. For example, we might wish to use labeled text data to help learn a model for classifying image data, when the labeled images are difﬁcult to obtain. An important aspect of translated learning is to build a “bridge” to link one feature space (known as the “source space”) to another space (known as the “target space”) through a translator in order to migrate the knowledge from source to target. The translated learning solution uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Finally, this chain of linkages is completed by tracing back to the instances in the target spaces. We show that this path of linkage can be modeled using a Markov chain and risk minimization. Through experiments on the text-aided image classiﬁcation and cross-language classiﬁcation tasks, we demonstrate that our translated learning framework can greatly outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods. 1</p><p>6 0.47114828 <a title="119-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Model_of_Behaviour_in_Economic_Games.html">33 nips-2008-Bayesian Model of Behaviour in Economic Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the graph structure associated with a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) from i.i.d. samples. We study the performance of study the performance of the ℓ1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimator in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges in the graph s and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the number of samples n. Our main result provides sufﬁcient conditions on (n, p, d) for the ℓ1 -regularized MLE estimator to recover all the edges of the graph with high probability. Under some conditions on the model covariance, we show that model selection can be achieved for sample sizes n = Ω(d2 log(p)), with the error decaying as O(exp(−c log(p))) for some constant c. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations and show good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.</p><p>2 0.96754587 <a title="119-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Resolution_Limits_of_Sparse_Coding_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2008-Resolution Limits of Sparse Coding in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of sparsity pattern detection for unknown ksparse n-dimensional signals observed through m noisy, random linear measurements. Sparsity pattern recovery arises in a number of settings including statistical model selection, pattern detection, and image acquisition. The main results in this paper are necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for asymptotically-reliable sparsity pattern recovery in terms of the dimensions m, n and k as well as the signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) and the minimum-to-average ratio (MAR) of the nonzero entries of the signal. We show that m > 2k log(n − k)/(SNR · MAR) is necessary for any algorithm to succeed, regardless of complexity; this matches a previous sufﬁcient condition for maximum likelihood estimation within a constant factor under certain scalings of k, SNR and MAR with n. We also show a sufﬁcient condition for a computationally-trivial thresholding algorithm that is larger than the previous expression by only a factor of 4(1 + SNR) and larger than the requirement for lasso by only a factor of 4/MAR. This provides insight on the precise value and limitations of convex programming-based algorithms.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.9455235 <a title="119-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_a_discriminative_hidden_part_model_for_human_action_recognition.html">119 nips-2008-Learning a discriminative hidden part model for human action recognition</a></p>

Similar to hCRF for object recognition, we model a human action by a ﬂexible constellation of parts conditioned on image observations. Different from object recognition, our model combines both large-scale global features and local patch features to distinguish various actions. Our experimental results show that our model is comparable to other state-of-the-art approaches in action recognition. In particular, our experimental results demonstrate that combining large-scale global features and local patch features performs signiﬁcantly better than directly applying hCRF on local patches alone. 1</p><p>4 0.93524551 <a title="119-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Liqing Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A visual attention system should respond placidly when common stimuli are presented, while at the same time keep alert to anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return. 1</p><p>5 0.89272022 <a title="119-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Signal-to-Noise_Ratio_Analysis_of_Policy_Gradient_Algorithms.html">210 nips-2008-Signal-to-Noise Ratio Analysis of Policy Gradient Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: John W. Roberts, Russ Tedrake</p><p>Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) reinforcement learning algorithms have strong (local) convergence guarantees, but their learning performance is typically limited by a large variance in the estimate of the gradient. In this paper, we formulate the variance reduction problem by describing a signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for policy gradient algorithms, and evaluate this SNR carefully for the popular Weight Perturbation (WP) algorithm. We conﬁrm that SNR is a good predictor of long-term learning performance, and that in our episodic formulation, the cost-to-go function is indeed the optimal baseline. We then propose two modiﬁcations to traditional model-free policy gradient algorithms in order to optimize the SNR. First, we examine WP using anisotropic sampling distributions, which introduces a bias into the update but increases the SNR; this bias can be interpreted as following the natural gradient of the cost function. Second, we show that non-Gaussian distributions can also increase the SNR, and argue that the optimal isotropic distribution is a ‘shell’ distribution with a constant magnitude and uniform distribution in direction. We demonstrate that both modiﬁcations produce substantial improvements in learning performance in challenging policy gradient experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.84874249 <a title="119-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Covariance_Estimation_for_High_Dimensional_Data_Vectors_Using_the_Sparse_Matrix_Transform.html">54 nips-2008-Covariance Estimation for High Dimensional Data Vectors Using the Sparse Matrix Transform</a></p>

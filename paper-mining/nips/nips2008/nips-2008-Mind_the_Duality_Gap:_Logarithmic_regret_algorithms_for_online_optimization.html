<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the generalization properties of online convex programming algorithms when the loss function is Lipschitz and strongly convex. Our main result is a sharp bound, that holds with high probability, on the excess risk of the output of an online algorithm in terms of the average regret. This allows one to use recent algorithms with logarithmic cumulative regret guarantees to achieve fast convergence rates for the excess risk with high probability. As a corollary, we characterize the convergence rate of P EGASOS (with high probability), a recently proposed method for solving the SVM optimization problem. 1</p><p>3 0.23235585 <a title="133-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss. This method has several essential properties. First, the degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically. We apply it to several datasets and ﬁnd for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable. 1</p><p>4 0.2153015 <a title="133-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Complexity_of_Linear_Prediction%3A_Risk_Bounds%2C_Margin_Bounds%2C_and_Regularization.html">161 nips-2008-On the Complexity of Linear Prediction: Risk Bounds, Margin Bounds, and Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This work characterizes the generalization ability of algorithms whose predictions are linear in the input vector. To this end, we provide sharp bounds for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities of (constrained) linear classes, which directly lead to a number of generalization bounds.

In addition to providing a uniﬁed analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds.

<p>Author: Prateek Jain, Brian Kulis, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: Metric learning algorithms can provide useful distance functions for a variety of domains, and recent work has shown good accuracy for problems where the learner can access all distance constraints at once. However, in many real applications, constraints are only available incrementally, thus necessitating methods that can perform online updates to the learned metric. Existing online algorithms offer bounds on worst-case performance, but typically do not perform well in practice as compared to their ofﬂine counterparts. We present a new online metric learning algorithm that updates a learned Mahalanobis metric based on LogDet regularization and gradient descent. We prove theoretical worst-case performance bounds, and empirically compare the proposed method against existing online metric learning algorithms. To further boost the practicality of our approach, we develop an online locality-sensitive hashing scheme which leads to efﬁcient updates to data structures used for fast approximate similarity search. We demonstrate our algorithm on multiple datasets and show that it outperforms relevant baselines.</p><p>6 0.16492873 <a title="133-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Multi-stage_Convex_Relaxation_for_Learning_with_Sparse_Regularization.html">145 nips-2008-Multi-stage Convex Relaxation for Learning with Sparse Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Karthik Sridharan, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Nathan Srebro</p><p>Abstract: We study convergence properties of empirical minimization of a stochastic strongly convex objective, where the stochastic component is linear. We show that the value attained by the empirical minimizer converges to the optimal value with rate 1/n. The result applies, in particular, to the SVM objective. Thus, we obtain a rate of 1/n on the convergence of the SVM objective (with ﬁxed regularization parameter) to its inﬁnite data limit. We demonstrate how this is essential for obtaining certain type of oracle inequalities for SVMs. The results extend also to approximate minimization as well as to strong convexity with respect to an arbitrary norm, and so also to objectives regularized using other p norms. 1</p><p>4 0.58160311 <a title="133-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-An_Online_Algorithm_for_Maximizing_Submodular_Functions.html">22 nips-2008-An Online Algorithm for Maximizing Submodular Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Streeter, Daniel Golovin</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for solving a broad class of online resource allocation problems. Our online algorithm can be applied in environments where abstract jobs arrive one at a time, and one can complete the jobs by investing time in a number of abstract activities, according to some schedule. We assume that the fraction of jobs completed by a schedule is a monotone, submodular function of a set of pairs (v, τ ), where τ is the time invested in activity v. Under this assumption, our online algorithm performs near-optimally according to two natural metrics: (i) the fraction of jobs completed within time T , for some ﬁxed deadline T > 0, and (ii) the average time required to complete each job. We evaluate our algorithm experimentally by using it to learn, online, a schedule for allocating CPU time among solvers entered in the 2007 SAT solver competition. 1</p><p>5 0.57299244 <a title="133-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Online_Metric_Learning_and_Fast_Similarity_Search.html">168 nips-2008-Online Metric Learning and Fast Similarity Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Talvitie, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel mathematical formalism for the idea of a “local model” of an uncontrolled dynamical system, a model that makes only certain predictions in only certain situations. As a result of its restricted responsibilities, a local model may be far simpler than a complete model of the system. We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods. 1</p><p>5 0.64837378 <a title="133-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_Online_Strongly_Convex_Programming_Algorithms.html">164 nips-2008-On the Generalization Ability of Online Strongly Convex Programming Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the generalization properties of online convex programming algorithms when the loss function is Lipschitz and strongly convex. Our main result is a sharp bound, that holds with high probability, on the excess risk of the output of an online algorithm in terms of the average regret. This allows one to use recent algorithms with logarithmic cumulative regret guarantees to achieve fast convergence rates for the excess risk with high probability. As a corollary, we characterize the convergence rate of P EGASOS (with high probability), a recently proposed method for solving the SVM optimization problem. 1</p><p>6 0.64629233 <a title="133-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>

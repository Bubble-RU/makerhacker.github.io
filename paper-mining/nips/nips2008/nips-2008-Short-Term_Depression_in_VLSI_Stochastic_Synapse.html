<p>Author: Vicençc Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>4 0.19563854 <a title="209-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Extracting_State_Transition_Dynamics_from_Multiple_Spike_Trains_with_Correlated_Poisson_HMM.html">81 nips-2008-Extracting State Transition Dynamics from Multiple Spike Trains with Correlated Poisson HMM</a></p>
<p>Author: Kentaro Katahira, Jun Nishikawa, Kazuo Okanoya, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: Neural activity is non-stationary and varies across time. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) have been used to track the state transition among quasi-stationary discrete neural states. Within this context, independent Poisson models have been used for the output distribution of HMMs; hence, the model is incapable of tracking the change in correlation without modulating the ﬁring rate. To achieve this, we applied a multivariate Poisson distribution with correlation terms for the output distribution of HMMs. We formulated a Variational Bayes (VB) inference for the model. The VB could automatically determine the appropriate number of hidden states and correlation types while avoiding the overlearning problem. We developed an efﬁcient algorithm for computing posteriors using the recursive relationship of a multivariate Poisson distribution. We demonstrated the performance of our method on synthetic data and a real spike train recorded from a songbird. 1</p><p>5 0.18456531 <a title="209-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Arno Onken, Steffen Grünewälder, Matthias Munk, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Correlations between spike counts are often used to analyze neural coding. The noise is typically assumed to be Gaussian. Yet, this assumption is often inappropriate, especially for low spike counts. In this study, we present copulas as an alternative approach. With copulas it is possible to use arbitrary marginal distributions such as Poisson or negative binomial that are better suited for modeling noise distributions of spike counts. Furthermore, copulas place a wide range of dependence structures at the disposal and can be used to analyze higher order interactions. We develop a framework to analyze spike count data by means of copulas. Methods for parameter inference based on maximum likelihood estimates and for computation of mutual information are provided. We apply the method to our data recorded from macaque prefrontal cortex. The data analysis leads to three ﬁndings: (1) copula-based distributions provide signiﬁcantly better ﬁts than discretized multivariate normal distributions; (2) negative binomial margins ﬁt the data signiﬁcantly better than Poisson margins; and (3) the dependence structure carries 12% of the mutual information between stimuli and responses. 1</p><p>6 0.17659387 <a title="209-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Dependent_Dirichlet_Process_Spike_Sorting.html">59 nips-2008-Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Gasthaus, Frank Wood, Dilan Gorur, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new incremental spike sorting model that automatically eliminates refractory period violations, accounts for action potential waveform drift, and can handle “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons. Our approach is to augment a known time-varying Dirichlet process that ties together a sequence of inﬁnite Gaussian mixture models, one per action potential waveform observation, with an interspike-interval-dependent likelihood that prohibits refractory period violations. We demonstrate this model by showing results from sorting two publicly available neural data recordings for which a partial ground truth labeling is known. 1</p><p>4 0.7181983 <a title="209-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Self-organization_using_synaptic_plasticity.html">204 nips-2008-Self-organization using synaptic plasticity</a></p>

<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>6 0.64962643 <a title="209-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Extracting_State_Transition_Dynamics_from_Multiple_Spike_Trains_with_Correlated_Poisson_HMM.html">81 nips-2008-Extracting State Transition Dynamics from Multiple Spike Trains with Correlated Poisson HMM</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Torr, M. P. Kumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining the approximate maximum a posteriori estimate of a discrete random ﬁeld characterized by pairwise potentials that form a truncated convex model. For this problem, we propose an improved st-MINCUT based move making algorithm. Unlike previous move making approaches, which either provide a loose bound or no bound on the quality of the solution (in terms of the corresponding Gibbs energy), our algorithm achieves the same guarantees as the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation. Compared to previous approaches based on the LP relaxation, e.g. interior-point algorithms or treereweighted message passing (TRW), our method is faster as it uses only the efﬁcient st-MINCUT algorithm in its design. Furthermore, it directly provides us with a primal solution (unlike TRW and other related methods which solve the dual of the LP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and standard real data problems. Our analysis also opens up an interesting question regarding the relationship between move making algorithms (such as α-expansion and the algorithms presented in this paper) and the randomized rounding schemes used with convex relaxations. We believe that further explorations in this direction would help design efﬁcient algorithms for more complex relaxations.</p><p>4 0.3502363 <a title="209-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Self-organization_using_synaptic_plasticity.html">204 nips-2008-Self-organization using synaptic plasticity</a></p>

The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>5 0.33515248 <a title="209-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Bio-inspired_Real_Time_Sensory_Map_Realignment_in_a_Robotic_Barn_Owl.html">38 nips-2008-Bio-inspired Real Time Sensory Map Realignment in a Robotic Barn Owl</a></p>
<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>6 0.33284414 <a title="209-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Dependent_Dirichlet_Process_Spike_Sorting.html">59 nips-2008-Dependent Dirichlet Process Spike Sorting</a></p>

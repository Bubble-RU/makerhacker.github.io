<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This work characterizes the generalization ability of algorithms whose predictions are linear in the input vector. To this end, we provide sharp bounds for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities of (constrained) linear classes, which directly lead to a number of generalization bounds. This derivation provides simpliﬁed proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a uniﬁed analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds. Interestingly, our results show that the uniform convergence rates of empirical risk minimization algorithms tightly match the regret bounds of online learning algorithms for linear prediction, up to a constant factor of 2. 1</p><p>3 0.20362313 <a title="189-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Kernel_Change-point_Analysis.html">111 nips-2008-Kernel Change-point Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Zaïd Harchaoui, Eric Moulines, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a kernel-based method for change-point analysis within a sequence of temporal observations. Change-point analysis of an unlabelled sample of observations consists in, ﬁrst, testing whether a change in the distribution occurs within the sample, and second, if a change occurs, estimating the change-point instant after which the distribution of the observations switches from one distribution to another different distribution. We propose a test statistic based upon the maximum kernel Fisher discriminant ratio as a measure of homogeneity between segments. We derive its limiting distribution under the null hypothesis (no change occurs), and establish the consistency under the alternative hypothesis (a change occurs). This allows to build a statistical hypothesis testing procedure for testing the presence of a change-point, with a prescribed false-alarm probability and detection probability tending to one in the large-sample setting. If a change actually occurs, the test statistic also yields an estimator of the change-point location. Promising experimental results in temporal segmentation of mental tasks from BCI data and pop song indexation are presented. 1</p><p>4 0.17198406 <a title="189-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Risk_Bounds_for_Randomized_Sample_Compressed_Classifiers.html">199 nips-2008-Risk Bounds for Randomized Sample Compressed Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Benjamin Recht</p><p>Abstract: Randomized neural networks are immortalized in this AI Koan: In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6. “What are you doing?” asked Minsky. “I am training a randomly wired neural net to play tic-tac-toe,” Sussman replied. “Why is the net wired randomly?” asked Minsky. Sussman replied, “I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play.” Minsky then shut his eyes. “Why do you close your eyes?” Sussman asked his teacher. “So that the room will be empty,” replied Minsky. At that moment, Sussman was enlightened. We analyze shallow random networks with the help of concentration of measure inequalities. Speciﬁcally, we consider architectures that compute a weighted sum of their inputs after passing them through a bank of arbitrary randomized nonlinearities. We identify conditions under which these networks exhibit good classiﬁcation performance, and bound their test error in terms of the size of the dataset and the number of random nonlinearities. 1</p><p>6 0.089416437 <a title="189-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Rates_for_Regularized_Objectives.html">85 nips-2008-Fast Rates for Regularized Objectives</a></p>

<p>Author: Jooseuk Kim, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: We provide statistical performance guarantees for a recently introduced kernel classiﬁer that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a difference of densities. The classiﬁer is similar to a support vector machine (SVM) in that it is the solution of a quadratic program and yields a sparse classiﬁer. Unlike SVMs, however, the L2 kernel classiﬁer does not involve a regularization parameter. We prove a distribution free concentration inequality for a cross-validation based estimate of the ISE, and apply this result to deduce an oracle inequality and consistency of the classiﬁer on the sense of both ISE and probability of error. Our results also specialize to give performance guarantees for an existing method of L2 kernel density estimation. 1</p><p>4 0.68101364 <a title="189-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Generalization_Ability_of_Online_Strongly_Convex_Programming_Algorithms.html">164 nips-2008-On the Generalization Ability of Online Strongly Convex Programming Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This paper examines the generalization properties of online convex programming algorithms when the loss function is Lipschitz and strongly convex. Our main result is a sharp bound, that holds with high probability, on the excess risk of the output of an online algorithm in terms of the average regret. This allows one to use recent algorithms with logarithmic cumulative regret guarantees to achieve fast convergence rates for the excess risk with high probability. As a corollary, we characterize the convergence rate of P EGASOS (with high probability), a recently proposed method for solving the SVM optimization problem. 1</p><p>5 0.64841402 <a title="189-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Martingale_Boosting.html">15 nips-2008-Adaptive Martingale Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Phil Long, Rocco Servedio</p><p>Abstract: In recent work Long and Servedio [LS05] presented a “martingale boosting” algorithm that works by constructing a branching program over weak classiﬁers and has a simple analysis based on elementary properties of random walks. [LS05] showed that this martingale booster can tolerate random classiﬁcation noise when it is run with a noise-tolerant weak learner; however, a drawback of the algorithm is that it is not adaptive, i.e. it cannot effectively take advantage of variation in the quality of the weak classiﬁers it receives. We present an adaptive variant of the martingale boosting algorithm. This adaptiveness is achieved by modifying the original algorithm so that the random walks that arise in its analysis have different step size depending on the quality of the weak learner at each stage. The new algorithm inherits the desirable properties of the original [LS05] algorithm, such as random classiﬁcation noise tolerance, and has other advantages besides adaptiveness: it requires polynomially fewer calls to the weak learner than the original algorithm, and it can be used with conﬁdencerated weak hypotheses that output real values rather than Boolean predictions.</p><p>6 0.64675444 <a title="189-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>

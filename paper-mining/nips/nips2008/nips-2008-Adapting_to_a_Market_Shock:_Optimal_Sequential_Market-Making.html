<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey</p><p>Abstract: In analogy to the PCA setting, the sparse PCA problem is often solved by iteratively alternating between two subtasks: cardinality-constrained rank-one variance maximization and matrix deﬂation. While the former has received a great deal of attention in the literature, the latter is seldom analyzed and is typically borrowed without justiﬁcation from the PCA context. In this work, we demonstrate that the standard PCA deﬂation procedure is seldom appropriate for the sparse PCA setting. To rectify the situation, we ﬁrst develop several deﬂation alternatives better suited to the cardinality-constrained context. We then reformulate the sparse PCA optimization problem to explicitly reﬂect the maximum additional variance objective on each round. The result is a generalized deﬂation procedure that typically outperforms more standard techniques on real-world datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.11399946 <a title="13-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Sequential_effects%3A_Superstition_or_rational_behavior%3F.html">206 nips-2008-Sequential effects: Superstition or rational behavior?</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela J. Yu, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In a variety of behavioral tasks, subjects exhibit an automatic and apparently suboptimal sequential effect: they respond more rapidly and accurately to a stimulus if it reinforces a local pattern in stimulus history, such as a string of repetitions or alternations, compared to when it violates such a pattern. This is often the case even if the local trends arise by chance in the context of a randomized design, such that stimulus history has no real predictive power. In this work, we use a normative Bayesian framework to examine the hypothesis that such idiosyncrasies may reﬂect the inadvertent engagement of mechanisms critical for adapting to a changing environment. We show that prior belief in non-stationarity can induce experimentally observed sequential effects in an otherwise Bayes-optimal algorithm. The Bayesian algorithm is shown to be well approximated by linear-exponential ﬁltering of past observations, a feature also apparent in the behavioral data. We derive an explicit relationship between the parameters and computations of the exact Bayesian algorithm and those of the approximate linear-exponential ﬁlter. Since the latter is equivalent to a leaky-integration process, a commonly used model of neuronal dynamics underlying perceptual decision-making and trial-to-trial dependencies, our model provides a principled account of why such dynamics are useful. We also show that parameter-tuning of the leaky-integration process is possible, using stochastic gradient descent based only on the noisy binary inputs. This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal prediction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities. 1</p><p>4 0.10628937 <a title="13-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Particle_Filter-based_Policy_Gradient_in_POMDPs.html">177 nips-2008-Particle Filter-based Policy Gradient in POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Our setting is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with continuous state, observation and action spaces. Decisions are based on a Particle Filter for estimating the belief state given past observations. We consider a policy gradient approach for parameterized policy optimization. For that purpose, we investigate sensitivity analysis of the performance measure with respect to the parameters of the policy, focusing on Finite Difference (FD) techniques. We show that the naive FD is subject to variance explosion because of the non-smoothness of the resampling procedure. We propose a more sophisticated FD method which overcomes this problem and establish its consistency. 1</p><p>5 0.065052263 <a title="13-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Policy_Iteration.html">195 nips-2008-Regularized Policy Iteration</a></p>
<p>Author: Amir M. Farahmand, Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Shie Mannor, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we consider approximate policy-iteration-based reinforcement learning algorithms. In order to implement a ﬂexible function approximation scheme we propose the use of non-parametric methods with regularization, providing a convenient way to control the complexity of the function approximator. We propose two novel regularized policy iteration algorithms by adding L2 -regularization to two widely-used policy evaluation methods: Bellman residual minimization (BRM) and least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). We derive efﬁcient implementation for our algorithms when the approximate value-functions belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We also provide ﬁnite-sample performance bounds for our algorithms and show that they are able to achieve optimal rates of convergence under the studied conditions. 1</p><p>6 0.059872065 <a title="13-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Biasing_Approximate_Dynamic_Programming_with_a_Lower_Discount_Factor.html">37 nips-2008-Biasing Approximate Dynamic Programming with a Lower Discount Factor</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan, Emily B. Fox</p><p>Abstract: Many nonlinear dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efﬁcient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences. The utility and ﬂexibility of our model are demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, and the IBOVESPA stock index.</p><p>6 0.42113569 <a title="13-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Load_and_Attentional_Bayes.html">124 nips-2008-Load and Attentional Bayes</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Pannagadatta K. Shivaswamy</p><p>Abstract: In classiﬁcation problems, Support Vector Machines maximize the margin of separation between two classes. While the paradigm has been successful, the solution obtained by SVMs is dominated by the directions with large data spread and biased to separate the classes by cutting along large spread directions. This article proposes a novel formulation to overcome such sensitivity and maximizes the margin relative to the spread of the data. The proposed formulation can be eﬃciently solved and experiments on digit datasets show drastic performance improvements over SVMs. 1</p><p>4 0.45404342 <a title="13-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: For supervised and unsupervised learning, positive deﬁnite kernels allow to use large and potentially inﬁnite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the ℓ1 -norm or the block ℓ1 -norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efﬁciently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p><p>5 0.33547908 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">234 nips-2008-The Infinite Factorial Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Jurgen V. Gael, Yee W. Teh, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new probability distribution over a potentially inﬁnite number of binary Markov chains which we call the Markov Indian buffet process. This process extends the IBP to allow temporal dependencies in the hidden variables. We use this stochastic process to build a nonparametric extension of the factorial hidden Markov model. After constructing an inference scheme which combines slice sampling and dynamic programming we demonstrate how the inﬁnite factorial hidden Markov model can be used for blind source separation. 1</p><p>6 0.33019409 <a title="13-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Analyzing_human_feature_learning_as_nonparametric_Bayesian_inference.html">26 nips-2008-Analyzing human feature learning as nonparametric Bayesian inference</a></p>

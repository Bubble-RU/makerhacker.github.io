<p>Author: Jeremy Lewi, Robert Butera, David M. Schneider, Sarah Woolley, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Sequential optimal design methods hold great promise for improving the efﬁciency of neurophysiology experiments. However, previous methods for optimal experimental design have incorporated only weak prior information about the underlying neural system (e.g., the sparseness or smoothness of the receptive ﬁeld). Here we describe how to use stronger prior information, in the form of parametric models of the receptive ﬁeld, in order to construct optimal stimuli and further improve the efﬁciency of our experiments. For example, if we believe that the receptive ﬁeld is well-approximated by a Gabor function, then our method constructs stimuli that optimally constrain the Gabor parameters (orientation, spatial frequency, etc.) using as few experimental trials as possible. More generally, we may believe a priori that the receptive ﬁeld lies near a known sub-manifold of the full parameter space; in this case, our method chooses stimuli in order to reduce the uncertainty along the tangent space of this sub-manifold as rapidly as possible. Applications to simulated and real data indicate that these methods may in many cases improve the experimental efﬁciency. 1</p><p>3 0.14956769 <a title="151-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Convergence_and_Rate_of_Convergence_of_a_Manifold-Based_Dimension_Reduction_Algorithm.html">51 nips-2008-Convergence and Rate of Convergence of a Manifold-Based Dimension Reduction Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Smith, Hongyuan Zha, Xiao-ming Wu</p><p>Abstract: We study the convergence and the rate of convergence of a local manifold learning algorithm: LTSA [13]. The main technical tool is the perturbation analysis on the linear invariant subspace that corresponds to the solution of LTSA. We derive a worst-case upper bound of errors for LTSA which naturally leads to a convergence result. We then derive the rate of convergence for LTSA in a special case. 1</p><p>4 0.094788171 <a title="151-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Learning_with_Networks_of_Features.html">194 nips-2008-Regularized Learning with Networks of Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ted Sandler, John Blitzer, Partha P. Talukdar, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature’s weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.085208207 <a title="151-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Extended_Grassmann_Kernels_for_Subspace-Based_Learning.html">80 nips-2008-Extended Grassmann Kernels for Subspace-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jihun Hamm, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Subspace-based learning problems involve data whose elements are linear subspaces of a vector space. To handle such data structures, Grassmann kernels have been proposed and used previously. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Grassmann kernels and probabilistic similarity measures. Firstly, we show that the KL distance in the limit yields the Projection kernel on the Grassmann manifold, whereas the Bhattacharyya kernel becomes trivial in the limit and is suboptimal for subspace-based problems. Secondly, based on our analysis of the KL distance, we propose extensions of the Projection kernel which can be extended to the set of afﬁne as well as scaled subspaces. We demonstrate the advantages of these extended kernels for classiﬁcation and recognition tasks with Support Vector Machines and Kernel Discriminant Analysis using synthetic and real image databases. 1</p><p>6 0.0836339 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Prediction_on_a_Tree.html">84 nips-2008-Fast Prediction on a Tree</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael P. Holmes, Jr. Isbell, Charles Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The Singular Value Decomposition is a key operation in many machine learning methods. Its computational cost, however, makes it unscalable and impractical for applications involving large datasets or real-time responsiveness, which are becoming increasingly common. We present a new method, QUIC-SVD, for fast approximation of the whole-matrix SVD based on a new sampling mechanism called the cosine tree. Our empirical tests show speedups of several orders of magnitude over exact SVD. Such scalability should enable QUIC-SVD to accelerate and enable a wide array of SVD-based methods and applications. 1</p><p>6 0.41244593 <a title="151-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Diffeomorphic_Dimensionality_Reduction.html">61 nips-2008-Diffeomorphic Dimensionality Reduction</a></p>

Our model extends the correlated topic model framework to probabilistic grammars, exploiting the logistic normal distribution as a prior over the grammar parameters. We derive a variational EM algorithm for that model, and then experiment with the task of unsupervised grammar induction for natural language dependency parsing.

<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption. However, real shapes from image datasets, even when expected to be related by “almost isometric” transformations, are actually subject not only to noise but also, to some limited degree, to variations in appearance and scale. In this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction. The outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is robust in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations. Our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models, while maintaining similar running times. 1</p><p>4 0.65166736 <a title="151-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Synchronous_Grammar_Induction.html">35 nips-2008-Bayesian Synchronous Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Phil Blunsom, Trevor Cohn, Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for inducing synchronous context free grammars (SCFGs) from a corpus of parallel string pairs. SCFGs can model equivalence between strings in terms of substitutions, insertions and deletions, and the reordering of sub-strings. We develop a non-parametric Bayesian model and apply it to a machine translation task, using priors to replace the various heuristics commonly used in this ﬁeld. Using a variational Bayes training procedure, we learn the latent structure of translation equivalence through the induction of synchronous grammar categories for phrasal translations, showing improvements in translation performance over maximum likelihood models. 1</p><p>5 0.64702308 <a title="151-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Hierarchical_Factor_Regression_Model.html">235 nips-2008-The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model</a></p>

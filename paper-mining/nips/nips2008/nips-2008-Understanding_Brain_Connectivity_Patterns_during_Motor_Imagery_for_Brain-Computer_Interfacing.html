</p><p>5 This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. [sent-10, score-0.586]
</p><p>6 It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. [sent-11, score-0.651]
</p><p>7 The primary goal of research on BCIs is to enable basic communication for subjects unable to communicate by normal means due to neuro-degenerative diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). [sent-15, score-0.264]
</p><p>8 In non-invasive BCIs, this is usually approached by measuring the electric ﬁeld of the brain by EEG, and detecting changes intentionally induced by the subject (cf. [sent-16, score-0.305]
</p><p>9 The most commonly used experimental paradigm in this context is motor imagery (MI) [2]. [sent-18, score-0.369]
</p><p>10 MI is known to be accompanied by a decrease in bandpower (usually most prominent in the µ-band, i. [sent-22, score-0.261]
</p><p>11 , roughly at 8-13 Hz) in that part of the motor cortex representing the speciﬁc limb [3]. [sent-24, score-0.458]
</p><p>12 These bandpower changes, termed event related (de-)synchronization (ERD/ERS), can be detected and subsequently used for inferring the subject’s intention. [sent-25, score-0.261]
</p><p>13 However, all subjects diagnosed with ALS and capable of operating a BCI still had residual motor control that enabled them to communicate without the use of a BCI. [sent-28, score-0.432]
</p><p>14 1  Unfortunately, reasons for the failure of establishing communication with completely locked-in subjects remain unknown. [sent-33, score-0.219]
</p><p>15 While cognitive deﬁcits in completely locked-in patients can at present not be ruled out as the cause of this failure, another possible explanation is abnormal brain activity observed in patients in late stages of ALS [8]. [sent-34, score-0.294]
</p><p>16 Our own observations indicate that intentionally induced bandpower changes in the electric ﬁeld of the brain might be reduced in subjects in late stages of ALS. [sent-35, score-0.627]
</p><p>17 In this context, one promising approach is to employ connectivity measures between different brain regions. [sent-37, score-0.49]
</p><p>18 It is well known from fMRI-studies that brain activity during MI is not conﬁned to primary motor areas, but rather includes a distributed network including pre-motor, parietal and frontal regions of the brain [9]. [sent-38, score-0.619]
</p><p>19 Furthermore, synchronization between different brain regions is known to be an essential feature of cognitive processing in general [10]. [sent-39, score-0.255]
</p><p>20 Subsequently, it can be expected that different cognitive tasks, such as MI of different limbs, are associated with different connectivity patterns between brain regions. [sent-40, score-0.562]
</p><p>21 These connectivity patterns should be detectable from EEG recordings, and thus offer a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention. [sent-41, score-0.391]
</p><p>22 Since measures of connectivity are, at least in principle, independent of bandpower changes, this might offer a new approach to establishing communication with completely locked-in subjects. [sent-42, score-0.738]
</p><p>23 In recent years, several measures of connectivity have been developed for analyzing EEG recordings (cf. [sent-43, score-0.404]
</p><p>24 However, very few studies exist that analyze connectivity patterns as revealed by EEG during MI [12, 13]. [sent-45, score-0.416]
</p><p>25 Furthermore, these studies focus on differences in connectivity patterns between MI and motor execution, which is not of primary interest for research on BCIs. [sent-46, score-0.773]
</p><p>26 In the context of non-invasive BCIs, connectivity measures have been most notably explored in [14] and [15]. [sent-47, score-0.366]
</p><p>27 However, these studies only consider frequency bands and small subsets of electrodes known to be relevant for bandpower features, and do not take into account possible volume conduction effects. [sent-48, score-0.879]
</p><p>28 This might lead to misinterpreting bandpower changes as changes in connectivity. [sent-49, score-0.401]
</p><p>29 Consequently, a better understanding of connectivity patterns during MI of different limbs as measured by EEG is required to guide the design of new feature extraction algorithms for BCIs. [sent-50, score-0.486]
</p><p>30 Speciﬁcally, it is important to properly address possible volume conduction effects, not conﬁne the analysis to a small subset of electrodes, and consider a broad range of frequency bands. [sent-51, score-0.354]
</p><p>31 In this work, these issues are addressed by combining connectivity analysis during MI of the left and right hand in four healthy subjects with Beamforming methods [6]. [sent-52, score-0.539]
</p><p>32 Since it is well known that MI includes primary motor cortex [3], this area is chosen as the starting point of the connectivity analysis. [sent-53, score-0.824]
</p><p>33 Spatial ﬁlters are designed that selectively extract those components of the EEG originating in the left and right motor cortex. [sent-54, score-0.408]
</p><p>34 Then, the concept of Transfer Entropy [16] is used to estimate class-conditional ’information ﬂow’ from all 128 employed recording sites into the left and right motor cortex in frequency bands ranging from 5 - 55 Hz. [sent-55, score-0.676]
</p><p>35 In this way, spatial topographies are obtained for each frequency band that depict by how much each area of the brain is inﬂuencing the left/right motor cortex during MI of the left/right hand. [sent-56, score-0.757]
</p><p>36 Interestingly, the most pronounced changes in connectivity patterns are not observed in MI of the left vs. [sent-57, score-0.557]
</p><p>37 Furthermore, these pattern changes are most pronounced in frequency bands not usually associated with MI. [sent-60, score-0.274]

</p><p>39 asymmetric connectivity analysis for three EEG sources within the brain. [sent-79, score-0.498]
</p><p>40 the brain can be expected to be asymmetric, with certain brain regions exerting stronger inﬂuence on other regions than vice versa. [sent-80, score-0.326]
</p><p>41 For this reason, asymmetric connectivity measures potentially provide more information on cognitive processes than symmetric measures. [sent-81, score-0.553]
</p><p>42 The commonly adopted deﬁnition of causality in time-series analysis is that si causes sj if observing si helps in predicting future observations of sj , i. [sent-85, score-0.415]
</p><p>43 Note that there is some ambiguity in this deﬁnition of causality, since it does not specify a metric for reduction of the prediction error of sj due to observing si . [sent-93, score-0.177]
</p><p>44 To assess Granger causality between bivariate time-series data a linear autoregressive model is ﬁt to the data, which is then used to compute a 2x2 transfer matrix in the frequency domain (cf. [sent-104, score-0.211]
</p><p>45 The off-diagonal elements of the transfer matrix then provide a measure of the asymmetric interaction between the observed time-series. [sent-106, score-0.167]
</p><p>46 Extensions of Granger causality to multivariate time-series data, termed directed transfer function (DTF) and partial directed coherence (PDC), have been developed (cf. [sent-107, score-0.192]
</p><p>47 The concept of Transfer Entropy (TE) [16] deﬁnes the causal inﬂuence of si on sj as the reduction in entropy of sj obtained by observing si . [sent-110, score-0.404]
</p><p>48 More precisely, let si and sj denote two random processes, and let sk [t] := si/j [t], . [sent-111, score-0.212]
</p><p>49 i/j TE is then deﬁned as Tk (si [t] → sj [t + 1]) := H sj [t + 1]|sk [t] − H sj [t + 1]|sk [t], sk [t] , (1) j j i with k the order of the random processes and H(·) the Shannon entropy. [sent-115, score-0.423]
</p><p>50 TE can thus be understood as the reduction in uncertainty about the random process sj at time t + 1 due to observing the past k samples of the random process si . [sent-116, score-0.177]
</p><p>51 , it is assumed that sj [t + 1], sk [t], sk [t] is jointly Gaussian distributed. [sent-121, score-0.226]
</p><p>52 TE can j i then be computed as det R(sk [t],sk [t]) det R(sj [t+1],sk [t]) 1 j i j GP Tk (si [t] → sj [t + 1]) = log , (2) 2 det R(sj [t+1],sk [t],sk [t]) det R(sk [t]) j i j with R(·) the (cross-)covariance matrices of the respective random processes [17]. [sent-122, score-0.274]
</p><p>53 2  The Problem of Volume Conduction in EEG Connectivity Analysis  The goal of connectivity analysis in EEG recordings is to estimate connectivity patterns between different regions of the brain. [sent-144, score-0.793]
</p><p>54 Instead, each EEG electrode measures a linear and instantaneous superposition of EEG sources within the brain [18]. [sent-146, score-0.392]
</p><p>55 This poses a problem for symmetric connectivity measures, since these assess instantaneous coupling between electrodes [18]. [sent-147, score-0.569]
</p><p>56 Asymmetric connectivity measures such as TE, on the other hand, are not based on instantaneous coupling, but rather consider prediction errors. [sent-148, score-0.41]
</p><p>57 It is not obvious that instantaneous volume conduction also poses a problem for this type of measures. [sent-149, score-0.352]
</p><p>58 Unfortunately, the following example demonstrates that volume conduction also leads to incorrect connectivity estimates in asymmetric connectivity analysis based on TE. [sent-150, score-1.023]
</p><p>59 , that the ﬁrst source only projects to the ﬁrst electrode with unit strength, the second source only projects to the second electrode with unit strength, and the third source projects to both electrodes with unit strength. [sent-158, score-0.498]
</p><p>60 Otherwise, TE between the two electrodes is estimated to be greater than zero solely due to volume conduction effects from source s3 . [sent-170, score-0.509]
</p><p>61 Accordingly, attenuation of volume conduction effects via source localization is not feasible if a complete connectivity pattern considering the whole brain is desired. [sent-179, score-0.834]
</p><p>62 It is well known that primary motor cortex is central to MI as measured by EEG [3]. [sent-181, score-0.499]
</p><p>63 Accordingly, it is assumed that any brain region involved in MI displays some connectivity to the primary motor cortex. [sent-182, score-0.781]
</p><p>64 This (admittedly rather strong) assumption enables a complete analysis of the connectivity patterns during MI covering the whole brain in the following way. [sent-183, score-0.515]
</p><p>65 First, two spatial ﬁlters, commonly known as Beamformers, are designed that selectively extract EEG sources originating within the right and left motor cortex, respectively [6]. [sent-184, score-0.523]
</p><p>66 In brief, this can be accomplished by solving the optimization problem wT Rxl/r w ˜ w T Rx w  w∗ = argmax w∈RM  ,  (5)  with Rx ∈ RM ×M the covariance of the recorded EEG, and Rxl/r ∈ RM ×M model-based spatial ˜ covariance matrices of EEG sources originating within the left/right motor cortex. [sent-185, score-0.567]
</p><p>67 In this way, spatial ﬁlters can be obtained that optimally attenuate the variance of all EEG sources not originating within the left/right motor cortex. [sent-186, score-0.468]
</p><p>68 With EEG sources originating within the left and right motor cortex extracted, TE from all EEG electrodes into the left and right motor cortex can be computed. [sent-189, score-1.318]
</p><p>69 In this way, volume conduction effects from all sources within the brain into the left/right motor cortex can be optimally attenuated. [sent-190, score-0.985]
</p><p>70 However, volume conduction effects from the left/right motor cortex to any of the EEG electrodes still poses a problem. [sent-191, score-0.95]
</p><p>71 Accordingly, it has to be veriﬁed if any positive TE from an EEG electrode into the left/right motor cortex could be caused by bandpower changes within the left/right motor cortex. [sent-192, score-1.155]
</p><p>72 Positive TE from any electrode into the left/right motor cortex can only be considered as a genuine causal link if it is not accompanied by a bandpower change in the respective motor cortex. [sent-193, score-1.159]
</p><p>73 3  Experimental Results  To investigate connectivity patterns during MI the following experimental paradigm was employed. [sent-194, score-0.391]
</p><p>74 During the experiment, EEG was recorded at 128 electrodes placed according to the extended 10-20 system with electrode Cz as reference. [sent-202, score-0.259]
</p><p>75 For each subject, model-based covariance matrices Rxl/r for EEG sources within the left/right motor ˜ cortex were computed as described in [6]. [sent-208, score-0.572]
</p><p>76 The EEG covariance matrix Rx was computed for each subject using all available data, and the two desired Beamformers, extracting EEG sources from the left and right motor cortex, were computed by solving (5). [sent-209, score-0.507]
</p><p>77 The EEG sources extracted from the left/right motor cortex as well as the unﬁltered data recorded at each electrode were then bandpass5  ﬁltered with sixth-order Butterworth ﬁlters in ﬁve frequency bands ranging from 5 to 55 Hz in steps of 10 Hz. [sent-210, score-0.816]
</p><p>78 Then, TE was computed from all EEG electrodes into the left/right motor cortex at each sample point as described in Section 2. [sent-211, score-0.605]
</p><p>79 Furthermore, for each subject class-conditional bandpower changes (ERD/ERS) of sources extracted from the left/right motor cortex were computed in order to identify frequency bands with common modulations in bandpower and TE. [sent-213, score-1.378]
</p><p>80 Two subjects showed signiﬁcant modulations of bandpower in all ﬁve frequency bands. [sent-214, score-0.475]
</p><p>81 The resulting topographies of mean TE between conditions of the two remaining subjects are shown in Fig. [sent-216, score-0.18]
</p><p>82 Here, the ﬁrst two columns show mean TE from all electrodes into the left/right motor cortex during MI of either hand (3. [sent-218, score-0.629]
</p><p>83 The last two columns show mean differences in TE into the left/right motor cortex between MI of the left and right hand (both conditions also baseline corrected). [sent-221, score-0.562]
</p><p>84 The observed changes in TE display opposite modulations in comparison to mean bandpower changes observed in left/right motor cortex relative to baseline (Fig. [sent-234, score-0.942]
</p><p>85 Here, strongest modulation of bandpower is found in the µ- (∼ 10 Hz) and β-band (∼ 25 Hz). [sent-237, score-0.345]
</p><p>86 3 are not due to volume conduction but genuine causal links. [sent-239, score-0.357]
</p><p>87 4  Discussion  In this study, Beamforming and TE were employed to investigate the topographies of ’information ﬂow’ into the left and right motor cortex during MI as measured by EEG. [sent-240, score-0.585]
</p><p>88 To the best of the author’s knowledge, this is the ﬁrst study investigating asymmetric connectivity patterns between brain regions during MI of different limbs considering a broad frequency range, a large number of recordings sites, and properly taking into account volume conduction effects. [sent-241, score-1.099]
</p><p>89 First, the presented results are obtained from only two subjects, since two subjects had to be excluded due to possible volume conduction effects. [sent-243, score-0.391]
</p><p>90 Also, no outﬂow from primary motor cortex and no TE between brain regions not including primary motor cortex have been considered. [sent-245, score-1.161]
</p><p>91 Never the less, the obtained results indicate that bandpower changes in motor cortex and connectivity between motor cortex and other regions of the brain are processes that occupy distinct spectral bands and are modulated by different cognitive tasks. [sent-247, score-1.924]
</p><p>92 In conjunction with the observation of no distinct changes in connectivity patterns between MI of different limbs, this indicates that in [14] and [15] bandpower changes might have been misinterpreted as connectivity changes. [sent-248, score-1.117]
</p><p>93 This is further supported by the fact that these studies focused on frequency bands displaying signiﬁcant modulation of bandpower (8-30 Hz) and did not control for volume conduction effects. [sent-249, score-0.78]
</p><p>94 In conclusion, the pronounced modulation of connectivity between MI of either hand vs. [sent-250, score-0.438]

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>2 0.19383068 <a title="243-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2008-Playing_Pinball_with_non-invasive_BCI.html">180 nips-2008-Playing Pinball with non-invasive BCI</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Krauledat, Konrad Grzeska, Max Sagebaum, Benjamin Blankertz, Carmen Vidaurre, Klaus-Robert Müller, Michael Schröder</p><p>Abstract: Compared to invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), non-invasive BCI systems based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have not been applied successfully for precisely timed control tasks. In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. 1</p><p>3 0.18754764 <a title="243-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V.

The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.12201066 <a title="243-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Policy_Search_for_Motor_Primitives_in_Robotics.html">181 nips-2008-Policy Search for Motor Primitives in Robotics</a></p>
<p>Author: Jens Kober, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Many motor skills in humanoid robotics can be learned using parametrized motor primitives as done in imitation learning. However, most interesting motor learning problems are high-dimensional reinforcement learning problems often beyond the reach of current methods. In this paper, we extend previous work on policy learning from the immediate reward case to episodic reinforcement learning. We show that this results in a general, common framework also connected to policy gradient methods and yielding a novel algorithm for policy learning that is particularly well-suited for dynamic motor primitives. The resulting algorithm is an EM-inspired algorithm applicable to complex motor learning tasks. We compare this algorithm to several well-known parametrized policy search methods and show that it outperforms them. We apply it in the context of motor learning and show that it can learn a complex Ball-in-a-Cup task using a real Barrett WAMTM robot arm. 1</p><p>5 0.11862244 <a title="243-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Unifying_the_Sensory_and_Motor_Components_of_Sensorimotor_Adaptation.html">244 nips-2008-Unifying the Sensory and Motor Components of Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Haith, Carl P. Jackson, R. C. Miall, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation of visually guided reaching movements in novel visuomotor environments (e.g. wearing prism goggles) comprises not only motor adaptation but also substantial sensory adaptation, corresponding to shifts in the perceived spatial location of visual and proprioceptive cues. Previous computational models of the sensory component of visuomotor adaptation have assumed that it is driven purely by the discrepancy introduced between visual and proprioceptive estimates of hand position and is independent of any motor component of adaptation. We instead propose a uniﬁed model in which sensory and motor adaptation are jointly driven by optimal Bayesian estimation of the sensory and motor contributions to perceived errors. Our model is able to account for patterns of performance errors during visuomotor adaptation as well as the subsequent perceptual aftereﬀects. This uniﬁed model also makes the surprising prediction that force ﬁeld adaptation will elicit similar perceptual shifts, even though there is never any discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive observations. We conﬁrm this prediction with an experiment. 1</p><p>6 0.11653211 <a title="243-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_the_Location_and_Orientation_of_Complex%2C_Correlated_Neural_Activity_using_MEG.html">74 nips-2008-Estimating the Location and Orientation of Complex, Correlated Neural Activity using MEG</a></p>

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>2 0.8367092 <a title="243-lsi-2" href="./nips-2008-Playing_Pinball_with_non-invasive_BCI.html">180 nips-2008-Playing Pinball with non-invasive BCI</a></p>

<p>Author: Julia Owen, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>5 0.50522375 <a title="243-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Unifying_the_Sensory_and_Motor_Components_of_Sensorimotor_Adaptation.html">244 nips-2008-Unifying the Sensory and Motor Components of Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for actively learning visual categories from a mixture of weakly and strongly labeled image examples. We propose to allow the categorylearner to strategically choose what annotations it receives—based on both the expected reduction in uncertainty as well as the relative costs of obtaining each annotation. We construct a multiple-instance discriminative classiﬁer based on the initial training data. Then all remaining unlabeled and weakly labeled examples are surveyed to actively determine which annotation ought to be requested next. After each request, the current classiﬁer is incrementally updated. Unlike previous work, our approach accounts for the fact that the optimal use of manual annotation may call for a combination of labels at multiple levels of granularity (e.g., a full segmentation on some images and a present/absent ﬂag on others). As a result, it is possible to learn more accurate category models with a lower total expenditure of manual annotation effort. 1</p><p>3 0.6612184 <a title="243-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Regression_and_Lasso.html">202 nips-2008-Robust Regression and Lasso</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Constantine Caramanis, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: We consider robust least-squares regression with feature-wise disturbance. We show that this formulation leads to tractable convex optimization problems, and we exhibit a particular uncertainty set for which the robust problem is equivalent to 1 regularized regression (Lasso). This provides an interpretation of Lasso from a robust optimization perspective. We generalize this robust formulation to consider more general uncertainty sets, which all lead to tractable convex optimization problems. Therefore, we provide a new methodology for designing regression algorithms, which generalize known formulations. The advantage is that robustness to disturbance is a physical property that can be exploited: in addition to obtaining new formulations, we use it directly to show sparsity properties of Lasso, as well as to prove a general consistency result for robust regression problems, including Lasso, from a uniﬁed robustness perspective. 1</p><p>4 0.65948212 <a title="243-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Supervised_Dictionary_Learning.html">226 nips-2008-Supervised Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Guillermo Sapiro, Andrew Zisserman, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: It is now well established that sparse signal models are well suited for restoration tasks and can be effectively learned from audio, image, and video data. Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.65408474 <a title="243-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Design_of_Loss_Functions_for_Classification%3A_theory%2C_robustness_to_outliers%2C_and_SavageBoost.html">162 nips-2008-On the Design of Loss Functions for Classification: theory, robustness to outliers, and SavageBoost</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The machine learning problem of classiﬁer design is studied from the perspective of probability elicitation, in statistics. This shows that the standard approach of proceeding from the speciﬁcation of a loss, to the minimization of conditional risk is overly restrictive. It is shown that a better alternative is to start from the speciﬁcation of a functional form for the minimum conditional risk, and derive the loss function. This has various consequences of practical interest, such as showing that 1) the widely adopted practice of relying on convex loss functions is unnecessary, and 2) many new losses can be derived for classiﬁcation problems. These points are illustrated by the derivation of a new loss which is not convex, but does not compromise the computational tractability of classiﬁer design, and is robust to the contamination of data with outliers. A new boosting algorithm, SavageBoost, is derived for the minimization of this loss. Experimental results show that it is indeed less sensitive to outliers than conventional methods, such as Ada, Real, or LogitBoost, and converges in fewer iterations. 1</p><p>6 0.65397286 <a title="243-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Hebbian_Learning_of_Bayes_Optimal_Decisions.html">96 nips-2008-Hebbian Learning of Bayes Optimal Decisions</a></p>

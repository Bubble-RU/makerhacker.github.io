<p>Author: Matthias Krauledat, Konrad Grzeska, Max Sagebaum, Benjamin Blankertz, Carmen Vidaurre, Klaus-Robert Müller, Michael Schröder</p><p>Abstract: Compared to invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), non-invasive BCI systems based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have not been applied successfully for precisely timed control tasks. In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. 1</p><p>3 0.2351265 <a title="243-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.14219315 <a title="243-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_the_Location_and_Orientation_of_Complex%2C_Correlated_Neural_Activity_using_MEG.html">74 nips-2008-Estimating the Location and Orientation of Complex, Correlated Neural Activity using MEG</a></p>
<p>Author: Julia Owen, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>5 0.095055506 <a title="243-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_asymptotic_equivalence_between_differential_Hebbian_and_temporal_difference_learning_using_a_local_third_factor.html">166 nips-2008-On the asymptotic equivalence between differential Hebbian and temporal difference learning using a local third factor</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Kolodziejski, Bernd Porr, Minija Tamosiunaite, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this theoretical contribution we provide mathematical proof that two of the most important classes of network learning - correlation-based differential Hebbian learning and reward-based temporal difference learning - are asymptotically equivalent when timing the learning with a local modulatory signal. This opens the opportunity to consistently reformulate most of the abstract reinforcement learning framework from a correlation based perspective that is more closely related to the biophysics of neurons. 1</p><p>6 0.088956177 <a title="243-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Effects_of_Stimulus_Type_and_of_Error-Correcting_Code_Design_on_BCI_Speller_Performance.html">67 nips-2008-Effects of Stimulus Type and of Error-Correcting Code Design on BCI Speller Performance</a></p>

<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>6 0.30127507 <a title="243-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-An_improved_estimator_of_Variance_Explained_in_the_presence_of_noise.html">24 nips-2008-An improved estimator of Variance Explained in the presence of noise</a></p>

<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mark Girolami, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Identiﬁcation and comparison of nonlinear dynamical system models using noisy and sparse experimental data is a vital task in many ﬁelds, however current methods are computationally expensive and prone to error due in part to the nonlinear nature of the likelihood surfaces induced. We present an accelerated sampling procedure which enables Bayesian inference of parameters in nonlinear ordinary and delay differential equations via the novel use of Gaussian processes (GP). Our method involves GP regression over time-series data, and the resulting derivative and time delay estimates make parameter inference possible without solving the dynamical system explicitly, resulting in dramatic savings of computational time. We demonstrate the speed and statistical accuracy of our approach using examples of both ordinary and delay differential equations, and provide a comprehensive comparison with current state of the art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.66988802 <a title="243-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.52649409 <a title="243-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Process_Inference_using_Control_Variables.html">71 nips-2008-Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Process Inference using Control Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>5 0.51252329 <a title="243-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Playing_Pinball_with_non-invasive_BCI.html">180 nips-2008-Playing Pinball with non-invasive BCI</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Krauledat, Konrad Grzeska, Max Sagebaum, Benjamin Blankertz, Carmen Vidaurre, Klaus-Robert Müller, Michael Schröder</p><p>Abstract: Compared to invasive Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI), non-invasive BCI systems based on Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have not been applied successfully for precisely timed control tasks. In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. 1</p><p>6 0.50947523 <a title="243-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_low-dimensional_single-trial_analysis_of_neural_population_activity.html">90 nips-2008-Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity</a></p>

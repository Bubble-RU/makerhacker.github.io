<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Guillermo Sapiro, Andrew Zisserman, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: It is now well established that sparse signal models are well suited for restoration tasks and can be effectively learned from audio, image, and video data. Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.19489424 <a title="62-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>
<p>Author: John Langford, Lihong Li, Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general method called truncated gradient to induce sparsity in the weights of online-learning algorithms with convex loss. This method has several essential properties. First, the degree of sparsity is continuous—a parameter controls the rate of sparsiﬁcation from no sparsiﬁcation to total sparsiﬁcation. Second, the approach is theoretically motivated, and an instance of it can be regarded as an online counterpart of the popular L1 -regularization method in the batch setting. We prove small rates of sparsiﬁcation result in only small additional regret with respect to typical online-learning guarantees. Finally, the approach works well empirically. We apply it to several datasets and ﬁnd for datasets with large numbers of features, substantial sparsity is discoverable. 1</p><p>4 0.17507647 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>5 0.17023717 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Deep_Learning_with_Kernel_Regularization_for_Visual_Recognition.html">56 nips-2008-Deep Learning with Kernel Regularization for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Xu, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we aim to train deep neural networks for rapid visual recognition. The task is highly challenging, largely due to the lack of a meaningful regularizer on the functions realized by the networks. We propose a novel regularization method that takes advantage of kernel methods, where an oracle kernel function represents prior knowledge about the recognition task of interest. We derive an efﬁcient algorithm using stochastic gradient descent, and demonstrate encouraging results on a wide range of recognition tasks, in terms of both accuracy and speed. 1</p><p>6 0.16724582 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Learning_with_Networks_of_Features.html">194 nips-2008-Regularized Learning with Networks of Features</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Consider linear prediction models where the target function is a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefﬁcients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneﬁcial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory. 1</p><p>4 0.67965305 <a title="62-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Online_Learning_via_Truncated_Gradient.html">214 nips-2008-Sparse Online Learning via Truncated Gradient</a></p>

<p>Author: Ted Sandler, John Blitzer, Partha P. Talukdar, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature’s weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.82218242 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Reducing_statistical_dependencies_in_natural_signals_using_radial_Gaussianization.html">192 nips-2008-Reducing statistical dependencies in natural signals using radial Gaussianization</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of transforming a signal to a representation in which the components are statistically independent. When the signal is generated as a linear transformation of independent Gaussian or non-Gaussian sources, the solution may be computed using a linear transformation (PCA or ICA, respectively). Here, we consider a complementary case, in which the source is non-Gaussian but elliptically symmetric. Such a source cannot be decomposed into independent components using a linear transform, but we show that a simple nonlinear transformation, which we call radial Gaussianization (RG), is able to remove all dependencies. We apply this methodology to natural signals, demonstrating that the joint distributions of nearby bandpass ﬁlter responses, for both sounds and images, are closer to being elliptically symmetric than linearly transformed factorial sources. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that the reduction in dependency achieved by applying RG to either pairs or blocks of bandpass ﬁlter responses is signiﬁcantly greater than that achieved by PCA or ICA.</p><p>4 0.81929272 <a title="62-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Exact_Inference_in_Planar_Ising_Models.html">69 nips-2008-Efficient Exact Inference in Planar Ising Models</a></p>

Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings in an expanded dual graph. Maximum-margin parameter estimation for a boundary detection task shows our approach to be efﬁcient and effective.

<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.8184824 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>

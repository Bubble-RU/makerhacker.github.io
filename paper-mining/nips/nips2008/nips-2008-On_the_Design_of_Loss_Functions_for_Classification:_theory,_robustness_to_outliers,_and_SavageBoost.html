While they allow for efﬁcient optimization algorithms, these convex formulations are not tight and sacriﬁce the ability to accurately model the true loss. We present tighter non-convex bounds based on generalizing the notion of a ramp loss from binary classiﬁcation to structured estimation. We show that a small modiﬁcation of existing optimization algorithms sufﬁces to solve this modiﬁed problem.

<p>Author: Sham M. Kakade, Karthik Sridharan, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: This work characterizes the generalization ability of algorithms whose predictions are linear in the input vector. To this end, we provide sharp bounds for Rademacher and Gaussian complexities of (constrained) linear classes, which directly lead to a number of generalization bounds. This derivation provides simpliﬁed proofs of a number of corollaries including: risk bounds for linear prediction (including settings where the weight vectors are constrained by either L2 or L1 constraints), margin bounds (including both L2 and L1 margins, along with more general notions based on relative entropy), a proof of the PAC-Bayes theorem, and upper bounds on L2 covering numbers (with Lp norm constraints and relative entropy constraints). In addition to providing a uniﬁed analysis, the results herein provide some of the sharpest risk and margin bounds. Interestingly, our results show that the uniform convergence rates of empirical risk minimization algorithms tightly match the regret bounds of online learning algorithms for linear prediction, up to a constant factor of 2. 1</p><p>4 0.13525695 <a title="162-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Efficient_Minimization_of_Classification_Calibrated_Surrogates.html">163 nips-2008-On the Efficient Minimization of Classification Calibrated Surrogates</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Nock, Frank Nielsen</p><p>Abstract: Bartlett et al (2006) recently proved that a ground condition for convex surrogates, classiﬁcation calibration, ties up the minimization of the surrogates and classiﬁcation risks, and left as an important problem the algorithmic questions about the minimization of these surrogates. In this paper, we propose an algorithm which provably minimizes any classiﬁcation calibrated surrogate strictly convex and differentiable — a set whose losses span the exponential, logistic and squared losses —, with boosting-type guaranteed convergence rates under a weak learning assumption. A particular subclass of these surrogates, that we call balanced convex surrogates, has a key rationale that ties it to maximum likelihood estimation, zerosum games and the set of losses that satisfy some of the most common requirements for losses in supervised learning. We report experiments on more than 50 readily available domains of 11 ﬂavors of the algorithm, that shed light on new surrogates, and the potential of data dependent strategies to tune surrogates. 1</p><p>5 0.13174106 <a title="162-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Martingale_Boosting.html">15 nips-2008-Adaptive Martingale Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Phil Long, Rocco Servedio</p><p>Abstract: In recent work Long and Servedio [LS05] presented a “martingale boosting” algorithm that works by constructing a branching program over weak classiﬁers and has a simple analysis based on elementary properties of random walks. [LS05] showed that this martingale booster can tolerate random classiﬁcation noise when it is run with a noise-tolerant weak learner; however, a drawback of the algorithm is that it is not adaptive, i.e. it cannot effectively take advantage of variation in the quality of the weak classiﬁers it receives. We present an adaptive variant of the martingale boosting algorithm. This adaptiveness is achieved by modifying the original algorithm so that the random walks that arise in its analysis have different step size depending on the quality of the weak learner at each stage. The new algorithm inherits the desirable properties of the original [LS05] algorithm, such as random classiﬁcation noise tolerance, and has other advantages besides adaptiveness: it requires polynomially fewer calls to the weak learner than the original algorithm, and it can be used with conﬁdencerated weak hypotheses that output real values rather than Boolean predictions.</p><p>6 0.13166511 <a title="162-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Support_Vector_Machines_with_a_Reject_Option.html">228 nips-2008-Support Vector Machines with a Reject Option</a></p>

<p>Author: Karthik Sridharan, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Nathan Srebro</p><p>Abstract: We study convergence properties of empirical minimization of a stochastic strongly convex objective, where the stochastic component is linear. We show that the value attained by the empirical minimizer converges to the optimal value with rate 1/n. The result applies, in particular, to the SVM objective. Thus, we obtain a rate of 1/n on the convergence of the SVM objective (with ﬁxed regularization parameter) to its inﬁnite data limit. We demonstrate how this is essential for obtaining certain type of oracle inequalities for SVMs. The results extend also to approximate minimization as well as to strong convexity with respect to an arbitrary norm, and so also to objectives regularized using other p norms. 1</p><p>5 0.64872646 <a title="162-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Support_Vector_Machines_with_a_Reject_Option.html">228 nips-2008-Support Vector Machines with a Reject Option</a></p>
<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Joseph Keshet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation where the classiﬁer may abstain instead of classifying each observation. The Bayes decision rule for this setup, known as Chow’s rule, is deﬁned by two thresholds on posterior probabilities. From simple desiderata, namely the consistency and the sparsity of the classiﬁer, we derive the double hinge loss function that focuses on estimating conditional probabilities only in the vicinity of the threshold points of the optimal decision rule. We show that, for suitable kernel machines, our approach is universally consistent. We cast the problem of minimizing the double hinge loss as a quadratic program akin to the standard SVM optimization problem and propose an active set method to solve it efﬁciently. We ﬁnally provide preliminary experimental results illustrating the interest of our constructive approach to devising loss functions. 1</p><p>6 0.57398784 <a title="162-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Privacy-preserving_logistic_regression.html">185 nips-2008-Privacy-preserving logistic regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>2 0.74944603 <a title="162-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Template_Matching_with_Shift-Invariant_Semi-NMF.html">16 nips-2008-Adaptive Template Matching with Shift-Invariant Semi-NMF</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan L. Roux, Alain D. Cheveigné, Lucas C. Parra</p><p>Abstract: How does one extract unknown but stereotypical events that are linearly superimposed within a signal with variable latencies and variable amplitudes? One could think of using template matching or matching pursuit to ﬁnd the arbitrarily shifted linear components. However, traditional matching approaches require that the templates be known a priori. To overcome this restriction we use instead semi Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (semiNMF) that we extend to allow for time shifts when matching the templates to the signal. The algorithm estimates templates directly from the data along with their non-negative amplitudes. The resulting method can be thought of as an adaptive template matching procedure. We demonstrate the procedure on the task of extracting spikes from single channel extracellular recordings. On these data the algorithm essentially performs spike detection and unsupervised spike clustering. Results on simulated data and extracellular recordings indicate that the method performs well for signalto-noise ratios of 6dB or higher and that spike templates are recovered accurately provided they are suﬃciently diﬀerent. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.69587237 <a title="162-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-On_the_Design_of_Loss_Functions_for_Classification%3A_theory%2C_robustness_to_outliers%2C_and_SavageBoost.html">162 nips-2008-On the Design of Loss Functions for Classification: theory, robustness to outliers, and SavageBoost</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Masnadi-shirazi, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: The machine learning problem of classiﬁer design is studied from the perspective of probability elicitation, in statistics. This shows that the standard approach of proceeding from the speciﬁcation of a loss, to the minimization of conditional risk is overly restrictive. It is shown that a better alternative is to start from the speciﬁcation of a functional form for the minimum conditional risk, and derive the loss function. This has various consequences of practical interest, such as showing that 1) the widely adopted practice of relying on convex loss functions is unnecessary, and 2) many new losses can be derived for classiﬁcation problems. These points are illustrated by the derivation of a new loss which is not convex, but does not compromise the computational tractability of classiﬁer design, and is robust to the contamination of data with outliers. A new boosting algorithm, SavageBoost, is derived for the minimization of this loss. Experimental results show that it is indeed less sensitive to outliers than conventional methods, such as Ada, Real, or LogitBoost, and converges in fewer iterations. 1</p><p>4 0.66001242 <a title="162-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Forward-Backward_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Learning_with_Linear_Models.html">14 nips-2008-Adaptive Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithm for Sparse Learning with Linear Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Consider linear prediction models where the target function is a sparse linear combination of a set of basis functions. We are interested in the problem of identifying those basis functions with non-zero coefﬁcients and reconstructing the target function from noisy observations. Two heuristics that are widely used in practice are forward and backward greedy algorithms. First, we show that neither idea is adequate. Second, we propose a novel combination that is based on the forward greedy algorithm but takes backward steps adaptively whenever beneﬁcial. We prove strong theoretical results showing that this procedure is effective in learning sparse representations. Experimental results support our theory. 1</p><p>5 0.58740866 <a title="162-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-On_the_asymptotic_equivalence_between_differential_Hebbian_and_temporal_difference_learning_using_a_local_third_factor.html">166 nips-2008-On the asymptotic equivalence between differential Hebbian and temporal difference learning using a local third factor</a></p>
<p>Author: Christoph Kolodziejski, Bernd Porr, Minija Tamosiunaite, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: In this theoretical contribution we provide mathematical proof that two of the most important classes of network learning - correlation-based differential Hebbian learning and reward-based temporal difference learning - are asymptotically equivalent when timing the learning with a local modulatory signal. This opens the opportunity to consistently reformulate most of the abstract reinforcement learning framework from a correlation based perspective that is more closely related to the biophysics of neurons. 1</p><p>6 0.5771296 <a title="162-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-A_Convergent_%24O%28n%29%24_Temporal-difference_Algorithm_for_Off-policy_Learning_with_Linear_Function_Approximation.html">1 nips-2008-A Convergent $O(n)$ Temporal-difference Algorithm for Off-policy Learning with Linear Function Approximation</a></p>

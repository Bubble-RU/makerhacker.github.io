<p>Author: Shuang Wu, Hongjing Lu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Psychophysical experiments show that humans are better at perceiving rotation and expansion than translation. These ﬁndings are inconsistent with standard models of motion integration which predict best performance for translation [6]. To explain this discrepancy, our theory formulates motion perception at two levels of inference: we ﬁrst perform model selection between the competing models (e.g. translation, rotation, and expansion) and then estimate the velocity using the selected model. We deﬁne novel prior models for smooth rotation and expansion using techniques similar to those in the slow-and-smooth model [17] (e.g. Green functions of differential operators). The theory gives good agreement with the trends observed in human experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.12702724 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_the_effects_of_memory_on_human_online_sentence_processing_with_particle_filters.html">139 nips-2008-Modeling the effects of memory on human online sentence processing with particle filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Roger P. Levy, Florencia Reali, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Language comprehension in humans is signiﬁcantly constrained by memory, yet rapid, highly incremental, and capable of utilizing a wide range of contextual information to resolve ambiguity and form expectations about future input. In contrast, most of the leading psycholinguistic models and ﬁelded algorithms for natural language parsing are non-incremental, have run time superlinear in input length, and/or enforce structural locality constraints on probabilistic dependencies between events. We present a new limited-memory model of sentence comprehension which involves an adaptation of the particle ﬁlter, a sequential Monte Carlo method, to the problem of incremental parsing. We show that this model can reproduce classic results in online sentence comprehension, and that it naturally provides the ﬁrst rational account of an outstanding problem in psycholinguistics, in which the preferred alternative in a syntactic ambiguity seems to grow more attractive over time even in the absence of strong disambiguating information. 1</p><p>5 0.125306 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Syntactic_Topic_Models.html">229 nips-2008-Syntactic Topic Models</a></p>

The STM generates words that are both thematically and syntactically constrained, which combines the semantic insights of topic models with the syntactic information available from parse trees. Each word of a sentence is generated by a distribution that combines document-speciﬁc topic weights and parse-tree-speciﬁc syntactic transitions. Words are assumed to be generated in an order that respects the parse tree. We derive an approximate posterior inference method based on variational methods for hierarchical Dirichlet processes, and we report qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. 1</p><p>6 0.12153456 <a title="35-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>

<p>Author: Tran T. Truyen, Dinh Phung, Hung Bui, Svetha Venkatesh</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMM), we present the hierarchical semi-Markov conditional random ﬁeld (HSCRF), a generalisation of embedded undirected Markov chains to model complex hierarchical, nested Markov processes. It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we develop efﬁcient algorithms for learning and constrained inference in a partially-supervised setting, which is important issue in practice where labels can only be obtained sparsely. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases. 1</p><p>6 0.39433458 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Model_selection_and_velocity_estimation_using_novel_priors_for_motion_patterns.html">136 nips-2008-Model selection and velocity estimation using novel priors for motion patterns</a></p>

<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex. In experiments, we demonstrate efﬁcient ﬁltering in a range of multi-agent domains. 1</p><p>3 0.65496641 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Robust_Near-Isometric_Matching_via_Structured_Learning_of_Graphical_Models.html">201 nips-2008-Robust Near-Isometric Matching via Structured Learning of Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption. However, real shapes from image datasets, even when expected to be related by “almost isometric” transformations, are actually subject not only to noise but also, to some limited degree, to variations in appearance and scale. In this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction. The outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is robust in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations. Our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models, while maintaining similar running times. 1</p><p>4 0.65423644 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.65421081 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-A_rational_model_of_preference_learning_and_choice_prediction_by_children.html">10 nips-2008-A rational model of preference learning and choice prediction by children</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher G. Lucas, Thomas L. Griffiths, Fei Xu, Christine Fawcett</p><p>Abstract: Young children demonstrate the ability to make inferences about the preferences of other agents based on their choices. However, there exists no overarching account of what children are doing when they learn about preferences or how they use that knowledge. We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. Speciﬁcally, we show how a simple econometric model can be extended to capture two- to four-year-olds’ use of statistical information in inferring preferences, and their generalization of these preferences. 1</p><p>6 0.65098763 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Large_Margin_Taxonomy_Embedding_for_Document_Categorization.html">114 nips-2008-Large Margin Taxonomy Embedding for Document Categorization</a></p>

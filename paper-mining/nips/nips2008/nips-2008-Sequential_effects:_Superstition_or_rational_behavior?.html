<h1>206 nips-2008-Sequential effects: Superstition or rational behavior?</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2008-206-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3519-sequential-effects-superstition-or-rational-behavior.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Angela J. Yu, Jonathan D. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In a variety of behavioral tasks, subjects exhibit an automatic and apparently suboptimal sequential effect: they respond more rapidly and accurately to a stimulus if it reinforces a local pattern in stimulus history, such as a string of repetitions or alternations, compared to when it violates such a pattern. This is often the case even if the local trends arise by chance in the context of a randomized design, such that stimulus history has no real predictive power. In this work, we use a normative Bayesian framework to examine the hypothesis that such idiosyncrasies may reﬂect the inadvertent engagement of mechanisms critical for adapting to a changing environment. We show that prior belief in non-stationarity can induce experimentally observed sequential effects in an otherwise Bayes-optimal algorithm. The Bayesian algorithm is shown to be well approximated by linear-exponential ﬁltering of past observations, a feature also apparent in the behavioral data. We derive an explicit relationship between the parameters and computations of the exact Bayesian algorithm and those of the approximate linear-exponential ﬁlter. Since the latter is equivalent to a leaky-integration process, a commonly used model of neuronal dynamics underlying perceptual decision-making and trial-to-trial dependencies, our model provides a principled account of why such dynamics are useful. We also show that parameter-tuning of the leaky-integration process is possible, using stochastic gradient descent based only on the noisy binary inputs. This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal prediction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities. 1</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2008-206-reference" href="../nips2008_reference/nips-2008-Sequential_effects%3A_Superstition_or_rational_behavior%3F_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey</p><p>Abstract: In analogy to the PCA setting, the sparse PCA problem is often solved by iteratively alternating between two subtasks: cardinality-constrained rank-one variance maximization and matrix deﬂation. While the former has received a great deal of attention in the literature, the latter is seldom analyzed and is typically borrowed without justiﬁcation from the PCA context. In this work, we demonstrate that the standard PCA deﬂation procedure is seldom appropriate for the sparse PCA setting. To rectify the situation, we ﬁrst develop several deﬂation alternatives better suited to the cardinality-constrained context. We then reformulate the sparse PCA optimization problem to explicitly reﬂect the maximum additional variance objective on each round. The result is a generalized deﬂation procedure that typically outperforms more standard techniques on real-world datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.24499901 <a title="206-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenyuan Dai, Yuqiang Chen, Gui-rong Xue, Qiang Yang, Yong Yu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new machine learning strategy called translated learning. Unlike many previous learning tasks, we focus on how to use labeled data from one feature space to enhance the classiﬁcation of other entirely different learning spaces. For example, we might wish to use labeled text data to help learn a model for classifying image data, when the labeled images are difﬁcult to obtain. An important aspect of translated learning is to build a “bridge” to link one feature space (known as the “source space”) to another space (known as the “target space”) through a translator in order to migrate the knowledge from source to target. The translated learning solution uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Finally, this chain of linkages is completed by tracing back to the instances in the target spaces. We show that this path of linkage can be modeled using a Markov chain and risk minimization. Through experiments on the text-aided image classiﬁcation and cross-language classiﬁcation tasks, we demonstrate that our translated learning framework can greatly outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods. 1</p><p>4 0.18930963 <a title="206-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Particle_Filter-based_Policy_Gradient_in_POMDPs.html">177 nips-2008-Particle Filter-based Policy Gradient in POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: Our setting is a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with continuous state, observation and action spaces. Decisions are based on a Particle Filter for estimating the belief state given past observations. We consider a policy gradient approach for parameterized policy optimization. For that purpose, we investigate sensitivity analysis of the performance measure with respect to the parameters of the policy, focusing on Finite Difference (FD) techniques. We show that the naive FD is subject to variance explosion because of the non-smoothness of the resampling procedure. We propose a more sophisticated FD method which overcomes this problem and establish its consistency. 1</p><p>5 0.1875083 <a title="206-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Kernel_Measures_of_Independence_for_non-iid_Data.html">112 nips-2008-Kernel Measures of Independence for non-iid Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Le Song, Arthur Gretton, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated in the framework of statistical independence such as the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. In this paper, we extend this criterion to deal with structured and interdependent observations. This is achieved by modeling the structures using undirected graphical models and comparing the Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. We apply this new criterion to independent component analysis and sequence clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.17341097 <a title="206-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Dynamics_of_Cognitive_Control.html">231 nips-2008-Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanmay Das, Malik Magdon-Ismail</p><p>Abstract: We study the proﬁt-maximization problem of a monopolistic market-maker who sets two-sided prices in an asset market. The sequential decision problem is hard to solve because the state space is a function. We demonstrate that the belief state is well approximated by a Gaussian distribution. We prove a key monotonicity property of the Gaussian state update which makes the problem tractable, yielding the ﬁrst optimal sequential market-making algorithm in an established model. The algorithm leads to a surprising insight: an optimal monopolist can provide more liquidity than perfectly competitive market-makers in periods of extreme uncertainty, because a monopolist is willing to absorb initial losses in order to learn a new valuation rapidly so she can extract higher proﬁts later. 1</p><p>4 0.6731115 <a title="206-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>

This is a proof of concept that not only can neurons implement near-optimal prediction based on standard neuronal dynamics, but that they can also learn to tune the processing parameters without explicitly representing probabilities. 1</p><p>2 0.84688973 <a title="206-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Exact_Inference_in_Planar_Ising_Models.html">69 nips-2008-Efficient Exact Inference in Planar Ising Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicol N. Schraudolph, Dmitry Kamenetsky</p><p>Abstract: We give polynomial-time algorithms for the exact computation of lowest-energy states, worst margin violators, partition functions, and marginals in certain binary undirected graphical models. Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings in an expanded dual graph. Maximum-margin parameter estimation for a boundary detection task shows our approach to be efﬁcient and effective. A C++ implementation is available from http://nic.schraudolph.org/isinf/. 1</p><p>3 0.82093388 <a title="206-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Fitted_Q-iteration_by_Advantage_Weighted_Regression.html">87 nips-2008-Fitted Q-iteration by Advantage Weighted Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Gerhard Neumann, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Recently, ﬁtted Q-iteration (FQI) based methods have become more popular due to their increased sample efﬁciency, a more stable learning process and the higher quality of the resulting policy. However, these methods remain hard to use for continuous action spaces which frequently occur in real-world tasks, e.g., in robotics and other technical applications. The greedy action selection commonly used for the policy improvement step is particularly problematic as it is expensive for continuous actions, can cause an unstable learning process, introduces an optimization bias and results in highly non-smooth policies unsuitable for real-world systems. In this paper, we show that by using a soft-greedy action selection the policy improvement step used in FQI can be simpliﬁed to an inexpensive advantageweighted regression. With this result, we are able to derive a new, computationally efﬁcient FQI algorithm which can even deal with high dimensional action spaces. 1</p><p>4 0.8183046 <a title="206-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Dynamics_of_Cognitive_Control.html">231 nips-2008-Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Reynolds, Michael C. Mozer</p><p>Abstract: Cognitive control refers to the ﬂexible deployment of memory and attention in response to task demands and current goals. Control is often studied experimentally by presenting sequences of stimuli, some demanding a response, and others modulating the stimulus-response mapping. In these tasks, participants must maintain information about the current stimulus-response mapping in working memory. Prominent theories of cognitive control use recurrent neural nets to implement working memory, and optimize memory utilization via reinforcement learning. We present a novel perspective on cognitive control in which working memory representations are intrinsically probabilistic, and control operations that maintain and update working memory are dynamically determined via probabilistic inference. We show that our model provides a parsimonious account of behavioral and neuroimaging data, and suggest that it offers an elegant conceptualization of control in which behavior can be cast as optimal, subject to limitations on learning and the rate of information processing. Moreover, our model provides insight into how task instructions can be directly translated into appropriate behavior and then efﬁciently reﬁned with subsequent task experience. 1</p><p>5 0.81605548 <a title="206-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Abhinav Gupta, Jianbo Shi, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach that combines bag-of-words and spatial models to perform semantic and syntactic analysis for recognition of an object based on its internal appearance and its context. We argue that while object recognition requires modeling relative spatial locations of image features within the object, a bag-of-word is sufﬁcient for representing context. Learning such a model from weakly labeled data involves labeling of features into two classes: foreground(object) or “informative” background(context). We present a “shape-aware” model which utilizes contour information for efﬁcient and accurate labeling of features in the image. Our approach iterates between an MCMC-based labeling and contour based labeling of features to integrate co-occurrence of features and shape similarity. 1</p><p>6 0.8134048 <a title="206-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-An_ideal_observer_model_of_infant_object_perception.html">23 nips-2008-An ideal observer model of infant object perception</a></p>

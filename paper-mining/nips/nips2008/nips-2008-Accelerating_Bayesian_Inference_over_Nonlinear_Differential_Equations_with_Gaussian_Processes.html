<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>3 0.22924207 <a title="12-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Kernel_Shaping_for_Learning_Control.html">32 nips-2008-Bayesian Kernel Shaping for Learning Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Mrinal Kalakrishnan, Sethu Vijayakumar, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: In kernel-based regression learning, optimizing each kernel individually is useful when the data density, curvature of regression surfaces (or decision boundaries) or magnitude of output noise varies spatially. Previous work has suggested gradient descent techniques or complex statistical hypothesis methods for local kernel shaping, typically requiring some amount of manual tuning of meta parameters. We introduce a Bayesian formulation of nonparametric regression that, with the help of variational approximations, results in an EM-like algorithm for simultaneous estimation of regression and kernel parameters. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, requires no sampling, automatically rejects outliers and has only one prior to be speciﬁed. It can be used for nonparametric regression with local polynomials or as a novel method to achieve nonstationary regression with Gaussian processes. Our methods are particularly useful for learning control, where reliable estimation of local tangent planes is essential for adaptive controllers and reinforcement learning. We evaluate our methods on several synthetic data sets and on an actual robot which learns a task-level control law. 1</p><p>4 0.22237545 <a title="12-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_human_function_learning_with_Gaussian_processes.html">138 nips-2008-Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Chris Lucas, Joseph Williams, Michael L. Kalish</p><p>Abstract: Accounts of how people learn functional relationships between continuous variables have tended to focus on two possibilities: that people are estimating explicit functions, or that they are performing associative learning supported by similarity. We provide a rational analysis of function learning, drawing on work on regression in machine learning and statistics. Using the equivalence of Bayesian linear regression and Gaussian processes, we show that learning explicit rules and using similarity can be seen as two views of one solution to this problem. We use this insight to deﬁne a Gaussian process model of human function learning that combines the strengths of both approaches. 1</p><p>5 0.16926676 <a title="12-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Learning_of_Robot_Inverse_Dynamics.html">146 nips-2008-Multi-task Gaussian Process Learning of Robot Inverse Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Stefan Klanke, Sethu Vijayakumar, Kian M. Chai</p><p>Abstract: The inverse dynamics problem for a robotic manipulator is to compute the torques needed at the joints to drive it along a given trajectory; it is beneﬁcial to be able to learn this function for adaptive control. A robotic manipulator will often need to be controlled while holding different loads in its end effector, giving rise to a multi-task learning problem. By placing independent Gaussian process priors over the latent functions of the inverse dynamics, we obtain a multi-task Gaussian process prior for handling multiple loads, where the inter-task similarity depends on the underlying inertial parameters. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-task formulation is effective in sharing information among the various loads, and generally improves performance over either learning only on single tasks or pooling the data over all tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.16103609 <a title="12-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Convolved_Gaussian_Processes_for_Multi-output_Regression.html">213 nips-2008-Sparse Convolved Gaussian Processes for Multi-output Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated. We show results of the proposed methodology for synthetic data and real world applications on pollution prediction and a sensor network. 1</p><p>4 0.67770892 <a title="12-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Kernel_Shaping_for_Learning_Control.html">32 nips-2008-Bayesian Kernel Shaping for Learning Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.69437522 <a title="12-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Accelerating_Bayesian_Inference_over_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">12 nips-2008-Accelerating Bayesian Inference over Nonlinear Differential Equations with Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.55059856 <a title="12-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Process_Inference_using_Control_Variables.html">71 nips-2008-Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Process Inference using Control Variables</a></p>

Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from tens to hundreds of neurons on individual experimental trials. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the data are ﬁrst “denoised” by smoothing over time, then a static dimensionality reduction technique is applied. We ﬁrst describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way, and account for spiking variability that may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), which uniﬁes the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-ﬁt metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that GPFA provided a better characterization of the population activity than the two-stage methods. 1</p><p>6 0.49836344 <a title="12-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_human_function_learning_with_Gaussian_processes.html">138 nips-2008-Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes</a></p>

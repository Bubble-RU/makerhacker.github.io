<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: We present the Gaussian Process Density Sampler (GPDS), an exchangeable generative model for use in nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Samples drawn from the GPDS are consistent with exact, independent samples from a ﬁxed density function that is a transformation of a function drawn from a Gaussian process prior. Our formulation allows us to infer an unknown density from data using Markov chain Monte Carlo, which gives samples from the posterior distribution over density functions and from the predictive distribution on data space. We can also infer the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We compare this density modeling technique to several existing techniques on a toy problem and a skullreconstruction task. 1</p><p>4 0.061698027 <a title="186-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Nonlinear_causal_discovery_with_additive_noise_models.html">153 nips-2008-Nonlinear causal discovery with additive noise models</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrik O. Hoyer, Dominik Janzing, Joris M. Mooij, Jan R. Peters, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables is a fundamental problem in science. For continuous-valued data linear acyclic causal models with additive noise are often used because these models are well understood and there are well-known methods to ﬁt them to data. In reality, of course, many causal relationships are more or less nonlinear, raising some doubts as to the applicability and usefulness of purely linear methods. In this contribution we show that the basic linear framework can be generalized to nonlinear models. In this extended framework, nonlinearities in the data-generating process are in fact a blessing rather than a curse, as they typically provide information on the underlying causal system and allow more aspects of the true data-generating mechanisms to be identiﬁed. In addition to theoretical results we show simulations and some simple real data experiments illustrating the identiﬁcation power provided by nonlinearities. 1</p><p>5 0.057069596 <a title="186-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Level_Active_Prediction_of_Useful_Image_Annotations_for_Recognition.html">142 nips-2008-Multi-Level Active Prediction of Useful Image Annotations for Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for actively learning visual categories from a mixture of weakly and strongly labeled image examples. We propose to allow the categorylearner to strategically choose what annotations it receives—based on both the expected reduction in uncertainty as well as the relative costs of obtaining each annotation. We construct a multiple-instance discriminative classiﬁer based on the initial training data. Then all remaining unlabeled and weakly labeled examples are surveyed to actively determine which annotation ought to be requested next. After each request, the current classiﬁer is incrementally updated. Unlike previous work, our approach accounts for the fact that the optimal use of manual annotation may call for a combination of labels at multiple levels of granularity (e.g., a full segmentation on some images and a present/absent ﬂag on others). As a result, it is possible to learn more accurate category models with a lower total expenditure of manual annotation effort. 1</p><p>6 0.051914059 <a title="186-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Partially_Observed_Maximum_Entropy_Discrimination_Markov_Networks.html">176 nips-2008-Partially Observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Joshua W. Robinson, Alexander J. Hartemink</p><p>Abstract: A principled mechanism for identifying conditional dependencies in time-series data is provided through structure learning of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs). An important assumption of DBN structure learning is that the data are generated by a stationary process—an assumption that is not true in many important settings. In this paper, we introduce a new class of graphical models called non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks, in which the conditional dependence structure of the underlying data-generation process is permitted to change over time. Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks represent a new framework for studying problems in which the structure of a network is evolving over time. We deﬁne the non-stationary DBN model, present an MCMC sampling algorithm for learning the structure of the model from time-series data under different assumptions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm on both simulated and biological data. 1</p><p>5 0.43273497 <a title="186-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-A_spatially_varying_two-sample_recombinant_coalescent%2C_with_applications_to_HIV_escape_response.html">11 nips-2008-A spatially varying two-sample recombinant coalescent, with applications to HIV escape response</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Braunstein, Zhi Wei, Shane T. Jensen, Jon D. Mcauliffe</p><p>Abstract: Statistical evolutionary models provide an important mechanism for describing and understanding the escape response of a viral population under a particular therapy. We present a new hierarchical model that incorporates spatially varying mutation and recombination rates at the nucleotide level. It also maintains separate parameters for treatment and control groups, which allows us to estimate treatment effects explicitly. We use the model to investigate the sequence evolution of HIV populations exposed to a recently developed antisense gene therapy, as well as a more conventional drug therapy. The detection of biologically relevant and plausible signals in both therapy studies demonstrates the effectiveness of the method. 1</p><p>6 0.43135977 <a title="186-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Model_of_Behaviour_in_Economic_Games.html">33 nips-2008-Bayesian Model of Behaviour in Economic Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: We study learning formulations with non-convex regularizaton that are natural for sparse linear models. There are two approaches to this problem: • Heuristic methods such as gradient descent that only ﬁnd a local minimum. A drawback of this approach is the lack of theoretical guarantee showing that the local minimum gives a good solution. • Convex relaxation such as L1 -regularization that solves the problem under some conditions. However it often leads to sub-optimal sparsity in reality. This paper tries to remedy the above gap between theory and practice. In particular, we investigate a multi-stage convex relaxation scheme for solving problems with non-convex regularization. Theoretically, we analyze the behavior of a resulting two-stage relaxation scheme for the capped-L1 regularization. Our performance bound shows that the procedure is superior to the standard L1 convex relaxation for learning sparse targets. Experiments conﬁrm the effectiveness of this method on some simulation and real data. 1</p><p>3 0.44545639 <a title="186-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_low-dimensional_single-trial_analysis_of_neural_population_activity.html">90 nips-2008-Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Byron M. Yu, John P. Cunningham, Gopal Santhanam, Stephen I. Ryu, Krishna V. Shenoy, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of extracting smooth, low-dimensional neural trajectories that summarize the activity recorded simultaneously from tens to hundreds of neurons on individual experimental trials. Current methods for extracting neural trajectories involve a two-stage process: the data are ﬁrst “denoised” by smoothing over time, then a static dimensionality reduction technique is applied. We ﬁrst describe extensions of the two-stage methods that allow the degree of smoothing to be chosen in a principled way, and account for spiking variability that may vary both across neurons and across time. We then present a novel method for extracting neural trajectories, Gaussian-process factor analysis (GPFA), which uniﬁes the smoothing and dimensionality reduction operations in a common probabilistic framework. We applied these methods to the activity of 61 neurons recorded simultaneously in macaque premotor and motor cortices during reach planning and execution. By adopting a goodness-of-ﬁt metric that measures how well the activity of each neuron can be predicted by all other recorded neurons, we found that GPFA provided a better characterization of the population activity than the two-stage methods. 1</p><p>4 0.44116536 <a title="186-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.44027919 <a title="186-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.43838179 <a title="186-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Forward-Backward_Greedy_Algorithm_for_Sparse_Learning_with_Linear_Models.html">14 nips-2008-Adaptive Forward-Backward Greedy Algorithm for Sparse Learning with Linear Models</a></p>

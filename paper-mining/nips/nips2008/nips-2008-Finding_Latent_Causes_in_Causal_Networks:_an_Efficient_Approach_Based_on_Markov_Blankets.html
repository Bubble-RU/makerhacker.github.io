While there are asymptotically correct, informative algorithms for discovering causal relationships from a single dataset, even with missing values and hidden variables, there have been no such reliable procedures for distributed data with overlapping variables. We present a novel, asymptotically correct procedure that discovers a minimal equivalence class of causal DAG structures using local independence information from distributed data of this form and evaluate its performance using synthetic and real-world data against causal discovery algorithms for single datasets and applying Structural EM, a heuristic DAG structure learning procedure for data with missing values, to the concatenated data.</p><p>3 0.11432912 <a title="86-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Nonlinear_causal_discovery_with_additive_noise_models.html">153 nips-2008-Nonlinear causal discovery with additive noise models</a></p>
<p>Author: Patrik O. Hoyer, Dominik Janzing, Joris M. Mooij, Jan R. Peters, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The discovery of causal relationships between a set of observed variables is a fundamental problem in science. For continuous-valued data linear acyclic causal models with additive noise are often used because these models are well understood and there are well-known methods to ﬁt them to data. In reality, of course, many causal relationships are more or less nonlinear, raising some doubts as to the applicability and usefulness of purely linear methods. In this contribution we show that the basic linear framework can be generalized to nonlinear models. In this extended framework, nonlinearities in the data-generating process are in fact a blessing rather than a curse, as they typically provide information on the underlying causal system and allow more aspects of the true data-generating mechanisms to be identiﬁed. In addition to theoretical results we show simulations and some simple real data experiments illustrating the identiﬁcation power provided by nonlinearities. 1</p><p>4 0.10891905 <a title="86-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Sampling_for_Gaussian_Process_Inference_using_Control_Variables.html">71 nips-2008-Efficient Sampling for Gaussian Process Inference using Control Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>5 0.055368342 <a title="86-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Hierarchical_Semi-Markov_Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Recursive_Sequential_Data.html">98 nips-2008-Hierarchical Semi-Markov Conditional Random Fields for Recursive Sequential Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Tran T. Truyen, Dinh Phung, Hung Bui, Svetha Venkatesh</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by the hierarchical hidden Markov models (HHMM), we present the hierarchical semi-Markov conditional random ﬁeld (HSCRF), a generalisation of embedded undirected Markov chains to model complex hierarchical, nested Markov processes. It is parameterised in a discriminative framework and has polynomial time algorithms for learning and inference. Importantly, we develop efﬁcient algorithms for learning and constrained inference in a partially-supervised setting, which is important issue in practice where labels can only be obtained sparsely. We demonstrate the HSCRF in two applications: (i) recognising human activities of daily living (ADLs) from indoor surveillance cameras, and (ii) noun-phrase chunking. We show that the HSCRF is capable of learning rich hierarchical models with reasonable accuracy in both fully and partially observed data cases. 1</p><p>6 0.0540861 <a title="86-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Erik Talvitie, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel mathematical formalism for the idea of a “local model” of an uncontrolled dynamical system, a model that makes only certain predictions in only certain situations. As a result of its restricted responsibilities, a local model may be far simpler than a complete model of the system. We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods. 1</p><p>6 0.30200189 <a title="86-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_response_behavior_in_multisensory_perception_with_conflicting_cues.html">46 nips-2008-Characterizing response behavior in multisensory perception with conflicting cues</a></p>

Keywords: Graphical Models, Structure Learning, Causal Inference. 1 Introduction: Task Definition & Related Work The statistical definition of causality pioneered by Pearl (2000) and Spirtes et al. (2001) has shed new light on how to detect causation. Central in this approach is the automated detection of causeeffect relationships using observational (i.e., non-experimental) data. This can be a necessary task, as in many situations, performing randomized controlled experiments to unveil causation can be impossible, unethical , or too costly. When the analysis deals with variables that cannot be manipulated, being able to learn from data collected by observing the running system is the only possibility. It turns out that learning the full causal structure of a set of variables is, in its most general form , impossible.

<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efﬁciently computing pairwise (l2 , l1 ) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modiﬁes the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reﬂect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage in that it is “one-sketch-for-all.” In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efﬁciently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the χ2 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances. We recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval. 1</p><p>3 0.45924962 <a title="86-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-The_Conjoint_Effect_of_Divisive_Normalization_and_Orientation_Selectivity_on_Redundancy_Reduction.html">232 nips-2008-The Conjoint Effect of Divisive Normalization and Orientation Selectivity on Redundancy Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Bandpass ﬁltering, orientation selectivity, and contrast gain control are prominent features of sensory coding at the level of V1 simple cells. While the effect of bandpass ﬁltering and orientation selectivity can be assessed within a linear model, contrast gain control is an inherently nonlinear computation. Here we employ the class of Lp elliptically contoured distributions to investigate the extent to which the two features—orientation selectivity and contrast gain control—are suited to model the statistics of natural images. Within this framework we ﬁnd that contrast gain control can play a signiﬁcant role for the removal of redundancies in natural images. Orientation selectivity, in contrast, has only a very limited potential for redundancy reduction. 1</p><p>4 0.34644091 <a title="86-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-PSDBoost%3A_Matrix-Generation_Linear_Programming_for_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices_Learning.html">175 nips-2008-PSDBoost: Matrix-Generation Linear Programming for Positive Semidefinite Matrices Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Alan Welsh, Lei Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning a positive semideﬁnite matrix. The critical issue is how to preserve positive semideﬁniteness during the course of learning. Our algorithm is mainly inspired by LPBoost [1] and the general greedy convex optimization framework of Zhang [2]. We demonstrate the essence of the algorithm, termed PSDBoost (positive semideﬁnite Boosting), by focusing on a few different applications in machine learning. The proposed PSDBoost algorithm extends traditional Boosting algorithms in that its parameter is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace being one instead of a classiﬁer. PSDBoost is based on the observation that any trace-one positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into linear convex combinations of trace-one rank-one matrices, which serve as base learners of PSDBoost. Numerical experiments are presented. 1</p><p>5 0.34325308 <a title="86-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>6 0.34289163 <a title="86-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Integrating_Locally_Learned_Causal_Structures_with_Overlapping_Variables.html">108 nips-2008-Integrating Locally Learned Causal Structures with Overlapping Variables</a></p>

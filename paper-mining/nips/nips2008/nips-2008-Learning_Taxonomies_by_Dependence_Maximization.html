<p>Author: Ling Huang, Donghui Yan, Nina Taft, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is useful for a wide-ranging set of applications in areas such as biological data analysis, image processing and data mining. However, the computational and/or communication resources required by the method in processing large-scale data are often prohibitively high, and practitioners are often required to perturb the original data in various ways (quantization, downsampling, etc) before invoking a spectral algorithm. In this paper, we use stochastic perturbation theory to study the effects of data perturbation on the performance of spectral clustering. We show that the error under perturbation of spectral clustering is closely related to the perturbation of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. From this result we derive approximate upper bounds on the clustering error. We show that this bound is tight empirically across a wide range of problems, suggesting that it can be used in practical settings to determine the amount of data reduction allowed in order to meet a speciﬁcation of permitted loss in clustering performance. 1</p><p>3 0.18172522 <a title="117-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Clustered_Multi-Task_Learning%3A_A_Convex_Formulation.html">47 nips-2008-Clustered Multi-Task Learning: A Convex Formulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Jacob, Jean-philippe Vert, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may beneﬁt from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classiﬁcation or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non-convex methods dedicated to the same problem. 1</p><p>4 0.16847076 <a title="117-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>5 0.16473958 <a title="117-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Using_Bayesian_Dynamical_Systems_for_Motion_Template_Libraries.html">247 nips-2008-Using Bayesian Dynamical Systems for Motion Template Libraries</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvia Chiappa, Jens Kober, Jan R. Peters</p><p>Abstract: Motor primitives or motion templates have become an important concept for both modeling human motor control as well as generating robot behaviors using imitation learning. Recent impressive results range from humanoid robot movement generation to timing models of human motions. The automatic generation of skill libraries containing multiple motion templates is an important step in robot learning. Such a skill learning system needs to cluster similar movements together and represent each resulting motion template as a generative model which is subsequently used for the execution of the behavior by a robot system. In this paper, we show how human trajectories captured as multi-dimensional time-series can be clustered using Bayesian mixtures of linear Gaussian state-space models based on the similarity of their dynamics. The appropriate number of templates is automatically determined by enforcing a parsimonious parametrization. As the resulting model is intractable, we introduce a novel approximation method based on variational Bayes, which is especially designed to enable the use of efﬁcient inference algorithms. On recorded human Balero movements, this method is not only capable of ﬁnding reasonable motion templates but also yields a generative model which works well in the execution of this complex task on a simulated anthropomorphic SARCOS arm.</p><p>6 0.16386122 <a title="117-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Measures_of_Clustering_Quality%3A_A_Working_Set_of_Axioms_for_Clustering.html">132 nips-2008-Measures of Clustering Quality: A Working Set of Axioms for Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>3 0.87171501 <a title="117-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Cyclizing_Clusters_via_Zeta_Function_of_a_Graph.html">55 nips-2008-Cyclizing Clusters via Zeta Function of a Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting underlying clusters from large-scale data plays a central role in machine learning research. In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering complex data of multiple distributions and multiple scales. To this end, we develop an algorithm named Zeta l-links (Zell) which consists of two parts: Zeta merging with a similarity graph and an initial set of small clusters derived from local l-links of samples. More speciﬁcally, we propose to structurize a cluster using cycles in the associated subgraph. A new mathematical tool, Zeta function of a graph, is introduced for the integration of all cycles, leading to a structural descriptor of a cluster in determinantal form. The popularity character of a cluster is conceptualized as the global fusion of variations of such a structural descriptor by means of the leave-one-out strategy in the cluster. Zeta merging proceeds, in the hierarchical agglomerative fashion, according to the maximum incremental popularity among all pairwise clusters. Experiments on toy data clustering, imagery pattern clustering, and image segmentation show the competitive performance of Zell. The 98.1% accuracy, in the sense of the normalized mutual information (NMI), is obtained on the FRGC face data of 16028 samples and 466 facial clusters. 1</p><p>4 0.79226273 <a title="117-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Spectral_Clustering_with_Perturbed_Data.html">218 nips-2008-Spectral Clustering with Perturbed Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan L. Boyd-graber, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop the syntactic topic model (STM), a nonparametric Bayesian model of parsed documents. The STM generates words that are both thematically and syntactically constrained, which combines the semantic insights of topic models with the syntactic information available from parse trees. Each word of a sentence is generated by a distribution that combines document-speciﬁc topic weights and parse-tree-speciﬁc syntactic transitions. Words are assumed to be generated in an order that respects the parse tree. We derive an approximate posterior inference method based on variational methods for hierarchical Dirichlet processes, and we report qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. 1</p><p>2 0.85306096 <a title="117-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Grouping_Contours_Via_a_Related_Image.html">95 nips-2008-Grouping Contours Via a Related Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Praveen Srinivasan, Liming Wang, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Contours have been established in the biological and computer vision literature as a compact yet descriptive representation of object shape. While individual contours provide structure, they lack the large spatial support of region segments (which lack internal structure). We present a method for further grouping of contours in an image using their relationship to the contours of a second, related image. Stereo, motion, and similarity all provide cues that can aid this task; contours that have similar transformations relating them to their matching contours in the second image likely belong to a single group. To ﬁnd matches for contours, we rely only on shape, which applies directly to all three modalities without modiﬁcation, in contrast to the specialized approaches developed for each independently. Visually salient contours are extracted in each image, along with a set of candidate transformations for aligning subsets of them. For each transformation, groups of contours with matching shape across the two images are identiﬁed to provide a context for evaluating matches of individual contour points across the images. The resulting contexts of contours are used to perform a ﬁnal grouping on contours in the original image while simultaneously ﬁnding matches in the related image, again by shape matching. We demonstrate grouping results on image pairs consisting of stereo, motion, and similar images. Our method also produces qualitatively better results against a baseline method that does not use the inferred contexts. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.81681579 <a title="117-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of unsupervised algorithms, numerical taxonomy clustering, to simultaneously cluster data, and to learn a taxonomy that encodes the relationship between the clusters. The algorithms work by maximizing the dependence between the taxonomy and the original data. The resulting taxonomy is a more informative visualization of complex data than simple clustering; in addition, taking into account the relations between different clusters is shown to substantially improve the quality of the clustering, when compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms in the literature (both spectral clustering and a previous dependence maximization approach). We demonstrate our algorithm on image and text data. 1</p><p>4 0.80514765 <a title="117-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.77504611 <a title="117-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.73909742 <a title="117-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>

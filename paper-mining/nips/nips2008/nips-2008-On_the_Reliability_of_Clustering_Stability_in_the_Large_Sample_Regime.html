<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Alan Welsh, Lei Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning a positive semideﬁnite matrix. The critical issue is how to preserve positive semideﬁniteness during the course of learning. Our algorithm is mainly inspired by LPBoost [1] and the general greedy convex optimization framework of Zhang [2]. We demonstrate the essence of the algorithm, termed PSDBoost (positive semideﬁnite Boosting), by focusing on a few different applications in machine learning. The proposed PSDBoost algorithm extends traditional Boosting algorithms in that its parameter is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace being one instead of a classiﬁer. PSDBoost is based on the observation that any trace-one positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into linear convex combinations of trace-one rank-one matrices, which serve as base learners of PSDBoost. Numerical experiments are presented. 1</p><p>3 0.12268928 <a title="165-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-An_interior-point_stochastic_approximation_method_and_an_L1-regularized_delta_rule.html">25 nips-2008-An interior-point stochastic approximation method and an L1-regularized delta rule</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Mark Schmidt, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: The stochastic approximation method is behind the solution to many important, actively-studied problems in machine learning. Despite its farreaching application, there is almost no work on applying stochastic approximation to learning problems with general constraints. The reason for this, we hypothesize, is that no robust, widely-applicable stochastic approximation method exists for handling such problems. We propose that interior-point methods are a natural solution. We establish the stability of a stochastic interior-point approximation method both analytically and empirically, and demonstrate its utility by deriving an on-line learning algorithm that also performs feature selection via L1 regularization. 1</p><p>4 0.087733515 <a title="165-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>5 0.087445736 <a title="165-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Improved_Moves_for_Truncated_Convex_Models.html">104 nips-2008-Improved Moves for Truncated Convex Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Philip Torr, M. P. Kumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of obtaining the approximate maximum a posteriori estimate of a discrete random ﬁeld characterized by pairwise potentials that form a truncated convex model. For this problem, we propose an improved st-MINCUT based move making algorithm. Unlike previous move making approaches, which either provide a loose bound or no bound on the quality of the solution (in terms of the corresponding Gibbs energy), our algorithm achieves the same guarantees as the standard linear programming (LP) relaxation. Compared to previous approaches based on the LP relaxation, e.g. interior-point algorithms or treereweighted message passing (TRW), our method is faster as it uses only the efﬁcient st-MINCUT algorithm in its design. Furthermore, it directly provides us with a primal solution (unlike TRW and other related methods which solve the dual of the LP). We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on both synthetic and standard real data problems. Our analysis also opens up an interesting question regarding the relationship between move making algorithms (such as α-expansion and the algorithms presented in this paper) and the randomized rounding schemes used with convex relaxations. We believe that further explorations in this direction would help design efﬁcient algorithms for more complex relaxations.</p><p>6 0.086173333 <a title="165-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Rademacher_Complexity_Bounds_for_Non-I.I.D._Processes.html">189 nips-2008-Rademacher Complexity Bounds for Non-I.I.D.

<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>3 0.5687924 <a title="165-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>

<p>Author: Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting underlying clusters from large-scale data plays a central role in machine learning research. In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering complex data of multiple distributions and multiple scales. To this end, we develop an algorithm named Zeta l-links (Zell) which consists of two parts: Zeta merging with a similarity graph and an initial set of small clusters derived from local l-links of samples. More speciﬁcally, we propose to structurize a cluster using cycles in the associated subgraph. A new mathematical tool, Zeta function of a graph, is introduced for the integration of all cycles, leading to a structural descriptor of a cluster in determinantal form. The popularity character of a cluster is conceptualized as the global fusion of variations of such a structural descriptor by means of the leave-one-out strategy in the cluster. Zeta merging proceeds, in the hierarchical agglomerative fashion, according to the maximum incremental popularity among all pairwise clusters. Experiments on toy data clustering, imagery pattern clustering, and image segmentation show the competitive performance of Zell. The 98.1% accuracy, in the sense of the normalized mutual information (NMI), is obtained on the FRGC face data of 16028 samples and 466 facial clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.54529911 <a title="165-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Spectral_Clustering_with_Perturbed_Data.html">218 nips-2008-Spectral Clustering with Perturbed Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Huang, Donghui Yan, Nina Taft, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering is useful for a wide-ranging set of applications in areas such as biological data analysis, image processing and data mining. However, the computational and/or communication resources required by the method in processing large-scale data are often prohibitively high, and practitioners are often required to perturb the original data in various ways (quantization, downsampling, etc) before invoking a spectral algorithm. In this paper, we use stochastic perturbation theory to study the effects of data perturbation on the performance of spectral clustering. We show that the error under perturbation of spectral clustering is closely related to the perturbation of the eigenvectors of the Laplacian matrix. From this result we derive approximate upper bounds on the clustering error. We show that this bound is tight empirically across a wide range of problems, suggesting that it can be used in practical settings to determine the amount of data reduction allowed in order to meet a speciﬁcation of permitted loss in clustering performance. 1</p><p>6 0.49765706 <a title="165-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Ali Nouri, Michael L. Littman</p><p>Abstract: The essence of exploration is acting to try to decrease uncertainty. We propose a new methodology for representing uncertainty in continuous-state control problems. Our approach, multi-resolution exploration (MRE), uses a hierarchical mapping to identify regions of the state space that would beneﬁt from additional samples. We demonstrate MRE’s broad utility by using it to speed up learning in a prototypical model-based and value-based reinforcement-learning method. Empirical results show that MRE improves upon state-of-the-art exploration approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.63149637 <a title="165-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Mixed_Membership_Stochastic_Blockmodels.html">134 nips-2008-Mixed Membership Stochastic Blockmodels</a></p>
<p>Author: Edoardo M. Airoldi, David M. Blei, Stephen E. Fienberg, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: In many settings, such as protein interactions and gene regulatory networks, collections of author-recipient email, and social networks, the data consist of pairwise measurements, e.g., presence or absence of links between pairs of objects. Analyzing such data with probabilistic models requires non-standard assumptions, since the usual independence or exchangeability assumptions no longer hold. In this paper, we introduce a class of latent variable models for pairwise measurements: mixed membership stochastic blockmodels. Models in this class combine a global model of dense patches of connectivity (blockmodel) with a local model to instantiate node-speciﬁc variability in the connections (mixed membership). We develop a general variational inference algorithm for fast approximate posterior inference. We demonstrate the advantages of mixed membership stochastic blockmodel with applications to social networks and protein interaction networks. 1</p><p>4 0.5461846 <a title="165-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Performance_analysis_for_L%5C_2_kernel_classification.html">178 nips-2008-Performance analysis for L\ 2 kernel classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jooseuk Kim, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: We provide statistical performance guarantees for a recently introduced kernel classiﬁer that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a difference of densities. The classiﬁer is similar to a support vector machine (SVM) in that it is the solution of a quadratic program and yields a sparse classiﬁer. Unlike SVMs, however, the L2 kernel classiﬁer does not involve a regularization parameter. We prove a distribution free concentration inequality for a cross-validation based estimate of the ISE, and apply this result to deduce an oracle inequality and consistency of the classiﬁer on the sense of both ISE and probability of error. Our results also specialize to give performance guarantees for an existing method of L2 kernel density estimation. 1</p><p>5 0.53946555 <a title="165-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Global_Ranking_Using_Continuous_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">93 nips-2008-Global Ranking Using Continuous Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu, Xu-dong Zhang, De-sheng Wang, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies global ranking problem by learning to rank methods. Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for ‘local ranking’, in the sense that the ranking model is deﬁned on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to deﬁne the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is deﬁned as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two speciﬁc information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines.</p><p>6 0.5329594 <a title="165-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>

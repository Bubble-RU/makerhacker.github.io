</p><p>2 In the present work, conditions are established for an RKHS to be characteristic on groups and semigroups. [sent-12, score-0.457]
</p><p>3 Illustrative examples are provided, including characteristic kernels on periodic domains, rotation matrices, and Rn . [sent-13, score-0.557]
</p><p>4 Key to the above work is the notion of a characteristic kernel, as introduced in [5, 6]: it gives an RKHS for which probabilities have unique images (i. [sent-17, score-0.361]
</p><p>5 Universal kernels on compact metric spaces [16] are characteristic [8], as are Gaussian and Laplace kernels on Rn [6]. [sent-21, score-0.979]
</p><p>6 Recently, it has been shown [14] that a continuous shift-invariant R-valued positive deﬁnite kernel on Rn is characteristic if and only if the support of its Fourier transform is the entire Rn . [sent-22, score-0.717]
</p><p>7 This completely determines the set of characteristic ones in the convex cone of continuous shift-invariant positive deﬁnite kernels on Rn . [sent-23, score-0.718]
</p><p>8 One of the chief advantages of kernel methods is that they allow us to deal straightforwardly with complex domains, through use of a kernel function to determine the similarity between objects in these domains [13]. [sent-24, score-0.264]
</p><p>9 A question that naturally arises is whether characteristic kernels can be deﬁned on spaces besides Rn . [sent-25, score-0.582]
</p><p>10 Several such domains constitute topological groups/semigroups, and our focus is on kernels deﬁned by their algebraic structure. [sent-26, score-0.342]
</p><p>11 Broadly speaking, our approach is based on extensions of Fourier analysis to groups and semigroups, where we apply appropriate extensions of Bochner’s theorem to obtain the required conditions on the kernel. [sent-27, score-0.221]
</p><p>12 The most immediate generalization of the results in [14] is to locally compact Abelian groups, of which (Rn , +) is one example. [sent-28, score-0.239]
</p><p>13 Thus, in Section 2 we provide review of characteristic kernels on (Rn , +) from this viewpoint. [sent-29, score-0.557]
</p><p>14 In Section 3 we derive necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for kernels 1  on locally compact Abelian groups to be characteristic. [sent-30, score-0.579]
</p><p>15 We next address non-Abelian compact groups in Section 4, for which we obtain a sufﬁcient condition for a characteristic kernel. [sent-34, score-0.66]
</p><p>16 Finally, in Section 5, we consider the Abelian semigroup (Rn , +), where + R+ = [0, ∞). [sent-36, score-0.212]
</p><p>17 This semigroup has many practical applications, including expressions of nonnegative measures or frequency on n points [3]. [sent-37, score-0.255]
</p><p>18 Note that in all cases, we provide speciﬁc examples of characteristic kernels to illustrate the properties required. [sent-38, score-0.557]
</p><p>19 2  Preliminaries: Characteristic kernels and shift-invariant kernels  Let X be a random variable taking values on a measurable space (Ω, B), and H be a RKHS deﬁned by a measurable kernel k on Ω such that E[ k(X, X)] < ∞. [sent-39, score-0.671]
</p><p>20 A bounded measurable kernel k on Ω is called characteristic if {P : probability on (Ω, B)} → H,  P → mP = EX∼P [k(·, X)]  (1)  is injective ([5, 6]). [sent-42, score-0.581]
</p><p>21 Therefore, by deﬁnition, a characteristic kernel uniquely determines a probability by its mean element. [sent-43, score-0.456]
</p><p>22 The following result provides the necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a kernel to be characteristic and shows its associated RKHS to be a rich function class. [sent-46, score-0.509]
</p><p>23 Let (Ω, B) be a measurable space, k be a bounded measurable positive deﬁnite kernel on Ω, and H be the associated RKHS. [sent-49, score-0.333]
</p><p>24 Then, k is characteristic if and only if H + R (direct sum of the two RKHS’s) is dense in L2 (P ) for every probability P on (Ω, B). [sent-50, score-0.362]
</p><p>25 The above lemma and Theorem 3 of [6] imply that characteristic kernels give a criterion of (conditional) independence through (conditional) covariance on RKHS, which enables statistical tests of independence with kernels [6]. [sent-51, score-0.821]
</p><p>26 This explains also the practical importance of characteristic kernels. [sent-52, score-0.337]
</p><p>27 The following result shows that the characteristic property is invariant under some conformal mappings introduced in [17] and provides a construction to generate new characteristic kernels. [sent-53, score-0.764]
</p><p>28 Let Ω be a topological space with Borel σ-ﬁeld, k be a measurable positive deﬁnite kernel on Ω such that Ω k(·, y)dµ(y) = 0 means µ = 0 for a ﬁnite Borel measure µ, and f : Ω → C be a bounded continuous function such that f (x) > 0 for all x ∈ Ω and k(x, x)|f (x)|2 is bounded. [sent-55, score-0.432]
</p><p>29 We will focus on spaces with algebraic structure for better description of characteristic kernels. [sent-61, score-0.422]
</p><p>30 We call this type of positive deﬁnite kernels shift-invariant, because k(zx, zy) = φ((zy)−1 zx) = φ(y −1 x) = k(x, y) for any z ∈ G. [sent-64, score-0.294]
</p><p>31 There are many examples of shift-invariant positive deﬁnite kernels on the additive group Rn : Gausn sian RBF kernel k(x, y) = exp(− x−y 2 /σ 2 ) and Laplacian kernel k(x, y) = exp(−β i=1 |xi − n yi |) are famous ones. [sent-65, score-0.692]
</p><p>32 (2)  Rn  Bochner’s theorem completely characterizes the set of continuous shift-invariant positive deﬁnite kernels on Rn by the Fourier transform. [sent-69, score-0.482]
</p><p>33 It also implies that the continuous positive deﬁnite functions √ T form a convex cone with the extreme points given by the Fourier kernels {e −1x ω | ω ∈ Rn }. [sent-70, score-0.381]
</p><p>34 2  It is interesting to determine the class of continuous shift-invariant “characteristic” kernels on Rn . [sent-71, score-0.307]
</p><p>35 The basic idea is the following: since the mean element EP [φ(y − X)] is equal to the convolution φ ∗ P , the Fourier transform rewrites the deﬁnition of characteristic property as (P − Q)Λ = 0  =⇒  P = Q,  where denotes the Fourier transform, and we use φ ∗ P = ΛP . [sent-75, score-0.46]
</p><p>36 We will extend these results to more general algebraic objects, such as groups and semigroups, on which Fourier analysis and Bochner’s theorem can be extended. [sent-77, score-0.281]
</p><p>37 3  Characteristic kernels on locally compact Abelian groups  It is known that most of the results on Fourier analysis for Rn are extended to any locally compact Abelian (LCA) group, which is an Abelian (i. [sent-78, score-0.818]
</p><p>38 commutative) topological group with the topology Hausdorff and locally compact. [sent-80, score-0.295]
</p><p>39 The group operation is denoted by “+” in Abelian cases. [sent-82, score-0.185]
</p><p>40 Hereafter, for a LCA group G, we consider only the probability measures included in the set of ﬁnite regular measures M (G) (see Supplements) to discuss characteristic property. [sent-83, score-0.583]
</p><p>41 For a LCA group G, there exists a non-negative regular measure m on G such that m(E + x) = m(E) for every x ∈ G and every Borel set E in G. [sent-88, score-0.242]
</p><p>42 The set of all continuous characters of G forms an Abelian group with the operation (γ1 γ2 )(x) = γ1 (x)γ2 (x). [sent-94, score-0.292]
</p><p>43 This group is called the dual group of G, and denoted by G. [sent-98, score-0.375]
</p><p>44 It is ˆ ˆ known that G is a LCA group if the weakest topology is introduced so that x is continuous for each ˆ x ∈ G. [sent-100, score-0.284]
</p><p>45 We can therefore consider the dual of G, denoted by Gˆ and the group homomorphism ˆ , ˆ G → Gˆ , x → x. [sent-101, score-0.266]
</p><p>46 √  T  It is known that the dual group of the LCA group Rn is {e −1ω x | ω ∈ Rn }, which can be identiﬁed with Rn . [sent-119, score-0.35]
</p><p>47 The above deﬁnition and properties of Fourier transform for LCA groups are extension of the ordinary Fourier transform for Rn . [sent-120, score-0.344]
</p><p>48 A continuous function φ on G is positive deﬁnite if and only if there is a unique non-negative measure Λ ∈ M (G) such that φ(x) =  (x, γ)dΛ(γ) G  3. [sent-128, score-0.217]
</p><p>49 (5)  Shift-invariant characteristic kernels on LCA group  Based on Bochner’s theorem, a sufﬁcient condition of the characteristic property is obtained. [sent-130, score-1.103]
</p><p>50 Let φ be a continuous positive deﬁnite function on a LCA group G given by Eq. [sent-132, score-0.321]
</p><p>51 If supp(Λ) = G, then the positive deﬁnite kernel k(x, y) = φ(x − y) is characteristic. [sent-134, score-0.193]
</p><p>52 Let φ be a R-valued continuous positive deﬁnite function on a LCA group G given by Eq. [sent-142, score-0.321]
</p><p>53 The kernel φ(x − y) is characteristic if and only if (i) 0 ∈ G is not open and supp(Λ) = G, or (ii) 0 ∈ G is open and supp(Λ) ⊃ G − {0}. [sent-144, score-0.534]
</p><p>54 It is obvious that k is characteristic if and only if so is k(x, y) + 1. [sent-149, score-0.364]
</p><p>55 Take an open neighborhood W of 0 in G with compact closure such that W ⊂ τ −1 (U − γ0 ). [sent-155, score-0.216]
</p><p>56 Also, g is positive deﬁnite, since i,j ci cj g(xi − xj ) = i,j ci cj G χW (xi − xj − y)χ−W (y)dy = i,j ci cj G χW (xi − y)χ−W (y − xj )dy = i ci χW (xi − y) j cj χW (xj − y) dy ≥ 0. [sent-159, score-0.796]
</p><p>57 From Theorem 8, we can see that the characteristic property is stable under the product for shift-invariant kernels. [sent-174, score-0.36]
</p><p>58 Let φ1 (x − y) and φ2 (x − y) be R-valued continuous shift-invariant characteristic kernels on a LCA group G. [sent-176, score-0.804]
</p><p>59 (Rn , +): As already shown in [6, 14], the Gaussian RBF kernel exp(− 2σ2 x − y 2 ) n n and Laplacian kernel exp(−β i=1 |xi − yi |) are characteristic on R . [sent-187, score-0.575]
</p><p>60 An example of a positive deﬁnite kernel that is not characteristic on Rn is sinc(x − y) = sin(x−y) . [sent-188, score-0.53]
</p><p>61 The dual group is {e −1nx | n ∈ Z}, which is isomorphic to Z. [sent-191, score-0.19]
</p><p>62 Examples of non-characteristic kernels on [0, 2π) include cos(x − y), F´ jer, and Dirichlet kernel. [sent-198, score-0.22]
</p><p>63 e  4  Characteristic kernels on compact groups  We discuss non-Abelian cases in this section. [sent-199, score-0.517]
</p><p>64 Providing useful positive deﬁnite kernels on this class is important in those applications areas. [sent-202, score-0.294]
</p><p>65 First, we give a brief summary of known results on the Fourier analysis on locally compact and compact groups. [sent-203, score-0.416]
</p><p>66 1  Unitary representation and Fourier analysis  Let G be a locally compact group, which may not be Abelian. [sent-206, score-0.239]
</p><p>67 For a unitary representation (T, H) on a locally compact group G, a subspace V in H is called Ginvariant if T (x)V ⊂ V for every x ∈ G. [sent-208, score-0.586]
</p><p>68 A unitary representation (T, H) is irreducible if there are 5  no closed G-invariant subspace except {0} and H. [sent-209, score-0.214]
</p><p>69 Unitary representations (T1 , H1 ) and (T2 , H2 ) are said to be equivalent if there is a unitary isomorphism A : H1 → H2 such that T1 = A−1 T2 A. [sent-210, score-0.196]
</p><p>70 (i) If G is a compact group, every irreducible unitary representation (T, H) of G is ﬁnite dimensional, that is, H is ﬁnite dimensional. [sent-216, score-0.416]
</p><p>71 (ii) If G is an Abelian group, every irreducible unitary representation of G is one dimensional. [sent-217, score-0.239]
</p><p>72 It is possible to extend the Fourier analysis on locally compact non-Abelian groups. [sent-219, score-0.239]
</p><p>73 Unlike Abelian cases, the Fourier transform by the characters are not possible, but we need to consider unitary representations and operator-valued Fourier transform. [sent-220, score-0.307]
</p><p>74 We deﬁne G to be the set of equivalent classes of irreducible unitary representations of a compact group G. [sent-225, score-0.551]
</p><p>75 The equivalence class of a unitary representation (T, HT ) is denoted by [T ], and the dimensionality of HT by dT . [sent-226, score-0.187]
</p><p>76 It is known that on a compact group G there is a Haar measure m, which is a left and right invariant non-negative ﬁnite measure. [sent-228, score-0.369]
</p><p>77 This is a natural extension of the Fourier transform on LCA groups, where G is the characters serving as the Fourier kernel in view of Theorem 10. [sent-233, score-0.264]
</p><p>78 Bochner’s theorem can be extended to compact groups as follows [11, Section 34. [sent-239, score-0.398]
</p><p>79 A continuous function φ on a compact group G is positive deﬁnite if and only if the Fourier transform φ(T ) is positive semideﬁnite, gives an absolutely convergent series Eq. [sent-242, score-0.739]
</p><p>80 −1 i,j ci cj φ(xj xi ) = ∗ [T ] dT Tr[T (xi )φ(T )T (xj ) ] = [T ] dT Tr[  The proof of “if” part is easy; in fact,  i,j ci cj  =  i,j ci cj  i ci T (xi )  4. [sent-244, score-0.529]
</p><p>81 Shift-invariant characteristic kernels on compact groups  We have the following sufﬁcient condition of characteristic property for compact groups. [sent-246, score-1.417]
</p><p>82 If φ(T ) is strictly positive deﬁnite for every [T ] ∈ G\{1}, the kernel φ(y −1 x) is characteristic. [sent-250, score-0.218]
</p><p>83 (8) derives an γn for each term, we see that a sequence {an }∞ such that n=0 ∞ a0 ≥ 0, an > 0 (n ≥ 1), and n=0 an (2n + 1)2 < ∞ deﬁnes a characteristic positive deﬁnite kernel on SO(3) by 1 sin((2n + 1)θ) (cos θ = Tr[B −1 A], 0 ≤ θ ≤ π). [sent-285, score-0.556]
</p><p>84 (2n + 1)3 8 sin θ n=0  ∞  α2n+1 sin((2n + 1)θ) 1 2α sin θ = arctan . [sent-288, score-0.23]
</p><p>85 (2n + 1) sin θ 2 sin θ 1 − α2 n=0  Characteristic kernels on the semigroup Rn +  In this section, we consider kernels on an Abelian semigroup (S, +). [sent-289, score-1.094]
</p><p>86 In this case, a kernel based on the semigroup structure is deﬁned by k(x, y) = φ(x + y). [sent-290, score-0.331]
</p><p>87 For an Abelian semigroup (S, +), a semicharacter is deﬁned by a map ρ : S → C such that ρ(x + y) = ρ(x)ρ(y). [sent-291, score-0.212]
</p><p>88 While extensions of Bochner’s theorem are known for semigroups [2], the topology on the set of semicharacters are not as obvious as LCA groups, and the straightforward extension of the results in Section 3 is difﬁcult. [sent-292, score-0.3]
</p><p>89 We focus only on the Abelian semigroup (Rn , +), where R+ = [0, ∞). [sent-293, score-0.212]
</p><p>90 + This semigroup has many practical applications of data analysis including expressions of nonnegative measures or frequency on n points [3]. [sent-294, score-0.255]
</p><p>91 For Rn , Laplace transform replaces Fourier transform to give Bochner’s theorem. [sent-300, score-0.2]
</p><p>92 +  (9)  Based on the above theorem, we have the following sufﬁcient condition of characteristic property. [sent-305, score-0.363]
</p><p>93 If suppΛ = Rn , then the + positive deﬁnite kernel k(x, y) = φ(x + y) is characteristic. [sent-309, score-0.193]
</p><p>94 7  We show some examples of characteristic kernels on (Rn , +). [sent-317, score-0.557]
</p><p>95 This type of kernel on non-negative measures is discussed in [3] in connection with semigroup structure. [sent-323, score-0.374]
</p><p>96 6  Conclusions  We have discussed conditions that kernels deﬁned by the algebraic structure of groups and semigroups are characteristic. [sent-324, score-0.496]
</p><p>97 For locally compact Abelian groups, the continuous shift-invariant Rvalued characteristic kernels are completely determined by the Fourier inverse of positive measures with support equal to the entire dual group. [sent-325, score-1.03]
</p><p>98 For compact (non-Abelian) groups, we show a sufﬁcient condition of continuous shift-invariant characteristic kernels in terms of the operator-valued Fourier transform. [sent-326, score-0.847]
</p><p>99 In the advanced theory of harmonic analysis, + Bochner’s theorem and Fourier analysis can be extended to more general algebraic structure to some extent. [sent-328, score-0.198]
</p><p>100 While the characteristic property gives a necessary requirement for RKHS embeddings of distributions to be distinguishable, it does not address optimal kernel choice at ﬁnite sample sizes. [sent-332, score-0.518]

<p>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by applications like elections, web-page ranking, revenue maximization etc., we consider the question of inferring popular rankings using constrained data. More speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of inferring a probability distribution over the group of permutations using its ﬁrst order marginals. We ﬁrst prove that it is not possible to recover more than O(n) permutations over n elements with the given information. We then provide a simple and novel algorithm that can recover up to O(n) permutations under a natural stochastic model; in this sense, the algorithm is optimal. In certain applications, the interest is in recovering only the most popular (or mode) ranking. As a second result, we provide an algorithm based on the Fourier Transform over the symmetric group to recover the mode under a natural majority condition; the algorithm turns out to be a maximum weight matching on an appropriately deﬁned weighted bipartite graph. The questions considered are also thematically related to Fourier Transforms over the symmetric group and the currently popular topic of compressed sensing. 1</p><p>3 0.15056784 <a title="44-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the ℓ1 -norm or the block ℓ1 -norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efﬁciently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p><p>4 0.11952396 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Extended_Grassmann_Kernels_for_Subspace-Based_Learning.html">80 nips-2008-Extended Grassmann Kernels for Subspace-Based Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jihun Hamm, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Subspace-based learning problems involve data whose elements are linear subspaces of a vector space. To handle such data structures, Grassmann kernels have been proposed and used previously. In this paper, we analyze the relationship between Grassmann kernels and probabilistic similarity measures. Firstly, we show that the KL distance in the limit yields the Projection kernel on the Grassmann manifold, whereas the Bhattacharyya kernel becomes trivial in the limit and is suboptimal for subspace-based problems. Secondly, based on our analysis of the KL distance, we propose extensions of the Projection kernel which can be extended to the set of afﬁne as well as scaled subspaces. We demonstrate the advantages of these extended kernels for classiﬁcation and recognition tasks with Support Vector Machines and Kernel Discriminant Analysis using synthetic and real image databases. 1</p><p>5 0.096814036 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-label_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">143 nips-2008-Multi-label Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuiwang Ji, Liang Sun, Rong Jin, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We present a multi-label multiple kernel learning (MKL) formulation in which the data are embedded into a low-dimensional space directed by the instancelabel correlations encoded into a hypergraph. We formulate the problem in the kernel-induced feature space and propose to learn the kernel matrix as a linear combination of a given collection of kernel matrices in the MKL framework. The proposed learning formulation leads to a non-smooth min-max problem, which can be cast into a semi-inﬁnite linear program (SILP). We further propose an approximate formulation with a guaranteed error bound which involves an unconstrained convex optimization problem. In addition, we show that the objective function of the approximate formulation is differentiable with Lipschitz continuous gradient, and hence existing methods can be employed to compute the optimal solution efﬁciently. We apply the proposed formulation to the automated annotation of Drosophila gene expression pattern images, and promising results have been reported in comparison with representative algorithms.</p><p>6 0.084854513 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Dimensionality_Reduction_for_Data_in_Multiple_Feature_Representations.html">63 nips-2008-Dimensionality Reduction for Data in Multiple Feature Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: Srikanth Jagabathula, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: Motivated by applications like elections, web-page ranking, revenue maximization etc., we consider the question of inferring popular rankings using constrained data. More speciﬁcally, we consider the problem of inferring a probability distribution over the group of permutations using its ﬁrst order marginals. We ﬁrst prove that it is not possible to recover more than O(n) permutations over n elements with the given information. We then provide a simple and novel algorithm that can recover up to O(n) permutations under a natural stochastic model; in this sense, the algorithm is optimal. In certain applications, the interest is in recovering only the most popular (or mode) ranking. As a second result, we provide an algorithm based on the Fourier Transform over the symmetric group to recover the mode under a natural majority condition; the algorithm turns out to be a maximum weight matching on an appropriately deﬁned weighted bipartite graph. The questions considered are also thematically related to Fourier Transforms over the symmetric group and the currently popular topic of compressed sensing. 1</p><p>3 0.63340962 <a title="44-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Haixuan Yang, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithms have the ability to avoid over-ﬁtting problems and to express solutions as kernel expansions. However, we observe that the current RLS algorithms cannot provide a satisfactory interpretation even on the penalty of a constant function. Based on the intuition that a good kernelbased inductive function should be consistent with both the data and the kernel, a novel learning scheme is proposed. The advantages of this scheme lie in its corresponding Representer Theorem, its strong interpretation ability about what kind of functions should not be penalized, and its promising accuracy improvements shown in a number of experiments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed technical description about heat kernels, which serves as an example for the readers to apply similar techniques for other kernels. Our work provides a preliminary step in a new direction to explore the varying consistency between inductive functions and kernels under various distributions. 1</p><p>6 0.48783249 <a title="44-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Scalable_Algorithms_for_String_Kernels_with_Inexact_Matching.html">203 nips-2008-Scalable Algorithms for String Kernels with Inexact Matching</a></p>

<p>Author: Shenghuo Zhu, Kai Yu, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic relational models (SRMs) [15] provide a rich family of choices for learning and predicting dyadic data between two sets of entities. The models generalize matrix factorization to a supervised learning problem that utilizes attributes of entities in a hierarchical Bayesian framework. Previously variational Bayes inference was applied for SRMs, which is, however, not scalable when the size of either entity set grows to tens of thousands. In this paper, we introduce a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for equivalent models of SRMs in order to scale the computation to very large dyadic data sets. Both superior scalability and predictive accuracy are demonstrated on a collaborative ﬁltering problem, which involves tens of thousands users and half million items. 1 Stochastic Relational Models Stochastic relational models (SRMs) [15] are generalizations of Gaussian process (GP) models [11] to the relational domain, where each observation is a dyadic datum, indexed by a pair of entities. They model dyadic data by a multiplicative interaction of two Gaussian process priors. Let U be the feature representation (or index) space of a set of entities. A pair-wise similarity in U is given by a kernel (covariance) function Σ : U × U → R. A Gaussian process (GP) deﬁnes a random function f : U → R, whose distribution is characterized by a mean function and the covariance function Σ, denoted by f ∼ N∞ (0, Σ)1 , where, for simplicity, we assume the mean to be the constant zero. GP complies with the intuition regarding the smoothness — if two entities ui and uj are similar according to Σ, then f (ui ) and f (uj ) are similar with a high probability. A domain of dyadic data must involve another set of entities, let it be represented (or indexed) by V. In a similar way, this entity set is associated with another kernel function Ω. For example, in a typical collaborative ﬁltering domain, U represents users while V represents items, then, Σ measures the similarity between users and Ω measures the similarity between items. Being the relation between a pair of entities from different sets, a dyadic variable y is indexed by the product space U × V. Then an SRM aims to model y(u, v) by the following generative process, Model 1. The generative model of an SRM: 1. Draw kernel functions Σ ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ), and Ω ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Ω◦ ); 2. For k = 1, . . . , d: draw random functions fk ∼ N∞ (0, Σ), and gk ∼ N∞ (0, Ω); 1 We denote an n dimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix Σ by Nn (0, Σ). Then N∞ (0, Σ) explicitly indicates that a GP follows an “inﬁnite dimensional” Gaussian distribution. 1 3. For each pair (u, v): draw y(u, v) ∼ p(y(u, v)|z(u, v), γ), where d 1 z(u, v) = √ fk (u)gk (v) + b(u, v). d k=1 In this model, IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ) and IW ∞ (δ, Ω◦ ) are hyper priors, whose details will be introduced later. p(y|z, γ) is the problem-speciﬁc noise model. For example, it can follow a Gaussian noise distribution y ∼ N1 (z, γ) if y is numerical, or, a Bernoulli distribution if y is binary. Function b(u, v) is the bias function over the U × V. For simplicity, we assume b(u, v) = 0. In the limit d → ∞, the model converges to a special case where fk and gk can be analytically marginalized out and z becomes a Gaussian process z ∼ N∞ (0, Σ ⊗ Ω) [15], with the covariance between pairs being a tensor kernel K ((ui , vs ), (uj , vt )) = Σ(ui , uj )Ω(vs , vt ). In anther special case, if Σ and Ω are both ﬁxed to be Dirac delta functions, and U, V are ﬁnite sets, it is easy to see that the model reduces to probabilistic matrix factorization. The hyper prior IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ) is called inverted Wishart Process that generalizes the ﬁnite ndimensional inverted Wishart distribution [2] IW n (Σ|δ, Σ◦ ) ∝ |Σ| − 1 (δ+2n) 2 1 etr − Σ−1 Σ◦ , 2 where δ is the degree-of-freedom parameter, and Σ◦ is a positive deﬁnite kernel matrix. We note that the above deﬁnition is different from the popular formulation [3] or [4] in the machine learning community. The advantage of this new notation is demonstrated by the following theorem [2]. Theorem 1. Let A ∼ IW m (δ, K), A ∈ R+ , K ∈ R+ , and A and K be partitioned as A= A11 , A12 , A21 , A22 K= K11 , K12 K21 , K22 where A11 and K11 are two n × n sub matrices, n < m, then A11 ∼ IW n (δ, K11 ). The new formulation of inverted Wishart is consistent under marginalization. Therefore, similar to the way of deriving GPs from Gaussian distributions, we deﬁne a distribution of inﬁnite-dimensional kernel functions, denoted by Σ ∼ IW ∞ (δ, Σ◦ ), such that any sub kernel matrix of size m × m follows Σ ∼ IW m (δ, Σ◦ ), where both Σ and Σ◦ are positive deﬁnite kernel functions. In case when U and V are sets of entity indices, SRMs let Σ◦ and Ω◦ both be Dirac delta functions, i.e., any of their sub kernel matrices is an identity matrix. Similar to GP regression/classiﬁcation, the major application of SRMs is supervised prediction based on observed relational values and input features of entities. Formally, let YI = {y(u, v)|(u, v) ∈ I} be the set of noisy observations, where I ⊂ U × V, the model aims to predict the noise-free values ZO = {z(u, v)|(u, v) ∈ O} on O ⊂ U × V. As our computation is always on a ﬁnite set containing both I and O, from now on, we only consider the ﬁnite subset U0 × V0 , a ﬁnite support subset of U × V that contains I ∪ O. Accordingly we let Σ be the covariance matrix of Σ on U0 , and Ω be the covariance matrix of Ω on V0 . Previously a variational Bayesian method was applied to SRMs [15], which computes the maximum a posterior estimates of Σ and Ω, given YI , and then predicts ZO based on the estimated Σ and Ω. There are two limitations of this empirical Bayesian approach: (1) The variational method is not a fully Bayesian treatment. Ideally we wish to integrate Σ and Ω; (2) The more critical issue is, the algorithm has the complexity O(m3 + n3 ), with m = |U0 | and n = |V0 |, is not scalable to a large relational domain where m or n exceeds several thousands. In this paper we will introduce a fully Bayesian inference algorithm using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. By deriving equivalent sampling processes, we show the algorithms can be applied to a dataset, which is 103 times larger than the previous work [15], and produce an excellent accuracy. In the rest of this paper, we present our algorithms for Bayesian inference of SRMs in Section 2. Some related work is discussed in Section 3, followed by experiment results of SRMs in Section 4. Section 5 concludes. 2 2 Bayesian Models and MCMC Inference In this paper, we tackle the scalability issue with a fully Bayesian paradigm. We estimate the expectation of ZO directly from YI using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (speciﬁcally, Gibbs sampling), instead of evaluating that from estimated Σ or Ω. Our contribution is in how to make the MCMC inference more efﬁcient for large scale data. We ﬁrst introduce some necessary notation here. Bold capital letters, e.g. X, indicate matrices. I(m) is an identity matrix of size m × m. Nd , Nm,d , IW m , χ−2 are the multivariate normal distribution, the matrix-variate normal distribution, the inverse-Wishart distribution, and the inverse chi-square distribution, respectively. 2.1 Models with Non-informative Priors Let r = |I|, m = |U0 | and n = |V0 |. It is assumed that d min(m, n), and the observed set, I, is sparse, i.e. r mn. First, we consider the case of Σ◦ = αI(m) and Ω◦ = βI(n) . Let {fk } on U0 denoted by matrix variate F of size m × d, {gk } on V0 denoted by matrix variate G of size n × d. Then the generative model is written as Model 2 and depicted in Figure 1. Model 2. The generative model of a matrix-variate SRM: Σ 1. Draw Σ ∼ IW m (δ, αI(m) ) and Ω ∼ IW n (δ, βI(n) ); Ω I(d) G F 2. Draw F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ) and G|Ω ∼ Nn,d (0, Ω ⊗ I(d) ); I(d) Z 3. Draw s2 ∼ χ−2 (ν, σ 2 ) ; 4. Draw Y|F, G, s2 ∼ Nm,n (Z, s2 I(m) ⊗ I(n) ), where Z = FG . s2 Y where Nm,d is the matrix-variate normal distribution of size m × d; α, Figure 1: Model 2 β, δ, ν and σ 2 are scalar parameters of the model. A slight difference √ between this ﬁnite model and Model 1 is that the coefﬁcient 1/ d is ignored for simplicity because this coefﬁcient can be absorbed by α or β. As we can explicitly compute Pr(Σ|F), Pr(Ω|G), Pr(F|YI , G, Σ, s2 ), Pr(G|YI , F, Ω, s2 ), Pr(s2 |YI , F, G), we can apply Gibbs sampling algorithm to compute ZO . However, the computational time complexity is at least O(m3 + n3 ), which is not practical for large scale data. 2.2 Gibbs Sampling Method To overcome the inefﬁciency in sampling large covariance matrices, we rewrite the sampling process using the property of Theorem 2 to take the advantage of d min(m, n). αI(d) αI(m) Theorem 2. If 1. Σ ∼ IW m (δ, αI(m) ) and F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ), 2. K ∼ IW d (δ, αI(d) ) and H|K ∼ Nm,d (0, I(m) ⊗ K), then, matrix variates, F and H, have the same distribution. Proof sketch. Matrix variate F follows a matrix variate t distribution, t(δ, 0, αI(m) , I(d) ), which is written as 1 Σ I(d) F → I(m) K F Figure 2: Theorem 2 1 p(F) ∝ |I(m) + (αI(m) )−1 F(I(d) )−1 F |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) = |I(m) + α−1 FF |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) Matrix variate H follows a matrix variate t distribution, t(δ, 0, I(m) , αI(d) ), which can be written as 1 1 p(H) ∝ |I(m) + (I(m) )−1 H(αI(d) )−1 H |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) = |I(m) + α−1 HH |− 2 (δ+m+d−1) Thus, matrix variates, F and H, have the same distribution. 3 This theorem allows us to sample a smaller covariance matrix K of size d × d on the column side instead of sampling a large covariance matrix Σ of size m × m on the row side. The translation is depicted in Figure 2. This theorem applies to G as well, thus we rewrite the model as Model 3 (or Figure 3). A similar idea was used in our previous work [16]. Model 3. The alternative generative model of a matrix-variate SRM: I(m) I(n) K R 1. Draw K ∼ IW d (δ, αI(d) ) and R ∼ IW d (δ, βI(d) ); G F 2. Draw F|K ∼ Nm,d (0, I(m) ⊗ K), and G|R ∼ Nn,d (0, I(n) ⊗ R), 3. Draw s2 ∼ χ−2 (ν, σ 2 ) ; Z 4. Draw Y|F, G, s2 ∼ Nm,n (Z, s2 I(m) ⊗ I(n) ), where Z = FG . s2 Y Let column vector f i be the i-th row of matrix F, and column vector gj Figure 3: Model 3 be the j-th row of matrix G. In Model 3, {f i } are independent given K, 2 G and s . Similar independence applies to {gj } as well. The conditional posterior distribution of K, R, {f i }, {gj } and s2 can be easily computed, thus the Gibbs sampling for SRM is named BSRM (for Bayesian SRM). We use Gibbs sampling to compute the mean of ZO , which is derived from the samples of FG . Because of the sparsity of I, each iteration in this sampling algorithm can be computed in O(d2 r + d3 (m + n)) time complexity2 , which is a dramatic reduction from the previous time complexity O(m3 + n3 ) . 2.3 Models with Informative Priors An important characteristic of SRMs is that it allows the inclusion of certain prior knowledge of entities into the model. Speciﬁcally, the prior information is encoded as the prior covariance parameters, i.e. Σ◦ and Ω◦ . In the general case, it is difﬁcult to run sampling process due to the size of Σ◦ and Ω◦ . We assume that Σ◦ and Ω◦ have a special form, i.e. Σ◦ = F◦ (F◦ ) + αI(m) , where F◦ is an m × p matrix, and Ω◦ = G◦ (G◦ ) + βI(n) , where G◦ is an n × q matrix, and the magnitude of p and q is about the same as or less than that of d. This prior knowledge can be obtained from some additional features of entities. Although such an informative Σ◦ prevents us from directly sampling each row of F independently, as we do in Model 3, we can expand matrix F of size m × d to (F, F◦ ) of size m × (d + p), and derive an equivalent model, where rows of F are conditionally independent given F◦ . Figure 4 illustrates this transformation. Theorem 3. Let δ > p, Σ◦ = F◦ (F◦ ) + αI(m) , where F◦ is an m × p matrix. If 1. Σ ∼ IW m (δ, Σ◦ ) and F|Σ ∼ Nm,d (0, Σ ⊗ I(d) ), K11 K12 ∼ IW d+p (δ − p, αI(d+p) ) and K21 K22 H|K ∼ Nm,d (F◦ K−1 K21 , I(m) ⊗ K11·2 ), 22 2. K = αI(d+p) Σ0 Σ I(d) F → I(m) K (F, F0 ) Figure 4: Theorem 3 where K11·2 = K11 − K12 K−1 K21 , then F and H have the same distribution. 22 Proof sketch. Consider the distribution (H1 , H2 )|K ∼ Nm,d+p (0, I(m) ⊗ K). (1) Because H1 |H2 ∼ Nm,d (H2 K−1 K21 , I(m) ⊗ K11·2 ), p(H) = p(H1 |H2 = F◦ ). On the other 22 hand, we have a matrix-variate t distribution, (H1 , H2 ) ∼ tm,d+p (δ − p, 0, αI(m) , I(d+p) ). By Theorem 4.3.9 in [4], we have H1 |H2 ∼ tm,d (δ, 0, αI(m) + H2 H2 , I(d) ) = tm,d (δ, 0, Σ◦ , I(d) ), which implies p(F) = p(H1 |H2 = F◦ ) = p(H). 2 |Y − FG |2 can be efﬁciently computed in O(dr) time. I 4 The following corollary allows us to compute the posterior distribution of K efﬁciently. Corollary 4. K|H ∼ IW d+p (δ + m, αI(d+p) + (H, F◦ ) (H, F◦ )). Proof sketch. Because normal distribution and inverse Wishart distribution are conjugate, we can derive the posterior distribution K from Eq. (1). Thus, we can explicitly sample from the conditional posterior distributions, as listed in Algorithm 1 (BSRM/F for BSRM with features) in Appendix. We note that when p = q = 0, Algorithm 1 (BSRM/F) reduces to the exact algorithm for BSRM. Each iteration in this sampling algorithm can be computed in O(d2 r + d3 (m + n) + dpm + dqn) time complexity. 2.4 Unblocking for Sampling Implementation Blocking Gibbs sampling technique is commonly used to improve the sampling efﬁciency by reducing the sample variance according to the Rao-Blackwell theorem (c.f. [9]). However, blocking Gibbs sampling is not necessary to be computationally efﬁcient. To improve the computational efﬁciency of Algorithm 1, we use unblocking sampling to reduce the major computational cost is Step 2 and Step 4. We consider sampling each element of F conditionally. The sampling process is written as Step 4 and Step 9 of Algorithm 2, which is called BSRM/F with conditional Gibss sampling. We can reduce the computational cost of each iteration to O(dr + d2 (m + n) + dpm + dqn), which is comparable to other low-rank matrix factorization approaches. Though such a conditional sampling process increases the sample variance comparing to Algorithm 1, we can afford more samples within a given amount of time due to its faster speed. Our experiments show that the overall computational cost of Algorithm 2 is usually less than that of Algorithm 1 when achieving the same accuracy. Additionally, since {f i } are independent, we can parallelize the for loops in Step 4 and Step 9 of Algorithm 2. 3 Related Work SRMs fall into a class of statistical latent-variable relational models that explain relations by latent factors of entities. Recently a number of such models were proposed that can be roughly put into two groups, depending on whether the latent factors are continuous or discrete: (1) Discrete latent-state relational models: a large body of research infers latent classes of entities and explains the entity relationship by the probability conditioned on the joint state of participating entities, e.g., [6, 14, 7, 1]. In another work [10], binary latent factors are modeled; (2) Continuous latent-variable relational models: many such models assume relational data underlain by multiplicative effects between latent variables of entities, e.g. [5]. A simple example is matrix factorization, which recently has become very popular in collaborative ﬁltering applications, e.g., [12, 8, 13]. The latest Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization [13] reported the state-of-the-art accuracy of matrix factorization on Netﬂix data. Interestingly, the model turns out to be similar to our Model 3 under the non-informative prior. This paper reveals the equivalence between different models and offers a more general Bayesian framework that allows informative priors from entity features to play a role. The framework also generalizes Gaussian processes [11] to a relational domain, where a nonparametric prior for stochastic relational processes is described. 4 Experiments Synthetic data: We compare BSRM under noninformative priors against two other algorithms: the fast max-margin matrix factorization (fMMMF) in [12] with a square loss, and SRM using variational Bayesian approach (SRM-VB) in [15]. We generate a 30 × 20 random matrix (Figure 5(a)), then add Gaussian noise with σ 2 = 0.1 (Figure 5(b)). The root mean squared noise is 0.32. We select 70% elements as the observed data and use the rest of the elements for testing. The reconstruction matrix and root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of predictions on the test elements are shown in Figure 5(c)-5(e). BSRM outperforms the variational approach of SRMs and fMMMF. Note that because of the log-determinant penalty of the inverse Wishart prior, SRM-VB enforces the rank to be smaller, thus the result of SRM-VB looks smoother than that of BSRM. 5 5 5 5 5 5 10 10 10 10 10 15 15 15 15 15 20 20 20 20 20 25 25 25 25 30 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 25 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 30 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 (a) Original Matrix (b) With Noise(0.32) (c) fMMMF (0.27) (d) SRM-VB(0.22) 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 (e) BSRM(0.19) Figure 5: Experiments on synthetic data.

All standard errors are 0.001 or less. EachMovie data: We test the accuracy and the efﬁciency of our algorithms on EachMovie. The dataset contains 74, 424 users’ 2, 811, 718 ratings on 1, 648 movies, i.e. about 2.29% are rated by zero-to-ﬁve stars. We put all the ratings into a matrix, and randomly select 80% as observed data to predict the remaining ratings. The random selection was carried out 10 times independently. We compare our approach against several competing methods: 1) User Mean, predicting ratings by the sample mean of the same user’s ratings; 2) Move Mean, predicting rating by the sample mean of ratings on the same movie; 3) fMMMF [12]; 4) VB introduced in [8], which is a probabilistic lowrank matrix factorization using variational approximation. Because of the data size, we cannot run the SRM-VB of [15]. We test the algorithms BSRM and BSRM/F, both following Algorithm 2, which run without and with features, respectively. The features used in BSRM/F are generated from the PCA result of the binary indicator matrix that indicates whether the user rates the movie. The 10 top factors of both the user side and the movie side are used as features, i.e. p = 10, q = 10. We run the experiments with different d = 16, 32, 100, 200, 300. The hyper parameters are set to some trivial values, δ = p + 1 = 11, α = β = 1, σ 2 = 1, and ν = 1. The results are shown in Table 1 and 2. We ﬁnd that the accuracy improves as the number of d is increased. Once d is greater than 100, the further improvement is not very signiﬁcant within a reasonable amount of running time. rank (d) BSRM RMSE MAE BSRM/F RMSE MAE 16 1.0983 0.8411 1.0952 0.8311 32 1.0924 0.8321 1.0872 0.8280 100 1.0905 0.8335 1.0848 0.8289 200 1.0903 0.8340 1.0846 0.8293 300 1.0902 0.8393 1.0852 0.8292 Table 2: RMSE (root mean squared error) and MAE (mean absolute error) of experiments on EachMovie data.

After the burn-in period, we restart to compute 1.1 the averaged ZO and evaluate them, therefore there are abrupt points at 100 iterations 1.08 in both cases.

The dataset consists of 100, 480, 507 ratings from 480, 189 users on 17, 770 movies. In addition, Netﬂix also provides a set of validation data with 1, 408, 395 ratings. In order to evaluate the prediction accuracy, there is a test set containing 2, 817, 131 ratings whose values are withheld and unknown for all the participants. The features used in BSRM/F are generated from the PCA result of a binary matrix that indicates whether or not the user rated the movie. The top 30 user-side factors are used as features, none of movie-side factors are used, i.e. p = 30, q = 0. The hyper parameters are set to some trivial values, δ = p + 1 = 31, α = β = 1, σ 2 = 1, and ν = 1. The results on the validation data are shown in Table 3.

We overcome the scalability issue by transforming SRMs into equivalent models, which can be efﬁciently sampled. The experiments show that the fully Bayesian inference outperforms the previously used variational Bayesian inference on SRMs. In addition, some techniques for efﬁcient computation in this paper can be applied to other large-scale Bayesian inferences, especially for models involving inverse-Wishart distributions.

A matrix with subscripts indicates its submatrix, which consists its entries at the given indices in the subscripts, for example, XIj ,j is a subvector of the j-th column of X whose row indices are in set Ij , X·,j is the j-th column of X (· indicates the full set). Xi,j denotes the (i, j)-th 2 entry of X. |X|2 is the squared sum of elements in set I, i.e. (i,j)∈I Xi,j .

Sparsity is enforced by means of automatic relevance determination or by imposing appropriate prior distributions, such as generalised hyperbolic distributions. We derive a variational Expectation-Maximisation algorithm for the estimation of the hyperparameters and show that our novel probabilistic approach compares favourably to existing techniques. We illustrate how the proposed method can be applied in the context of cryptoanalysis as a preprocessing tool for the construction of template attacks. 1</p><p>4 0.59467375 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Weakly-Related_Unlabeled_Data_%3A_Towards_Better_Text_Categorization.html">205 nips-2008-Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data : Towards Better Text Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Liu Yang, Rong Jin, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption is exploited by most semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, if the unlabeled data is merely weakly related to the target classes, it becomes questionable whether driving the decision boundary to the low density regions of the unlabeled data will help the classiﬁcation. In such case, the cluster assumption may not be valid; and consequently how to leverage this type of unlabeled data to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy becomes a challenge. We introduce “Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data” (SSLW), an inductive method that builds upon the maximum-margin approach, towards a better usage of weakly-related unlabeled information. Although the SSLW could improve a wide range of classiﬁcation tasks, in this paper, we focus on text categorization with a small training pool. The key assumption behind this work is that, even with different topics, the word usage patterns across different corpora tends to be consistent. To this end, SSLW estimates the optimal wordcorrelation matrix that is consistent with both the co-occurrence information derived from the weakly-related unlabeled documents and the labeled documents. For empirical evaluation, we present a direct comparison with a number of stateof-the-art methods for inductive semi-supervised learning and text categorization. We show that SSLW results in a signiﬁcant improvement in categorization accuracy, equipped with a small training set and an unlabeled resource that is weakly related to the test domain.</p><p>5 0.59316462 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Exploring_Large_Feature_Spaces_with_Hierarchical_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">79 nips-2008-Exploring Large Feature Spaces with Hierarchical Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: For supervised and unsupervised learning, positive deﬁnite kernels allow to use large and potentially inﬁnite dimensional feature spaces with a computational cost that only depends on the number of observations. This is usually done through the penalization of predictor functions by Euclidean or Hilbertian norms. In this paper, we explore penalizing by sparsity-inducing norms such as the ℓ1 -norm or the block ℓ1 -norm. We assume that the kernel decomposes into a large sum of individual basis kernels which can be embedded in a directed acyclic graph; we show that it is then possible to perform kernel selection through a hierarchical multiple kernel learning framework, in polynomial time in the number of selected kernels. This framework is naturally applied to non linear variable selection; our extensive simulations on synthetic datasets and datasets from the UCI repository show that efﬁciently exploring the large feature space through sparsity-inducing norms leads to state-of-the-art predictive performance.</p><p>6 0.59065574 <a title="44-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>

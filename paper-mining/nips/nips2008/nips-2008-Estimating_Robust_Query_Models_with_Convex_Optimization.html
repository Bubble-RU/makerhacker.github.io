<p>Author: Giovanni Cavallanti, Nicolò Cesa-bianchi, Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: We provide a new analysis of an efﬁcient margin-based algorithm for selective sampling in classiﬁcation problems. Using the so-called Tsybakov low noise condition to parametrize the instance distribution, we show bounds on the convergence rate to the Bayes risk of both the fully supervised and the selective sampling versions of the basic algorithm. Our analysis reveals that, excluding logarithmic factors, the average risk of the selective sampler converges to the Bayes risk at rate N −(1+α)(2+α)/2(3+α) where N denotes the number of √ queried labels, and α > 0 is the exponent in the low noise condition. For all α > 3 − 1 ≈ 0.73 this convergence rate is asymptotically faster than the rate N −(1+α)/(2+α) achieved by the fully supervised version of the same classiﬁer, which queries all labels, and for α → ∞ the two rates exhibit an exponential gap. Experiments on textual data reveal that simple variants of the proposed selective sampler perform much better than popular and similarly efﬁcient competitors. 1</p><p>4 0.19819918 <a title="73-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Human_Active_Learning.html">101 nips-2008-Human Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui M. Castro, Charles Kalish, Robert Nowak, Ruichen Qian, Tim Rogers, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a topic at the interface of machine learning and cognitive science. Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study comparing human category learning in active versus passive settings. 1</p><p>5 0.18413484 <a title="73-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Global_Ranking_Using_Continuous_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">93 nips-2008-Global Ranking Using Continuous Conditional Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Qin, Tie-yan Liu, Xu-dong Zhang, De-sheng Wang, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies global ranking problem by learning to rank methods. Conventional learning to rank methods are usually designed for ‘local ranking’, in the sense that the ranking model is deﬁned on a single object, for example, a document in information retrieval. For many applications, this is a very loose approximation. Relations always exist between objects and it is better to deﬁne the ranking model as a function on all the objects to be ranked (i.e., the relations are also included). This paper refers to the problem as global ranking and proposes employing a Continuous Conditional Random Fields (CRF) for conducting the learning task. The Continuous CRF model is deﬁned as a conditional probability distribution over ranking scores of objects conditioned on the objects. It can naturally represent the content information of objects as well as the relation information between objects, necessary for global ranking. Taking two speciﬁc information retrieval tasks as examples, the paper shows how the Continuous CRF method can perform global ranking better than baselines.</p><p>6 0.16407941 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_High-dimensional_Kernel_Summations_Using_the_Monte_Carlo_Multipole_Method.html">83 nips-2008-Fast High-dimensional Kernel Summations Using the Monte Carlo Multipole Method</a></p>

<p>Author: Dongryeol Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new fast Gaussian summation algorithm for high-dimensional datasets with high accuracy. First, we extend the original fast multipole-type methods to use approximation schemes with both hard and probabilistic error. Second, we utilize a new data structure called subspace tree which maps each data point in the node to its lower dimensional mapping as determined by any linear dimension reduction method such as PCA. This new data structure is suitable for reducing the cost of each pairwise distance computation, the most dominant cost in many kernel methods. Our algorithm guarantees probabilistic relative error on each kernel sum, and can be applied to high-dimensional Gaussian summations which are ubiquitous inside many kernel methods as the key computational bottleneck. We provide empirical speedup results on low to high-dimensional datasets up to 89 dimensions. 1 Fast Gaussian Kernel Summation In this paper, we propose new computational techniques for efﬁciently approximating the following sum for each query point qi ∈ Q: Φ(qi , R) = e−||qi −rj || 2 /(2h2 ) (1) rj ∈R where R is the reference set; each reference point is associated with a Gaussian function with a smoothing parameter h (the ’bandwidth’). This form of summation is ubiquitous in many statistical learning methods, including kernel density estimation, kernel regression, Gaussian process regression, radial basis function networks, spectral clustering, support vector machines, and kernel PCA [1, 4]. Cross-validation in all of these methods require evaluating Equation 1 for multiple values of h. Kernel density estimation, for example, requires |R| density estimate based on |R| − 1 points, yielding a brute-force computational cost scaling quadratically (that is O(|R| 2 )). Error bounds. Due to its expensive computational cost, many algorithms approximate the Gaussian kernel sums at the expense of reduced precision. Therefore, it is natural to discuss error bound criteria which measure the quality of the approximations with respect to their corresponding true values. The following error bound criteria are common in literature: Deﬁnition 1.1. An algorithm guarantees absolute error bound, if for each exact value Φ(q i , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) such that Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ . Deﬁnition 1.2. An algorithm guarantees relative error bound, if for each exact value Φ(q i , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) ∈ R such that Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ |Φ(qi , R)|. 1 Bounding the relative error (e.g., the percentage deviation) is much harder because the error bound criterion is in terms of the initially unknown exact quantity. As a result, many previous methods [7] have focused on bounding the absolute error. The relative error bound criterion is preferred to the absolute error bound criterion in statistical applications in which high accuracy is desired. Our new algorithm will enforce the following “relaxed” form of the relative error bound criterion, whose motivation will be discussed shortly. Deﬁnition 1.3. An algorithm guarantees (1 − α) probabilistic relative error bound, if for each exact value Φ(qi , R) for qi ∈ Q, it computes Φ(qi , R) ∈ R, such that with at least probability 0 < 1 − α < 1, Φ(qi , R) − Φ(qi , R) ≤ |Φ(qi , R)|. Previous work. The most successful class of acceleration methods employ “higher-order divide and conquer” or generalized N -body algorithms (GNA) [4]. This approach can use any spatial partioning tree such as kd-trees or ball-trees for both the query set Q and reference data R and performs a simulataneous recursive descent on both trees. GNA with relative error bounds (Deﬁnition 1.2) [5, 6, 11, 10] utilized bounding boxes and additional cached-sufﬁcient statistics such as higher-order moments needed for series-expansion. [5, 6] utilized bounding-box based error bounds which tend to be very loose, which resulted in slow empirical performance around suboptimally small and large bandwidths. [11, 10] extended GNA-based Gaussian summations with series-expansion which provided tighter bounds; it showed enormous performance improvements, but only up to low dimensional settings (up to D = 5) since the number of required terms in series expansion increases exponentially with respect to D. [9] introduces an iterative sampling based GNA for accelerating the computation of nested sums (a related easier problem). Its speedup is achieved by replacing pessimistic error bounds provided by bounding boxes with normal-based conﬁdence interval from Monte Carlo sampling. [9] demonstrates the speedup many orders of magnitude faster than the previous state of the art in the context of computing aggregates over the queries (such as the LSCV score for selecting the optimal bandwidth). However, the authors did not discuss the sampling-based approach for computations that require per-query estimates, such as those required for kernel density estimation. None of the previous approaches for kernel summations addresses the issue of reducing the computational cost of each distance computation which incurs O(D) cost. However, the intrinsic dimensionality d of most high-dimensional datasets is much smaller than the explicit dimension D (that is, d << D). [12] proposed tree structures using a global dimension reduction method, such as random projection, as a preprocessing step for efﬁcient (1 + ) approximate nearest neighbor search. Similarly, we develop a new data structure for kernel summations; our new data structure is constructed in a top-down fashion to perform the initial spatial partitioning in the original input space R D and performs a local dimension reduction to a localized subset of the data in a bottom-up fashion. This paper. We propose a new fast Gaussian summation algorithm that enables speedup in higher dimensions. Our approach utilizes: 1) probabilistic relative error bounds (Deﬁnition 1.3) on kernel sums provided by Monte Carlo estimates 2) a new tree structure called subspace tree for reducing the computational cost of each distance computation. The former can be seen as relaxing the strict requirement of guaranteeing hard relative bound on very small quantities, as done in [5, 6, 11, 10]. The latter was mentioned as a possible way of ameliorating the effects of the curse of dimensionality in [14], a pioneering paper in this area. Notations. Each query point and reference point (a D-dimensional vector) is indexed by natural numbers i, j ∈ N, and denoted qi and rj respectively. For any set S, |S| denotes the number of elements in S. The entities related to the left and the right child are denoted with superscripts L and R; an internal node N has the child nodes N L and N R . 2 Gaussian Summation by Monte Carlo Sampling Here we describe the extension needed for probabilistic computation of kernel summation satisfying Deﬁnition 1.3. The main routine for the probabilistic kernel summation is shown in Algorithm 1. The function MCMM takes the query node Q and the reference node R (each initially called with the roots of the query tree and the reference tree, Qroot and Rroot ) and β (initially called with α value which controls the probability guarantee that each kernel sum is within relative error). 2 Algorithm 1 The core dual-tree routine for probabilistic Gaussian kernel summation. MCMM(Q, R, β) if C AN S UMMARIZE E XACT(Q, R, ) then S UMMARIZE E XACT(Q, R) else if C AN S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , β) then 5: S UMMARIZE MC(Q, R, , β) else if Q is a leaf node then if R is a leaf node then MCMMBASE(Q, R) 10: else MCMM Q, RL , β , MCMM Q, RR , β 2 2 else if R is a leaf node then MCMM(QL , R, β), MCMM(QR , R, β) 15: else MCMM QL , RL , β , MCMM QL , RR , β 2 2 MCMM QR , RL , β , MCMM QR , RR , β 2 2 The idea of Monte Carlo sampling used in the new algorithm is similar to the one in [9], except the sampling is done per query and we use approximations that provide hard error bounds as well (i.e. ﬁnite difference, exhaustive base case: MCMMBASE). This means that the approximation has less variance than a pure Monte Carlo approach used in [9]. Algorithm 1 ﬁrst attempts approximations with hard error bounds, which are computationally cheaper than sampling-based approximations. For example, ﬁnite-difference scheme [5, 6] can be used for the C AN S UMMARIZE E XACT and S UMMARIZE E XACT functions in any general dimension. The C AN S UMMARIZE MC function takes two parameters that specify the accuracy: the relative error and its probability guarantee and decides whether to use Monte Carlo sampling for the given pair of nodes. If the reference node R contains too few points, it may be more efﬁcient to process it using exact methods that use error bounds based on bounding primitives on the node pair or exhaustive pair-wise evaluations, which is determined by the condition: τ · minitial ≤ |R| where τ > 1 controls the minimum number of reference points needed for Monte Carlo sampling to proceed. If the reference node does contain enough points, then for each query point q ∈ Q, the S AMPLE routine samples minitial terms over the terms in the summation Φ(q, R) = Kh (||q − rjn ||) rjn ∈R where Φ(q, R) denotes the exact contribution of R to q’s kernel sum. Basically, we are interested in estimating Φ(q, R) by Φ(q, R) = |R|µS , where µS is the sample mean of S. From the Central 2 Limit Theorem, given enough m samples, µS N (µ, σS /m) where Φ(q, R) = |R|µ (i.e. µ is the average of the kernel value between q and any reference point r ∈ R); this implies that √ |µS − µ| ≤ zβ/2 σS / m with probability 1 − β. The pruning rule we have to enforce for each query point for the contribution of R is: σS Φ(q, R) zβ/2 √ ≤ |R| m where σS the sample standard deviation of S. Since Φ(q, R) is one of the unknown quanities we want to compute, we instead enforce the following: σS zβ/2 √ ≤ m Φl (q, R) + |R| µS − |R| zβ/2 σS √ m (2) where Φl (q, R) is the currently running lower bound on the sum computed using exact methods z σ √ and |R| µS − β/2 S is the probabilistic component contributed by R. Denoting Φl,new (q, R) = m zβ/2 σ Φl (q, R) + |R| µS − √ S , the minimum number of samples for q needed to achieve the |S| 3 target error the right side of the inequality in Equation 2 with at least probability of 1 − β is: 2 2 m ≥ zβ/2 σS (|R| + |R|)2 2 (Φl (q, R) + |R|µ )2 S If the given query node and reference node pair cannot be pruned using either nonprobabilistic/probabilistic approximations, then we recurse on a smaller subsets of two sets. In particular, when dividing over the reference node R, we recurse with half of the β value 1 . We now state the probablistic error guarantee of our algorithm as a theorem. Theorem 2.1. After calling MCMM with Q = Qroot , R = Rroot , and β = α, Algorithm 1 approximates each Φ(q, R) with Φ(q, R) such that Deﬁnition 1.3 holds. Proof. For a query/reference (Q, R) pair and 0 < β < 1, MCMMBASE and S UMMARIZE E XACT compute estimates for q ∈ Q such that Φ(q, R) − Φ(q, R) < Φ(q,R)|R| with probability at |R| least 1 > 1 − β. By Equation 2, S UMMARIZE MC computes estimates for q ∈ Q such that Φ(q, R) − Φ(q, R) < Φ(q,R)|R| with probability 1 − β. |R| We now induct on |Q ∪ R|. Line 11 of Algorithm 1 divides over the reference whose subcalls compute estimates that satisfy Φ(q, RL ) − Φ(q, RL ) ≤ Φ(q,R)|RR | |R| L each with at least 1 − β 2 Φ(q,R)|RL | |R| and Φ(q, RR ) − Φ(q, RR ) ≤ probability by induction hypothesis. For q ∈ Q, Φ(q, R) = Φ(q, R )+ Φ(q, R ) which means |Φ(q, R)−Φ(q, R)| ≤ Φ(q,R)|R| with probability at least 1−β. |R| Line 14 divides over the query and each subcall computes estimates that hold with at least probability 1 − β for q ∈ QL and q ∈ QR . Line 16 and 17 divides both over the query and the reference, and the correctness can be proven similarly. Therefore, M CM M (Qroot , Rroot , α) computes estimates satisfying Deﬁnition 1.3. R “Reclaiming” probability. We note that the assigned probability β for the query/reference pair computed with exact bounds (S UMMARIZE E XACT and MCMMBASE) is not used. This portion of the probability can be “reclaimed” in a similar fashion as done in [10] and re-used to prune more aggressively in the later stages of the algorithm. All experiments presented in this paper were beneﬁted by this simple modiﬁcation. 3 Subspace Tree A subspace tree is basically a space-partitioning tree with a set of orthogonal bases associated with each node N : N.Ω = (µ, U, Λ, d) where µ is the mean, U is a D×d matrix whose columns consist of d eigenvectors, and Λ the corresponding eigenvalues. The orthogonal basis set is constructed using a linear dimension reduction method such as PCA. It is constructed in the top-down manner using the PARTITION S ET function dividing the given set of points into two (where the PARTITION S ET function divides along the dimension with the highest variance in case of a kd-tree for example), with the subspace in each node formed in the bottom-up manner. Algorithm 3 shows a PCA tree (a subspace tree using PCA as a dimension reduction) for a 3-D dataset. The subspace of each leaf node is computed using P CA BASE which can use the exact PCA [3] or a stochastic one [2]. For an internal node, the subspaces of the child nodes, N L .Ω = (µL , U L , ΛL , dL ) and N R .Ω = (µR , U R , ΛR , dR ), are approximately merged using the M ERGE S UBSPACES function which involves solving an (d L + dR + 1) × (dL + dR + 1) eigenvalue problem [8], which runs in O((dL + dR + 1)3 ) << O(D 3 ) given that the dataset is sparse. In addition, each data point x in each node N is mapped to its new lower-dimensional coordinate using the orthogonal basis set of N : xproj = U T (x − µ). The L2 norm reconstruction error is given by: ||xrecon − x||2 = ||(U xproj + µ) − x||2 . 2 2 Monte Carlo sampling using a subspace tree. Consider C AN S UMMARIZE MC function in Algorithm 2. The “outer-loop” over this algorithm is over the query set Q, and it would make sense to project each query point q ∈ Q to the subspace owned by the reference node R. Let U and µ be the orthogonal basis system for R consisting of d basis. For each q ∈ Q, consider the squared distance 1 We could also divide β such that the node that may be harder to approximate gets a lower value. 4 Algorithm 2 Monte Carlo sampling based approximation routines.

For the Gaussian kernel, each pairwise kernel value is approximated as: e−||q−r|| 2 /(2h2 ) ≈ e−||q−qrecon || 2 (3) /(2h2 ) −||qproj −rproj ||2 /(2h2 ) e where qrecon = U qproj +µ and qproj = U (q−µ). For a ﬁxed query point q, e can be precomputed (which takes d dot products between two D-dimensional vectors) and re-used for every distance computation between q and any reference point r ∈ R whose cost is now O(d) << O(D). Therefore, we can take more samples efﬁciently. For a total of sufﬁciently large m samples, the computational cost is O(d(D + m)) << O(D · m) for each query point. −||q−qrecon ||2 /(2h2 ) T Increased variance comes at the cost of inexact distance computations, however. Each distance computation incurs at most squared L2 norm of ||rrecon − r||2 error. That is, 2 ||q − rrecon ||2 − ||q − r||2 ≤ ||rrecon − r||2 . Neverhteless, the sample variance for each query 2 2 2 point plus the inexactness due to dimension reduction τS can be shown to be bounded for the Gaus2 2 sian kernel as: (where each s = e−||q−rrecon || /(2h ) ): 1 m−1 ≤ 1 m−1 s∈S s2 − m · µ 2 S s2 + τS 2 min 1, max e||rrecon −r||2 /h s∈S r∈R 2 2 − m µS min e−||rrecon −r||2 /(2h 2 2 ) r∈R Exhaustive computations using a subspace tree. Now suppose we have built subspace trees for the query and the reference sets. We can project either each query point onto the reference subspace, or each reference point onto the query subspace, depending on which subspace has a smaller dimension and the number of points in each node. The subspaces formed in the leaf nodes usually are highly numerically accurate since it contains very few points compared to the extrinsic dimensionality D. 4 Experimental Results We empirically evaluated the runtime performance of our algorithm on seven real-world datasets, scaled to ﬁt in [0, 1]D hypercube, for approximating the Gaussian sum at every query point with a range of bandwidths. This experiment is motivated by many kernel methods that require computing the Gaussian sum at different bandwidth values (according to the standard least-sqares crossvalidation scores [15]). Nevertheless, we emphasize that the acceleration results are applicable to other kernel methods that require efﬁcient Gaussian summation. In this paper, the reference set equals the query set. All datasets have 50K points so that the exact exhaustive method can be tractably computed. All times are in seconds and include the time needed to build the trees. Codes are in C/C++ and run on a dual Intel Xeon 3GHz with 8 Gb of main memory. The measurements in second to eigth columns are obtained by running the algorithms at the bandwidth kh∗ where 10−3 ≤ k ≤ 103 is the constant in the corresponding column header. The last columns denote the total time needed to run on all seven bandwidth values. Each table has results for ﬁve algorithms: the naive algorithm and four algorithms. The algorithms with p = 1 denote the previous state-of-the-art (ﬁnite-difference with error redistribution) [10], 5 Algorithm 3 PCA tree building routine.

Each entry has the running time and the percentage of the query points that did not satisfy the relative error . Analysis. Readers should focus on the last columns containing the total time needed for evaluating Gaussian sum at all points for seven different bandwidth values. This is indicated by boldfaced numbers for our probabilistic algorithm. As expected, On low-dimensional datasets (below 6 dimensions), the algorithm using series-expansion based bounds gives two to three times speedup compared to our approach that uses Monte Carlo sampling. Multipole moments are an effective form of compression in low dimensions with analytical error bounds that can be evaluated; our Monte Carlo-based method has an asymptotic error bound which must be “learned” through sampling. As we go from 7 dimensions and beyond, series-expansion cannot be done efﬁciently because of its slow convergence. Our probabilistic algorithm (p = 0.9) using Monte Carlo consistently performs better than the algorithm using exact bounds (p = 1) by at least a factor of two. Compared to naive, it achieves the maximum speedup of about nine times on an 16-dimensional dataset; on an 89-dimensional dataset, it is at least three times as fast as the naive. Note that all the datasets contain only 50K points, and the speedup will be more dramatic as we increase the number of points. 5 Conclusion We presented an extension to fast multipole methods to use approximation methods with both hard and probabilistic bounds. Our experimental results show speedup over the previous state-of-the-art on high-dimensional datasets. Our future work will include possible improvements inspired by a recent work done in the FMM community using a matrix-factorization formulation [13]. Figure 1: Left: A PCA-tree for a 3-D dataset.

<p>Author: Rui M. Castro, Charles Kalish, Robert Nowak, Ruichen Qian, Tim Rogers, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a topic at the interface of machine learning and cognitive science. Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study comparing human category learning in active versus passive settings. 1</p><p>6 0.39976123 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Global_Ranking_Using_Continuous_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">93 nips-2008-Global Ranking Using Continuous Conditional Random Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Jordan L. Boyd-graber, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop the syntactic topic model (STM), a nonparametric Bayesian model of parsed documents. The STM generates words that are both thematically and syntactically constrained, which combines the semantic insights of topic models with the syntactic information available from parse trees. Each word of a sentence is generated by a distribution that combines document-speciﬁc topic weights and parse-tree-speciﬁc syntactic transitions. Words are assumed to be generated in an order that respects the parse tree. We derive an approximate posterior inference method based on variational methods for hierarchical Dirichlet processes, and we report qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. 1</p><p>2 0.892901 <a title="73-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Grouping_Contours_Via_a_Related_Image.html">95 nips-2008-Grouping Contours Via a Related Image</a></p>
<p>Author: Praveen Srinivasan, Liming Wang, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Contours have been established in the biological and computer vision literature as a compact yet descriptive representation of object shape. While individual contours provide structure, they lack the large spatial support of region segments (which lack internal structure). We present a method for further grouping of contours in an image using their relationship to the contours of a second, related image. Stereo, motion, and similarity all provide cues that can aid this task; contours that have similar transformations relating them to their matching contours in the second image likely belong to a single group. To ﬁnd matches for contours, we rely only on shape, which applies directly to all three modalities without modiﬁcation, in contrast to the specialized approaches developed for each independently. Visually salient contours are extracted in each image, along with a set of candidate transformations for aligning subsets of them. For each transformation, groups of contours with matching shape across the two images are identiﬁed to provide a context for evaluating matches of individual contour points across the images. The resulting contexts of contours are used to perform a ﬁnal grouping on contours in the original image while simultaneously ﬁnding matches in the related image, again by shape matching. We demonstrate grouping results on image pairs consisting of stereo, motion, and similar images. Our method also produces qualitatively better results against a baseline method that does not use the inferred contexts. 1</p><p>3 0.87783188 <a title="73-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA_for_Hand_Tracking_and_Brain-Machine_interfacing_During_3D_Motor_Control.html">110 nips-2008-Kernel-ARMA for Hand Tracking and Brain-Machine interfacing During 3D Motor Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.85361207 <a title="73-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of unsupervised algorithms, numerical taxonomy clustering, to simultaneously cluster data, and to learn a taxonomy that encodes the relationship between the clusters. The algorithms work by maximizing the dependence between the taxonomy and the original data. The resulting taxonomy is a more informative visualization of complex data than simple clustering; in addition, taking into account the relations between different clusters is shown to substantially improve the quality of the clustering, when compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms in the literature (both spectral clustering and a previous dependence maximization approach). We demonstrate our algorithm on image and text data. 1</p><p>same-paper 5 0.84545624 <a title="73-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.83930171 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>

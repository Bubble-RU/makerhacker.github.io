<p>Author: Jordan L. Boyd-graber, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop the syntactic topic model (STM), a nonparametric Bayesian model of parsed documents. The STM generates words that are both thematically and syntactically constrained, which combines the semantic insights of topic models with the syntactic information available from parse trees. Each word of a sentence is generated by a distribution that combines document-speciﬁc topic weights and parse-tree-speciﬁc syntactic transitions. Words are assumed to be generated in an order that respects the parse tree. We derive an approximate posterior inference method based on variational methods for hierarchical Dirichlet processes, and we report qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. 1</p><p>3 0.12354954 <a title="4-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Learning_with_Networks_of_Features.html">194 nips-2008-Regularized Learning with Networks of Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ted Sandler, John Blitzer, Partha P. Talukdar, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature’s weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.11356211 <a title="4-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Unsupervised_Learning_of_Visual_Sense_Models_for_Polysemous_Words.html">246 nips-2008-Unsupervised Learning of Visual Sense Models for Polysemous Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Polysemy is a problem for methods that exploit image search engines to build object category models. Existing unsupervised approaches do not take word sense into consideration. We propose a new method that uses a dictionary to learn models of visual word sense from a large collection of unlabeled web data. The use of LDA to discover a latent sense space makes the model robust despite the very limited nature of dictionary deﬁnitions. The deﬁnitions are used to learn a distribution in the latent space that best represents a sense. The algorithm then uses the text surrounding image links to retrieve images with high probability of a particular dictionary sense. An object classiﬁer is trained on the resulting sense-speciﬁc images. We evaluate our method on a dataset obtained by searching the web for polysemous words. Category classiﬁcation experiments show that our dictionarybased approach outperforms baseline methods. 1</p><p>5 0.1070905 <a title="4-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>6 0.10048712 <a title="4-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Asynchronous_Distributed_Learning_of_Topic_Models.html">28 nips-2008-Asynchronous Distributed Learning of Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Yik-cheung Tam, Tanja Schultz</p><p>Abstract: We present a correlated bigram LSA approach for unsupervised LM adaptation for automatic speech recognition. The model is trained using efﬁcient variational EM and smoothed using the proposed fractional Kneser-Ney smoothing which handles fractional counts. We address the scalability issue to large training corpora via bootstrapping of bigram LSA from unigram LSA. For LM adaptation, unigram and bigram LSA are integrated into the background N-gram LM via marginal adaptation and linear interpolation respectively. Experimental results on the Mandarin RT04 test set show that applying unigram and bigram LSA together yields 6%–8% relative perplexity reduction and 2.5% relative character error rate reduction which is statistically signiﬁcant compared to applying only unigram LSA. On the large-scale evaluation on Arabic, 3% relative word error rate reduction is achieved which is also statistically signiﬁcant. 1</p><p>3 0.73061603 <a title="4-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Syntactic_Topic_Models.html">229 nips-2008-Syntactic Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Zhang, Deepak Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: Multi-level hierarchical models provide an attractive framework for incorporating correlations induced in a response variable that is organized hierarchically. Model ﬁtting is challenging, especially for a hierarchy with a large number of nodes. We provide a novel algorithm based on a multi-scale Kalman ﬁlter that is both scalable and easy to implement. For Gaussian response, we show our method provides the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter estimates; for non-Gaussian response, parameter estimation is performed through a Laplace approximation. However, the Laplace approximation provides biased parameter estimates that is corrected through a parametric bootstrap procedure. We illustrate through simulation studies and analyses of real world data sets in health care and online advertising.</p><p>5 0.66637731 <a title="4-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Beyond_Novelty_Detection%3A_Incongruent_Events%2C_when_General_and_Specific_Classifiers_Disagree.html">36 nips-2008-Beyond Novelty Detection: Incongruent Events, when General and Specific Classifiers Disagree</a></p>
<p>Author: Daphna Weinshall, Hynek Hermansky, Alon Zweig, Jie Luo, Holly Jimison, Frank Ohl, Misha Pavel</p><p>Abstract: Unexpected stimuli are a challenge to any machine learning algorithm. Here we identify distinct types of unexpected events, focusing on ’incongruent events’ when ’general level’ and ’speciﬁc level’ classiﬁers give conﬂicting predictions. We deﬁne a formal framework for the representation and processing of incongruent events: starting from the notion of label hierarchy, we show how partial order on labels can be deduced from such hierarchies. For each event, we compute its probability in different ways, based on adjacent levels (according to the partial order) in the label hierarchy. An incongruent event is an event where the probability computed based on some more speciﬁc level (in accordance with the partial order) is much smaller than the probability computed based on some more general level, leading to conﬂicting predictions. We derive algorithms to detect incongruent events from different types of hierarchies, corresponding to class membership or part membership. Respectively, we show promising results with real data on two speciﬁc problems: Out Of Vocabulary words in speech recognition, and the identiﬁcation of a new sub-class (e.g., the face of a new individual) in audio-visual facial object recognition.</p><p>6 0.64245665 <a title="4-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Asynchronous_Distributed_Learning_of_Topic_Models.html">28 nips-2008-Asynchronous Distributed Learning of Topic Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan, Emily B. Fox</p><p>Abstract: Many nonlinear dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our nonparametric Bayesian approach utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated approximation to the Dirichlet process with efﬁcient joint sampling of the mode and state sequences. The utility and ﬂexibility of our model are demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, and the IBOVESPA stock index.</p><p>2 0.8520028 <a title="4-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Structure_Learning_in_Human_Sequential_Decision-Making.html">223 nips-2008-Structure Learning in Human Sequential Decision-Making</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Acuna, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: We use graphical models and structure learning to explore how people learn policies in sequential decision making tasks. Studies of sequential decision-making in humans frequently ﬁnd suboptimal performance relative to an ideal actor that knows the graph model that generates reward in the environment. We argue that the learning problem humans face also involves learning the graph structure for reward generation in the environment. We formulate the structure learning problem using mixtures of reward models, and solve the optimal action selection problem using Bayesian Reinforcement Learning. We show that structure learning in one and two armed bandit problems produces many of the qualitative behaviors deemed suboptimal in previous studies. Our argument is supported by the results of experiments that demonstrate humans rapidly learn and exploit new reward structure. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.83832216 <a title="4-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-A_Scalable_Hierarchical_Distributed_Language_Model.html">4 nips-2008-A Scalable Hierarchical Distributed Language Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>5 0.78774315 <a title="4-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Stephen Gould, Ashutosh Saxena, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difﬁcult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classiﬁers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited “black box” interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classiﬁers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction. 1</p><p>6 0.78307354 <a title="4-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_low-dimensional_single-trial_analysis_of_neural_population_activity.html">90 nips-2008-Gaussian-process factor analysis for low-dimensional single-trial analysis of neural population activity</a></p>

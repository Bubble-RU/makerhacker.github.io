<p>Author: Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of domain adaptation with multiple sources. For each source domain, the distribution over the input points as well as a hypothesis with error at most ǫ are given. The problem consists of combining these hypotheses to derive a hypothesis with small error with respect to the target domain. We present several theoretical results relating to this problem. In particular, we prove that standard convex combinations of the source hypotheses may in fact perform very poorly and that, instead, combinations weighted by the source distributions beneﬁt from favorable theoretical guarantees. Our main result shows that, remarkably, for any ﬁxed target function, there exists a distribution weighted combining rule that has a loss of at most ǫ with respect to any target mixture of the source distributions. We further generalize the setting from a single target function to multiple consistent target functions and show the existence of a combining rule with error at most 3ǫ. Finally, we report empirical results for a multiple source adaptation problem with a real-world dataset.</p><p>3 0.10415855 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.10224235 <a title="24-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Human_Active_Learning.html">101 nips-2008-Human Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui M. Castro, Charles Kalish, Robert Nowak, Ruichen Qian, Tim Rogers, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a topic at the interface of machine learning and cognitive science. Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study comparing human category learning in active versus passive settings. 1</p><p>5 0.097326651 <a title="24-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Interpreting_the_neural_code_with_Formal_Concept_Analysis.html">109 nips-2008-Interpreting the neural code with Formal Concept Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Dominik Endres, Peter Foldiak</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel application of Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) to neural decoding: instead of just trying to ﬁgure out which stimulus was presented, we demonstrate how to explore the semantic relationships in the neural representation of large sets of stimuli. FCA provides a way of displaying and interpreting such relationships via concept lattices. We explore the effects of neural code sparsity on the lattice. We then analyze neurophysiological data from high-level visual cortical area STSa, using an exact Bayesian approach to construct the formal context needed by FCA. Prominent features of the resulting concept lattices are discussed, including hierarchical face representation and indications for a product-of-experts code in real neurons. 1</p><p>6 0.087976798 <a title="24-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Julia Owen, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The synchronous brain activity measured via MEG (or EEG) can be interpreted as arising from a collection (possibly large) of current dipoles or sources located throughout the cortex. Estimating the number, location, and orientation of these sources remains a challenging task, one that is signiﬁcantly compounded by the effects of source correlations and the presence of interference from spontaneous brain activity, sensor noise, and other artifacts. This paper derives an empirical Bayesian method for addressing each of these issues in a principled fashion. The resulting algorithm guarantees descent of a cost function uniquely designed to handle unknown orientations and arbitrary correlations. Robust interference suppression is also easily incorporated. In a restricted setting, the proposed method is shown to have theoretically zero bias estimating both the location and orientation of multi-component dipoles even in the presence of correlations, unlike a variety of existing Bayesian localization methods or common signal processing techniques such as beamforming and sLORETA. Empirical results on both simulated and real data sets verify the efﬁcacy of this approach. 1</p><p>3 0.53841472 <a title="24-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Domain_Adaptation_with_Multiple_Sources.html">65 nips-2008-Domain Adaptation with Multiple Sources</a></p>

<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efﬁciently computing pairwise (l2 , l1 ) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modiﬁes the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reﬂect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage in that it is “one-sketch-for-all.” In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efﬁciently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the χ2 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances. We recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval. 1</p><p>5 0.50600469 <a title="24-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Near-minimax_recursive_density_estimation_on_the_binary_hypercube.html">149 nips-2008-Near-minimax recursive density estimation on the binary hypercube</a></p>
<p>Author: Maxim Raginsky, Svetlana Lazebnik, Rebecca Willett, Jorge Silva</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a recursive estimation procedure for multivariate binary densities using orthogonal expansions. For d covariates, there are 2d basis coefﬁcients to estimate, which renders conventional approaches computationally prohibitive when d is large. However, for a wide class of densities that satisfy a certain sparsity condition, our estimator runs in probabilistic polynomial time and adapts to the unknown sparsity of the underlying density in two key ways: (1) it attains near-minimax mean-squared error, and (2) the computational complexity is lower for sparser densities. Our method also allows for ﬂexible control of the trade-off between mean-squared error and computational complexity.</p><p>6 0.47415128 <a title="24-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Bio-inspired_Real_Time_Sensory_Map_Realignment_in_a_Robotic_Barn_Owl.html">38 nips-2008-Bio-inspired Real Time Sensory Map Realignment in a Robotic Barn Owl</a></p>

<p>Author: Pietro Berkes, Frank Wood, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: The coding of information by neural populations depends critically on the statistical dependencies between neuronal responses. However, there is no simple model that can simultaneously account for (1) marginal distributions over single-neuron spike counts that are discrete and non-negative; and (2) joint distributions over the responses of multiple neurons that are often strongly dependent. Here, we show that both marginal and joint properties of neural responses can be captured using copula models. Copulas are joint distributions that allow random variables with arbitrary marginals to be combined while incorporating arbitrary dependencies between them. Different copulas capture different kinds of dependencies, allowing for a richer and more detailed description of dependencies than traditional summary statistics, such as correlation coefﬁcients. We explore a variety of copula models for joint neural response distributions, and derive an efﬁcient maximum likelihood procedure for estimating them. We apply these models to neuronal data collected in macaque pre-motor cortex, and quantify the improvement in coding accuracy afforded by incorporating the dependency structure between pairs of neurons. We ﬁnd that more than one third of neuron pairs shows dependency concentrated in the lower or upper tails for their ﬁring rate distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.81016392 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_human_function_learning_with_Gaussian_processes.html">138 nips-2008-Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Chris Lucas, Joseph Williams, Michael L. Kalish</p><p>Abstract: Accounts of how people learn functional relationships between continuous variables have tended to focus on two possibilities: that people are estimating explicit functions, or that they are performing associative learning supported by similarity. We provide a rational analysis of function learning, drawing on work on regression in machine learning and statistics. Using the equivalence of Bayesian linear regression and Gaussian processes, we show that learning explicit rules and using similarity can be seen as two views of one solution to this problem. We use this insight to deﬁne a Gaussian process model of human function learning that combines the strengths of both approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.80966049 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Exact_Convex_Confidence-Weighted_Learning.html">78 nips-2008-Exact Convex Confidence-Weighted Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Mark Dredze, Fernando Pereira</p><p>Abstract: Conﬁdence-weighted (CW) learning [6], an online learning method for linear classiﬁers, maintains a Gaussian distributions over weight vectors, with a covariance matrix that represents uncertainty about weights and correlations. Conﬁdence constraints ensure that a weight vector drawn from the hypothesis distribution correctly classiﬁes examples with a speciﬁed probability. Within this framework, we derive a new convex form of the constraint and analyze it in the mistake bound model. Empirical evaluation with both synthetic and text data shows our version of CW learning achieves lower cumulative and out-of-sample errors than commonly used ﬁrst-order and second-order online methods. 1</p><p>5 0.80932498 <a title="24-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Clustered_Multi-Task_Learning%3A_A_Convex_Formulation.html">47 nips-2008-Clustered Multi-Task Learning: A Convex Formulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Jacob, Jean-philippe Vert, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may beneﬁt from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classiﬁcation or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non-convex methods dedicated to the same problem. 1</p><p>6 0.80861604 <a title="24-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Partially_Observed_Maximum_Entropy_Discrimination_Markov_Networks.html">176 nips-2008-Partially Observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Networks</a></p>

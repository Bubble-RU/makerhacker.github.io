<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mark Girolami, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Identiﬁcation and comparison of nonlinear dynamical system models using noisy and sparse experimental data is a vital task in many ﬁelds, however current methods are computationally expensive and prone to error due in part to the nonlinear nature of the likelihood surfaces induced. We present an accelerated sampling procedure which enables Bayesian inference of parameters in nonlinear ordinary and delay differential equations via the novel use of Gaussian processes (GP). Our method involves GP regression over time-series data, and the resulting derivative and time delay estimates make parameter inference possible without solving the dynamical system explicitly, resulting in dramatic savings of computational time. We demonstrate the speed and statistical accuracy of our approach using examples of both ordinary and delay differential equations, and provide a comprehensive comparison with current state of the art methods. 1</p><p>3 0.15793566 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Kernel_Shaping_for_Learning_Control.html">32 nips-2008-Bayesian Kernel Shaping for Learning Control</a></p>
<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Mrinal Kalakrishnan, Sethu Vijayakumar, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: In kernel-based regression learning, optimizing each kernel individually is useful when the data density, curvature of regression surfaces (or decision boundaries) or magnitude of output noise varies spatially. Previous work has suggested gradient descent techniques or complex statistical hypothesis methods for local kernel shaping, typically requiring some amount of manual tuning of meta parameters. We introduce a Bayesian formulation of nonparametric regression that, with the help of variational approximations, results in an EM-like algorithm for simultaneous estimation of regression and kernel parameters. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, requires no sampling, automatically rejects outliers and has only one prior to be speciﬁed. It can be used for nonparametric regression with local polynomials or as a novel method to achieve nonstationary regression with Gaussian processes. Our methods are particularly useful for learning control, where reliable estimation of local tangent planes is essential for adaptive controllers and reinforcement learning. We evaluate our methods on several synthetic data sets and on an actual robot which learns a task-level control law. 1</p><p>4 0.15747927 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Load_and_Attentional_Bayes.html">124 nips-2008-Load and Attentional Bayes</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Selective attention is a most intensively studied psychological phenomenon, rife with theoretical suggestions and schisms. A critical idea is that of limited capacity, the allocation of which has produced continual conﬂict about such phenomena as early and late selection. An inﬂuential resolution of this debate is based on the notion of perceptual load (Lavie, 2005), which suggests that low-load, easy tasks, because they underuse the total capacity of attention, mandatorily lead to the processing of stimuli that are irrelevant to the current attentional set; whereas high-load, difﬁcult tasks grab all resources for themselves, leaving distractors high and dry. We argue that this theory presents a challenge to Bayesian theories of attention, and suggest an alternative, statistical, account of key supporting data. 1</p><p>5 0.1470388 <a title="146-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Local_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Real_Time_Online_Model_Learning.html">125 nips-2008-Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real Time Online Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Duy Nguyen-tuong, Jan R. Peters, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-time applications, e.g., online approximation of the inverse dynamics model for model-based robot control, requires fast online regression techniques. Inspired by local learning, we propose a method to speed up standard Gaussian process regression (GPR) with local GP models (LGP). The training data is partitioned in local regions, for each an individual GP model is trained. The prediction for a query point is performed by weighted estimation using nearby local models. Unlike other GP approximations, such as mixtures of experts, we use a distance based measure for partitioning of the data and weighted prediction. The proposed method achieves online learning and prediction in real-time. Comparisons with other non-parametric regression methods show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and ν-SVR. 1</p><p>6 0.12687033 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Hierarchical_Factor_Regression_Model.html">235 nips-2008-The Infinite Hierarchical Factor Regression Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated. We show results of the proposed methodology for synthetic data and real world applications on pollution prediction and a sensor network. 1</p><p>3 0.65697807 <a title="146-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Local_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Real_Time_Online_Model_Learning.html">125 nips-2008-Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real Time Online Model Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>6 0.5365932 <a title="146-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Bayesian_Kernel_Shaping_for_Learning_Control.html">32 nips-2008-Bayesian Kernel Shaping for Learning Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Zaïd Harchaoui, Eric Moulines, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a kernel-based method for change-point analysis within a sequence of temporal observations. Change-point analysis of an unlabelled sample of observations consists in, ﬁrst, testing whether a change in the distribution occurs within the sample, and second, if a change occurs, estimating the change-point instant after which the distribution of the observations switches from one distribution to another different distribution. We propose a test statistic based upon the maximum kernel Fisher discriminant ratio as a measure of homogeneity between segments. We derive its limiting distribution under the null hypothesis (no change occurs), and establish the consistency under the alternative hypothesis (a change occurs). This allows to build a statistical hypothesis testing procedure for testing the presence of a change-point, with a prescribed false-alarm probability and detection probability tending to one in the large-sample setting. If a change actually occurs, the test statistic also yields an estimator of the change-point location. Promising experimental results in temporal segmentation of mental tasks from BCI data and pop song indexation are presented. 1</p><p>4 0.63515323 <a title="146-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Tracking_Changing_Stimuli_in_Continuous_Attractor_Neural_Networks.html">240 nips-2008-Tracking Changing Stimuli in Continuous Attractor Neural Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: K. Wong, Si Wu, Chi Fung</p><p>Abstract: Continuous attractor neural networks (CANNs) are emerging as promising models for describing the encoding of continuous stimuli in neural systems. Due to the translational invariance of their neuronal interactions, CANNs can hold a continuous family of neutrally stable states. In this study, we systematically explore how neutral stability of a CANN facilitates its tracking performance, a capacity believed to have wide applications in brain functions. We develop a perturbative approach that utilizes the dominant movement of the network stationary states in the state space. We quantify the distortions of the bump shape during tracking, and study their effects on the tracking performance. Results are obtained on the maximum speed for a moving stimulus to be trackable, and the reaction time to catch up an abrupt change in stimulus. 1</p><p>5 0.48668537 <a title="146-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Convolved_Gaussian_Processes_for_Multi-output_Regression.html">213 nips-2008-Sparse Convolved Gaussian Processes for Multi-output Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated. We show results of the proposed methodology for synthetic data and real world applications on pollution prediction and a sensor network. 1</p><p>6 0.4839755 <a title="146-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Adaptive_Template_Matching_with_Shift-Invariant_Semi-NMF.html">16 nips-2008-Adaptive Template Matching with Shift-Invariant Semi-NMF</a></p>

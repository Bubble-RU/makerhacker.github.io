<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.24594778 <a title="204-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Short-Term_Depression_in_VLSI_Stochastic_Synapse.html">209 nips-2008-Short-Term Depression in VLSI Stochastic Synapse</a></p>
<p>Author: Peng Xu, Timothy K. Horiuchi, Pamela A. Abshire</p><p>Abstract: We report a compact realization of short-term depression (STD) in a VLSI stochastic synapse. The behavior of the circuit is based on a subtractive single release model of STD. Experimental results agree well with simulation and exhibit expected STD behavior: the transmitted spike train has negative autocorrelation and lower power spectral density at low frequencies which can remove redundancy in the input spike train, and the mean transmission probability is inversely proportional to the input spike rate which has been suggested as an automatic gain control mechanism in neural systems. The dynamic stochastic synapse could potentially be a powerful addition to existing deterministic VLSI spiking neural systems. 1</p><p>4 0.22634265 <a title="204-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Spike_Feature_Extraction_Using_Informative_Samples.html">220 nips-2008-Spike Feature Extraction Using Informative Samples</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhi Yang, Qi Zhao, Wentai Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a spike feature extraction algorithm that targets real-time spike sorting and facilitates miniaturized microchip implementation. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated on synthesized waveforms and experimentally recorded sequences. When compared with many spike sorting approaches our algorithm demonstrates improved speed, accuracy and allows unsupervised execution. A preliminary hardware implementation has been realized using an integrated microchip interfaced with a personal computer. 1</p><p>5 0.17814179 <a title="204-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Performance_analysis_for_L%5C_2_kernel_classification.html">178 nips-2008-Performance analysis for L\ 2 kernel classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Jooseuk Kim, Clayton Scott</p><p>Abstract: We provide statistical performance guarantees for a recently introduced kernel classiﬁer that optimizes the L2 or integrated squared error (ISE) of a difference of densities. The classiﬁer is similar to a support vector machine (SVM) in that it is the solution of a quadratic program and yields a sparse classiﬁer. Unlike SVMs, however, the L2 kernel classiﬁer does not involve a regularization parameter. We prove a distribution free concentration inequality for a cross-validation based estimate of the ISE, and apply this result to deduce an oracle inequality and consistency of the classiﬁer on the sense of both ISE and probability of error. Our results also specialize to give performance guarantees for an existing method of L2 kernel density estimation. 1</p><p>6 0.16862839 <a title="204-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_Short-term_Noise_Dependence_of_Spike_Counts_in_Macaque_Prefrontal_Cortex.html">137 nips-2008-Modeling Short-term Noise Dependence of Spike Counts in Macaque Prefrontal Cortex</a></p>

<p>Author: Juan Huo, Zhijun Yang, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: The visual and auditory map alignment in the Superior Colliculus (SC) of barn owl is important for its accurate localization for prey behavior. Prism learning or Blindness may interfere this alignment and cause loss of the capability of accurate prey. However, juvenile barn owl could recover its sensory map alignment by shifting its auditory map. The adaptation of this map alignment is believed based on activity dependent axon developing in Inferior Colliculus (IC). A model is built to explore this mechanism. In this model, axon growing process is instructed by an inhibitory network in SC while the strength of the inhibition adjusted by Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). We test and analyze this mechanism by application of the neural structures involved in spatial localization in a robotic system. 1</p><p>4 0.59428924 <a title="204-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jan Gasthaus, Frank Wood, Dilan Gorur, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we propose a new incremental spike sorting model that automatically eliminates refractory period violations, accounts for action potential waveform drift, and can handle “appearance” and “disappearance” of neurons. Our approach is to augment a known time-varying Dirichlet process that ties together a sequence of inﬁnite Gaussian mixture models, one per action potential waveform observation, with an interspike-interval-dependent likelihood that prohibits refractory period violations. We demonstrate this model by showing results from sorting two publicly available neural data recordings for which a partial ground truth labeling is known. 1</p><p>6 0.56590241 <a title="204-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Spike_Feature_Extraction_Using_Informative_Samples.html">220 nips-2008-Spike Feature Extraction Using Informative Samples</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshihiro Yamanishi</p><p>Abstract: We formulate the problem of bipartite graph inference as a supervised learning problem, and propose a new method to solve it from the viewpoint of distance metric learning. The method involves the learning of two mappings of the heterogeneous objects to a uniﬁed Euclidean space representing the network topology of the bipartite graph, where the graph is easy to infer. The algorithm can be formulated as an optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We report encouraging results on the problem of compound-protein interaction network reconstruction from chemical structure data and genomic sequence data. 1</p><p>3 0.72553796 <a title="204-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Automatic_online_tuning_for_fast_Gaussian_summation.html">29 nips-2008-Automatic online tuning for fast Gaussian summation</a></p>
<p>Author: Vlad I. Morariu, Balaji V. Srinivasan, Vikas C. Raykar, Ramani Duraiswami, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms require the summation of Gaussian kernel functions, an expensive operation if implemented straightforwardly. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of evaluating such sums, including tree and analysis based methods. These achieve varying speedups depending on the bandwidth, dimension, and prescribed error, making the choice between methods difﬁcult for machine learning tasks. We provide an algorithm that combines tree methods with the Improved Fast Gauss Transform (IFGT). As originally proposed the IFGT suffers from two problems: (1) the Taylor series expansion does not perform well for very low bandwidths, and (2) parameter selection is not trivial and can drastically affect performance and ease of use. We address the ﬁrst problem by employing a tree data structure, resulting in four evaluation methods whose performance varies based on the distribution of sources and targets and input parameters such as desired accuracy and bandwidth. To solve the second problem, we present an online tuning approach that results in a black box method that automatically chooses the evaluation method and its parameters to yield the best performance for the input data, desired accuracy, and bandwidth. In addition, the new IFGT parameter selection approach allows for tighter error bounds. Our approach chooses the fastest method at negligible additional cost, and has superior performance in comparisons with previous approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.64346027 <a title="204-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>5 0.63119775 <a title="204-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Local_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Real_Time_Online_Model_Learning.html">125 nips-2008-Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real Time Online Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Duy Nguyen-tuong, Jan R. Peters, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-time applications, e.g., online approximation of the inverse dynamics model for model-based robot control, requires fast online regression techniques. Inspired by local learning, we propose a method to speed up standard Gaussian process regression (GPR) with local GP models (LGP). The training data is partitioned in local regions, for each an individual GP model is trained. The prediction for a query point is performed by weighted estimation using nearby local models. Unlike other GP approximations, such as mixtures of experts, we use a distance based measure for partitioning of the data and weighted prediction. The proposed method achieves online learning and prediction in real-time. Comparisons with other non-parametric regression methods show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and ν-SVR. 1</p><p>6 0.47181958 <a title="204-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Prediction_on_a_Tree.html">84 nips-2008-Fast Prediction on a Tree</a></p>

</p><p>4 1  Introduction  Trust tasks such as the Dictator, Ultimatum and Investor-Trustee games provide an empirical basis for investigating social cooperation and reciprocity [11]. [sent-23, score-0.23]
</p><p>5 Even in completely anonymous settings, human subjects show rich patterns of behavior that can be seen in terms of such personality concepts as charity, envy and guilt. [sent-24, score-0.121]
</p><p>6 The burgeoning interaction between economic psychology and neuroscience requires formal treatments of these issues. [sent-27, score-0.084]
</p><p>7 From the perspective of neuroscience, such treatments can provide a precise quantitative window into neural structures involved in assessing utilties of outcomes, capturing risk and probabilities associated with interpersonal interactions, and imputing intentions and beliefs to others. [sent-28, score-0.233]
</p><p>8 In turn, evidence from brain responses associated with these factors should elucidate the neural algorithms of complex interpersonal choices, and thereby illuminate economic decision-making. [sent-29, score-0.108]
</p><p>9 Here, we consider a sequence of paradigmatic trust tasks that have been used to motivate a variety of behaviorally-based economic models. [sent-30, score-0.212]
</p><p>10 In brief, we provide a formalization in terms of partially observable Markov decision processes, approximating type-theoretic Bayes-Nash equilibria [8] using ﬁnite hierarchies of belief, where subjects’ private types are construed as parameters of their inequity averse utility functions [2]. [sent-31, score-0.201]
</p><p>11 The game ends if the Investor chooses the safe option; alternatively, he can pass the decision to the Trustee. [sent-38, score-0.223]
</p><p>12 The Trustee can now choose a fair option $[25,25] or choose to defect $[15,30]. [sent-39, score-0.102]
</p><p>13 In turn, she has the option of repaying any (integer) amount of her resulting allocation to the Investor. [sent-42, score-0.075]
</p><p>14 Figure 1b shows the more sophisticated game we consider, namely a multi-round, sequential, version of the Trust game [15]. [sent-45, score-0.39]
</p><p>15 The fact that even in a purely anonymized setting, Investors invest at all, and Trustees reciprocate at all in games such as that of ﬁgure 1a, is a challenge to standard, money-maximizing doctrines (which expect to ﬁnd the Nash equilibrium where neither happens), and pose a problem for modeling. [sent-46, score-0.141]
</p><p>16 One popular strategy is to retain the notion that subjects attempt to optimize their utilities, but to include in these utilities social factors that penalize cases in which opponents win either more (crudely envy, parameterized by α) or less (guilt, parameterized by β) than themselves [2]. [sent-47, score-0.155]
</p><p>17 One popular InequityAversion utility function [2] characterizes player i by the type Ti = (αi , βi ) of her utility function: U (αi , βi ) = xi − αi max{(xj − xi ), 0} − βi max{(xi − xj ), 0}  (1)  where xi , xj are the amounts received by players i and j respectively. [sent-48, score-0.494]
</p><p>18 Social utility functions such as that of equation 1 mandate probing, belief manipulation and the like. [sent-51, score-0.139]
</p><p>19 As in the standard formulation [8], players know their own types but not those of their opponents; dyads are thus playing games of incomplete information. [sent-53, score-0.343]
</p><p>20 A player also has prior beliefs about their opponent that are updated in a Bayesian manner after observing the opponent’s actions. [sent-54, score-0.492]
</p><p>21 This leads to an inﬁnite hierarchy of beliefs: what the Trustee thinks of the Investor; what the Trustee thinks the Investor thinks of him; what the Trustee thinks the Investor thinks the Trustee thinks of her; and so on. [sent-56, score-0.426]
</p><p>22 If players have common prior beliefs over the possible types in the game, and this prior is common knowledge, then (at least one) subjective equilibrium known as the Bayes-Nash Equilibrium (BNE), exists [8]. [sent-57, score-0.371]
</p><p>23 Algorithms to compute BNE solutions have been developed but, in the general case, are NP-hard [6] and thus infeasible for complex multi-round games [9]. [sent-58, score-0.097]
</p><p>24 First, a ﬁnite hierarchy of beliefs can provably approximate the equilibrium solution that arises in an inﬁnite belief hierarchy arbitrarily closely [10], an idea that has indeed been employed in practice to compute equilibria in a multi-agent setting [5]. [sent-61, score-0.417]
</p><p>25 Second, based on a whole wealth of games such as the p-Beauty game [11], it has been suggested that human subjects only employ a very restricted number of steps of strategic thinking. [sent-62, score-0.571]
</p><p>26 Higher order beliefs are required as each player’s action inﬂuences the opponent’s beliefs which in turn inﬂuence their policy. [sent-69, score-0.405]
</p><p>27 2  Partially Observable Markov Games  As in the framework of Bayesian games, player i’s inequity aversion type Ti = (αi , βi ) is known to it, but not to the opponent. [sent-70, score-0.249]
</p><p>28 Player i does have a prior distribution over the type of the other player j, (0) bi (Tj ); and, if suitably sophisticated, can also have higher-order priors over the whole hierarchy (0) (0) (0) (0) of recursive beliefs about types. [sent-71, score-0.591]
</p><p>29 We denote the collection of priors as bi = {bi , bi , bi , . [sent-72, score-0.414]
</p><p>30 (t) Play proceeds sequentially, with player i choosing action ai at time t according to the expected future value of this choice. [sent-76, score-0.313]
</p><p>31 Given the interdependence of beliefs and actions, we expect to see probing (to ﬁnd out the type and beliefs of one’s opponent) and belief manipulation (being nice now to take advantage of one’s opponent later). [sent-78, score-0.624]
</p><p>32 In order to break this, we assume that each player has k levels of strategic thinking as in the Cognitive Hierarchy framework [13]. [sent-82, score-0.452]
</p><p>33 Thus each k-level player assumes that his opponent is a k − 1-level player. [sent-83, score-0.307]
</p><p>34 At the lowest level of the recursion, the 0-level player uses a simple likelihood to update their opponent’s beliefs. [sent-84, score-0.184]
</p><p>35 (t)  (t)  (t)  The utility Ui (ai ) is calculated at every round for each player i for action ai by marginalizing (t) over the current beliefs bi . [sent-85, score-0.758]
</p><p>36 As an example, if there are only two types for a player the belief state, which is a continuous probability distribution over the interval 3  [0, 1] is discretized to take K values bi1 = 0, . [sent-88, score-0.223]
</p><p>37 One characteristic of this explicit process model, or algorithmic approach, is that it is possible to consider what happens when the priors of the players differ. [sent-93, score-0.142]
</p><p>38 We also veriﬁed our algorithm against the QRE and BNE solutions provided by GAMBIT ([14]) on a 1 and 2 round Trust game for k = 1, 2 respectively. [sent-95, score-0.248]
</p><p>39 3  Generative Model for Investor-Trustee Game  Reputation-formation plays a particularly critical role in the Investor-Trustee game, with even the most selﬁsh players trying to beneﬁt from cooperation, at least in the initial rounds. [sent-97, score-0.142]
</p><p>40 7) such that in the last round the Trustee with type βT = 0. [sent-102, score-0.083]
</p><p>41 3 will not return any amount to the Investor and will choose fair outcome if βT = 0. [sent-103, score-0.093]
</p><p>42 We generate a rich tapestry of behavior by varying the prior expectations as to βT and the values of strategic (k) level (0,1,2) for the players. [sent-105, score-0.217]
</p><p>43 3 shows the evolution of the Players’ Q-values and 1st-order beliefs of the Investor and 2nd-order beliefs of the Trustee (i. [sent-108, score-0.37]
</p><p>44 , her beliefs as to the Investor’s beliefs about her value of βT ) over the course of a single game. [sent-110, score-0.37]
</p><p>45 they are strategic players), but the Trustee is actually less guilty βT = 0. [sent-113, score-0.217]
</p><p>46 This makes the Investor’s beliefs about βT go from being uniform to being about 0. [sent-116, score-0.185]
</p><p>47 This causes the Q-value for the action corresponding to giving $20 dollars to be highest, inspiring the Investor’s generosity in round 2. [sent-121, score-0.123]
</p><p>48 Equally, the Trustee’s (2nd-order) beliefs after receiving $15 in the ﬁrst round peak for the value βT = 0. [sent-122, score-0.238]
</p><p>49 In response, in rounds 5 and 7, the Trustee tries to coax the Investor. [sent-125, score-0.098]
</p><p>50 We ﬁnd this “reciprocal give and take” to be a characteristic behaviour of strategic Investors and Trustees (with k = 1). [sent-126, score-0.262]
</p><p>51 For naive Players with k = 0, a return of a very low amount for a high amount invested would lead to a complete breakdown of Trust formation. [sent-127, score-0.182]
</p><p>52 In round 1, Investors with kI = 0 and 1 offer $20 ﬁrst (the optimal probing action based on uniform prior beliefs) and for kI = 2 offers $15 dollars. [sent-131, score-0.141]
</p><p>53 A Trustee with kT = 0 and low βT will return nothing whereas an unconditionally cooperative Trustee (high βT ) returns roughly the same amount as received. [sent-133, score-0.219]
</p><p>54 Irrespective of the Trustee’s βT type, the amount returned by strategic Trustees with kT = 1, 2 is higher (between 1. [sent-134, score-0.282]
</p><p>55 In round 2 we ﬁnd that the low amount received causes trust to break down for Investors with kI = 0. [sent-136, score-0.245]
</p><p>56 Strategic Trustees return more initially and are able to coax naive Investors to give higher amounts in the game. [sent-138, score-0.125]
</p><p>57 Generally unconditionally cooperative Trustees return more, and form Trust throughout the game if they are strategic or if they are playing against strategic Investors. [sent-139, score-0.841]
</p><p>58 Trustees with low βT defect towards the end of the game but coax more investment in the beginning of the game. [sent-140, score-0.375]
</p><p>59 4  Figure 3: The generated game shows the amount given by an Investor with kI = 1 and a Trustee with βT = 0. [sent-141, score-0.238]
</p><p>60 The red bar indicates amount given by the Investor and the blue bar is the amount returned by the Trustee (after receiving 3 times amount given by the Investor). [sent-143, score-0.205]
</p><p>61 The ﬁgures on the right reveal the inner workings of the algorithm: Q-values through the rounds of the game for 5 different actions of the Investor (0, 5, 10, 15, 20) and 5 actions of the Trustee between values 0 and 3 times amount given by Investor. [sent-144, score-0.289]
</p><p>62 Also shown are the Investor’s 1st-order beliefs (left bar for βT = 0. [sent-145, score-0.212]
</p><p>63 The top half shows Investor playing against Trustee with low βT (= 0. [sent-149, score-0.078]
</p><p>64 The top dyad shows the amount given the Investor and the bottom dyad shows the amount returned by Trustee. [sent-152, score-0.202]
</p><p>65 Within each dyad the rows represent the strategic (kI ) levels of Investor (0, 1 or 2) and the columns represent kT level of the Trustee (0, 1 or 2). [sent-153, score-0.286]
</p><p>66 Two particular examples are highlighted within the dyads: Investor with kI = 0 and Trustee with kT = 2, high low uncooperative (βT ) and Investor kI = 1 and Trustee kT = 2, cooperative (βT ). [sent-155, score-0.186]
</p><p>67 Lighter colours reveal higher amounts (with amount given by Investor in ﬁrst round being 15 dollars). [sent-156, score-0.096]
</p><p>68 The effect of strategic level is more dramatic for the Investor, since his ability to defect at any point places him in effective charge of the interaction. [sent-157, score-0.264]
</p><p>69 Strategic Investors give more money in the game than naive Investors. [sent-158, score-0.269]
</p><p>70 A further observation is that strategic Investors are more immune to the Trustee’s actions. [sent-160, score-0.217]
</p><p>71 While this means that break-downs in the game due to 5  mistakes of the Trustee (or unfortunate choices from her softmax) are more easily corrected by the strategic Investor, he is also more likely to continue investing even if the Trustee doesn’t reciprocate. [sent-161, score-0.412]
</p><p>72 The latter typically offer less in the game and are also less susceptible to the actions of their opponent. [sent-163, score-0.217]
</p><p>73 Overall in this game, the Investors with kI = 1 make the most amount of money playing against a cooperative Trustee while kI = 0 Investors make the least. [sent-164, score-0.24]
</p><p>74 The best dyad consists of a kI = 1 Investor playing with a cooperative Trustee with kT = 0 or 1. [sent-165, score-0.197]
</p><p>75 Denote the sequence of plays in the (1) (1) (10) 10-round Investor-Trustee game as D = {[a1 , a2 ], . [sent-168, score-0.195]
</p><p>76 Since the game is Markovian 2 (t) we can calculate the probability of player i taking the action sequence {ai , t = 1, . [sent-171, score-0.414]
</p><p>77 This is a (0) likelihood function for Ti , bi , and so can be used for posterior inference about type given D. [sent-175, score-0.168]
</p><p>78 We classify the players for their utility function (βT value for the Trustee), strategic (ToM) levels and (0) (0) prior beliefs using the MAP value (Ti∗ , bi ∗ ) = maxTi ,b(0) P (D|Ti , bi ). [sent-176, score-0.911]
</p><p>79 i  We used our recognition model to classify subject pairs playing the 10-round Investor-Trustee game [15]. [sent-177, score-0.282]
</p><p>80 The data included 48 student pairs playing an Impersonal task for which the opponents’ identities were hidden and 54 student pairs playing a Personal task for which partners met. [sent-178, score-0.158]
</p><p>81 Each Investor-Trustee pair was classiﬁed for their level of strategic thinking k and the Trustee’s βT type (cooperative/uncooperative; see the table in Figure 5). [sent-179, score-0.276]
</p><p>82 The highlighted interactions reveal that many of the pairs in the Impersonal task consisted of strategic Investors and cooperative Trustees, who formed trust in the game with the levels of investment decreasing towards the end of the game. [sent-181, score-0.721]
</p><p>83 We also highlight the difference between strategic and non-strategic Investors. [sent-182, score-0.217]
</p><p>84 An Investor with kI = 0 will not form trust if the Trustee does not return a signiﬁcant amount initially whilst an Investor with kI = 2 will continue offering money in the game even if the Trustee gives back less than fair amounts in return. [sent-183, score-0.463]
</p><p>85 To test the robustness of the recognition model low we generated behaviours (450 dyads) with different values of βT (βT = [0, 0. [sent-188, score-0.086]
</p><p>86 Figure 5 shows how conﬁdently players of the given type were classiﬁed to have that type. [sent-198, score-0.172]
</p><p>87 This is because the Trustees with those characteristics will offer high amounts to coax the Investor. [sent-200, score-0.093]
</p><p>88 The number of subject-pairs with the classiﬁcation are shown in each entry high low along with whether the Trustee was classiﬁed as uncooperative / cooperative (βT , βT ). [sent-204, score-0.161]
</p><p>89 The subjects play an Impersonal game where they do not know the identities of the opponent and a Personal game where identities are revealed. [sent-205, score-0.643]
</p><p>90 We also show the classiﬁcation conﬁdence for the types given the behaviour was generated from our model with other values of βT for the Trustee, as well as the type that the player is most likely to be classiﬁed as in brackets. [sent-207, score-0.259]
</p><p>91 (A Trustee with low βT and kT = 1 is very likely to be misclassiﬁed as a player with kT = 2, while a player with kT = 2 will mostly be classiﬁed with kT = 2)  5  Discussion  We built a generative model that captures classes of observed behavior in multi-round trust tasks. [sent-208, score-0.54]
</p><p>92 We also do not suggest a normative rationale for pieces of the model such as the social utility function. [sent-211, score-0.115]
</p><p>93 Nevertheless, the separation between the vagaries of utility and the exactness of inference is attractive, not the least by providing clearly distinct signals as to the inner workings of the algorithm that can be extremely useful to capture neural ﬁndings. [sent-212, score-0.093]
</p><p>94 For instance, we postulate that higher activation will be observed in regions of the brain associated with theory of mind for Investors that give more in the game, and for Trustees that can coax more. [sent-216, score-0.071]
</p><p>95 However, unlike [13] our Naive players still build models, albeit unsophisticated ones, of the other player (in contrast to level 0 players who assume the opponent to play a random strategy). [sent-217, score-0.613]
</p><p>96 So this might lead to an investigation of how sophisticated and naive theory of mind models are built by subjects in the game. [sent-218, score-0.089]
</p><p>97 We need to incorporate some of the other parameters of our model, such as the Investor’s envy and the temperature parameter of the softmax distribution in order to capture the nuances in the interactions. [sent-221, score-0.073]
</p><p>98 7  Finally, this computational model provides a guide for designing experiments to probe aspects of social utility, strategic thinking levels and prior beliefs, as well as inviting ready extensions to related tasks such as Public Goods games. [sent-223, score-0.314]

<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex.

In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. 1</p><p>4 0.053281054 <a title="33-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Daniel Acuna, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: We use graphical models and structure learning to explore how people learn policies in sequential decision making tasks. Studies of sequential decision-making in humans frequently ﬁnd suboptimal performance relative to an ideal actor that knows the graph model that generates reward in the environment. We argue that the learning problem humans face also involves learning the graph structure for reward generation in the environment. We formulate the structure learning problem using mixtures of reward models, and solve the optimal action selection problem using Bayesian Reinforcement Learning. We show that structure learning in one and two armed bandit problems produces many of the qualitative behaviors deemed suboptimal in previous studies. Our argument is supported by the results of experiments that demonstrate humans rapidly learn and exploit new reward structure. 1</p><p>6 0.048789192 <a title="33-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>

<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex. In experiments, we demonstrate efﬁcient ﬁltering in a range of multi-agent domains. 1</p><p>3 0.53642321 <a title="33-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Psychiatry%3A_Insights_into_depression_through_normative_decision-making_models.html">187 nips-2008-Psychiatry: Insights into depression through normative decision-making models</a></p>
<p>Author: Quentin J. Huys, Joshua Vogelstein, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Decision making lies at the very heart of many psychiatric diseases. It is also a central theoretical concern in a wide variety of ﬁelds and has undergone detailed, in-depth, analyses. We take as an example Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), applying insights from a Bayesian reinforcement learning framework. We focus on anhedonia and helplessness. Helplessness—a core element in the conceptualizations of MDD that has lead to major advances in its treatment, pharmacological and neurobiological understanding—is formalized as a simple prior over the outcome entropy of actions in uncertain environments. Anhedonia, which is an equally fundamental aspect of the disease, is related to the effective reward size. These formulations allow for the design of speciﬁc tasks to measure anhedonia and helplessness behaviorally. We show that these behavioral measures capture explicit, questionnaire-based cognitions. We also provide evidence that these tasks may allow classiﬁcation of subjects into healthy and MDD groups based purely on a behavioural measure and avoiding any verbal reports. There are strong ties between decision making and psychiatry, with maladaptive decisions and behaviors being very prominent in people with psychiatric disorders. Depression is classically seen as following life events such as divorces and job losses. Longitudinal studies, however, have revealed that a signiﬁcant fraction of the stressors associated with depression do in fact follow MDD onset, and that they are likely due to maladaptive behaviors prominent in MDD (Kendler et al., 1999). Clinically effective ’talking’ therapies for MDD such as cognitive and dialectical behavior therapies (DeRubeis et al., 1999; Bortolotti et al., 2008; Gotlib and Hammen, 2002; Power, 2005) explicitly concentrate on altering patients’ maladaptive behaviors and decision making processes. Decision making is a promising avenue into psychiatry for at least two more reasons. First, it offers powerful analytical tools. Control problems related to decision making are prevalent in a huge diversity of ﬁelds, ranging from ecology to economics, computer science and engineering. These ﬁelds have produced well-founded and thoroughly characterized frameworks within which many issues in decision making can be framed. Here, we will focus on framing issues identiﬁed in psychiatric settings within a normative decision making framework. Its second major strength comes from its relationship to neurobiology, and particularly those neuromodulatory systems which are powerfully affected by all major clinically effective pharmacotherapies in psychiatry. The understanding of these systems has beneﬁted signiﬁcantly from theoretical accounts of optimal control such as reinforcement learning (Montague et al., 1996; Kapur and Remington, 1996; Smith et al., 1999; Yu and Dayan, 2005; Dayan and Yu, 2006). Such accounts may be useful to identify in more speciﬁc terms the roles of the neuromodulators in psychiatry (Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008; Dayan and Huys, 2008). ∗ qhuys@cantab.net, joshuav@jhu.edu, dayan@gatsby.ucl.ac.uk; www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/∼qhuys/pub.html 1 Master Yoked Control Figure 1: The learned helplessness (LH) paradigm. Three sets of rats are used in a sequence of two tasks. In the ﬁrst task, rats are exposed to escapable or inescapable shocks. Shocks come on at random times. The master rat is given escapable shocks: it can switch off the shock by performing an action, usually turning a wheel mounted in front of it. The yoked rat is exposed to precisely the same shocks as the master rat, i.e its shocks are terminated when the master rat terminates the shock. Thus its shocks are inescapable, there is nothing it can do itself to terminate them. A third set of rats is not exposed to shocks. Then, all three sets of rats are exposed to a shuttlebox escape task. Shocks again come on at random times, and rats have to shuttle to the other side of the box to terminate the shock. Only yoked rats fail to acquire the escape response. Yoked rats generally fail to acquire a wide variety of instrumental behaviours, either determined by reward or, as here, by punishment contingencies. This paper represents an initial attempt at validating this approach experimentally. We will frame core notions of MDD in a reinforcement learning framework and use it to design behavioral decision making experiments. More speciﬁcally, we will concentrate on two concepts central to current thinking about MDD: anhedonia and learned helplessness (LH, Maier and Seligman 1976; Maier and Watkins 2005). We formulate helplessness parametrically as prior beliefs on aspects of decision trees, and anhedonia as the effective reward size. This allows us to use choice behavior to infer the degree to which subjects’ behavioral choices are characterized by either of these. For validation, we correlate the parameters inferred from subjects’ behavior with standard, questionnaire-based measures of hopelessness and anhedonia, and ﬁnally use the inferred parameters alone to attempt to recover the diagnostic classiﬁcation. 1 Core concepts: helplessness and anhedonia The basic LH paradigm is explained in ﬁgure 1. Its importance is manifold: the effect of inescapable shock on subsequent learning is sensitive to most classes of clinically effective antidepressants; it has arguably been a motivation framework for the development of the main talking therapies for depression (cognitive behavioural therapy, Williams (1992), it has motivated the development of further, yet more speciﬁc animal models (Willner, 1997), and it has been the basis of very speciﬁc research into the cognitive basis of depression (Peterson et al., 1993). Behavioral control is the central concept in LH: yoked and master rat do not differ in terms of the amount of shock (stress) they have experienced, only in terms of the behavioural control over it. It is not a standard notion in reinforcement learning, and there are several ways one could translate the concept into RL terms. At a simple level, there is intuitively more behavioural control if, when repeating one action, the same outcome occurs again and again, than if this were not true. Thus, at a very ﬁrst level, control might be related to the outcome entropy of actions (see Maier and Seligman 1976 for an early formulation). Of course, this is too simple. If all available actions deterministically led to the same outcome, the agent has very little control. Finally, if one were able to achieve all outcomes except for the one one cares about (in the rats’ case switching off or avoiding the shock), we would again not say that there is much control (see Huys (2007); Huys and Dayan (2007) for a more detailed discussion). Despite its obvious limitations, we will here concentrate on the simplest notion for reasons of mathematical expediency. 2 0.6 0.5 Exploration vs Exploitation Predictive Distributions Q(aknown)−Q(aunknown) P(reward a known ) 0.7 2 0 1 2 3 4 5 0.4 0.3 0.2 Choose blue slot machine 0.5 0 −0.5 0.1 0 1 1 2 3 4 5 Reward −1 Choose orange slot machine 1 High control Low control 2 3 4 5 Tree depth Figure 2: Effect of γ on predictions, Q-values and exploration behaviour. Assume a slot machine (blue) has been chosen ﬁve times, with possible rewards 1-5, and that reward 2 has been obtained twice, and reward 4 three times (inset in left panel). Left: Predictive distribution for a prior with negative γ (low control) in light gray, and large γ (extensive control) in dark gray. We see that, if the agent believes he has much control (and outcome distributions have low entropy), the predictive distribution puts all mass on the observations. Right: Assume now the agent gets up to 5 more pulls (tree depth 1-5) between the blue slot machine and a new, orange slot machine. The orange slot machine’s predictive distribution is ﬂat as it has never been tried, and its expected value is therefore 3. The plot shows the difference between the values for the two slot machines. First consider the agent only has one more pull to take. In this case, independently of the priors about control, the agent will choose the blue machine, because it is just slightly better than average. Note though that the difference is more pronounced if the agent has a high control prior. But things change if the agent has two or more choices. Now, it is worth trying out the new machine if the agent has a high-control prior. For in that case, if the new machine turns out to yield a large reward on the ﬁrst try, it is likely to do so again for the second and subsequent times. Thus, the prior about control determines the exploration bonus. The second central concept in current conceptions of MDD is that of reward sensitivity. Anhedonia, an inability to enjoy previously enjoyable things, is one of two symptoms necessary for the diagnosis of depression (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). A number of tasks in the literature have attempted to measure reward sensitivity behaviourally. While these generally concur in ﬁnding decreased reward sensitivity in subjects with MDD, these results need further clariﬁcation. Some studies show interactions between reward and punishment sensitivities with respect to MDD, but important aspects of the tasks are not clearly understood. For instance, Henriques et al. (1994); Henriques and Davidson (2000) show decreased resonsiveness of MDD subjects to rewards, but equally show decreased resonsiveness of healthy subjects to punishments. Pizzagalli et al. (2005) introduced an asymmetrically rewarded perceptual discrimination task and show that the rate of change of the response bias is anticorrelated with subjects’ anhedonic symptoms. Exactly how decreased reward responsivity can account for this is at pressent not clear. Great care has to be taken to disentangle these two concepts. Anhedonia and helplessness both provide good reasons for not taking an action: either because the reinforcements associated with the action are insufﬁcient (anhedonia), or because the outcome is not judged a likely result of taking some particular action (if actions are thought to have large outcome entropy). 2 A Bayesian formulation of control We consider a scenario where subjects have no knowledge of the outcome distributions of actions, but rather learn about them. This means that their prior beliefs about the outcome distributions are not overwhelmed by the likelihood of observations, and may thus have measurable effects on their action choices. In terms of RL, this means that agents do not know the decision tree of the problem they face. Control is formulated as a prior distribution on the outcome distributions, and thereby as a prior distribution on the decision trees. The concentration parameter α of a Dirichlet process can very simply parametrise entropy, and, if used as a prior, allow for very efﬁcient updates of the predictive distributions of actions. Let us assume we have actions A which have as outcomes rewards R, and keep count Nt (r, a) = 3 k:k < 0. Here, we included a regressor for the AGE as that was a confounding variable in our subject sample. Furthermore, if it is true that anhedonia, as expressed by the questionnaire, relates to reward sensitivity speciﬁcally, we should be able to write a similar regression for the learning rate ǫ (from equation 5) ǫ(BDIa, AGE) = θǫ BDIa + cǫ AGE + ζǫ but ﬁnd that θǫ is not different from zero. Figure 4 shows the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations) and conﬁrms that people who express higher levels of anhedonia do indeed show less reward sensitivity, but do not differ in terms of learning rate. If it were the case that subjects with higher BDIa score were just less attentive to the task, one might also expect an effect of BDIa on learning rate. 3.2 Control Validation: The control task is new, and we ﬁrst need to ascertain that subjects were indeed sensitive to main features of the task. We thus ﬁt both a RW-learning rule (as in the previous section, but adjusted for the varying number of available actions), and the full control model. Importantly, both these models have two parameters, but only the full control model has a notion of outcome entropy, and evaluations a tree. The chance probability of subjects’ actions was 0.37, meaning that, on average, there were just under three machines on the screen. The probability of the actions under the RW-learning rule was better at 0.48, and that of the full control model 0.54. These differences are highly signiﬁcant as the total number of choices is 29600. Thus, we conclude that subjects were indeed sensitive to the manipulation of outcome entropy, and that they did look ahead in a tree. Prior belief about control: Applying the procedure from the previous task to the main task, we write the main parameters of equations 2 and 4 as functions of the questionnaire measures and infer linear parameters: γ1 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ1 BHS + θγ1 BDIa + cγ1 AGE + ζγ1 γ2 (BDIa, BHS, age) = χγ2 BHS + θγ2 BDIa + cγ2 AGE + ζγ2 β(BDIa, BHS, age) = χβ BHS + θβ BDIa + cβ AGE + ζβ Importantly, because the BDIa scores and the BHS scores are correlated in our sample (they tend to be large for the subjects with MDD), we include the cross-terms (θγ1 , θγ2 , χγ ), as we are interested in the speciﬁc effects of BDIa on β, as before, and of BHS on γ. 6 3 control γ 2 Figure 6: Classiﬁcation. Controls are shown as black dots, and depressed subjects as red crosses. The blue line is a linear classiﬁer. Thus, the patients and controls can be approximately classiﬁed purely on the basis of behaviour. 1 0 83% correct 69% sensitivity 94% specificity −1 −2 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 reward sensitivity β We here infer and display two separate values γ1 and γ2 . These correspond to the level of control in the ﬁrst and the second half of the experiment. In fact, to parallel the LH experiments better, the slot machines in the ﬁrst 50 rooms were actually very noisy (low true γ), which means that subjects were here exposed to low levels of control just like the yoked rats in the original experiment. In the second half of the experiment on the other hand, slot machines tended to be quite reliable (high true γ). Figure 5 shows again the ML values for the parameters of interest (emphasized in blue in the equations). Again, we ﬁnd that our parameter estimate are very signiﬁcantly different from zero (> three standard deviations). The effect of the BHS score on the prior beliefs about control γ is much stronger in the second half than of the experiment in the ﬁrst half, i.e. the effect of BHS on the prior belief about control is particularly prominent when subjects are in a high-control environment and have previously been exposed to a low-control environment. This is an interesting parallel to the learned helplessness experiments in animals. 3.3 Classiﬁcation Finally we combine the two tasks. We integrate out the learning rate ǫ, which we had found not be related to the questionnaire measures (c.f. ﬁgure 4), and use the distribution over β from the ﬁrst task as a prior distribution on β for the second task. We also put weak priors on γ and infer both β and γ for the second task on a subject-by-subject basis. Figure 6 shows the posterior values for γ and β for MDD and healthy subjects and the ability of a linear classiﬁer to classify them. 4 Discussion In this paper, we have attempted to provide a speciﬁc formulation of core psychiatric concepts in reinforcement learning terms, i.e. hopelessness as a prior belief about controllability, and anhedonia as reward sensitivity. We have brieﬂy explained how we expect these formulations to have effect in a behavioural situation, have presented a behavioral task explicitly designed to be sensitive to our formulations, and shown that people’s verbal expression of hopelessness and anhedonia do have speciﬁc behavioral impacts. Subjects who express anhedonia display insensitivity to rewards and those expressing hopelessness behave as if they had prior beliefs that outcome distributions of actions (slot machines) are very broad. Finally, we have shown that these purely behavioural measures are also predictive of their psychiatric status, in that we were able to classify patients and healthy controls purely on the basis of performance. Several aspects of this work are novel. There have been previous attempts to map aspects of psychiatric dysfunction onto speciﬁc parametrizations (Cohen et al., 1996; Smith et al., 2004; Williams and Dayan, 2005; Moutoussis et al., 2008), but we believe that our work represents the ﬁrst attempt to a) apply it to MDD; b) make formal predictions about subject behavior c) present strong evidence linking anhedonia speciﬁcally to reward insensitivity across two tasks d) combine tasks to tease helplessness and anhedonia apart and e) to use the behavioral inferences for classiﬁcation. The latter point is particularly important, as it will determine any potential clinical signiﬁcance (Veiel, 1997). In the future, rather than cross-validating with respect to say DSM-IV criteria, it may also be important to validate measures such as ours in their own right in longitudinal studies. 7 Several important caveats do remain. First, the populations are not fully matched for age. We included age as an additional regressor and found all results to be robust. Secondly, only the healthy subjects were remunerated. However, repeating the analyses presented using only the MDD subjects yields the same results (data not shown). Thirdly, we have not yet fully mirrored the LH experiments. We have so far only tested the transfer from a low-control environment to a high-control environment. To make statements like those in animal learned helplessness experiments, the transfer from high-control to low-control environments will need to be examined, too. Fourth, the notion of control we have used is very simple, and more complex notions should certainly be tested (see Dayan and Huys 2008). Fifth, and maybe most importantly, we have so far only attempted to classify MDD and healthy subjects, and can thus not yet make any statements about the speciﬁcity of these effects with respect to MDD. Finally, it will be important to replicate these results independently, and possibly in a different modality. Nevertheless, we believe these results to be very encouraging.

<p>Author: Erik Talvitie, Satinder P. Singh</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel mathematical formalism for the idea of a “local model” of an uncontrolled dynamical system, a model that makes only certain predictions in only certain situations. As a result of its restricted responsibilities, a local model may be far simpler than a complete model of the system. We then show how one might combine several local models to produce a more detailed model. We demonstrate our ability to learn a collection of local models on a large-scale example and do a preliminary empirical comparison of learning a collection of local models and some other model learning methods. 1</p><p>5 0.40836608 <a title="33-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Skill_Characterization_Based_on_Betweenness.html">212 nips-2008-Skill Characterization Based on Betweenness</a></p>
<p>Author: Ozgur Simsek, Andre S. Barreto</p><p>Abstract: We present a characterization of a useful class of skills based on a graphical representation of an agent’s interaction with its environment. Our characterization uses betweenness, a measure of centrality on graphs. It captures and generalizes (at least intuitively) the bottleneck concept, which has inspired many of the existing skill-discovery algorithms. Our characterization may be used directly to form a set of skills suitable for a given task. More importantly, it serves as a useful guide for developing incremental skill-discovery algorithms that do not rely on knowing or representing the interaction graph in its entirety. 1</p><p>6 0.39990363 <a title="33-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_a_discriminative_hidden_part_model_for_human_action_recognition.html">119 nips-2008-Learning a discriminative hidden part model for human action recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Debajyoti Ray, Brooks King-casas, P. R. Montague, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Classical game theoretic approaches that make strong rationality assumptions have difﬁculty modeling human behaviour in economic games. We investigate the role of ﬁnite levels of iterated reasoning and non-selﬁsh utility functions in a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process model that incorporates game theoretic notions of interactivity. Our generative model captures a broad class of characteristic behaviours in a multi-round Investor-Trustee game. We invert the generative process for a recognition model that is used to classify 200 subjects playing this game against randomly matched opponents. 1</p><p>2 0.61247218 <a title="33-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Probabilistic_detection_of_short_events%2C_with_application_to_critical_care_monitoring.html">186 nips-2008-Probabilistic detection of short events, with application to critical care monitoring</a></p>
<p>Author: Norm Aleks, Stuart Russell, Michael G. Madden, Diane Morabito, Kristan Staudenmayer, Mitchell Cohen, Geoffrey T. Manley</p><p>Abstract: We describe an application of probabilistic modeling and inference technology to the problem of analyzing sensor data in the setting of an intensive care unit (ICU). In particular, we consider the arterial-line blood pressure sensor, which is subject to frequent data artifacts that cause false alarms in the ICU and make the raw data almost useless for automated decision making. The problem is complicated by the fact that the sensor data are averaged over ﬁxed intervals whereas the events causing data artifacts may occur at any time and often have durations signiﬁcantly shorter than the data collection interval. We show that careful modeling of the sensor, combined with a general technique for detecting sub-interval events and estimating their duration, enables detection of artifacts and accurate estimation of the underlying blood pressure values. Our model’s performance identifying artifacts is superior to two other classiﬁers’ and about as good as a physician’s. 1</p><p>3 0.56908309 <a title="33-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Hierarchical_Fisher_Kernels_for_Longitudinal_Data.html">97 nips-2008-Hierarchical Fisher Kernels for Longitudinal Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Jeffrey Kaye, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: We develop new techniques for time series classiﬁcation based on hierarchical Bayesian generative models (called mixed-effect models) and the Fisher kernel derived from them. A key advantage of the new formulation is that one can compute the Fisher information matrix despite varying sequence lengths and varying sampling intervals. This avoids the commonly-used ad hoc replacement of the Fisher information matrix with the identity which destroys the geometric invariance of the kernel. Our construction retains the geometric invariance, resulting in a kernel that is properly invariant under change of coordinates in the model parameter space. Experiments on detecting cognitive decline show that classiﬁers based on the proposed kernel out-perform those based on generative models and other feature extraction routines, and on Fisher kernels that use the identity in place of the Fisher information.</p><p>4 0.42141515 <a title="33-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Human_Active_Learning.html">101 nips-2008-Human Active Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Rui M. Castro, Charles Kalish, Robert Nowak, Ruichen Qian, Tim Rogers, Xiaojin Zhu</p><p>Abstract: We investigate a topic at the interface of machine learning and cognitive science. Human active learning, where learners can actively query the world for information, is contrasted with passive learning from random examples. Furthermore, we compare human active learning performance with predictions from statistical learning theory. We conduct a series of human category learning experiments inspired by a machine learning task for which active and passive learning error bounds are well understood, and dramatically distinct. Our results indicate that humans are capable of actively selecting informative queries, and in doing so learn better and faster than if they are given random training data, as predicted by learning theory. However, the improvement over passive learning is not as dramatic as that achieved by machine active learning algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst quantitative study comparing human category learning in active versus passive settings. 1</p><p>5 0.31398222 <a title="33-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Structure_Learning_in_Human_Sequential_Decision-Making.html">223 nips-2008-Structure Learning in Human Sequential Decision-Making</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Acuna, Paul R. Schrater</p><p>Abstract: We use graphical models and structure learning to explore how people learn policies in sequential decision making tasks. Studies of sequential decision-making in humans frequently ﬁnd suboptimal performance relative to an ideal actor that knows the graph model that generates reward in the environment. We argue that the learning problem humans face also involves learning the graph structure for reward generation in the environment. We formulate the structure learning problem using mixtures of reward models, and solve the optimal action selection problem using Bayesian Reinforcement Learning. We show that structure learning in one and two armed bandit problems produces many of the qualitative behaviors deemed suboptimal in previous studies. Our argument is supported by the results of experiments that demonstrate humans rapidly learn and exploit new reward structure. 1</p><p>6 0.3130284 <a title="33-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>

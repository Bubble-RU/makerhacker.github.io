<p>Author: Liu Yang, Rong Jin, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption is exploited by most semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, if the unlabeled data is merely weakly related to the target classes, it becomes questionable whether driving the decision boundary to the low density regions of the unlabeled data will help the classiﬁcation. In such case, the cluster assumption may not be valid; and consequently how to leverage this type of unlabeled data to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy becomes a challenge. We introduce “Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data” (SSLW), an inductive method that builds upon the maximum-margin approach, towards a better usage of weakly-related unlabeled information. Although the SSLW could improve a wide range of classiﬁcation tasks, in this paper, we focus on text categorization with a small training pool. The key assumption behind this work is that, even with different topics, the word usage patterns across different corpora tends to be consistent. To this end, SSLW estimates the optimal wordcorrelation matrix that is consistent with both the co-occurrence information derived from the weakly-related unlabeled documents and the labeled documents. For empirical evaluation, we present a direct comparison with a number of stateof-the-art methods for inductive semi-supervised learning and text categorization. We show that SSLW results in a signiﬁcant improvement in categorization accuracy, equipped with a small training set and an unlabeled resource that is weakly related to the test domain.</p><p>3 0.17521323 <a title="245-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>4 0.17275232 <a title="245-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Look_Ma%2C_No_Hands%3A_Analyzing_the_Monotonic_Feature_Abstraction_for_Text_Classification.html">128 nips-2008-Look Ma, No Hands: Analyzing the Monotonic Feature Abstraction for Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Doug Downey, Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Is accurate classiﬁcation possible in the absence of hand-labeled data? This paper introduces the Monotonic Feature (MF) abstraction—where the probability of class membership increases monotonically with the MF’s value. The paper proves that when an MF is given, PAC learning is possible with no hand-labeled data under certain assumptions. We argue that MFs arise naturally in a broad range of textual classiﬁcation applications. On the classic “20 Newsgroups” data set, a learner given an MF and unlabeled data achieves classiﬁcation accuracy equal to that of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learner relying on 160 hand-labeled examples. Even when MFs are not given as input, their presence or absence can be determined from a small amount of hand-labeled data, which yields a new semi-supervised learning method that reduces error by 15% on the 20 Newsgroups data. 1</p><p>5 0.15104237 <a title="245-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Generative_and_Discriminative_Learning_with_Unknown_Labeling_Bias.html">91 nips-2008-Generative and Discriminative Learning with Unknown Labeling Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Steven J. Phillips, Miroslav Dudík</p><p>Abstract: We apply robust Bayesian decision theory to improve both generative and discriminative learners under bias in class proportions in labeled training data, when the true class proportions are unknown. For the generative case, we derive an entropybased weighting that maximizes expected log likelihood under the worst-case true class proportions. For the discriminative case, we derive a multinomial logistic model that minimizes worst-case conditional log loss. We apply our theory to the modeling of species geographic distributions from presence data, an extreme case of labeling bias since there is no absence data. On a benchmark dataset, we ﬁnd that entropy-based weighting offers an improvement over constant estimates of class proportions, consistently reducing log loss on unbiased test data. 1</p><p>6 0.14404976 <a title="245-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Level_Active_Prediction_of_Useful_Image_Annotations_for_Recognition.html">142 nips-2008-Multi-Level Active Prediction of Useful Image Annotations for Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Massih Amini, Nicolas Usunier, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We propose two transductive bounds on the risk of majority votes that are estimated over partially labeled training sets. The ﬁrst one involves the margin distribution of the classiﬁer and a risk bound on its associate Gibbs classiﬁer. The bound is tight when so is the Gibbs’s bound and when the errors of the majority vote classiﬁer is concentrated on a zone of low margin. In semi-supervised learning, considering the margin as an indicator of conﬁdence constitutes the working hypothesis of algorithms which search the decision boundary on low density regions. Following this assumption, we propose to bound the error probability of the voted classiﬁer on the examples for whose margins are above a ﬁxed threshold. As an application, we propose a self-learning algorithm which iteratively assigns pseudo-labels to the set of unlabeled training examples that have their margin above a threshold obtained from this bound. Empirical results on different datasets show the effectiveness of our approach compared to the same algorithm and the TSVM in which the threshold is ﬁxed manually. 1</p><p>3 0.76856488 <a title="245-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Look_Ma%2C_No_Hands%3A_Analyzing_the_Monotonic_Feature_Abstraction_for_Text_Classification.html">128 nips-2008-Look Ma, No Hands: Analyzing the Monotonic Feature Abstraction for Text Classification</a></p>

Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Working memory is a central topic of cognitive neuroscience because it is critical for solving real-world problems in which information from multiple temporally distant sources must be combined to generate appropriate behavior. However, an often neglected fact is that learning to use working memory effectively is itself a difficult problem. The Gating framework [14] is a collection of psychological models that show how dopamine can train the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex to form useful working memory representations in certain types of problems. We unite Gating with machine learning theory concerning the general problem of memory-based optimal control [5-6]. We present a normative model that learns, by online temporal difference methods, to use working memory to maximize discounted future reward in partially observable settings. The model successfully solves a benchmark working memory problem, and exhibits limitations similar to those observed in humans. Our purpose is to introduce a concise, normative definition of high level cognitive concepts such as working memory and cognitive control in terms of maximizing discounted future rewards. 1 I n t ro d u c t i o n Working memory is loosely defined in cognitive neuroscience as information that is (1) internally maintained on a temporary or short term basis, and (2) required for tasks in which immediate observations cannot be mapped to correct actions. It is widely assumed that prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays a role in maintaining and updating working memory. However, relatively little is known about how PFC develops useful working memory representations for a new task. Furthermore, current work focuses on describing the structure and limitations of working memory, but does not ask why, or in what general class of tasks, is it necessary. Borrowing from the theory of optimal control in partially observable Markov decision problems (POMDPs), we frame the psychological concept of working memory as an internal state representation, developed and employed to maximize future reward in partially observable environments. We combine computational insights from POMDPs and neurobiologically plausible models from cognitive neuroscience to suggest a simple reinforcement learning (RL) model of working memory function that can be implemented through dopaminergic training of the basal ganglia and PFC. The Gating framework is a series of cognitive neuroscience models developed to explain how dopaminergic RL signals can shape useful working memory representations [1-4]. Computationally this framework models working memory as a collection of past observations, each of which can occasionally be replaced with the current observation, and addresses the problem of learning when to update each memory element versus maintaining it. In the original Gating model [1-2] the PFC contained a unitary working memory representation that was updated whenever a phasic dopamine (DA) burst occurred (e.g., due to unexpected reward or novelty). That model was the first to connect working memory and RL via the temporal difference (TD) model of DA firing [7-8], and thus to suggest how working memory might serve a normative purpose. However, that model had limited computational flexibility due to the unitary nature of the working memory (i.e., a singleobservation memory controlled by a scalar DA signal). More recent work [3-4] has partially repositioned the Gating framework within the Actor/Critic model of mesostriatal RL [9-10], positing memory updating as but another cortical action controlled by the dorsal striatal</p><p>3 0.70130944 <a title="245-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae-kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: We present a new co-clustering problem of images and visual features. The problem involves a set of non-object images in addition to a set of object images and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of object images from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of object images and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classiﬁers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classiﬁer is an aggregation of weak-learners, i.e. simple visual features. The obtained classiﬁers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit multimodalities, e.g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classiﬁers in object detection tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.69284093 <a title="245-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-From_Online_to_Batch_Learning_with_Cutoff-Averaging.html">88 nips-2008-From Online to Batch Learning with Cutoff-Averaging</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel</p><p>Abstract: We present cutoff averaging, a technique for converting any conservative online learning algorithm into a batch learning algorithm. Most online-to-batch conversion techniques work well with certain types of online learning algorithms and not with others, whereas cutoff averaging explicitly tries to adapt to the characteristics of the online algorithm being converted. An attractive property of our technique is that it preserves the efﬁciency of the original online algorithm, making it appropriate for large-scale learning problems. We provide a statistical analysis of our technique and back our theoretical claims with experimental results. 1</p><p>5 0.68933201 <a title="245-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.68541265 <a title="245-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Linear_Classification_and_Selective_Sampling_Under_Low_Noise_Conditions.html">123 nips-2008-Linear Classification and Selective Sampling Under Low Noise Conditions</a></p>

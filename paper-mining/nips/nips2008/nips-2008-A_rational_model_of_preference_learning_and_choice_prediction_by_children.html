</p><p>4 We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. [sent-13, score-0.748]
</p><p>5 1  Introduction  Economists and computer scientists are often concerned with inferring people’s preferences from their choices, developing econometric methods (e. [sent-15, score-0.638]
</p><p>6 However, identifying the preferences of others is also a key part of social cognitive development, allowing children to understand how people act and what they want. [sent-20, score-1.038]
</p><p>7 Young children are thus often in the position of economists or computer scientists, trying to infer the nebulous preferences of the people around them from the choices they make. [sent-21, score-1.224]
</p><p>8 In this paper, we explore whether the inferences that children draw about preferences can be explained within the same kind of formalism as that used in economics and computer science, testing the hypothesis that children are making rational inferences from the limited data available to them. [sent-22, score-1.932]
</p><p>9 Before about 18 months of age, children seem to assume that everyone likes the same things as themselves, having difﬁculty understanding the subjective nature of preferences (e. [sent-23, score-0.97]
</p><p>10 However, shortly after coming to recognize that different agents can maintain different preferences, children demonstrate a remarkably sophisticated ability to draw conclusions about the preferences of others from their behavior. [sent-26, score-1.043]
</p><p>11 This literature in developmental psychology is paralleled by work in econometrics on statistical models for inferring preferences from choices. [sent-28, score-0.779]
</p><p>12 By observing the choices people make, we can recover their utilities by applying statistical inference, providing a simple rational standard against which the inferences of children can be compared. [sent-31, score-1.043]
</p><p>13 These models combine information across agents to make inferences about the properties or value of different options. [sent-35, score-0.268]
</p><p>14 Our contribution in this paper is to bring together these different threads of research to develop rational models of children’s inferences about preferences. [sent-36, score-0.327]
</p><p>15 Section 2 summarizes developmental work on children’s inferences about preferences. [sent-37, score-0.284]
</p><p>16 Section 3 outlines the basic idea behind rational choice models, drawing on previous work in economics and computer science. [sent-38, score-0.303]
</p><p>17 We then consider how these models can be used to explain developmental data, with Section 4 concerned with inferences about preferences from choices, and Section 5 focusing on inferences about the properties of objects from preferences. [sent-39, score-1.137]
</p><p>18 2  Children’s inferences about preferences  The basic evidence that children do not differentiate the preferences of others before about 18 months of age comes from Repacholi and Gopnik [6]. [sent-41, score-1.713]
</p><p>19 Subsequent work has built on these results to explore the kinds of cues that children can use in inferring preferences, and how children generalize consistent patterns of preferences. [sent-42, score-0.861]
</p><p>20 1  Learning preferences from statistical evidence  While 18-month-olds are able to infer preferences from affective responses, we often need to make inferences from more impoverished data, such as the patterns of choices that people make when faced with various options. [sent-44, score-1.61]
</p><p>21 Recent work by Kushnir and colleagues [8] provided the ﬁrst evidence that 3- and 4-year-old children can use statistical sampling information as the basis for inferring an agent’s preference for toys. [sent-45, score-0.589]
</p><p>22 Three groups of children were tested in a simple task. [sent-46, score-0.407]
</p><p>23 Then the child was given three toys – a red disc (the target), a blue plastic ﬂower (the alternative), and a yellow cylinder (the distractor) – and was asked to give Squirrel the one he liked. [sent-60, score-0.301]
</p><p>24 The results of the experiment showed that the children chose the target (the red disc) 0. [sent-62, score-0.537]
</p><p>25 67 times (out of 2) in the 100%, 50%, and 18% conditions, respectively, suggesting that children used the non-random sampling behavior of Squirrel as the basis for inferring his preferences. [sent-65, score-0.481]
</p><p>26 2  Generalizing from shared preferences  Recognizing that preferences can vary from one agent to another also establishes an opportunity to discover that those preferences can differ in the degree to which they are related to one’s own. [sent-67, score-1.805]
</p><p>27 Fawcett and Markson [7] asked under what conditions children would use shared preferences between themselves and another agent as the basis for generalization, using a task similar to the “collaborative ﬁltering” problem explored in computer science. [sent-68, score-1.121]
</p><p>28 In each block the actors introduced two objects from a common category, including toys, television shows and foods. [sent-70, score-0.223]
</p><p>29 Each actor expressed liking the object she introduced and dislike for the other’s object. [sent-71, score-0.503]
</p><p>30 One actor had preferences that were matched to the 2  child’s in all blocks, in that her objects had features chosen to be more interesting to the child. [sent-72, score-1.049]
</p><p>31 After each actor reacted to the objects, the child was given an opportunity to play with the objects, and his or her preference for one object over the other was judged by independent coders, based on relative interest in and play with each object. [sent-73, score-0.679]
</p><p>32 Each actor brought out a new object that was described as being in the same category as the training objects, but was hidden from the child by an opaque container. [sent-75, score-0.555]
</p><p>33 Each actor then reacted to her novel object in a manner that varied by condition. [sent-76, score-0.443]
</p><p>34 In the like condition, the actor’s reaction was to examine the object and describe it as her favorite object of the category. [sent-77, score-0.244]
</p><p>35 In the indifferent condition the actor did not examine the toy, and professed ignorance about it. [sent-79, score-0.302]
</p><p>36 The child was then given an opportunity to choose one hidden object to play with. [sent-80, score-0.26]
</p><p>37 Finally, a second test block began, identical to the ﬁrst except that the hidden objects were members of a different category from those seen in training. [sent-81, score-0.244]
</p><p>38 Children consistently chose the test items that were favored by the agent who shared their own preferences during training, for both toys and the similar category, books. [sent-87, score-0.873]
</p><p>39 In contrast, when a highly distant category was used during test, children did not show any systematic generalization behaviors. [sent-88, score-0.519]
</p><p>40 These results suggest that children use shared preferences as the basis for generalization, but they also take into account whether the categories are related or not. [sent-89, score-0.972]
</p><p>41 3  Summary and prospectus  Recent results in developmental psychology indicate that young children are capable of making remarkably sophisticated inferences about the preferences of others. [sent-91, score-1.302]
</p><p>42 This raises the question of how they make these inferences, and whether the kinds of conclusions that children draw from the behavior of others are justiﬁed. [sent-92, score-0.458]
</p><p>43 In the tradition of rational analysis [10], we consider the problem of how one might optimally infer people’s preferences from their choices, and compare the predictions of such a model with the developmental data. [sent-94, score-0.889]
</p><p>44 The results of this analysis will help us understand how children might conceive of the relationship between the choices that people make and the preferences they have. [sent-95, score-1.173]
</p><p>45 Fortunately, the relationship between preferences and choices has been the subject of extensive research in economics and psychology. [sent-97, score-0.734]
</p><p>46 One of the most basic models of choice behavior is the Luce-Shepard choice rule [11, 12], which asserts that when presented with a set of J options with utilities u = (u1 , . [sent-98, score-0.341]
</p><p>47 Given this choice rule, learning about an agent’s preferences is a simple matter of Bayesian inference. [sent-102, score-0.59]
</p><p>48 While this simple model is sufﬁcient to capture preferences among a constrained set of objects, most models used in econometrics aim to predict the choices that agents will make about novel objects. [sent-107, score-0.842]
</p><p>49 3  This can be done by assuming that options have features that determine their utility, with the utility of option i being a function of the utility of its features. [sent-108, score-0.328]
</p><p>50 If we let xi be a binary vector indicating whether an option possesses each of a ﬁnite set of features, and β a be the utility that agent a assigns to those features1 , we can express the utility of option i for agent a as the inner product of these two vectors. [sent-109, score-0.55]
</p><p>51 The probability of agent a choosing option i is then P (c = j|X, β a ) =  exp(β T xi ) a exp(β T xj ) a j  (3)  where X collects the features of all of the options. [sent-110, score-0.276]
</p><p>52 First, the Luce-Shepard rule reﬂects the choice probabilities that result when agents seek to maximize their utility in the presence of noise on utilities that follows a Weibull distribution [13], and is thus compatible with the standard assumptions of statistical decision theory. [sent-113, score-0.358]
</p><p>53 Second, the MML can approximate the distribution of choices for essentially any heterogeneous population of utility-maximizing agents given appropriate choice of p(β a ) [1]. [sent-114, score-0.27]
</p><p>54 The model outlined in this section provides a way to optimally answer the question of how to infer the preferences of an agent from their choices. [sent-120, score-0.712]
</p><p>55 In the remainder of the paper, we explore how well this simple rational model accounts for the inferences that children make about preferences, applying the model to the key developmental phenomena introduced in the previous section. [sent-121, score-0.831]
</p><p>56 4  Using statistical information to infer preferences  The experiment conducted by Kushnir and colleagues [8], discussed in Section 2. [sent-122, score-0.619]
</p><p>57 1, provides evidence that children are sensitive to statistical information when inferring the preferences of agents. [sent-123, score-1.018]
</p><p>58 In this section, we examine whether this inference is consistent with the predictions of the rational model outlined above. [sent-124, score-0.222]
</p><p>59 1  Applying the MML model  The child’s goal is to learn what Squirrel’s preferences are, so as to offer an appropriate toy. [sent-127, score-0.531]
</p><p>60 The 1  We will refer to the utilities of features as “preferences” to distinguish them from the utilities of options. [sent-142, score-0.274]
</p><p>61 45  target  alternate  distractor  Sum squared error (SSE)  0  P(choice)  1 50 percent target  model children  0. [sent-146, score-0.607]
</p><p>62 number of options in each choice Squirrel made from the box was the total number of objects in the box (38), with each type of object being represented with the appropriate frequency. [sent-160, score-0.46]
</p><p>63 The N = 5 choices made by Squirrel thus provide the data c from which its preferences can be inferred. [sent-161, score-0.661]
</p><p>64 The child must now select an object to give Squirrel, with one target, one alternative, and one distractor as options. [sent-165, score-0.262]
</p><p>65 If we suppose each child is matching Squirrel’s choice distribution, we can use the Luce-Shepard choice rule (Equation 3) to predict the rates at which children should choose the different objects for a particular value of β a , P (cchild = j|X, β a ). [sent-166, score-0.803]
</p><p>66 The only conspicuous difference between the model’s predictions and the children’s choices was the tendency of children to choose the target object more frequently than alternatives even when it was the only object in the box. [sent-176, score-0.825]
</p><p>67 This can be explained by observing that under the cover story used in the experiment, Squirrel was freely choosing to select objects from the box, implicitly indicating that it was choosing these objects over other unobserved options. [sent-177, score-0.27]
</p><p>68 As a simple test of this explanation, we generated new predictions under the assumption that each choice included one other unobserved option, with features orthogonal to the choices in the box. [sent-178, score-0.317]
</p><p>69 3  Alternative explanations  Kushnir and colleagues [8] suggest that the children in the experiment may be learning preferences by using statistical information to identify situations where the agent’s behavior is not consistent with random sampling. [sent-183, score-1.056]
</p><p>70 5  Generalizing preferences to novel objects  The study of Fawcett and Markson [7] introduced in Section 2. [sent-189, score-0.706]
</p><p>71 2 provides a way to go beyond simple estimation of preferences from choices, exploring how children solve the “collaborative ﬁltering” problem of generalizing preferences to novel objects. [sent-190, score-1.534]
</p><p>72 The ﬁrst inference the child must make – learning the actors’ preferences by computing p(β a |X, c) for a ∈ (1, 2) – is the same as that necessary for the ﬁrst set of experiments discussed above. [sent-194, score-0.626]
</p><p>73 Speciﬁcally, we need to deﬁne how preferences are related to affective responses, since the actors simply indicated their affective response to the novel object. [sent-197, score-0.811]
</p><p>74 We will refer to the actor whose preferences matched those of the child as Actor 1, and the other actor as Actor 2. [sent-198, score-1.221]
</p><p>75 Let the features of Actor a’s preferred object in round n be xna , the features of the same-category novel object be xsa , and the features of the different-category novel object be xda . [sent-199, score-0.633]
</p><p>76 When the category is irrelevant, we will use x∗a ∈ {xsa , xda } to indicate the features of the novel object. [sent-200, score-0.225]
</p><p>77 The goal of the child is to infer x∗a (and thus whether they themselves will like the novel object) from the observed affective response of agent a, the features of the objects from the previous rounds X, and the choices of the agent on the previous rounds c. [sent-201, score-0.888]
</p><p>78 This can be done by evaluating P (x∗a |X, c, ra ) =  P (x∗a |β a , ra )p(β a |X, c) dβa  (6)  where P (x∗a |β a , ra ) is the posterior distribution over the features of the novel object given the preferences and affective response of the agent. [sent-202, score-1.076]
</p><p>79 The likelihood P (ra |x∗a , β a ) reﬂects the probability of the agent producing a particular affective response given the properties of the object and the agent’s preferences. [sent-205, score-0.334]
</p><p>80 In the like condition, the actor declared this to be her favorite object. [sent-207, score-0.312]

</p><p>82 The preﬁxes C4 and C3 denote cases where children chose to play with the objects presented by the matched actor (i. [sent-218, score-0.936]
</p><p>83 The third character denotes the like (L) or dislike (D) condition, and the fourth character denotes whether the object is in the same category (S) or a different category (D) from those seen in training. [sent-221, score-0.415]
</p><p>84 In deﬁning the prior distributions from which the features of both the observed objects and the novel objects are sampled, it is important to represent differences between categories. [sent-223, score-0.378]
</p><p>85 Having computed a posterior distribution over x∗a using this prior and likelihood, the child must combine this information with his or her own preferences to select an object. [sent-227, score-0.626]
</p><p>86 Unfortunately, we do not have direct access to the utilities of the children in this experiment, so we must estimate them from the children’s choice data. [sent-228, score-0.569]
</p><p>87 That done, we apply the choice rule a ﬁnal time and obtain choice probabilities for the objects selected by the children on the ﬁnal trial. [sent-230, score-0.708]
</p><p>88 2  Results  Figure 2 shows the rates at which children chose actor 1’s object and the model’s predictions for the same. [sent-232, score-0.88]
</p><p>89 The model predicts less-extreme probabilities than were observed in the choices of the children, in particular in the cases where children chose to play with one of actor 2’s objects. [sent-240, score-0.918]
</p><p>90 This may be attributed to actor 1’s objects having features one would expect people to like a priori, making the zero-mean preference prior inappropriate. [sent-241, score-0.629]
</p><p>91 3  Alternative explanations  The model described above provides good predictions of children’s inferences in this experiment, but also attributes relatively complex beliefs to the child. [sent-243, score-0.282]
</p><p>92 The simplest model might suggest that children were simply learning associations between speciﬁc behaviors by the matching actor and the presence of a desirable object. [sent-246, score-0.738]
</p><p>93 The most basic model of this kind, assuming that the matching actor is generally associated with desirable objects, is falsiﬁed by the children showing no bias towards the matching actor’s objects in the dislike condition. [sent-247, score-0.962]
</p><p>94 A more elaborate version, in which children associate positive affect by the matching actor with desirable objects, is inconsistent with children’s stronger preferences when the novel objects were similar to the training objects. [sent-248, score-1.415]
</p><p>95 This evidence also runs against explanations that the children are selecting objects based on liking the matched actor or believing that the matched actor is a more reliable judge of quality. [sent-249, score-1.272]
</p><p>96 6  Conclusion  We have outlined a simple rational model for inferences about preferences from choices, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, and shown that this model produces predictions that closely parallel the behavior of children reasoning about the preferences of others. [sent-251, score-1.987]
</p><p>97 These results shed light on how children may think about choice, desire, and other minds, and highlight new questions and possible extensions. [sent-252, score-0.407]
</p><p>98 In future work, we intend to explore whether the developmental shift discovered by Repacholi and Gopnik [6] can be explained in terms of rational model selection under an MML view. [sent-253, score-0.237]
</p><p>99 Our approach also provides a framework for predicting how children might make inferences to preferences at the population level and exploring the information provided by correlated features. [sent-255, score-1.154]

<p>Author: Dotan D. Castro, Dmitry Volkinshtein, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: Actor-critic algorithms for reinforcement learning are achieving renewed popularity due to their good convergence properties in situations where other approaches often fail (e.g., when function approximation is involved). Interestingly, there is growing evidence that actor-critic approaches based on phasic dopamine signals play a key role in biological learning through cortical and basal ganglia loops. We derive a temporal difference based actor critic learning algorithm, for which convergence can be proved without assuming widely separated time scales for the actor and the critic. The approach is demonstrated by applying it to networks of spiking neurons. The established relation between phasic dopamine and the temporal difference signal lends support to the biological relevance of such algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.16328764 <a title="10-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Analyzing_human_feature_learning_as_nonparametric_Bayesian_inference.html">26 nips-2008-Analyzing human feature learning as nonparametric Bayesian inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Jim C. Huang, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Ranking is at the heart of many information retrieval applications. Unlike standard regression or classiﬁcation in which we predict outputs independently, in ranking we are interested in predicting structured outputs so that misranking one object can signiﬁcantly affect whether we correctly rank the other objects. In practice, the problem of ranking involves a large number of objects to be ranked and either approximate structured prediction methods are required, or assumptions of independence between object scores must be made in order to make the problem tractable. We present a probabilistic method for learning to rank using the graphical modelling framework of cumulative distribution networks (CDNs), where we can take into account the structure inherent to the problem of ranking by modelling the joint cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) over multiple pairwise preferences. We apply our framework to the problem of document retrieval in the case of the OHSUMED benchmark dataset. We will show that the RankNet, ListNet and ListMLE probabilistic models can be viewed as particular instances of CDNs and that our proposed framework allows for the exploration of a broad class of ﬂexible structured loss functionals for learning to rank. 1</p><p>5 0.10627561 <a title="10-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Agent_Filtering_with_Infinitely_Nested_Beliefs.html">141 nips-2008-Multi-Agent Filtering with Infinitely Nested Beliefs</a></p>
<p>Author: Luke Zettlemoyer, Brian Milch, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In partially observable worlds with many agents, nested beliefs are formed when agents simultaneously reason about the unknown state of the world and the beliefs of the other agents. The multi-agent ﬁltering problem is to efﬁciently represent and update these beliefs through time as the agents act in the world. In this paper, we formally deﬁne an inﬁnite sequence of nested beliefs about the state of the world at the current time t, and present a ﬁltering algorithm that maintains a ﬁnite representation which can be used to generate these beliefs. In some cases, this representation can be updated exactly in constant time; we also present a simple approximation scheme to compact beliefs if they become too complex. In experiments, we demonstrate efﬁcient ﬁltering in a range of multi-agent domains. 1</p><p>6 0.089722447 <a title="10-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-An_ideal_observer_model_of_infant_object_perception.html">23 nips-2008-An ideal observer model of infant object perception</a></p>

However, there exists no overarching account of what children are doing when they learn about preferences or how they use that knowledge. We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. Speciﬁcally, we show how a simple econometric model can be extended to capture two- to four-year-olds’ use of statistical information in inferring preferences, and their generalization of these preferences. 1</p><p>2 0.68029314 <a title="10-lsi-2" href="./nips-2008-Analyzing_human_feature_learning_as_nonparametric_Bayesian_inference.html">26 nips-2008-Analyzing human feature learning as nonparametric Bayesian inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Fei Xu</p><p>Abstract: Before the age of 4 months, infants make inductive inferences about the motions of physical objects. Developmental psychologists have provided verbal accounts of the knowledge that supports these inferences, but often these accounts focus on categorical rather than probabilistic principles. We propose that infant object perception is guided in part by probabilistic principles like persistence: things tend to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. To illustrate this idea we develop an ideal observer model that incorporates probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia. Like previous researchers, we suggest that rigid motions are expected from an early age, but we challenge the previous claim that the inertia principle is relatively slow to develop [1]. We support these arguments by modeling several experiments from the developmental literature. Over the past few decades, ingenious experiments [1, 2] have suggested that infants rely on systematic expectations about physical objects when interpreting visual scenes. Looking time studies suggest, for example, that infants expect objects to follow continuous trajectories through time and space, and understand that two objects cannot simultaneously occupy the same location. Many of these studies have been replicated several times, but there is still no consensus about the best way to characterize the knowledge that gives rise to these ﬁndings. Two main approaches can be found in the literature. The verbal approach uses natural language to characterize principles of object perception [1, 3]: for example, Spelke [4] proposes that object perception is consistent with principles including continuity (“a moving object traces exactly one connected path over space and time”) and cohesion (“a moving object maintains its connectedness and boundaries”). The mechanistic approach proposes that physical knowledge is better characterized by describing the mechanisms that give rise to behavior, and researchers working in this tradition often develop computational models that support their theoretical proposals [5]. We pursue a third approach—the ideal observer approach [6, 7, 8]—that combines aspects of both previous traditions. Like the verbal approach, our primary goal is to characterize principles that account for infant behavior, and we will not attempt to characterize the mechanisms that produce this behavior. Like the mechanistic approach, we emphasize the importance of formal models, and suggest that these models can capture forms of knowledge that are difﬁcult for verbal accounts to handle. Ideal observer models [6, 9] specify the conclusions that normatively follow given a certain source of information and a body of background knowledge. These models can therefore address questions about the information and the knowledge that support perception. Approaches to the information question characterize the kinds of perceptual information that human observers use. For example, Geisler [9] discusses which components of the information available at the retina contribute to visual perception, and Banks and Shannon [10] use ideal observer models to study the perceptual consequences of immaturities in the retina. Approaches to the knowledge question characterize the background assumptions that are combined with the available input in order to make inductive inferences. For example, Weiss and Adelson [7] describe several empirical phenomena that are consistent with the a priori assumption that motions tend to be slow and smooth. There are few previous attempts to develop ideal observer models of infant perception, and most of them focus only on the information question [10]. This paper addresses the knowledge question, and proposes that the ideal observer approach can help to identify the minimal set of principles needed to account for the visual competence of young infants. Most verbal theories of object perception focus on categorical principles [4], or principles that make a single distinction between possible and impossible scenes. We propose that physical knowledge in infancy is also characterized by probabilistic principles, or expectations that make some possible scenes more surprising than others. We demonstrate the importance of probabilistic principles by focusing on two examples: the rigidity principle states that objects usually maintain their shape and size when they move, and the inertia principle states that objects tend to maintain the same pattern of motion over time. Both principles capture important regularities, but exceptions to these regularities are relatively common. Focusing on rigidity and inertia allows us to demonstrate two contributions that probabilistic approaches can make. First, probabilistic approaches can reinforce current proposals about infant perception. Spelke [3] suggests that rigidity is a core principle that guides object perception from a very early age, and we demonstrate how this idea can be captured by a model that also tolerates exceptions, such as non-rigid biological motion. Second, probabilistic approaches can identify places where existing proposals may need to be revised. Spelke [3] argues that the principle of inertia is slow to develop, but we suggest that a probabilistic version of this principle can help to account for inferences made early in development. 1 An ideal observer approach An ideal observer approach to object perception can be formulated in terms of a generative model for scenes. Scenes can be generated in three steps. First we choose the number n of objects that will appear in the scene, and generate the shape, visual appearance, and initial location of each object. We then choose a velocity ﬁeld for each object which speciﬁes how the object moves and changes shape over time. Finally, we create a visual scene by taking a two-dimensional projection of the moving objects generated in the two previous steps. An ideal observer approach explores the idea that the inferences made by infants approximate the optimal inferences with respect to this generative model. We work within this general framework but make two simpliﬁcations. We will not discuss how the shapes and visual appearances of objects are generated, and we make the projection step simple by working with a two-dimensional world. These simpliﬁcations allow us to focus on the expectations about velocity ﬁelds that guide motion perception in infants. The next two sections present two prior distributions that can be used to generate velocity ﬁelds. The ﬁrst is a baseline prior that does not incorporate probabilistic principles, and the second incorporates probabilistic versions of rigidity and inertia. The two priors capture different kinds of knowledge, and we argue that the second provides the more accurate characterization of the knowledge that infants bring to object perception. 1.1 A baseline prior on velocity ﬁelds Our baseline prior is founded on ﬁve categorical principles that are closely related to principles discussed by Spelke [3, 4]. The principles we consider rely on three basic notions: space, time, and matter. We also refer to particles, which are small pieces of matter that occupy space-time points. Particles satisfy several principles: C1. Temporal continuity. Particles are not created or destroyed. In other words, every particle that exists at time t1 must also exist at time t2 . C2. Spatial continuity. Each particle traces a continuous trajectory through space. C3. Exclusion. No two particles may occupy the same space-time point. An object is a collection of particles, and these collections satisfy two principles: C4. Discreteness. Each particle belongs to exactly one object. C5. Cohesion. At each point in time, the particles belonging to an object occupy a single connected region of space. Suppose that we are interested in a space-time window speciﬁed by a bounded region of space and a bounded interval of time. For simplicity, we will assume that space is two-dimensional, and that the space-time window corresponds to the unit cube. Suppose that a velocity ﬁeld v assigns a velocity (vx , vy ) to each particle in the space-time window, and let vi be the ﬁeld created by considering only particles that belong to object i. We develop a theory of object perception by deﬁning a prior distribution p(v) on velocity ﬁelds. Consider ﬁrst the distribution p(v1 ) on ﬁelds for a single object. Any ﬁeld that violates one or more of principles C1–C5 is assigned zero probability. For instance, ﬁelds where part of an object winks out of existence violate the principle of temporal continuity, and ﬁelds where an object splits into two distinct pieces violate the principle of cohesion. Many ﬁelds, however, remain, including ﬁelds that specify non-rigid motions and jagged trajectories. For now, assume that we are working with a space of ﬁelds that is bounded but very large, and that the prior distribution over this space is uniform for all ﬁelds consistent with principles C1–C5: p(v1 ) ∝ f (v1 ) = 0 1 if v1 violates C1–C5 otherwise. (1) Consider now the distribution p(v1 , v2 ) on ﬁelds for pairs of objects. Principles C1 through C5 rule out some of these ﬁelds, but again we must specify a prior distribution on those that remain. Our prior is induced by the following principle: C6. Independence. Velocity ﬁelds for multiple objects are independently generated subject to principles C1 through C5. More formally, the independence principle speciﬁes how the prior for the multiple object case is related to the prior p(v1 ) on velocity ﬁelds for a single object (Equation 1): p(v1 , . . . , vn ) ∝ f (v1 , . . . , vn ) = 0 if {vi } collectively violate C1–C5 f (v1 ) . . . f (vn ) otherwise. (2) 1.2 A smoothness prior on velocity ﬁelds We now develop a prior p(v) that incorporates probabilistic expectations about the motion of physical objects. Consider again the prior p(v1 ) on the velocity ﬁeld v1 of a single object. Principles C1–C5 make a single cut that distinguishes possible from impossible ﬁelds, but we need to consider whether infants have additional knowledge that makes some of the possible ﬁelds less surprising than others. One informal idea that seems relevant is the notion of persistence[11]: things tend to remain the same, and when they change they do so gradually. We focus on two versions of this idea that may guide expectations about velocity ﬁelds: S1. Spatial smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in space. S2. Temporal smoothness. Velocity ﬁelds tend to be smooth in time. A ﬁeld is “smooth in space” if neighboring particles tend to have similar velocities at any instant of time. The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where all particles have the same velocity at any instant—in other words, where an object moves rigidly. The principle of spatial smoothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain the same shape and size. A ﬁeld is “smooth in time” if any particle tends to have similar velocities at nearby instants of time. The smoothest possible ﬁeld will be one where each particle maintains the same velocity throughout the entire interval of interest. The principle of temporal smoothness therefore captures the idea that objects tend to maintain their initial pattern of motion. For instance, stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and a moving object following a given trajectory tends to continue along that trajectory. Principles S1 and S2 are related to two principles— rigidity and inertia—that have been discussed in the developmental literature. The rigidity principle states that objects “tend to maintain their size and shape over motion”[3], and the inertia principle states that objects move smoothly in the absence of obstacles [4]. Some authors treat these principles rather differently: for instance, Spelke suggests that rigidity is one of the core principles that guides object perception from a very early age [3], but that the principle of inertia is slow to develop and is weak or fragile once acquired. Since principles S1 and S2 seem closely related, the suggestion that one develops much later than the other seems counterintuitive. The rest of this paper explores the idea that both of these principles are needed to characterize infant perception. Our arguments will be supported by formal analyses, and we therefore need formal versions of S1 and S2. There may be different ways to formalize these principles, but we present a simple L1 L2 U b) 200 L1 L2 U 0 log “ p(H1 |v) p(H2 |v) ” a) −200 baseline smoothness Figure 1: (a) Three scenes inspired by the experiments of Spelke and colleagues [12, 13]. Each scene can be interpreted as a single object, or as a small object on top of a larger object. (b) Relative preferences for the one-object and two-object interpretations according to two models. The baseline model prefers the one-object interpretation in all three cases, but the smoothness model prefers the one-object interpretation only for scenes L1 and L2. approach that builds on existing models of motion perception in adults [7, 8]. We deﬁne measures of instantaneous roughness that capture how rapidly a velocity ﬁeld v varies in space and time: Rspace (v, t) = ∂v(x, y, t) ∂x 2 ∂v(x, y, t) ∂t 1 vol(O(t)) 2 + ∂v(x, y, t) ∂y 2 dxdy (3) O(t) Rtime (v, t) = 1 vol(O(t)) dxdy (4) O(t) where O(t) is the set of all points that are occupied by the object at time t, and vol(O(t)) is the volume of the object at time t. Rspace (v, t) will be large if neighboring particles at time t tend to have different velocities, and Rtime (v, t) will be large if many particles are accelerating at time t. We combine our two roughness measures to create a single smoothness function S(·) that measures the smoothness of a velocity ﬁeld: S(v) = −λspace Rspace (v, t)dt − λtime Rtime (v, t)dt (5) where λspace and λtime are positive weights that capture the importance of spatial smoothness and temporal smoothness. For all analyses in this paper we set λspace = 10000 and λtime = 250, which implies that violations of spatial smoothness are penalized more harshly than violations of temporal smoothness. We now replace Equation 1 with a prior on velocity ﬁelds that takes smoothness into account: 0 if v1 violates C1–C5 p(v1 ) ∝ f (v1 ) = (6) exp (S(v1 )) otherwise. Combining Equation 6 with Equation 2 speciﬁes a model of object perception that incorporates probabilistic principles of rigidity and inertia. 2 Empirical ﬁndings: spatial smoothness There are many experiments where infants aged 4 months and younger appear to make inferences that are consistent with the principle of rigidity. This section suggests that the principle of spatial smoothness can account for these results. We therefore propose that a probabilistic principle (spatial smoothness) can explain all of the ﬁndings previously presented in support of a categorical principle (rigidity), and can help in addition to explain how infants perceive non-rigid motion. One set of studies explores inferences about the number of objects in a scene. When a smaller block is resting on top of a larger block (L1 in Figure 1a), 3-month-olds infer that the scene includes a single object [12]. The same result holds when the small and large blocks are both moving in the same direction (L2 in Figure 1a) [13]. When these blocks are moving in opposite directions (U in Figure 1a), however, infants appear to infer that the scene contains two objects [13]. Results like these suggest that infants may have a default expectation that objects tend to move rigidly. We compared the predictions made by two models about the scenes in Figure 1a. The smoothness model uses a prior p(v1 ) that incorporates principles S1 and S2 (Equation 6), and the baseline model is identical except that it sets λspace = λtime = 0. Both models therefore incorporate principles C1– C6, but only the smoothness model captures the principle of spatial smoothness. Given any of the scenes in Figure 1a, an infant must solve two problems: she must compute the velocity ﬁeld v for the scene and must decide whether this ﬁeld speciﬁes the motion of one or two objects. Here we focus on the second problem, and assume that the infant’s perceptual system has already computed a veridical velocity ﬁeld for each scene that we consider. In principle, however, the smoothness prior in Equation 6 can address both problems. Previous authors have shown how smoothness priors can be used to compute velocity ﬁelds given raw image data [7, 8]. Let H1 be the hypothesis that a given velocity ﬁeld corresponds to a single object, and let H2 be the hypothesis that the ﬁeld speciﬁes the motions of two objects. We assume that the prior probabilities of these hypotheses are equal, and that P (H1 ) = P (H2 ) = 0.5. An ideal observer can use the posterior odds ratio to choose between these hypotheses: P (H1 |v) P (v|H1 ) P (H1 ) = ≈ P (H2 |v) P (v|H2 ) P (H2 ) f (v) f (v1 )dv1 f (v1 , v2 )dv1 dv2 f (vA , vB ) (7) Equation 7 follows from Equations 2 and 6, and from approximating P (v|H2 ) by considering only the two object interpretation (vA , vB ) with maximum posterior probability. For each scene in Figure 1a, the best two object interpretation will specify a ﬁeld vA for the small upper block, and a ﬁeld vB for the large lower block. To approximate the posterior odds ratio in Equation 7 we compute rough approximations of f (v1 )dv1 and f (v1 , v2 )dv1 dv2 by summing over a ﬁnite space of velocity ﬁelds. As described in the supporting material, we consider all ﬁelds that can be built from objects with 5 possible shapes, 900 possible starting locations, and 10 possible trajectories. For computational tractability, we convert each continuous velocity ﬁeld to a discrete ﬁeld deﬁned over a space-time grid with 45 cells along each spatial dimension and 21 cells along the temporal dimension. Our results show that both models prefer the one-object hypothesis H1 when presented with scenes L1 and L2 (Figure 1b). Since there are many more two-object scenes than one-object scenes, any typical two-object interpretation is assigned lower prior probability than a typical one-object interpretation. This preference for simpler interpretations is a consequence of the Bayesian Occam’s razor. The baseline model makes the same kind of inference about scene U, and again prefers the one-object interpretation. Like infants, however, the smoothness model prefers the two-object interpretation of scene U. This model assigns low probability to a one-object interpretation where adjacent points on the object have very different velocities, and this preference for smooth motion is strong enough to overcome the simplicity preference that makes the difference when interpreting the other two scenes. Other experiments from the developmental literature have produced results consistent with the principle of spatial smoothness. For example, 3.5-month olds are surprised when a tall object is fully hidden behind a short screen, 4 month olds are surprised when a large object appears to pass through a small slot, and 4.5-month olds expect a swinging screen to be interrupted when an object is placed in its path [1, 2]. All three inferences appear to rely on the expectation that objects tend not to shrink or to compress like foam rubber. Many of these experiments are consistent with an account that simply rules out non-rigid motion instead of introducing a graded preference for spatial smoothness. Biological motions, however, are typically non-rigid, and experiments suggest that infants can track and make inferences about objects that follow non-rigid trajectories [14]. Findings like these call for a theory like ours that incorporates a preference for rigid motion, but recognizes that non-rigid motions are possible. 3 Empirical ﬁndings: temporal smoothness We now turn to the principle of temporal smoothness (S2) and discuss some of the experimental evidence that bears on this principle. Some researchers suggest that a closely related principle (inertia) is slow to develop, but we argue that expectations about temporal smoothness are needed to capture inferences made before the age of 4 months. Baillargeon and DeVos [15] describe one relevant experiment that explores inferences about moving objects and obstacles. During habituation, 3.5-month-old infants saw a car pass behind an occluder and emerge from the other side (habituation stimulus H in Figure 2a). An obstacle was then placed in the direct path of the car (unlikely scenes U1 and U2) or beside this direct path (likely scene L), and the infants again saw the car pass behind the occluder and emerge from the other side.

The habituation stimulus H shows a block passing behind a barrier and emerging on the other side. After habituation, a new block is added either out of the direct path of the ﬁrst block (L) or directly in the path of the ﬁrst block (U1 and U2). In U1, the ﬁrst block leaps over the second block, and in U2 the second block hops so that the ﬁrst block can pass underneath. (b) Relative probabilities of scenes L, U1 and U2 according to two models. The baseline model ﬁnds all three scenes equally likely a priori, and considers L and U2 equally likely after habituation.

Now the best interpretation of stimulus U involves multiple changes of direction. time measurements suggested that the infants were more surprised to see the car emerge when the obstacle lay within the direct path of the car. This result is consistent with the principle of temporal smoothness, which suggests that infants expected the car to maintain a straight-line trajectory, and the obstacle to remain stationary. We compared the smoothness model and the baseline model on a schematic version of this task. To model this experiment, we again assume that the infant’s perceptual system has recovered a veridical velocity ﬁeld, but now we must allow for occlusion. An ideal observer approach that treats a two dimensional scene as a projection of a three dimensional world can represent the occluder as an object in its own right. Here, however, we continue to work with a two dimensional world, and treat the occluded parts of the scene as missing data. An ideal observer approach should integrate over all possible values of the missing data, but for computational simplicity we approximate this approach by considering only one or two high-probability interpretations of each occluded scene. We also need to account for habituation, and for cases where the habituation stimulus includes occlusion. We assume that an ideal observer computes a habituation ﬁeld vH , or the velocity ﬁeld with maximum posterior probability given the habituation stimulus. In Figure 2a, the inferred habituation ﬁeld vH speciﬁes a trajectory where the block moves smoothly from the left to the right of the scene. We now assume that the observer expects subsequent velocity ﬁelds to be similar to vH . Formally, we use a product-of-experts approach to deﬁne a post-habituation distribution on velocity ﬁelds: pH (v) ∝ p(v)p(v|vH ) (8) The ﬁrst expert p(v) uses the prior distribution in Equation 6, and the second expert p(v|vH ) assumes that ﬁeld v is drawn from a Gaussian distribution centered on vH . Intuitively, after habituation to vH the second expert expects that subsequent velocity ﬁelds will be similar to vH . More information about this model of habituation is provided in the supporting material. Given these assumptions, the black and dark gray bars in Figure 2 indicate relative a priori probabilities for scenes L, U1 and U2. The baseline model considers all three scenes equally probable, but the smoothness model prefers L. After habituation, the baseline model is still unable to account for the behavioral data, since it considers scenes L and U2 to be equally probable. The smoothness model, however, continues to prefer L. We previously mentioned three consequences of the principle of temporal smoothness: stationary objects tend to remain stationary, moving objects tend to keep moving, and moving objects tend to maintain a steady trajectory. The “car and obstacle” task addresses the ﬁrst and third of these proposals, but other tasks provide support for the second. Many authors have studied settings where one moving object comes to a stop, and a second object starts to move [17]. Compared to the case where the ﬁrst object collides with the second, infants appear to be surprised by the “no-contact” case where the two objects never touch. This ﬁnding is consistent with the temporal smoothness principle, which predicts that infants expect the ﬁrst object to continue moving until forced to stop, and expect the second object to remain stationary until forced to start. Other experiments [18] provide support for the principle of temporal smoothness, but there are also studies that appear inconsistent with this principle. In one of these studies [16], infants are initially habituated to a block that moves from one corner of an enclosure to another (H1 in Figure 3a). After habituation, infants see a block that begins from a different corner, and now the occluder is removed to reveal the block in a location consistent with a straight-line trajectory (L) or in a location that matches the ﬁnal resting place during the habituation phase (U). Looking times suggest that infants aged 4-12 months are no more surprised by the inertia-violating outcome (U) than the inertia-consistent outcome (L). The smoothness model, however, can account for this ﬁnding. The outcome in U is contrary to temporal smoothness but consistent with habituation, and the tradeoff between these factors leads the model to assign roughly the same probability to scenes L and U (Figure 3b). Only one of the inertia experiments described by Spelke et al. [16] and Spelke et al. [1] avoids this tradeoff between habituation and smoothness. This experiment considers a case where the habituation stimulus (H2 in Figure 3a) is equally similar to the two test stimuli. The results suggest that 8 month olds are now surprised by the inertia-violating outcome, and the predictions of our model are consistent with this ﬁnding (Figure 3b). 4 and 6 month olds, however, continue to look equally at the two outcomes. Note, however, that the trajectories in Figure 3 include at most one inﬂection point. Experiments that consider trajectories with many inﬂection points can provide a more powerful way of exploring whether 4 month olds have expectations about temporal smoothness. One possible experiment is sketched in Figure 3c. The task is very similar to the task in Figure 3a, except that a barrier is added after habituation. In order for the block to end up in the same location as before, it must now follow a tortuous path around the barrier (U). Based on the principle of temporal smoothness, we predict that 4-month-olds will be more surprised to see the outcome in stimulus U than the outcome in stimulus L. This experimental design is appealing in part because previous work shows that infants are surprised by a case similar to U where the barrier extends all the way from one wall to the other [16], and our proposed experiment is a minor variant of this task. Although there is room for debate about the status of temporal smoothness, we presented two reasons to revisit the conclusion that this principle develops relatively late. First, some version of this principle seems necessary to account for experiments like the car and obstacle experiment in Figure 2. Second, most of the inertia experiments that produced null results use a habituation stimulus which may have prevented infants from revealing their default expectations, and the one experiment that escapes this objection considers a relatively minor violation of temporal smoothness. Additional experiments are needed to explore this principle, but we predict that the inertia principle will turn out to be yet another example of knowledge that is available earlier than researchers once thought. 4 Discussion and Conclusion We argued that characterizations of infant knowledge should include room for probabilistic expectations, and that probabilistic expectations about spatial and temporal smoothness appear to play a role in infant object perception. To support these claims we described an ideal observer model that includes both categorical (C1 through C5) and probabilistic principles (S1 and S2), and demonstrated that the categorical principles alone are insufﬁcient to account for several experimental ﬁndings. Our two probabilistic principles are related to principles (rigidity and inertia) that have previously been described as categorical principles. Although rigidity and inertia appear to play a role in some early inferences, formulating these principles as probabilistic expectations helps to explain how infants deal with non-rigid motion and violations of inertia. Our analysis focused on some of the many existing experiments in the developmental literature, but new experiments will be needed to explore our probabilistic approach in depth. Categorical versions of a given principle (e.g. rigidity) allow room for only two kinds of behavior depending on whether the principle is violated or not. Probabilistic principles can be violated to a greater or lesser extent, and our approach predicts that violations of different magnitude may lead to different behaviors. Future studies of rigidity and inertia can consider violations of these principles that range from mild (Figure 3a) to severe (Figure 3c), and can explore whether infants respond to these violations differently. Future work should also consider whether the categorical principles we described (C1 through C5) are better characterized as probabilistic expectations. In particular, future studies can explore whether young infants consider large violations of cohesion (C5) or spatial continuity (C2) more surprising than smaller violations of these principles. Although we did not focus on learning, our approach allows us to begin thinking formally about how principles of object perception might be acquired. First, we can explore how parameters like the smoothness parameters in our model (λspace and λtime ) might be tuned by experience. Second, we can use statistical model selection to explore transitions between different sets of principles. For instance, if a learner begins with the baseline model we considered (principles C1–C6), we can explore which subsequent observations provide the strongest statistical evidence for smoothness principles S1 and S2, and how much of this evidence is required before an ideal learner would prefer our smoothness model over the baseline model. It is not yet clear which principles of object perception could be learned, but the ideal observer approach can help to resolve this question. References [1] E. S. Spelke, K. Breinlinger, J.

The goal of learning is to allow multiplication of matrices to represent symbolic relationships between objects and symbolic relationships between relationships, which is the main novelty of the method. We demonstrate that this leads to excellent generalization in two different domains: modular arithmetic and family relationships. We show that the same system can learn ﬁrst-order propositions such as (2, 5) ∈ +3 or (Christopher, Penelope) ∈ has wife, and higher-order propositions such as (3, +3) ∈ plus and (+3, −3) ∈ inverse or (has husband, has wife) ∈ higher oppsex. We further demonstrate that the system understands how higher-order propositions are related to ﬁrst-order ones by showing that it can correctly answer questions about ﬁrst-order propositions involving the relations +3 or has wife even though it has not been trained on any ﬁrst-order examples involving these relations. 1</p><p>5 0.48961273 <a title="10-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Skill_Characterization_Based_on_Betweenness.html">212 nips-2008-Skill Characterization Based on Betweenness</a></p>

<p>Author: Christopher G. Lucas, Thomas L. Griffiths, Fei Xu, Christine Fawcett</p><p>Abstract: Young children demonstrate the ability to make inferences about the preferences of other agents based on their choices. However, there exists no overarching account of what children are doing when they learn about preferences or how they use that knowledge. We use a rational model of preference learning, drawing on ideas from economics and computer science, to explain the behavior of children in several recent experiments. Speciﬁcally, we show how a simple econometric model can be extended to capture two- to four-year-olds’ use of statistical information in inferring preferences, and their generalization of these preferences. 1</p><p>2 0.80134714 <a title="10-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-QUIC-SVD%3A_Fast_SVD_Using_Cosine_Trees.html">188 nips-2008-QUIC-SVD: Fast SVD Using Cosine Trees</a></p>

Its computational cost, however, makes it unscalable and impractical for applications involving large datasets or real-time responsiveness, which are becoming increasingly common.

Our empirical tests show speedups of several orders of magnitude over exact SVD. Such scalability should enable QUIC-SVD to accelerate and enable a wide array of SVD-based methods and applications. 1</p><p>3 0.69652104 <a title="10-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Policy_Iteration.html">195 nips-2008-Regularized Policy Iteration</a></p>

In order to implement a ﬂexible function approximation scheme we propose the use of non-parametric methods with regularization, providing a convenient way to control the complexity of the function approximator. We propose two novel regularized policy iteration algorithms by adding L2 -regularization to two widely-used policy evaluation methods: Bellman residual minimization (BRM) and least-squares temporal difference learning (LSTD). We derive efﬁcient implementation for our algorithms when the approximate value-functions belong to a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We also provide ﬁnite-sample performance bounds for our algorithms and show that they are able to achieve optimal rates of convergence under the studied conditions. 1</p><p>4 0.6705004 <a title="10-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Mind_the_Duality_Gap%3A_Logarithmic_regret_algorithms_for_online_optimization.html">133 nips-2008-Mind the Duality Gap: Logarithmic regret algorithms for online optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Guy Lever, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We continue our study of online prediction of the labelling of a graph. We show a fundamental limitation of Laplacian-based algorithms: if the graph has a large diameter then the number of mistakes made by such algorithms may be proportional to the square root of the number of vertices, even when tackling simple problems. We overcome this drawback by means of an efﬁcient algorithm which achieves a logarithmic mistake bound. It is based on the notion of a spine, a path graph which provides a linear embedding of the original graph. In practice, graphs may exhibit cluster structure; thus in the last part, we present a modiﬁed algorithm which achieves the “best of both worlds”: it performs well locally in the presence of cluster structure, and globally on large diameter graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.63593304 <a title="10-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Difference_Based_Actor_Critic_Learning_-_Convergence_and_Neural_Implementation.html">230 nips-2008-Temporal Difference Based Actor Critic Learning - Convergence and Neural Implementation</a></p>

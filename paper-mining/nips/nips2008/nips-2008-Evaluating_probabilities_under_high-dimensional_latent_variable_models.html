<p>Author: Vinod Nair, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We present a mixture model whose components are Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). This possibility has not been considered before because computing the partition function of an RBM is intractable, which appears to make learning a mixture of RBMs intractable as well. Surprisingly, when formulated as a third-order Boltzmann machine, such a mixture model can be learned tractably using contrastive divergence. The energy function of the model captures threeway interactions among visible units, hidden units, and a single hidden discrete variable that represents the cluster label. The distinguishing feature of this model is that, unlike other mixture models, the mixing proportions are not explicitly parameterized. Instead, they are deﬁned implicitly via the energy function and depend on all the parameters in the model. We present results for the MNIST and NORB datasets showing that the implicit mixture of RBMs learns clusters that reﬂect the class structure in the data. 1</p><p>3 0.21067801 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>4 0.17968193 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: We present the Gaussian Process Density Sampler (GPDS), an exchangeable generative model for use in nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Samples drawn from the GPDS are consistent with exact, independent samples from a ﬁxed density function that is a transformation of a function drawn from a Gaussian process prior. Our formulation allows us to infer an unknown density from data using Markov chain Monte Carlo, which gives samples from the posterior distribution over density functions and from the predictive distribution on data space. We can also infer the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We compare this density modeling technique to several existing techniques on a toy problem and a skullreconstruction task. 1</p><p>5 0.13749427 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>6 0.12770051 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Generative_versus_discriminative_training_of_RBMs_for_classification_of_fMRI_images.html">92 nips-2008-Generative versus discriminative training of RBMs for classification of fMRI images</a></p>

This process extends the IBP to allow temporal dependencies in the hidden variables. We use this stochastic process to build a nonparametric extension of the factorial hidden Markov model. After constructing an inference scheme which combines slice sampling and dynamic programming we demonstrate how the inﬁnite factorial hidden Markov model can be used for blind source separation. 1</p><p>4 0.61771476 <a title="77-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Generative_versus_discriminative_training_of_RBMs_for_classification_of_fMRI_images.html">92 nips-2008-Generative versus discriminative training of RBMs for classification of fMRI images</a></p>
<p>Author: Tanya Schmah, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Steven L. Small, Stephen Strother, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Neuroimaging datasets often have a very large number of voxels and a very small number of training cases, which means that overﬁtting of models for this data can become a very serious problem. Working with a set of fMRI images from a study on stroke recovery, we consider a classiﬁcation task for which logistic regression performs poorly, even when L1- or L2- regularized. We show that much better discrimination can be achieved by ﬁtting a generative model to each separate condition and then seeing which model is most likely to have generated the data. We compare discriminative training of exactly the same set of models, and we also consider convex blends of generative and discriminative training. 1</p><p>5 0.58729625 <a title="77-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Zhu, Eric P. Xing, Bo Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Learning graphical models with hidden variables can offer semantic insights to complex data and lead to salient structured predictors without relying on expensive, sometime unattainable fully annotated training data. While likelihood-based methods have been extensively explored, to our knowledge, learning structured prediction models with latent variables based on the max-margin principle remains largely an open problem. In this paper, we present a partially observed Maximum Entropy Discrimination Markov Network (PoMEN) model that attempts to combine the advantages of Bayesian and margin based paradigms for learning Markov networks from partially labeled data. PoMEN leads to an averaging prediction rule that resembles a Bayes predictor that is more robust to overﬁtting, but is also built on the desirable discriminative laws resemble those of the M3 N. We develop an EM-style algorithm utilizing existing convex optimization algorithms for M3 N as a subroutine. We demonstrate competent performance of PoMEN over existing methods on a real-world web data extraction task. 1</p><p>4 0.71481085 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>5 0.71219009 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>

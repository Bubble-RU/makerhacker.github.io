<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>3 0.14539719 <a title="64-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Relative_Performance_Guarantees_for_Approximate_Inference_in_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation.html">197 nips-2008-Relative Performance Guarantees for Approximate Inference in Latent Dirichlet Allocation</a></p>
<p>Author: Indraneel Mukherjee, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical probabilistic modeling of discrete data has emerged as a powerful tool for text analysis. Posterior inference in such models is intractable, and practitioners rely on approximate posterior inference methods such as variational inference or Gibbs sampling. There has been much research in designing better approximations, but there is yet little theoretical understanding of which of the available techniques are appropriate, and in which data analysis settings. In this paper we provide the beginnings of such understanding. We analyze the improvement that the recently proposed collapsed variational inference (CVB) provides over mean ﬁeld variational inference (VB) in latent Dirichlet allocation. We prove that the difference in the tightness of the bound on the likelihood of a document decreases as O(k − 1) + log m/m, where k is the number of topics in the model and m is the number of words in a document. As a consequence, the advantage of CVB over VB is lost for long documents but increases with the number of topics. We demonstrate empirically that the theory holds, using simulated text data and two text corpora. We provide practical guidelines for choosing an approximation. 1</p><p>4 0.14382453 <a title="64-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Syntactic_Topic_Models.html">229 nips-2008-Syntactic Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jordan L. Boyd-graber, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop the syntactic topic model (STM), a nonparametric Bayesian model of parsed documents. The STM generates words that are both thematically and syntactically constrained, which combines the semantic insights of topic models with the syntactic information available from parse trees. Each word of a sentence is generated by a distribution that combines document-speciﬁc topic weights and parse-tree-speciﬁc syntactic transitions. Words are assumed to be generated in an order that respects the parse tree. We derive an approximate posterior inference method based on variational methods for hierarchical Dirichlet processes, and we report qualitative and quantitative results on both synthetic data and hand-parsed documents. 1</p><p>5 0.13808052 <a title="64-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Asynchronous_Distributed_Learning_of_Topic_Models.html">28 nips-2008-Asynchronous Distributed Learning of Topic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Padhraic Smyth, Max Welling, Arthur U. Asuncion</p><p>Abstract: Distributed learning is a problem of fundamental interest in machine learning and cognitive science. In this paper, we present asynchronous distributed learning algorithms for two well-known unsupervised learning frameworks: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes (HDP). In the proposed approach, the data are distributed across P processors, and processors independently perform Gibbs sampling on their local data and communicate their information in a local asynchronous manner with other processors. We demonstrate that our asynchronous algorithms are able to learn global topic models that are statistically as accurate as those learned by the standard LDA and HDP samplers, but with signiﬁcant improvements in computation time and memory. We show speedup results on a 730-million-word text corpus using 32 processors, and we provide perplexity results for up to 1500 virtual processors. As a stepping stone in the development of asynchronous HDP, a parallel HDP sampler is also introduced. 1</p><p>6 0.1321452 <a title="64-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Large_Margin_Taxonomy_Embedding_for_Document_Categorization.html">114 nips-2008-Large Margin Taxonomy Embedding for Document Categorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: Applications of multi-class classiﬁcation, such as document categorization, often appear in cost-sensitive settings. Recent work has signiﬁcantly improved the state of the art by moving beyond “ﬂat” classiﬁcation through incorporation of class hierarchies [4]. We present a novel algorithm that goes beyond hierarchical classiﬁcation and estimates the latent semantic space that underlies the class hierarchy. In this space, each class is represented by a prototype and classiﬁcation is done with the simple nearest neighbor rule. The optimization of the semantic space incorporates large margin constraints that ensure that for each instance the correct class prototype is closer than any other. We show that our optimization is convex and can be solved efﬁciently for large data sets. Experiments on the OHSUMED medical journal data base yield state-of-the-art results on topic categorization. 1</p><p>6 0.74128544 <a title="64-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Correlated_Bigram_LSA_for_Unsupervised_Language_Model_Adaptation.html">52 nips-2008-Correlated Bigram LSA for Unsupervised Language Model Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Mrinal Kalakrishnan, Sethu Vijayakumar, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: In kernel-based regression learning, optimizing each kernel individually is useful when the data density, curvature of regression surfaces (or decision boundaries) or magnitude of output noise varies spatially. Previous work has suggested gradient descent techniques or complex statistical hypothesis methods for local kernel shaping, typically requiring some amount of manual tuning of meta parameters. We introduce a Bayesian formulation of nonparametric regression that, with the help of variational approximations, results in an EM-like algorithm for simultaneous estimation of regression and kernel parameters. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, requires no sampling, automatically rejects outliers and has only one prior to be speciﬁed. It can be used for nonparametric regression with local polynomials or as a novel method to achieve nonstationary regression with Gaussian processes. Our methods are particularly useful for learning control, where reliable estimation of local tangent planes is essential for adaptive controllers and reinforcement learning. We evaluate our methods on several synthetic data sets and on an actual robot which learns a task-level control law. 1</p><p>2 0.76761663 <a title="64-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Variational_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Process_Experts.html">249 nips-2008-Variational Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Yuan, Claus Neubauer</p><p>Abstract: Mixture of Gaussian processes models extended a single Gaussian process with ability of modeling multi-modal data and reduction of training complexity. Previous inference algorithms for these models are mostly based on Gibbs sampling, which can be very slow, particularly for large-scale data sets. We present a new generative mixture of experts model. Each expert is still a Gaussian process but is reformulated by a linear model. This breaks the dependency among training outputs and enables us to use a much faster variational Bayesian algorithm for training. Our gating network is more ﬂexible than previous generative approaches as inputs for each expert are modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. The number of experts and number of Gaussian components for an expert are inferred automatically. A variety of tests show the advantages of our method. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.74498677 <a title="64-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-DiscLDA%3A_Discriminative_Learning_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification.html">64 nips-2008-DiscLDA: Discriminative Learning for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Lacoste-julien, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have become popular as methods for dimensionality reduction in collections of text documents or images. These models are usually treated as generative models and trained using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. In this paper, we discuss an alternative: a discriminative framework in which we assume that supervised side information is present, and in which we wish to take that side information into account in ﬁnding a reduced dimensionality representation. Speciﬁcally, we present DiscLDA, a discriminative variation on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in which a class-dependent linear transformation is introduced on the topic mixture proportions. This parameter is estimated by maximizing the conditional likelihood. By using the transformed topic mixture proportions as a new representation of documents, we obtain a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that uncovers the latent structure in a document collection while preserving predictive power for the task of classiﬁcation. We compare the predictive power of the latent structure of DiscLDA with unsupervised LDA on the 20 Newsgroups document classiﬁcation task and show how our model can identify shared topics across classes as well as class-dependent topics.</p><p>4 0.74222636 <a title="64-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Transfer_Learning_by_Distribution_Matching_for_Targeted_Advertising.html">241 nips-2008-Transfer Learning by Distribution Matching for Targeted Advertising</a></p>
<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Christoph Sawade, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers for several related tasks that may differ in their joint distribution of input and output variables. For each task, small – possibly even empty – labeled samples and large unlabeled samples are available. While the unlabeled samples reﬂect the target distribution, the labeled samples may be biased. This setting is motivated by the problem of predicting sociodemographic features for users of web portals, based on the content which they have accessed. Here, questionnaires offered to a portion of each portal’s users produce biased samples. We derive a transfer learning procedure that produces resampling weights which match the pool of all examples to the target distribution of any given task. Transfer learning enables us to make predictions even for new portals with few or no training data and improves the overall prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>5 0.62074661 <a title="64-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-task_Gaussian_Process_Learning_of_Robot_Inverse_Dynamics.html">146 nips-2008-Multi-task Gaussian Process Learning of Robot Inverse Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher Williams, Stefan Klanke, Sethu Vijayakumar, Kian M. Chai</p><p>Abstract: The inverse dynamics problem for a robotic manipulator is to compute the torques needed at the joints to drive it along a given trajectory; it is beneﬁcial to be able to learn this function for adaptive control. A robotic manipulator will often need to be controlled while holding different loads in its end effector, giving rise to a multi-task learning problem. By placing independent Gaussian process priors over the latent functions of the inverse dynamics, we obtain a multi-task Gaussian process prior for handling multiple loads, where the inter-task similarity depends on the underlying inertial parameters. Experiments demonstrate that this multi-task formulation is effective in sharing information among the various loads, and generally improves performance over either learning only on single tasks or pooling the data over all tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.619546 <a title="64-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>

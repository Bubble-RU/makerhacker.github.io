<p>Author: Ralf M. Haefner, Bruce G. Cumming</p><p>Abstract: A crucial part of developing mathematical models of information processing in the brain is the quantiﬁcation of their success. One of the most widely-used metrics yields the percentage of the variance in the data that is explained by the model. Unfortunately, this metric is biased due to the intrinsic variability in the data. We derive a simple analytical modiﬁcation of the traditional formula that signiﬁcantly improves its accuracy (as measured by bias) with similar or better precision (as measured by mean-square error) in estimating the true underlying Variance Explained by the model class. Our estimator advances on previous work by a) accounting for overﬁtting due to free model parameters mitigating the need for a separate validation data set, b) adjusting for the uncertainty in the noise estimate and c) adding a conditioning term. We apply our new estimator to binocular disparity tuning curves of a set of macaque V1 neurons and ﬁnd that on a population level almost all of the variance unexplained by Gabor functions is attributable to noise. 1</p><p>3 0.074357413 <a title="149-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: We present the Gaussian Process Density Sampler (GPDS), an exchangeable generative model for use in nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Samples drawn from the GPDS are consistent with exact, independent samples from a ﬁxed density function that is a transformation of a function drawn from a Gaussian process prior. Our formulation allows us to infer an unknown density from data using Markov chain Monte Carlo, which gives samples from the posterior distribution over density functions and from the predictive distribution on data space. We can also infer the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We compare this density modeling technique to several existing techniques on a toy problem and a skullreconstruction task. 1</p><p>4 0.074079171 <a title="149-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Sparsity_of_SVMs_that_use_the_epsilon-insensitive_loss.html">217 nips-2008-Sparsity of SVMs that use the epsilon-insensitive loss</a></p>

<p>Author: Yves Grandvalet, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Joseph Keshet, Stéphane Canu</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of binary classiﬁcation where the classiﬁer may abstain instead of classifying each observation. The Bayes decision rule for this setup, known as Chow’s rule, is deﬁned by two thresholds on posterior probabilities. From simple desiderata, namely the consistency and the sparsity of the classiﬁer, we derive the double hinge loss function that focuses on estimating conditional probabilities only in the vicinity of the threshold points of the optimal decision rule. We show that, for suitable kernel machines, our approach is universally consistent. We cast the problem of minimizing the double hinge loss as a quadratic program akin to the standard SVM optimization problem and propose an active set method to solve it efﬁciently. We ﬁnally provide preliminary experimental results illustrating the interest of our constructive approach to devising loss functions. 1</p><p>6 0.064626642 <a title="149-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Particle_Filter-based_Policy_Gradient_in_POMDPs.html">177 nips-2008-Particle Filter-based Policy Gradient in POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Conditional Random Sampling (CRS) was originally proposed for efﬁciently computing pairwise (l2 , l1 ) distances, in static, large-scale, and sparse data. This study modiﬁes the original CRS and extends CRS to handle dynamic or streaming data, which much better reﬂect the real-world situation than assuming static data. Compared with many other sketching algorithms for dimension reductions such as stable random projections, CRS exhibits a signiﬁcant advantage in that it is “one-sketch-for-all.” In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of CRS in efﬁciently computing the Hamming norm, the Hamming distance, the lp distance, and the χ2 distance. A generic estimator and an approximate variance formula are also provided, for approximating any type of distances. We recommend CRS as a promising tool for building highly scalable systems, in machine learning, data mining, recommender systems, and information retrieval. 1</p><p>5 0.53518158 <a title="149-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Weighted_Sums_of_Random_Kitchen_Sinks%3A_Replacing_minimization_with_randomization_in_learning.html">250 nips-2008-Weighted Sums of Random Kitchen Sinks: Replacing minimization with randomization in learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Benjamin Recht</p><p>Abstract: Randomized neural networks are immortalized in this AI Koan: In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6. “What are you doing?” asked Minsky. “I am training a randomly wired neural net to play tic-tac-toe,” Sussman replied. “Why is the net wired randomly?” asked Minsky. Sussman replied, “I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play.” Minsky then shut his eyes. “Why do you close your eyes?” Sussman asked his teacher. “So that the room will be empty,” replied Minsky. At that moment, Sussman was enlightened. We analyze shallow random networks with the help of concentration of measure inequalities. Speciﬁcally, we consider architectures that compute a weighted sum of their inputs after passing them through a bank of arbitrary randomized nonlinearities. We identify conditions under which these networks exhibit good classiﬁcation performance, and bound their test error in terms of the size of the dataset and the number of random nonlinearities. 1</p><p>6 0.5325259 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>

<p>Author: Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner, Gediminas Lukšys</p><p>Abstract: Suppose we train an animal in a conditioning experiment. Can one predict how a given animal, under given experimental conditions, would perform the task? Since various factors such as stress, motivation, genetic background, and previous errors in task performance can inﬂuence animal behaviour, this appears to be a very challenging aim. Reinforcement learning (RL) models have been successful in modeling animal (and human) behaviour, but their success has been limited because of uncertainty as to how to set meta-parameters (such as learning rate, exploitation-exploration balance and future reward discount factor) that strongly inﬂuence model performance. We show that a simple RL model whose metaparameters are controlled by an artiﬁcial neural network, fed with inputs such as stress, affective phenotype, previous task performance, and even neuromodulatory manipulations, can successfully predict mouse behaviour in the ”hole-box” - a simple conditioning task. Our results also provide important insights on how stress and anxiety affect animal learning, performance accuracy, and discounting of future rewards, and on how noradrenergic systems can interact with these processes. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72234613 <a title="149-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Near-minimax_recursive_density_estimation_on_the_binary_hypercube.html">149 nips-2008-Near-minimax recursive density estimation on the binary hypercube</a></p>

<p>Author: Kilian Q. Weinberger, Olivier Chapelle</p><p>Abstract: Applications of multi-class classiﬁcation, such as document categorization, often appear in cost-sensitive settings. Recent work has signiﬁcantly improved the state of the art by moving beyond “ﬂat” classiﬁcation through incorporation of class hierarchies [4]. We present a novel algorithm that goes beyond hierarchical classiﬁcation and estimates the latent semantic space that underlies the class hierarchy. In this space, each class is represented by a prototype and classiﬁcation is done with the simple nearest neighbor rule. The optimization of the semantic space incorporates large margin constraints that ensure that for each instance the correct class prototype is closer than any other. We show that our optimization is convex and can be solved efﬁciently for large data sets. Experiments on the OHSUMED medical journal data base yield state-of-the-art results on topic categorization. 1</p><p>4 0.56603515 <a title="149-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>5 0.56493121 <a title="149-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_Robust_Query_Models_with_Convex_Optimization.html">73 nips-2008-Estimating Robust Query Models with Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevyn Collins-thompson</p><p>Abstract: Query expansion is a long-studied approach for improving retrieval effectiveness by enhancing the user’s original query with additional related words. Current algorithms for automatic query expansion can often improve retrieval accuracy on average, but are not robust: that is, they are highly unstable and have poor worst-case performance for individual queries. To address this problem, we introduce a novel formulation of query expansion as a convex optimization problem over a word graph. The model combines initial weights from a baseline feedback algorithm with edge weights based on word similarity, and integrates simple constraints to enforce set-based criteria such as aspect balance, aspect coverage, and term centrality. Results across multiple standard test collections show consistent and signiﬁcant reductions in the number and magnitude of expansion failures, while retaining the strong positive gains of the baseline algorithm. Our approach does not assume a particular retrieval model, making it applicable to a broad class of existing expansion algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.56472158 <a title="149-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Transformational_Invariants_from_Natural_Movies.html">118 nips-2008-Learning Transformational Invariants from Natural Movies</a></p>

<p>Author: Adrian Haith, Carl P. Jackson, R. C. Miall, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation of visually guided reaching movements in novel visuomotor environments (e.g. wearing prism goggles) comprises not only motor adaptation but also substantial sensory adaptation, corresponding to shifts in the perceived spatial location of visual and proprioceptive cues. Previous computational models of the sensory component of visuomotor adaptation have assumed that it is driven purely by the discrepancy introduced between visual and proprioceptive estimates of hand position and is independent of any motor component of adaptation. We instead propose a uniﬁed model in which sensory and motor adaptation are jointly driven by optimal Bayesian estimation of the sensory and motor contributions to perceived errors. Our model is able to account for patterns of performance errors during visuomotor adaptation as well as the subsequent perceptual aftereﬀects. This uniﬁed model also makes the surprising prediction that force ﬁeld adaptation will elicit similar perceptual shifts, even though there is never any discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive observations. We conﬁrm this prediction with an experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.1597943 <a title="241-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-An_Empirical_Analysis_of_Domain_Adaptation_Algorithms_for_Genomic_Sequence_Analysis.html">19 nips-2008-An Empirical Analysis of Domain Adaptation Algorithms for Genomic Sequence Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Yishay Mansour, Mehryar Mohri, Afshin Rostamizadeh</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the problem of domain adaptation with multiple sources. For each source domain, the distribution over the input points as well as a hypothesis with error at most ǫ are given. The problem consists of combining these hypotheses to derive a hypothesis with small error with respect to the target domain. We present several theoretical results relating to this problem. In particular, we prove that standard convex combinations of the source hypotheses may in fact perform very poorly and that, instead, combinations weighted by the source distributions beneﬁt from favorable theoretical guarantees. Our main result shows that, remarkably, for any ﬁxed target function, there exists a distribution weighted combining rule that has a loss of at most ǫ with respect to any target mixture of the source distributions. We further generalize the setting from a single target function to multiple consistent target functions and show the existence of a combining rule with error at most 3ǫ. Finally, we report empirical results for a multiple source adaptation problem with a real-world dataset.</p><p>5 0.13081568 <a title="241-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>6 0.12379458 <a title="241-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Recurrent_Temporal_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machine.html">237 nips-2008-The Recurrent Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine</a></p>

<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Graham W. Taylor</p><p>Abstract: The Temporal Restricted Boltzmann Machine (TRBM) is a probabilistic model for sequences that is able to successfully model (i.e., generate nice-looking samples of) several very high dimensional sequences, such as motion capture data and the pixels of low resolution videos of balls bouncing in a box. The major disadvantage of the TRBM is that exact inference is extremely hard, since even computing a Gibbs update for a single variable of the posterior is exponentially expensive. This difﬁculty has necessitated the use of a heuristic inference procedure, that nonetheless was accurate enough for successful learning. In this paper we introduce the Recurrent TRBM, which is a very slight modiﬁcation of the TRBM for which exact inference is very easy and exact gradient learning is almost tractable. We demonstrate that the RTRBM is better than an analogous TRBM at generating motion capture and videos of bouncing balls. 1</p><p>6 0.52407753 <a title="241-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Adapting_to_a_Market_Shock%3A_Optimal_Sequential_Market-Making.html">13 nips-2008-Adapting to a Market Shock: Optimal Sequential Market-Making</a></p>

<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Mrinal Kalakrishnan, Sethu Vijayakumar, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: In kernel-based regression learning, optimizing each kernel individually is useful when the data density, curvature of regression surfaces (or decision boundaries) or magnitude of output noise varies spatially. Previous work has suggested gradient descent techniques or complex statistical hypothesis methods for local kernel shaping, typically requiring some amount of manual tuning of meta parameters. We introduce a Bayesian formulation of nonparametric regression that, with the help of variational approximations, results in an EM-like algorithm for simultaneous estimation of regression and kernel parameters. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, requires no sampling, automatically rejects outliers and has only one prior to be speciﬁed. It can be used for nonparametric regression with local polynomials or as a novel method to achieve nonstationary regression with Gaussian processes. Our methods are particularly useful for learning control, where reliable estimation of local tangent planes is essential for adaptive controllers and reinforcement learning. We evaluate our methods on several synthetic data sets and on an actual robot which learns a task-level control law. 1</p><p>2 0.80466032 <a title="241-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Variational_Mixture_of_Gaussian_Process_Experts.html">249 nips-2008-Variational Mixture of Gaussian Process Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Chao Yuan, Claus Neubauer</p><p>Abstract: Mixture of Gaussian processes models extended a single Gaussian process with ability of modeling multi-modal data and reduction of training complexity. Previous inference algorithms for these models are mostly based on Gibbs sampling, which can be very slow, particularly for large-scale data sets. We present a new generative mixture of experts model. Each expert is still a Gaussian process but is reformulated by a linear model. This breaks the dependency among training outputs and enables us to use a much faster variational Bayesian algorithm for training. Our gating network is more ﬂexible than previous generative approaches as inputs for each expert are modeled by a Gaussian mixture model. The number of experts and number of Gaussian components for an expert are inferred automatically. A variety of tests show the advantages of our method. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78547966 <a title="241-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Transfer_Learning_by_Distribution_Matching_for_Targeted_Advertising.html">241 nips-2008-Transfer Learning by Distribution Matching for Targeted Advertising</a></p>

Transfer learning enables us to make predictions even for new portals with few or no training data and improves the overall prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.76524311 <a title="241-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-DiscLDA%3A_Discriminative_Learning_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification.html">64 nips-2008-DiscLDA: Discriminative Learning for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Lacoste-julien, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have become popular as methods for dimensionality reduction in collections of text documents or images. These models are usually treated as generative models and trained using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. In this paper, we discuss an alternative: a discriminative framework in which we assume that supervised side information is present, and in which we wish to take that side information into account in ﬁnding a reduced dimensionality representation. Speciﬁcally, we present DiscLDA, a discriminative variation on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in which a class-dependent linear transformation is introduced on the topic mixture proportions. This parameter is estimated by maximizing the conditional likelihood. By using the transformed topic mixture proportions as a new representation of documents, we obtain a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that uncovers the latent structure in a document collection while preserving predictive power for the task of classiﬁcation. We compare the predictive power of the latent structure of DiscLDA with unsupervised LDA on the 20 Newsgroups document classiﬁcation task and show how our model can identify shared topics across classes as well as class-dependent topics.</p><p>5 0.66647202 <a title="241-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>
<p>Author: Iain Murray, David MacKay, Ryan P. Adams</p><p>Abstract: We present the Gaussian Process Density Sampler (GPDS), an exchangeable generative model for use in nonparametric Bayesian density estimation. Samples drawn from the GPDS are consistent with exact, independent samples from a ﬁxed density function that is a transformation of a function drawn from a Gaussian process prior. Our formulation allows us to infer an unknown density from data using Markov chain Monte Carlo, which gives samples from the posterior distribution over density functions and from the predictive distribution on data space. We can also infer the hyperparameters of the Gaussian process. We compare this density modeling technique to several existing techniques on a toy problem and a skullreconstruction task. 1</p><p>6 0.66019952 <a title="241-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">234 nips-2008-The Infinite Factorial Hidden Markov Model</a></p>

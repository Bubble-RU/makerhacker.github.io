<p>Author: Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for the simultaneous, unsupervised segmentation and discovery of visual object categories from image databases. Examining a large set of manually segmented scenes, we show that object frequencies and segment sizes both follow power law distributions, which are well modeled by the Pitman–Yor (PY) process. This nonparametric prior distribution leads to learning algorithms which discover an unknown set of objects, and segmentation methods which automatically adapt their resolution to each image. Generalizing previous applications of PY processes, we use Gaussian processes to discover spatially contiguous segments which respect image boundaries. Using a novel family of variational approximations, our approach produces segmentations which compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods, while simultaneously discovering categories shared among natural scenes. 1</p><p>3 0.23469067 <a title="42-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>4 0.17630148 <a title="42-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Hybrid_Models_for_Image_Annotation_with_Partially_Labeled_Data.html">116 nips-2008-Learning Hybrid Models for Image Annotation with Partially Labeled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>5 0.16066001 <a title="42-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Level_Active_Prediction_of_Useful_Image_Annotations_for_Recognition.html">142 nips-2008-Multi-Level Active Prediction of Useful Image Annotations for Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a framework for actively learning visual categories from a mixture of weakly and strongly labeled image examples. We propose to allow the categorylearner to strategically choose what annotations it receives—based on both the expected reduction in uncertainty as well as the relative costs of obtaining each annotation. We construct a multiple-instance discriminative classiﬁer based on the initial training data. Then all remaining unlabeled and weakly labeled examples are surveyed to actively determine which annotation ought to be requested next. After each request, the current classiﬁer is incrementally updated. Unlike previous work, our approach accounts for the fact that the optimal use of manual annotation may call for a combination of labels at multiple levels of granularity (e.g., a full segmentation on some images and a present/absent ﬂag on others). As a result, it is possible to learn more accurate category models with a lower total expenditure of manual annotation effort. 1</p><p>6 0.15321048 <a title="42-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Shape-Based_Object_Localization_for_Descriptive_Classification.html">207 nips-2008-Shape-Based Object Localization for Descriptive Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Jennifer Tam, Jiri Simsa, Sean Hyde, Luis V. Ahn</p><p>Abstract: CAP TCHAs are computer-generated tests that humans can pass but current computer systems cannot. CAP TCHAs provide a method for automatically distinguishing a human from a computer program, and therefore can protect Web services from abuse by so-called “bots.” Most CAP TCHAs consist of distorted images, usually text, for which a user must provide some description. Unfortunately, visual CAP TCHAs limit access to the millions of visually impaired people using the Web. Audio CAP TCHAs were created to solve this accessibility issue; however, the security of audio CAP TCHAs was never formally tested. Some visual CAP TCHAs have been broken using machine learning techniques, and we propose using similar ideas to test the security of audio CAP TCHAs. Audio CAP TCHAs are generally composed of a set of words to be identified, layered on top of noise. We analyzed the security of current audio CAP TCHAs from popular Web sites by using AdaBoost, SVM, and k-NN, and achieved correct solutions for test samples with accuracy up to 71%. Such accuracy is enough to consider these CAPTCHAs broken. Training several different machine learning algorithms on different types of audio CAP TCHAs allowed us to analyze the strengths and weaknesses of the algorithms so that we could suggest a design for a more robust audio CAPTCHA. 1 Int rod uct i o n CAP TCHAs [1] are automated tests designed to tell computers and humans apart by presenting users with a problem that humans can solve but current computer programs cannot. Because CAPTCHAs can distinguish between humans and computers with high probability, they are used for many different security applications: they prevent bots from voting continuously in online polls, automatically registering for millions of spam email accounts, automatically purchasing tickets to buy out an event, etc. Once a CAP TCHA is broken (i.e., computer programs can successfully pass the test), bots can impersonate humans and gain access to services that they should not. Therefore, it is important for CAP TCHAs to be secure. To pass the typical visual CAP TCHA, a user must correctly type the characters displayed in an image of distorted text. Many visual CAP TCHAs have been broken with machine learning techniques [2]-[3], though some remain secure against such attacks. Because visually impaired users who surf the Web using screen-reading programs cannot see this type of CAPTCHA, audio CAP TCHAs were created. Typical audio CAP TCHAs consist of one or several speakers saying letters or digits at randomly spaced intervals. A user must correctly identify the digits or characters spoken in the audio file to pass the CAP TCHA. To make this test difficult for current computer systems, specifically automatic speech recognition (ASR) programs, background noise is injected into the audio files. Since no official evaluation of existing audio CAP TCHAs has been reported, we tested the security of audio CAP TCHAs used by many popular Web sites by running machine learning experiments designed to break them. In the next section, we provide an overview of the literature related to our project. Section 3 describes our methods for creating training data, and section 4 describes how we create classifiers that can recognize letters, digits, and noise. In section 5, we discuss how we evaluated our methods on widely used audio CAP TCHAs and we give our results. In particular, we show that the audio CAP TCHAs used by sites such as Google and Digg are susceptible to machine learning attacks. Section 6 mentions the proposed design of a new more secure audio CAP TCHA based on our findings. 2 Lit erat u r e r ev i ew To break the audio CAP TCHAs, we derive features from the CAP TCHA audio and use several machine learning techniques to perform ASR on segments of the CAPTCHA. There are many popular techniques for extracting features from speech. The three techniques we use are mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC), perceptual linear prediction (PLP), and relative spectral transform-PLP (RAS TA-PLP). MFCC is one of the most popular speech feature representations used. Similar to a fast Fourier transform (FF T), MFCC transforms an audio file into frequency bands, but (unlike FF T) MFCC uses mel-frequency bands, which are better for approximating the range of frequencies humans hear. PLP was designed to extract speaker-independent features from speech [4]. Therefore, by using PLP and a variant such as RAS TA-PL P, we were able to train our classifiers to recognize letters and digits independently of who spoke them. Since many different people recorded the digits used in one of the types of audio CAP TCHAs we tested, PLP and RAS TA-PLP were needed to extract the features that were most useful for solving them. In [4]-[5], the authors conducted experiments on recognizing isolated digits in the presence of noise using both PLP and RAS TA-PL P. However, the noise used consisted of telephone or microphone static caused by recording in different locations. The audio CAP TCHAs we use contain this type of noise, as well as added vocal noise and/or music, which is supposed to make the automated recognition process much harder. The authors of [3] emphasize how many visual CAP TCHAs can be broken by successfully splitting the task into two smaller tasks: segmentation and recognition. We follow a similar approach in that we first automatically split the audio into segments, and then we classify these segments as noise or words. In early March 2008, concurrent to our work, the blog of Wintercore Labs [6] claimed to have successfully broken the Google audio CAP TCHA. After reading their Web article and viewing the video of how they solve the CAP TCHAs, we are unconvinced that the process is entirely automatic, and it is unclear what their exact pass rate is. Because we are unable to find any formal technical analysis of this program, we can neither be sure of its accuracy nor the extent of its automation. 3 Cr e at i o n of tra i n i n g dat a Since automated programs can attempt to pass a CAPTCHA repeatedly, a CAPTCHA is essentially broken when a program can pass it more than a non-trivial fraction of the time; e.g., a 5% pass rate is enough. Our approach to breaking the audio CAP TCHAs began by first splitting the audio files into segments of noise or words: for our experiments, the words were spoken letters or digits. We used manual transcriptions of the audio CAP TCHAs to get information regarding the location of each spoken word within the audio file. We were able to label our segments accurately by using this information. We gathered 1,000 audio CAP TCHAs from each of the following Web sites: google.com, digg.com, and an older version of the audio CAP TCHA in recaptcha.net. Each of the CAP TCHAs was annotated with the information regarding letter/digit locations provided by the manual transcriptions. For each type of CAPTCHA, we randomly selected 900 samples for training and used the remaining 100 for testing. Using the digit/letter location information provided in the manual CAP TCHA transcriptions, each training CAP TCHA is divided into segments of noise, the letters a-z, or the digits 0-9, and labeled as such. We ignore the annotation information of the CAP TCHAs we use for testing, and therefore we cannot identify the size of those segments. Instead, each test CAP TCHA is divided into a number of fixed-size segments. The segments with the highest energy peaks are then classified using machine learning techniques (Figure 1). Since the size of a feature vector extracted from a segment generally depends on the size of the segment, using fixed-size segments allows each segment to be described with a feature vector of the same length. We chose the window size by listening to a few training segments and adjusted accordingly to ensure that the segment contained the entire digit/letter. There is undoubtedly a more optimal way of selecting the window size, however, we were still able to break the three CAP TCHAs we tested with our method. Figure 1: A test audio CAP TCHA with the fixed-size segments containing the highest energy peaks highlighted. The information provided in the manual transcriptions of the audio CAP TCHAs contains a list of the time intervals within which words are spoken. However, these intervals are of variable size and the word might be spoken anywhere within this interval. To provide fixedsize segments for training, we developed the following heuristic. First, divide each file into variable-size segments using the time intervals provided and label each segment accordingly. Then, within each segment, detect the highest energy peak and return its fixed-size neighborhood labeled with the current segment’s label. This heuristic achieved nearly perfect labeling accuracy for the training set. Rare mistakes occurred when the highest energy peak of a digit or letter segment corresponded to noise rather than to a digit or letter. To summarize this subsection, an audio file is transformed into a set of fixed-size segments labeled as noise, a digit between 0 and 9, or a letter between a and z. These segments are then used for training. Classifiers are trained for one type of CAPTCHA at a time. 4 C l a s s i f i e r con s t ru ct i o n From the training data we extracted five sets of features using twelve MFCCs and twelfth- order spectral (SPEC) and cepstral (CEPS) coefficients from PLP Matlab functions for extracting these features were provided online Voicebox package. We use AdaBoost, SVM, and k-NN algorithms digit and letter recognition. We detail our implementation of following subsections. 4 .1 and RAS TA-PL P. The at [7] and as part of the to implement automated each algorithm in the AdaBoost Using decision stumps as weak classifiers for AdaBoost, anywhere from 11 to 37 ensemble classifiers are built. The number of classifiers built depends on which type of CAPTCHA we are solving. Each classifier trains on all the segments associated with that type of CAP TCHA, and for the purpose of building a single classifier, segments are labeled by either -1 (negative example) or +1 (positive example). Using cross-validation, we choose to use 50 iterations for our AdaBoost algorithm. A segment can then be classified as a particular letter, digit, or noise according to the ensemble classifier that outputs the number closest to 1. 4 .2 S u p p o rt v e ct o r m a c h i n e To conduct digit recognition with SVM, we used the C++ implementations of libSVM [8] version 2.85 with C-SMV and RBF kernel. First, all feature values are scaled to the range of -1 to 1 as suggested by [8]. The scale parameters are stored so that test samples can be scaled accordingly. Then, a single multiclass classifier is created for each set of features using all the segments for a particular type of CAPTCHA. We use cross-validation and grid search to discover the optimal slack penalty (C=32) and kernel parameter (γ=0.011). 4 .3 k - n e a re st n e i g h b o r ( k - N N ) We use k-NN as our final method for classifying digits. For each type of CAP TCHA, five different classifiers are created by using all of the training data and the five sets of features associated with that particular type of CAP TCHA. Again we use cross-validation to discover the optimal parameter, in this case k=1. We use Euclidian distance as our distance metric. 5 Ass e s sm e n t of cu rre n t a ud i o CAPTCHAs Our method for solving CAP TCHAs iteratively extracts an audio segment from a CAP TCHA, inputs the segment to one of our digit or letter recognizers, and outputs the label for that segment. We continue this process until the maximum solution size is reached or there are no unlabeled segments left. Some of the CAPTCHAs we evaluated have solutions that vary in length. Our method ensures that we get solutions of varying length that are never longer than the maximum solution length. A segment to be classified is identified by taking the neighborhood of the highest energy peak of an as yet unlabeled part of the CAP TCHA. Once a prediction of the solution to the CAPTCHA is computed, it is compared to the true solution. Given that at least one of the audio CAP TCHAs allows users to make a mistake in one of the digits (e.g., reCAPTCHA), we compute the pass rate for each of the different types of CAPTCHAs with all of the following conditions: • The prediction matches the true solution exactly. • Inserting one digit into the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. • Replacing one digit in the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. • Removing one digit from the prediction would make it match the solution exactly. However, since we are only sure that these conditions apply to reCAPTCHA audio CAP TCHAs, we also calculate the percentage of exact solution matches in our results for each type of audio CAP TCHA. These results are described in the following subsections. 5 .1 Goog le Google audio CAP TCHAs consist of one speaker saying random digits 0-9, the phrase “once again,” followed by the exact same recorded sequence of digits originally presented. The background noise consists of human voices speaking backwards at varying volumes. A solution can range in length from five to eight words. We set our classifier to find the 12 loudest segments and classify these segments as digits or noise. Because the phrase “once again” marks the halfway point of the CAPTCHA, we preprocessed the audio to only serve this half of the CAP TCHA to our classifiers. It is important to note, however, that the classifiers were always able to identify the segment containing “once again,” and these segments were identified before all other segments. Therefore, if necessary, we could have had our system cut the file in half after first labeling this segment. For AdaBoost, we create 12 classifiers: one classifier for each digit, one for noise, and one for the phrase “once again.” Our results ( Table 1) show that at best we achieved a 90% pass rate using the “one mistake” passing conditions and a 66% exact solution match rate. Using SVM and the “one mistake” passing conditions, at best we achieve a 92% pass rate and a 67% exact solution match. For k-NN, the “one mistake” pass rate is 62% and the exact solution match rate is 26%. Table 1: Google audio CAP TCHA results: Maximum 67% accuracy was achieved by SVM. Classifiers Used AdaBoost SVM k-NN one mistake exact match one mistake exact match 88% 61% 92% 67% 30% 1% PLPSPEC 90% 66% 90% 67% 60% 26% PLPCEPS 90% 66% 92% 67% 62% 23% RAS TAPLPSPEC 88% 48% 90% 61% 29% 1% RAS TAPLPCEPS 5 .2 exact match MFCC Features Used One mistake 90% 63% 92% 67% 33% 2% Digg Digg CAP TCHAs also consist of one speaker, in this case saying a random combination of letters and digits. The background noise consists of static or what sounds like trickling water and is not continuous throughout the entire file. We noticed in our training data that the following characters were never present in a solution: 0, 1, 2, 5, 7, 9, i, o, z. Since the Digg audio CAPTCHA is also the verbal transcription of the visual CAP TCHA, we believe that these characters are excluded to avoid confusion between digits and letters that are similar in appearance. The solution length varies between three and six words. Using AdaBoost, we create 28 classifiers: one classifier for each digit or letter that appears in our training data and one classifier for noise. Perhaps because we had fewer segments to train with and there was a far higher proportion of noise segments, AdaBoost failed to produce any correct solutions. We believe that the overwhelming number of negative training examples versus the small number of positive training samples used to create each decision stump severely affected AdaBoost’s ability to classify audio segments correctly. A histogram of the training samples is provided in Figure 2 to illustrate the amount of training data available for each character. When using SVM, the best feature set passed with 96% using “one mistake” passing conditions and passed with 71% when matching the solution exactly. For k-NN, the best feature set produced a 90% “one mistake” pass rate and a 49% exact solution match. Full results can be found in Table 2.

The background noise consists of human voices speaking backwards at varying volumes. The solution is always eight digits long. For AdaBoost, we create 11 classifiers: one classifier for each digit and one classifier for noise. Because we know that the reCAPTCHA passing conditions are the “one mistake” passing conditions, SVM produces our best pass rate of 58%. Our best exact match rate is 45% ( Table 3). Table 3: reCAPTCHA audio CAP TCHA results: Maximum 45% accuracy was achieved by SVM.

Google had the next strongest CAP TCHAs followed by the strongest from reCAPTCHA. Although the Digg CAP TCHAs have the largest vocabulary, giving us less training data per label, the same woman recorded them all. More importantly, the same type of noise is used throughout the entire CAPTCHA. The noise sounds like running water and static which sounds very different from the human voice and does not produce the same energy spikes needed to locate segments, therefore making segmentation quite easy. The CAP TCHAs from Google and reCAPTCHA used other human voices for background noise, making segmentation much more difficult. Although Google used a smaller vocabulary than Digg and also only used one speaker, Google’s background noise made the CAP TCHA more difficult to solve. After listening to a few of Google’s CAP TCHAs, we noticed that although the background noise consisted of human voices, the same background noise was repeated. reCAP TCHA had similar noise to Google, but they had a larger selection of noise thus making it harder to learn. reCAP TCHA also has the longest solution length making it more difficult to get perfectly correct. Finally, reCAPTCHA used many different speakers causing it to be the strongest CAP TCHA of the three we tested. In conclusion, an audio CAP TCHA that consists of a finite vocabulary and background noise should have multiple speakers and noise similar to the speakers. 7 Recomm e n d at i o n s f or creat i n g st ro n g e r aud i o CAPTCHAs Due to our success in solving audio CAP TCHAs, we have decided to start developing new audio CAP TCHAs that our methods, and machine learning methods in general, will be less likely to solve. From our experiments, we note that CAP TCHAs containing longer solutions and multiple speakers tend to be more difficult to solve. Also, because our methods depend on the amount of training data we have, having a large vocabulary would make it more difficult to collect enough training data. Already since obtaining these results, reCAPTCHA.net has updated their audio CAP TCHA to contain more distortions and a larger vocabulary: the digits 0 through 99. In designing a new audio CAP TCHA we are also concerned with the human pass rate. The current human pass rate for the reCAPTCHA audio CAP TCHAs is only 70%. To develop an audio CAP TCHA with an improved human pass rate, we plan to take advantage of the human mind’s ability to understand distorted audio through context clues. By listening to a phrase instead of to random isolated words, humans are better able to decipher distorted utterances because they are familiar with the phrase or can use contextual clues to decipher the distorted audio. Using this idea, the audio for our new audio CAP TCHA will be taken from old-time radio programs in which the poor quality of the audio makes transcription by ASR systems difficult. Users will be presented with an audio clip consisting of a 4-6 word phrase. Half of the CAPTCHA consists of words, which validate a user to be human, while the other half of the words need to be transcribed. This is the same idea behind the visual reCAP TCHA that is currently digitizing text on which OCR fails. We expect that this new audio CAP TCHA will be more secure than the current version and easier for humans to pass. Initial experiments using this idea show this to be true [9]. 8 Co n c l u s i o n We have succeeded in “breaking” three different types of widely used audio CAP TCHAs, even though these were developed with the purpose of defeating attacks by machine learning techniques. We believe our results can be improved by selecting optimal segment sizes, but that is unnecessary given our already high success rate. For our experiments, segment sizes were not chosen in a special way; occasionally yielding results in which a segment only contained half of a word, causing our prediction to contain that particular word twice. We also believe that the AdaBoost results can be improved, particularly for the Digg audio CAP TCHAs, by ensuring that the number of negative training samples is closer to the number of positive training samples. We have shown that our approach is successful and can be used with many different audio CAP TCHAs that contain small finite vocabularies.

<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Benjamin Packer, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative tasks, including object categorization and detection, are central components of high-level computer vision. Sometimes, however, we are interested in more reﬁned aspects of the object in an image, such as pose or particular regions. In this paper we develop a method (LOOPS) for learning a shape and image feature model that can be trained on a particular object class, and used to outline instances of the class in novel images. Furthermore, while the training data consists of uncorresponded outlines, the resulting LOOPS model contains a set of landmark points that appear consistently across instances, and can be accurately localized in an image. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in precisely outlining objects that exhibit large deformations and articulations in cluttered natural images. These localizations can then be used to address a range of tasks, including descriptive classiﬁcation, search, and clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.69155085 <a title="42-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Multi-Level_Active_Prediction_of_Useful_Image_Annotations_for_Recognition.html">142 nips-2008-Multi-Level Active Prediction of Useful Image Annotations for Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Stephen Gould, Ashutosh Saxena, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difﬁcult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classiﬁers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited “black box” interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classiﬁers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction. 1</p><p>2 0.7704159 <a title="42-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Dependence_of_Orientation_Tuning_on_Recurrent_Excitation_and_Inhibition_in_a_Network_Model_of_V1.html">58 nips-2008-Dependence of Orientation Tuning on Recurrent Excitation and Inhibition in a Network Model of V1</a></p>
<p>Author: Klaus Wimmer, Marcel Stimberg, Robert Martin, Lars Schwabe, Jorge Mariño, James Schummers, David C. Lyon, Mriganka Sur, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: The computational role of the local recurrent network in primary visual cortex is still a matter of debate. To address this issue, we analyze intracellular recording data of cat V1, which combine measuring the tuning of a range of neuronal properties with a precise localization of the recording sites in the orientation preference map. For the analysis, we consider a network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type neurons arranged according to a biologically plausible two-dimensional topographic orientation preference map. We then systematically vary the strength of the recurrent excitation and inhibition relative to the strength of the afferent input. Each parametrization gives rise to a different model instance for which the tuning of model neurons at different locations of the orientation map is compared to the experimentally measured orientation tuning of membrane potential, spike output, excitatory, and inhibitory conductances. A quantitative analysis shows that the data provides strong evidence for a network model in which the afferent input is dominated by strong, balanced contributions of recurrent excitation and inhibition. This recurrent regime is close to a regime of “instability”, where strong, self-sustained activity of the network occurs. The ﬁring rate of neurons in the best-ﬁtting network is particularly sensitive to small modulations of model parameters, which could be one of the functional beneﬁts of a network operating in this particular regime. 1</p><p>3 0.72444355 <a title="42-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Recursive_Segmentation_and_Recognition_Templates_for_2D_Parsing.html">191 nips-2008-Recursive Segmentation and Recognition Templates for 2D Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Leo Zhu, Yuanhao Chen, Yuan Lin, Chenxi Lin, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: Language and image understanding are two major goals of artiﬁcial intelligence which can both be conceptually formulated in terms of parsing the input signal into a hierarchical representation. Natural language researchers have made great progress by exploiting the 1D structure of language to design efﬁcient polynomialtime parsing algorithms. By contrast, the two-dimensional nature of images makes it much harder to design efﬁcient image parsers and the form of the hierarchical representations is also unclear. Attempts to adapt representations and algorithms from natural language have only been partially successful. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Image Model (HIM) for 2D image parsing which outputs image segmentation and object recognition. This HIM is represented by recursive segmentation and recognition templates in multiple layers and has advantages for representation, inference, and learning. Firstly, the HIM has a coarse-to-ﬁne representation which is capable of capturing long-range dependency and exploiting different levels of contextual information. Secondly, the structure of the HIM allows us to design a rapid inference algorithm, based on dynamic programming, which enables us to parse the image rapidly in polynomial time. Thirdly, we can learn the HIM efﬁciently in a discriminative manner from a labeled dataset. We demonstrate that HIM outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by evaluation on the challenging public MSRC image dataset. Finally, we sketch how the HIM architecture can be extended to model more complex image phenomena. 1</p><p>4 0.71625733 <a title="42-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-PSDBoost%3A_Matrix-Generation_Linear_Programming_for_Positive_Semidefinite_Matrices_Learning.html">175 nips-2008-PSDBoost: Matrix-Generation Linear Programming for Positive Semidefinite Matrices Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Alan Welsh, Lei Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this work, we consider the problem of learning a positive semideﬁnite matrix. The critical issue is how to preserve positive semideﬁniteness during the course of learning. Our algorithm is mainly inspired by LPBoost [1] and the general greedy convex optimization framework of Zhang [2]. We demonstrate the essence of the algorithm, termed PSDBoost (positive semideﬁnite Boosting), by focusing on a few different applications in machine learning. The proposed PSDBoost algorithm extends traditional Boosting algorithms in that its parameter is a positive semideﬁnite matrix with trace being one instead of a classiﬁer. PSDBoost is based on the observation that any trace-one positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into linear convex combinations of trace-one rank-one matrices, which serve as base learners of PSDBoost. Numerical experiments are presented. 1</p><p>5 0.71076679 <a title="42-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Characterizing_response_behavior_in_multisensory_perception_with_conflicting_cues.html">46 nips-2008-Characterizing response behavior in multisensory perception with conflicting cues</a></p>

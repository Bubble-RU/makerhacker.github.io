<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the graph structure associated with a Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (GMRF) from i.i.d. samples. We study the performance of study the performance of the ℓ1 -regularized maximum likelihood estimator in the high-dimensional setting, where the number of nodes in the graph p, the number of edges in the graph s and the maximum node degree d, are allowed to grow as a function of the number of samples n. Our main result provides sufﬁcient conditions on (n, p, d) for the ℓ1 -regularized MLE estimator to recover all the edges of the graph with high probability. Under some conditions on the model covariance, we show that model selection can be achieved for sample sizes n = Ω(d2 log(p)), with the error decaying as O(exp(−c log(p))) for some constant c. We illustrate our theoretical results via simulations and show good correspondences between the theoretical predictions and behavior in simulations.</p><p>3 0.066673681 <a title="54-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Differentiable_Sparse_Coding.html">62 nips-2008-Differentiable Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, David M. Bradley</p><p>Abstract: Prior work has shown that features which appear to be biologically plausible as well as empirically useful can be found by sparse coding with a prior such as a laplacian (L1 ) that promotes sparsity. We show how smoother priors can preserve the beneﬁts of these sparse priors while adding stability to the Maximum A-Posteriori (MAP) estimate that makes it more useful for prediction problems. Additionally, we show how to calculate the derivative of the MAP estimate efﬁciently with implicit differentiation. One prior that can be differentiated this way is KL-regularization. We demonstrate its effectiveness on a wide variety of applications, and ﬁnd that online optimization of the parameters of the KL-regularized model can signiﬁcantly improve prediction performance. 1</p><p>4 0.051936559 <a title="54-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-High-dimensional_support_union_recovery_in_multivariate_regression.html">99 nips-2008-High-dimensional support union recovery in multivariate regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Guillaume R. Obozinski, Martin J. Wainwright, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression, where a K-dimensional response vector is regressed upon a ﬁxed set of p covariates. The problem of support union recovery is to recover the subset of covariates that are active in at least one of the regression problems. Studying this problem under high-dimensional scaling (where the problem parameters as well as sample size n tend to inﬁnity simultaneously), our main result is to show that exact recovery is possible once the order parameter given by θ 1 / 2 (n, p, s) : = n/[2ψ(B ∗ ) log(p − s)] exceeds a critical threshold. Here n is the sample size, p is the ambient dimension of the regression model, s is the size of the union of supports, and ψ(B ∗ ) is a sparsity-overlap function that measures a combination of the sparsities and overlaps of the K-regression coefﬁcient vectors that constitute the model. This sparsity-overlap function reveals that block 1 / 2 regularization for multivariate regression never harms performance relative to a naive 1 -approach, and can yield substantial improvements in sample complexity (up to a factor of K) when the regression vectors are suitably orthogonal relative to the design. We complement our theoretical results with simulations that demonstrate the sharpness of the result, even for relatively small problems. 1</p><p>5 0.051359497 <a title="54-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Efficient_Exact_Inference_in_Planar_Ising_Models.html">69 nips-2008-Efficient Exact Inference in Planar Ising Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicol N. Schraudolph, Dmitry Kamenetsky</p><p>Abstract: We give polynomial-time algorithms for the exact computation of lowest-energy states, worst margin violators, partition functions, and marginals in certain binary undirected graphical models. Our approach provides an interesting alternative to the well-known graph cut paradigm in that it does not impose any submodularity constraints; instead we require planarity to establish a correspondence with perfect matchings in an expanded dual graph. Maximum-margin parameter estimation for a boundary detection task shows our approach to be efﬁcient and effective.

<p>Author: Cédric Archambeau, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: We present a generative model for performing sparse probabilistic projections, which includes sparse principal component analysis and sparse canonical correlation analysis as special cases. Sparsity is enforced by means of automatic relevance determination or by imposing appropriate prior distributions, such as generalised hyperbolic distributions. We derive a variational Expectation-Maximisation algorithm for the estimation of the hyperparameters and show that our novel probabilistic approach compares favourably to existing techniques. We illustrate how the proposed method can be applied in the context of cryptoanalysis as a preprocessing tool for the construction of template attacks. 1</p><p>3 0.57391852 <a title="54-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations. While our framework is generally applicable to any type of vector ﬁeld, we focus in this paper on applying it to solving the EEG/MEG inverse problem. It is shown that signiﬁcantly more precise and neurophysiologically more plausible location and shape estimates of cerebral current sources from EEG/MEG measurements become possible with our method when comparing to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.54918247 <a title="54-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Model_Selection_in_Gaussian_Graphical_Models%3A_High-Dimensional_Consistency_of_%5Cboldmath%24%5Cell_1%24-regularized_MLE.html">135 nips-2008-Model Selection in Gaussian Graphical Models: High-Dimensional Consistency of \boldmath$\ell 1$-regularized MLE</a></p>

<p>Author: Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) has become established as one of the key tools for dimensionality reduction when dealing with real valued data. Approaches such as exponential family PCA and non-negative matrix factorisation have successfully extended PCA to non-Gaussian data types, but these techniques fail to take advantage of Bayesian inference and can suffer from problems of overﬁtting and poor generalisation. This paper presents a fully probabilistic approach to PCA, which is generalised to the exponential family, based on Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. We describe the model which is based on a factorisation of the observed data matrix, and show performance of the model on both synthetic and real data. 1</p><p>6 0.4951053 <a title="54-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Resolution_Limits_of_Sparse_Coding_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2008-Resolution Limits of Sparse Coding in High Dimensions</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Michael I. Jordan, Dit-Yan Yeung</p><p>Abstract: Kernel supervised learning methods can be uniﬁed by utilizing the tools from regularization theory. The duality between regularization and prior leads to interpreting regularization methods in terms of maximum a posteriori estimation and has motivated Bayesian interpretations of kernel methods. In this paper we pursue a Bayesian interpretation of sparsity in the kernel setting by making use of a mixture of a point-mass distribution and prior that we refer to as “Silverman’s g-prior.” We provide a theoretical analysis of the posterior consistency of a Bayesian model choice procedure based on this prior. We also establish the asymptotic relationship between this procedure and the Bayesian information criterion. 1</p><p>3 0.69677818 <a title="54-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-QUIC-SVD%3A_Fast_SVD_Using_Cosine_Trees.html">188 nips-2008-QUIC-SVD: Fast SVD Using Cosine Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael P. Holmes, Jr. Isbell, Charles Lee, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The Singular Value Decomposition is a key operation in many machine learning methods. Its computational cost, however, makes it unscalable and impractical for applications involving large datasets or real-time responsiveness, which are becoming increasingly common. We present a new method, QUIC-SVD, for fast approximation of the whole-matrix SVD based on a new sampling mechanism called the cosine tree. Our empirical tests show speedups of several orders of magnitude over exact SVD. Such scalability should enable QUIC-SVD to accelerate and enable a wide array of SVD-based methods and applications. 1</p><p>4 0.64765286 <a title="54-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Hierarchical_Fisher_Kernels_for_Longitudinal_Data.html">97 nips-2008-Hierarchical Fisher Kernels for Longitudinal Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhengdong Lu, Jeffrey Kaye, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: We develop new techniques for time series classiﬁcation based on hierarchical Bayesian generative models (called mixed-effect models) and the Fisher kernel derived from them. A key advantage of the new formulation is that one can compute the Fisher information matrix despite varying sequence lengths and varying sampling intervals. This avoids the commonly-used ad hoc replacement of the Fisher information matrix with the identity which destroys the geometric invariance of the kernel. Our construction retains the geometric invariance, resulting in a kernel that is properly invariant under change of coordinates in the model parameter space. Experiments on detecting cognitive decline show that classiﬁers based on the proposed kernel out-perform those based on generative models and other feature extraction routines, and on Fisher kernels that use the identity in place of the Fisher information.</p><p>5 0.56187141 <a title="54-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Dynamic_visual_attention%3A_searching_for_coding_length_increments.html">66 nips-2008-Dynamic visual attention: searching for coding length increments</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodi Hou, Liqing Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A visual attention system should respond placidly when common stimuli are presented, while at the same time keep alert to anomalous visual inputs. In this paper, a dynamic visual attention model based on the rarity of features is proposed. We introduce the Incremental Coding Length (ICL) to measure the perspective entropy gain of each feature. The objective of our model is to maximize the entropy of the sampled visual features. In order to optimize energy consumption, the limit amount of energy of the system is re-distributed amongst features according to their Incremental Coding Length. By selecting features with large coding length increments, the computational system can achieve attention selectivity in both static and dynamic scenes. We demonstrate that the proposed model achieves superior accuracy in comparison to mainstream approaches in static saliency map generation. Moreover, we also show that our model captures several less-reported dynamic visual search behaviors, such as attentional swing and inhibition of return. 1</p><p>6 0.55520517 <a title="54-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-High-dimensional_support_union_recovery_in_multivariate_regression.html">99 nips-2008-High-dimensional support union recovery in multivariate regression</a></p>

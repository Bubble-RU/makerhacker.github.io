<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>3 0.17451523 <a title="48-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Clustered_Multi-Task_Learning%3A_A_Convex_Formulation.html">47 nips-2008-Clustered Multi-Task Learning: A Convex Formulation</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Jacob, Jean-philippe Vert, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: In multi-task learning several related tasks are considered simultaneously, with the hope that by an appropriate sharing of information across tasks, each task may beneﬁt from the others. In the context of learning linear functions for supervised classiﬁcation or regression, this can be achieved by including a priori information about the weight vectors associated with the tasks, and how they are expected to be related to each other. In this paper, we assume that tasks are clustered into groups, which are unknown beforehand, and that tasks within a group have similar weight vectors. We design a new spectral norm that encodes this a priori assumption, without the prior knowledge of the partition of tasks into groups, resulting in a new convex optimization formulation for multi-task learning. We show in simulations on synthetic examples and on the IEDB MHC-I binding dataset, that our approach outperforms well-known convex methods for multi-task learning, as well as related non-convex methods dedicated to the same problem. 1</p><p>4 0.16847076 <a title="48-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Blaschko, Arthur Gretton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a family of unsupervised algorithms, numerical taxonomy clustering, to simultaneously cluster data, and to learn a taxonomy that encodes the relationship between the clusters. The algorithms work by maximizing the dependence between the taxonomy and the original data. The resulting taxonomy is a more informative visualization of complex data than simple clustering; in addition, taking into account the relations between different clusters is shown to substantially improve the quality of the clustering, when compared with state-ofthe-art algorithms in the literature (both spectral clustering and a previous dependence maximization approach). We demonstrate our algorithm on image and text data. 1</p><p>5 0.15129088 <a title="48-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Measures_of_Clustering_Quality%3A_A_Working_Set_of_Axioms_for_Clustering.html">132 nips-2008-Measures of Clustering Quality: A Working Set of Axioms for Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Margareta Ackerman</p><p>Abstract: Aiming towards the development of a general clustering theory, we discuss abstract axiomatization for clustering. In this respect, we follow up on the work of Kleinberg, ([1]) that showed an impossibility result for such axiomatization. We argue that an impossibility result is not an inherent feature of clustering, but rather, to a large extent, it is an artifact of the speciﬁc formalism used in [1]. As opposed to previous work focusing on clustering functions, we propose to address clustering quality measures as the object to be axiomatized. We show that principles like those formulated in Kleinberg’s axioms can be readily expressed in the latter framework without leading to inconsistency. A clustering-quality measure (CQM) is a function that, given a data set and its partition into clusters, returns a non-negative real number representing how strong or conclusive the clustering is. We analyze what clustering-quality measures should look like and introduce a set of requirements (axioms) for such measures. Our axioms capture the principles expressed by Kleinberg’s axioms while retaining consistency. We propose several natural clustering quality measures, all satisfying the proposed axioms. In addition, we analyze the computational complexity of evaluating the quality of a given clustering and show that, for the proposed CQMs, it can be computed in polynomial time. 1</p><p>6 0.14704494 <a title="48-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Cyclizing_Clusters_via_Zeta_Function_of_a_Graph.html">55 nips-2008-Cyclizing Clusters via Zeta Function of a Graph</a></p>

<p>Author: Deli Zhao, Xiaoou Tang</p><p>Abstract: Detecting underlying clusters from large-scale data plays a central role in machine learning research. In this paper, we tackle the problem of clustering complex data of multiple distributions and multiple scales. To this end, we develop an algorithm named Zeta l-links (Zell) which consists of two parts: Zeta merging with a similarity graph and an initial set of small clusters derived from local l-links of samples. More speciﬁcally, we propose to structurize a cluster using cycles in the associated subgraph. A new mathematical tool, Zeta function of a graph, is introduced for the integration of all cycles, leading to a structural descriptor of a cluster in determinantal form. The popularity character of a cluster is conceptualized as the global fusion of variations of such a structural descriptor by means of the leave-one-out strategy in the cluster. Zeta merging proceeds, in the hierarchical agglomerative fashion, according to the maximum incremental popularity among all pairwise clusters. Experiments on toy data clustering, imagery pattern clustering, and image segmentation show the competitive performance of Zell. The 98.1% accuracy, in the sense of the normalized mutual information (NMI), is obtained on the FRGC face data of 16028 samples and 466 facial clusters. 1</p><p>5 0.82905686 <a title="48-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Learning_Taxonomies_by_Dependence_Maximization.html">117 nips-2008-Learning Taxonomies by Dependence Maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Vicençc Gómez, Andreas Kaltenbrunner, Vicente López, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: Large networks of spiking neurons show abrupt changes in their collective dynamics resembling phase transitions studied in statistical physics. An example of this phenomenon is the transition from irregular, noise-driven dynamics to regular, self-sustained behavior observed in networks of integrate-and-ﬁre neurons as the interaction strength between the neurons increases. In this work we show how a network of spiking neurons is able to self-organize towards a critical state for which the range of possible inter-spike-intervals (dynamic range) is maximized. Self-organization occurs via synaptic dynamics that we analytically derive. The resulting plasticity rule is deﬁned locally so that global homeostasis near the critical state is achieved by local regulation of individual synapses. 1</p><p>2 0.8568638 <a title="48-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Supervised_Bipartite_Graph_Inference.html">225 nips-2008-Supervised Bipartite Graph Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoshihiro Yamanishi</p><p>Abstract: We formulate the problem of bipartite graph inference as a supervised learning problem, and propose a new method to solve it from the viewpoint of distance metric learning. The method involves the learning of two mappings of the heterogeneous objects to a uniﬁed Euclidean space representing the network topology of the bipartite graph, where the graph is easy to infer. The algorithm can be formulated as an optimization problem in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We report encouraging results on the problem of compound-protein interaction network reconstruction from chemical structure data and genomic sequence data. 1</p><p>3 0.8164379 <a title="48-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Automatic_online_tuning_for_fast_Gaussian_summation.html">29 nips-2008-Automatic online tuning for fast Gaussian summation</a></p>
<p>Author: Vlad I. Morariu, Balaji V. Srinivasan, Vikas C. Raykar, Ramani Duraiswami, Larry S. Davis</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms require the summation of Gaussian kernel functions, an expensive operation if implemented straightforwardly. Several methods have been proposed to reduce the computational complexity of evaluating such sums, including tree and analysis based methods. These achieve varying speedups depending on the bandwidth, dimension, and prescribed error, making the choice between methods difﬁcult for machine learning tasks. We provide an algorithm that combines tree methods with the Improved Fast Gauss Transform (IFGT). As originally proposed the IFGT suffers from two problems: (1) the Taylor series expansion does not perform well for very low bandwidths, and (2) parameter selection is not trivial and can drastically affect performance and ease of use. We address the ﬁrst problem by employing a tree data structure, resulting in four evaluation methods whose performance varies based on the distribution of sources and targets and input parameters such as desired accuracy and bandwidth. To solve the second problem, we present an online tuning approach that results in a black box method that automatically chooses the evaluation method and its parameters to yield the best performance for the input data, desired accuracy, and bandwidth. In addition, the new IFGT parameter selection approach allows for tighter error bounds. Our approach chooses the fastest method at negligible additional cost, and has superior performance in comparisons with previous approaches. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.75727981 <a title="48-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Clustering_via_LP-based_Stabilities.html">48 nips-2008-Clustering via LP-based Stabilities</a></p>
<p>Author: Nikos Komodakis, Nikos Paragios, Georgios Tziritas</p><p>Abstract: A novel center-based clustering algorithm is proposed in this paper. We ﬁrst formulate clustering as an NP-hard linear integer program and we then use linear programming and the duality theory to derive the solution of this optimization problem. This leads to an efﬁcient and very general algorithm, which works in the dual domain, and can cluster data based on an arbitrary set of distances. Despite its generality, it is independent of initialization (unlike EM-like methods such as K-means), has guaranteed convergence, can automatically determine the number of clusters, and can also provide online optimality bounds about the quality of the estimated clustering solutions. To deal with the most critical issue in a centerbased clustering algorithm (selection of cluster centers), we also introduce the notion of stability of a cluster center, which is a well deﬁned LP-based quantity that plays a key role to our algorithm’s success. Furthermore, we also introduce, what we call, the margins (another key ingredient in our algorithm), which can be roughly thought of as dual counterparts to stabilities and allow us to obtain computationally efﬁcient approximations to the latter. Promising experimental results demonstrate the potentials of our method.</p><p>5 0.73641366 <a title="48-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Local_Gaussian_Process_Regression_for_Real_Time_Online_Model_Learning.html">125 nips-2008-Local Gaussian Process Regression for Real Time Online Model Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Duy Nguyen-tuong, Jan R. Peters, Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: Learning in real-time applications, e.g., online approximation of the inverse dynamics model for model-based robot control, requires fast online regression techniques. Inspired by local learning, we propose a method to speed up standard Gaussian process regression (GPR) with local GP models (LGP). The training data is partitioned in local regions, for each an individual GP model is trained. The prediction for a query point is performed by weighted estimation using nearby local models. Unlike other GP approximations, such as mixtures of experts, we use a distance based measure for partitioning of the data and weighted prediction. The proposed method achieves online learning and prediction in real-time. Comparisons with other non-parametric regression methods show that LGP has higher accuracy than LWPR and close to the performance of standard GPR and ν-SVR. 1</p><p>6 0.59739077 <a title="48-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Online_Metric_Learning_and_Fast_Similarity_Search.html">168 nips-2008-Online Metric Learning and Fast Similarity Search</a></p>

<p>Author: Jo-anne Ting, Mrinal Kalakrishnan, Sethu Vijayakumar, Stefan Schaal</p><p>Abstract: In kernel-based regression learning, optimizing each kernel individually is useful when the data density, curvature of regression surfaces (or decision boundaries) or magnitude of output noise varies spatially. Previous work has suggested gradient descent techniques or complex statistical hypothesis methods for local kernel shaping, typically requiring some amount of manual tuning of meta parameters. We introduce a Bayesian formulation of nonparametric regression that, with the help of variational approximations, results in an EM-like algorithm for simultaneous estimation of regression and kernel parameters. The algorithm is computationally efﬁcient, requires no sampling, automatically rejects outliers and has only one prior to be speciﬁed. It can be used for nonparametric regression with local polynomials or as a novel method to achieve nonstationary regression with Gaussian processes. Our methods are particularly useful for learning control, where reliable estimation of local tangent planes is essential for adaptive controllers and reinforcement learning. We evaluate our methods on several synthetic data sets and on an actual robot which learns a task-level control law. 1</p><p>3 0.13405816 <a title="249-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Accelerating_Bayesian_Inference_over_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">12 nips-2008-Accelerating Bayesian Inference over Nonlinear Differential Equations with Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Calderhead, Mark Girolami, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: Identiﬁcation and comparison of nonlinear dynamical system models using noisy and sparse experimental data is a vital task in many ﬁelds, however current methods are computationally expensive and prone to error due in part to the nonlinear nature of the likelihood surfaces induced. We present an accelerated sampling procedure which enables Bayesian inference of parameters in nonlinear ordinary and delay differential equations via the novel use of Gaussian processes (GP). Our method involves GP regression over time-series data, and the resulting derivative and time delay estimates make parameter inference possible without solving the dynamical system explicitly, resulting in dramatic savings of computational time. We demonstrate the speed and statistical accuracy of our approach using examples of both ordinary and delay differential equations, and provide a comprehensive comparison with current state of the art methods. 1</p><p>4 0.13148828 <a title="249-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-MCBoost%3A_Multiple_Classifier_Boosting_for_Perceptual_Co-clustering_of_Images_and_Visual_Features.html">130 nips-2008-MCBoost: Multiple Classifier Boosting for Perceptual Co-clustering of Images and Visual Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Tae-kyun Kim, Roberto Cipolla</p><p>Abstract: We present a new co-clustering problem of images and visual features. The problem involves a set of non-object images in addition to a set of object images and features to be co-clustered. Co-clustering is performed in a way that maximises discrimination of object images from non-object images, thus emphasizing discriminative features. This provides a way of obtaining perceptual joint-clusters of object images and features. We tackle the problem by simultaneously boosting multiple strong classiﬁers which compete for images by their expertise. Each boosting classiﬁer is an aggregation of weak-learners, i.e. simple visual features. The obtained classiﬁers are useful for object detection tasks which exhibit multimodalities, e.g. multi-category and multi-view object detection tasks. Experiments on a set of pedestrian images and a face data set demonstrate that the method yields intuitive image clusters with associated features and is much superior to conventional boosting classiﬁers in object detection tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.13122532 <a title="249-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_human_function_learning_with_Gaussian_processes.html">138 nips-2008-Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas L. Griffiths, Chris Lucas, Joseph Williams, Michael L. Kalish</p><p>Abstract: Accounts of how people learn functional relationships between continuous variables have tended to focus on two possibilities: that people are estimating explicit functions, or that they are performing associative learning supported by similarity. We provide a rational analysis of function learning, drawing on work on regression in machine learning and statistics. Using the equivalence of Bayesian linear regression and Gaussian processes, we show that learning explicit rules and using similarity can be seen as two views of one solution to this problem. We use this insight to deﬁne a Gaussian process model of human function learning that combines the strengths of both approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.11541327 <a title="249-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Gates.html">89 nips-2008-Gates</a></p>

<p>Author: Mauricio Alvarez, Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: We present a sparse approximation approach for dependent output Gaussian processes (GP). Employing a latent function framework, we apply the convolution process formalism to establish dependencies between output variables, where each latent function is represented as a GP. Based on these latent functions, we establish an approximation scheme using a conditional independence assumption between the output processes, leading to an approximation of the full covariance which is determined by the locations at which the latent functions are evaluated. We show results of the proposed methodology for synthetic data and real world applications on pollution prediction and a sensor network. 1</p><p>3 0.59034342 <a title="249-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Accelerating_Bayesian_Inference_over_Nonlinear_Differential_Equations_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">12 nips-2008-Accelerating Bayesian Inference over Nonlinear Differential Equations with Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>6 0.54043072 <a title="249-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-Modeling_human_function_learning_with_Gaussian_processes.html">138 nips-2008-Modeling human function learning with Gaussian processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Steffen Bickel, Christoph Sawade, Tobias Scheffer</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers for several related tasks that may differ in their joint distribution of input and output variables. For each task, small – possibly even empty – labeled samples and large unlabeled samples are available. While the unlabeled samples reﬂect the target distribution, the labeled samples may be biased. This setting is motivated by the problem of predicting sociodemographic features for users of web portals, based on the content which they have accessed. Here, questionnaires offered to a portion of each portal’s users produce biased samples. We derive a transfer learning procedure that produces resampling weights which match the pool of all examples to the target distribution of any given task. Transfer learning enables us to make predictions even for new portals with few or no training data and improves the overall prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.59488499 <a title="249-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-DiscLDA%3A_Discriminative_Learning_for_Dimensionality_Reduction_and_Classification.html">64 nips-2008-DiscLDA: Discriminative Learning for Dimensionality Reduction and Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Lacoste-julien, Fei Sha, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic topic models have become popular as methods for dimensionality reduction in collections of text documents or images. These models are usually treated as generative models and trained using maximum likelihood or Bayesian methods. In this paper, we discuss an alternative: a discriminative framework in which we assume that supervised side information is present, and in which we wish to take that side information into account in ﬁnding a reduced dimensionality representation. Speciﬁcally, we present DiscLDA, a discriminative variation on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) in which a class-dependent linear transformation is introduced on the topic mixture proportions. This parameter is estimated by maximizing the conditional likelihood. By using the transformed topic mixture proportions as a new representation of documents, we obtain a supervised dimensionality reduction algorithm that uncovers the latent structure in a document collection while preserving predictive power for the task of classiﬁcation. We compare the predictive power of the latent structure of DiscLDA with unsupervised LDA on the 20 Newsgroups document classiﬁcation task and show how our model can identify shared topics across classes as well as class-dependent topics.</p><p>5 0.46526363 <a title="249-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-The_Infinite_Factorial_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">234 nips-2008-The Infinite Factorial Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Jurgen V. Gael, Yee W. Teh, Zoubin Ghahramani</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new probability distribution over a potentially inﬁnite number of binary Markov chains which we call the Markov Indian buffet process. This process extends the IBP to allow temporal dependencies in the hidden variables. We use this stochastic process to build a nonparametric extension of the factorial hidden Markov model. After constructing an inference scheme which combines slice sampling and dynamic programming we demonstrate how the inﬁnite factorial hidden Markov model can be used for blind source separation. 1</p><p>6 0.46017542 <a title="249-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-The_Gaussian_Process_Density_Sampler.html">233 nips-2008-The Gaussian Process Density Sampler</a></p>

<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence, Magnus Rattray, Michalis K. Titsias</p><p>Abstract: Sampling functions in Gaussian process (GP) models is challenging because of the highly correlated posterior distribution. We describe an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for sampling from the posterior process of the GP model. This algorithm uses control variables which are auxiliary function values that provide a low dimensional representation of the function. At each iteration, the algorithm proposes new values for the control variables and generates the function from the conditional GP prior. The control variable input locations are found by minimizing an objective function. We demonstrate the algorithm on regression and classiﬁcation problems and we use it to estimate the parameters of a differential equation model of gene regulation. 1</p><p>3 0.1451215 <a title="193-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Learning_with_Networks_of_Features.html">194 nips-2008-Regularized Learning with Networks of Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Ted Sandler, John Blitzer, Partha P. Talukdar, Lyle H. Ungar</p><p>Abstract: For many supervised learning problems, we possess prior knowledge about which features yield similar information about the target variable. In predicting the topic of a document, we might know that two words are synonyms, and when performing image recognition, we know which pixels are adjacent. Such synonymous or neighboring features are near-duplicates and should be expected to have similar weights in an accurate model. Here we present a framework for regularized learning when one has prior knowledge about which features are expected to have similar and dissimilar weights. The prior knowledge is encoded as a network whose vertices are features and whose edges represent similarities and dissimilarities between them. During learning, each feature’s weight is penalized by the amount it differs from the average weight of its neighbors. For text classiﬁcation, regularization using networks of word co-occurrences outperforms manifold learning and compares favorably to other recently proposed semi-supervised learning methods. For sentiment analysis, feature networks constructed from declarative human knowledge signiﬁcantly improve prediction accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.13248123 <a title="193-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Learning_with_Consistency_between_Inductive_Functions_and_Kernels.html">122 nips-2008-Learning with Consistency between Inductive Functions and Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Haixuan Yang, Irwin King, Michael Lyu</p><p>Abstract: Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithms have the ability to avoid over-ﬁtting problems and to express solutions as kernel expansions. However, we observe that the current RLS algorithms cannot provide a satisfactory interpretation even on the penalty of a constant function. Based on the intuition that a good kernelbased inductive function should be consistent with both the data and the kernel, a novel learning scheme is proposed. The advantages of this scheme lie in its corresponding Representer Theorem, its strong interpretation ability about what kind of functions should not be penalized, and its promising accuracy improvements shown in a number of experiments. Furthermore, we provide a detailed technical description about heat kernels, which serves as an example for the readers to apply similar techniques for other kernels. Our work provides a preliminary step in a new direction to explore the varying consistency between inductive functions and kernels under various distributions. 1</p><p>5 0.12265114 <a title="193-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Semi-supervised_Learning_with_Weakly-Related_Unlabeled_Data_%3A_Towards_Better_Text_Categorization.html">205 nips-2008-Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data : Towards Better Text Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Liu Yang, Rong Jin, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: The cluster assumption is exploited by most semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, if the unlabeled data is merely weakly related to the target classes, it becomes questionable whether driving the decision boundary to the low density regions of the unlabeled data will help the classiﬁcation. In such case, the cluster assumption may not be valid; and consequently how to leverage this type of unlabeled data to enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy becomes a challenge. We introduce “Semi-supervised Learning with Weakly-Related Unlabeled Data” (SSLW), an inductive method that builds upon the maximum-margin approach, towards a better usage of weakly-related unlabeled information. Although the SSLW could improve a wide range of classiﬁcation tasks, in this paper, we focus on text categorization with a small training pool. The key assumption behind this work is that, even with different topics, the word usage patterns across different corpora tends to be consistent. To this end, SSLW estimates the optimal wordcorrelation matrix that is consistent with both the co-occurrence information derived from the weakly-related unlabeled documents and the labeled documents. For empirical evaluation, we present a direct comparison with a number of stateof-the-art methods for inductive semi-supervised learning and text categorization. We show that SSLW results in a signiﬁcant improvement in categorization accuracy, equipped with a small training set and an unlabeled resource that is weakly related to the test domain.</p><p>6 0.10921748 <a title="193-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Learning_the_Semantic_Correlation%3A_An_Alternative_Way_to_Gain_from_Unlabeled_Text.html">120 nips-2008-Learning the Semantic Correlation: An Alternative Way to Gain from Unlabeled Text</a></p>

<p>Author: Yi Zhang, Artur Dubrawski, Jeff G. Schneider</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the question of what kind of knowledge is generally transferable from unlabeled text. We suggest and analyze the semantic correlation of words as a generally transferable structure of the language and propose a new method to learn this structure using an appropriately chosen latent variable model. This semantic correlation contains structural information of the language space and can be used to control the joint shrinkage of model parameters for any speciﬁc task in the same space through regularization. In an empirical study, we construct 190 different text classiﬁcation tasks from a real-world benchmark, and the unlabeled documents are a mixture from all these tasks. We test the ability of various algorithms to use the mixed unlabeled text to enhance all classiﬁcation tasks. Empirical results show that the proposed approach is a reliable and scalable method for semi-supervised learning, regardless of the source of unlabeled data, the speciﬁc task to be enhanced, and the prediction model used.</p><p>4 0.51650739 <a title="193-lsi-4" href="./nips-2008-Look_Ma%2C_No_Hands%3A_Analyzing_the_Monotonic_Feature_Abstraction_for_Text_Classification.html">128 nips-2008-Look Ma, No Hands: Analyzing the Monotonic Feature Abstraction for Text Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Doug Downey, Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: Is accurate classiﬁcation possible in the absence of hand-labeled data? This paper introduces the Monotonic Feature (MF) abstraction—where the probability of class membership increases monotonically with the MF’s value. The paper proves that when an MF is given, PAC learning is possible with no hand-labeled data under certain assumptions. We argue that MFs arise naturally in a broad range of textual classiﬁcation applications. On the classic “20 Newsgroups” data set, a learner given an MF and unlabeled data achieves classiﬁcation accuracy equal to that of a state-of-the-art semi-supervised learner relying on 160 hand-labeled examples. Even when MFs are not given as input, their presence or absence can be determined from a small amount of hand-labeled data, which yields a new semi-supervised learning method that reduces error by 15% on the 20 Newsgroups data. 1</p><p>5 0.49651173 <a title="193-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Localized_Sliced_Inverse_Regression.html">126 nips-2008-Localized Sliced Inverse Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, Le Song, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Object matching is a fundamental operation in data analysis. It typically requires the deﬁnition of a similarity measure between the classes of objects to be matched. Instead, we develop an approach which is able to perform matching by requiring a similarity measure only within each of the classes. This is achieved by maximizing the dependency between matched pairs of observations by means of the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. This problem can be cast as one of maximizing a quadratic assignment problem with special structure and we present a simple algorithm for ﬁnding a locally optimal solution. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86500931 <a title="193-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Regularized_Co-Clustering_with_Dual_Supervision.html">193 nips-2008-Regularized Co-Clustering with Dual Supervision</a></p>

Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of our algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.85547543 <a title="193-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Fast_Computation_of_Posterior_Mode_in_Multi-Level_Hierarchical_Models.html">82 nips-2008-Fast Computation of Posterior Mode in Multi-Level Hierarchical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Liang Zhang, Deepak Agarwal</p><p>Abstract: Multi-level hierarchical models provide an attractive framework for incorporating correlations induced in a response variable that is organized hierarchically. Model ﬁtting is challenging, especially for a hierarchy with a large number of nodes. We provide a novel algorithm based on a multi-scale Kalman ﬁlter that is both scalable and easy to implement. For Gaussian response, we show our method provides the maximum a-posteriori (MAP) parameter estimates; for non-Gaussian response, parameter estimation is performed through a Laplace approximation. However, the Laplace approximation provides biased parameter estimates that is corrected through a parametric bootstrap procedure. We illustrate through simulation studies and analyses of real world data sets in health care and online advertising.</p><p>4 0.85410368 <a title="193-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Structured_ranking_learning_using_cumulative_distribution_networks.html">224 nips-2008-Structured ranking learning using cumulative distribution networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Jim C. Huang, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Ranking is at the heart of many information retrieval applications. Unlike standard regression or classiﬁcation in which we predict outputs independently, in ranking we are interested in predicting structured outputs so that misranking one object can signiﬁcantly affect whether we correctly rank the other objects. In practice, the problem of ranking involves a large number of objects to be ranked and either approximate structured prediction methods are required, or assumptions of independence between object scores must be made in order to make the problem tractable. We present a probabilistic method for learning to rank using the graphical modelling framework of cumulative distribution networks (CDNs), where we can take into account the structure inherent to the problem of ranking by modelling the joint cumulative distribution functions (CDFs) over multiple pairwise preferences. We apply our framework to the problem of document retrieval in the case of the OHSUMED benchmark dataset. We will show that the RankNet, ListNet and ListMLE probabilistic models can be viewed as particular instances of CDNs and that our proposed framework allows for the exploration of a broad class of ﬂexible structured loss functionals for learning to rank. 1</p><p>5 0.71766722 <a title="193-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-Kernel_Measures_of_Independence_for_non-iid_Data.html">112 nips-2008-Kernel Measures of Independence for non-iid Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Xinhua Zhang, Le Song, Arthur Gretton, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many machine learning algorithms can be formulated in the framework of statistical independence such as the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion. In this paper, we extend this criterion to deal with structured and interdependent observations. This is achieved by modeling the structures using undirected graphical models and comparing the Hilbert space embeddings of distributions. We apply this new criterion to independent component analysis and sequence clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.64914137 <a title="193-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Diffeomorphic_Dimensionality_Reduction.html">61 nips-2008-Diffeomorphic Dimensionality Reduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption. However, real shapes from image datasets, even when expected to be related by “almost isometric” transformations, are actually subject not only to noise but also, to some limited degree, to variations in appearance and scale. In this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction. The outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is robust in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations. Our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models, while maintaining similar running times. 1</p><p>3 0.22213529 <a title="207-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Sparse_Signal_Recovery_Using_Markov_Random_Fields.html">215 nips-2008-Sparse Signal Recovery Using Markov Random Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuming He, Richard S. Zemel</p><p>Abstract: Extensive labeled data for image annotation systems, which learn to assign class labels to image regions, is difﬁcult to obtain. We explore a hybrid model framework for utilizing partially labeled data that integrates a generative topic model for image appearance with discriminative label prediction. We propose three alternative formulations for imposing a spatial smoothness prior on the image labels. Tests of the new models and some baseline approaches on three real image datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of incorporating the latent structure. 1</p><p>5 0.15321048 <a title="207-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Cascaded_Classification_Models%3A_Combining_Models_for_Holistic_Scene_Understanding.html">42 nips-2008-Cascaded Classification Models: Combining Models for Holistic Scene Understanding</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Stephen Gould, Ashutosh Saxena, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: One of the original goals of computer vision was to fully understand a natural scene. This requires solving several sub-problems simultaneously, including object detection, region labeling, and geometric reasoning. The last few decades have seen great progress in tackling each of these problems in isolation. Only recently have researchers returned to the difﬁcult task of considering them jointly. In this work, we consider learning a set of related models in such that they both solve their own problem and help each other. We develop a framework called Cascaded Classiﬁcation Models (CCM), where repeated instantiations of these classiﬁers are coupled by their input/output variables in a cascade that improves performance at each level. Our method requires only a limited “black box” interface with the models, allowing us to use very sophisticated, state-of-the-art classiﬁers without having to look under the hood. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on a large set of natural images by combining the subtasks of scene categorization, object detection, multiclass image segmentation, and 3d reconstruction. 1</p><p>6 0.14940165 <a title="207-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Ijaz Akhter, Yaser Sheikh, Sohaib Khan, Takeo Kanade</p><p>Abstract: Existing approaches to nonrigid structure from motion assume that the instantaneous 3D shape of a deforming object is a linear combination of basis shapes, which have to be estimated anew for each video sequence. In contrast, we propose that the evolving 3D structure be described by a linear combination of basis trajectories. The principal advantage of this approach is that we do not need to estimate any basis vectors during computation. We show that generic bases over trajectories, such as the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) basis, can be used to compactly describe most real motions. This results in a signiﬁcant reduction in unknowns, and corresponding stability in estimation. We report empirical performance, quantitatively using motion capture data, and qualitatively on several video sequences exhibiting nonrigid motions including piece-wise rigid motion, partially nonrigid motion (such as a facial expression), and highly nonrigid motion (such as a person dancing). 1</p><p>6 0.53885955 <a title="207-lsi-6" href="./nips-2008-A_%60%60Shape_Aware%27%27_Model_for_semi-supervised_Learning_of_Objects_and_its_Context.html">6 nips-2008-A ``Shape Aware'' Model for semi-supervised Learning of Objects and its Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Ponzi, Jeff Wickens</p><p>Abstract: Cell assemblies exhibiting episodes of recurrent coherent activity have been observed in several brain regions including the striatum[1] and hippocampus CA3[2]. Here we address the question of how coherent dynamically switching assemblies appear in large networks of biologically realistic spiking neurons interacting deterministically. We show by numerical simulations of large asymmetric inhibitory networks with ﬁxed external excitatory drive that if the network has intermediate to sparse connectivity, the individual cells are in the vicinity of a bifurcation between a quiescent and ﬁring state and the network inhibition varies slowly on the spiking timescale, then cells form assemblies whose members show strong positive correlation, while members of different assemblies show strong negative correlation. We show that cells and assemblies switch between ﬁring and quiescent states with time durations consistent with a power-law. Our results are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental studies. The deterministic dynamical behaviour is related to winner-less competition[3], shown in small closed loop inhibitory networks with heteroclinic cycles connecting saddle-points. 1</p><p>2 0.85873866 <a title="207-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Deflation_Methods_for_Sparse_PCA.html">57 nips-2008-Deflation Methods for Sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Lester W. Mackey</p><p>Abstract: In analogy to the PCA setting, the sparse PCA problem is often solved by iteratively alternating between two subtasks: cardinality-constrained rank-one variance maximization and matrix deﬂation. While the former has received a great deal of attention in the literature, the latter is seldom analyzed and is typically borrowed without justiﬁcation from the PCA context. In this work, we demonstrate that the standard PCA deﬂation procedure is seldom appropriate for the sparse PCA setting. To rectify the situation, we ﬁrst develop several deﬂation alternatives better suited to the cardinality-constrained context. We then reformulate the sparse PCA optimization problem to explicitly reﬂect the maximum additional variance objective on each round. The result is a generalized deﬂation procedure that typically outperforms more standard techniques on real-world datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.84277785 <a title="207-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Translated_Learning%3A_Transfer_Learning_across_Different_Feature_Spaces.html">242 nips-2008-Translated Learning: Transfer Learning across Different Feature Spaces</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenyuan Dai, Yuqiang Chen, Gui-rong Xue, Qiang Yang, Yong Yu</p><p>Abstract: This paper investigates a new machine learning strategy called translated learning. Unlike many previous learning tasks, we focus on how to use labeled data from one feature space to enhance the classiﬁcation of other entirely different learning spaces. For example, we might wish to use labeled text data to help learn a model for classifying image data, when the labeled images are difﬁcult to obtain. An important aspect of translated learning is to build a “bridge” to link one feature space (known as the “source space”) to another space (known as the “target space”) through a translator in order to migrate the knowledge from source to target. The translated learning solution uses a language model to link the class labels to the features in the source spaces, which in turn is translated to the features in the target spaces. Finally, this chain of linkages is completed by tracing back to the instances in the target spaces. We show that this path of linkage can be modeled using a Markov chain and risk minimization. Through experiments on the text-aided image classiﬁcation and cross-language classiﬁcation tasks, we demonstrate that our translated learning framework can greatly outperform many state-of-the-art baseline methods. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.82262444 <a title="207-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Shape-Based_Object_Localization_for_Descriptive_Classification.html">207 nips-2008-Shape-Based Object Localization for Descriptive Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Benjamin Packer, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Discriminative tasks, including object categorization and detection, are central components of high-level computer vision. Sometimes, however, we are interested in more reﬁned aspects of the object in an image, such as pose or particular regions. In this paper we develop a method (LOOPS) for learning a shape and image feature model that can be trained on a particular object class, and used to outline instances of the class in novel images. Furthermore, while the training data consists of uncorresponded outlines, the resulting LOOPS model contains a set of landmark points that appear consistently across instances, and can be accurately localized in an image. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results in precisely outlining objects that exhibit large deformations and articulations in cluttered natural images. These localizations can then be used to address a range of tasks, including descriptive classiﬁcation, search, and clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.72766608 <a title="207-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-The_Conjoint_Effect_of_Divisive_Normalization_and_Orientation_Selectivity_on_Redundancy_Reduction.html">232 nips-2008-The Conjoint Effect of Divisive Normalization and Orientation Selectivity on Redundancy Reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Fabian H. Sinz, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: Bandpass ﬁltering, orientation selectivity, and contrast gain control are prominent features of sensory coding at the level of V1 simple cells. While the effect of bandpass ﬁltering and orientation selectivity can be assessed within a linear model, contrast gain control is an inherently nonlinear computation. Here we employ the class of Lp elliptically contoured distributions to investigate the extent to which the two features—orientation selectivity and contrast gain control—are suited to model the statistics of natural images. Within this framework we ﬁnd that contrast gain control can play a signiﬁcant role for the removal of redundancies in natural images. Orientation selectivity, in contrast, has only a very limited potential for redundancy reduction. 1</p><p>6 0.72239631 <a title="207-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-An_ideal_observer_model_of_infant_object_perception.html">23 nips-2008-An ideal observer model of infant object perception</a></p>

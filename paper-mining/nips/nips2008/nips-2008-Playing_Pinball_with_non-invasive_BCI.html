</p><p>4 Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training. [sent-20, score-0.689]
</p><p>5 The current study shows clearly that very compelling control with excellent timing and dynamics is possible for a non-invasive BCI. [sent-21, score-0.258]
</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Brain computer interfaces (BCI) have seen a rapid development towards faster and more userfriendly systems for thought-based control of devices such as video games, wheel chairs, robotic devices etc. [sent-22, score-0.369]
</p><p>7 While a full control of even complex trajectories has become possible for invasive BCIs [1, 2, 3], non-invasive EEG-based systems have been considered hardly able to provide such high information transfer rates between man and machine [4, 5]. [sent-23, score-0.226]
</p><p>8 This paper will show evidence that real-time BCI control of a machine is possible with little subject training. [sent-24, score-0.258]
</p><p>9 The machine studied (a standard pinball machine, see Fig. [sent-25, score-0.36]
</p><p>10 1 requires only two classes for control but a very fast and precise reaction; predictive behavior and learning are mandatory. [sent-26, score-0.197]
</p><p>11 We 1  consider it a formidable platform for studying timing and dynamics of brain control in real-time interaction with a physical machine. [sent-27, score-0.406]
</p><p>12 Furthermore this paradigm is well suited for future investigations of mental states during complex real-time tasks and decision-making processes. [sent-28, score-0.11]
</p><p>13 Figure 1: Left: pinball machine used for the present study. [sent-29, score-0.36]
</p><p>14 Compared to highly controlled and simpliﬁed lab settings, a pinball machine provides ﬂow (according to the deﬁnition in [6]), a rich and complex feedback, acoustic and visual distractors, and a challenging behavioral task. [sent-32, score-0.36]
</p><p>15 These components are well-known ingredients for engaging and immersive game environments [7]. [sent-33, score-0.135]
</p><p>16 In case of the pinball machine model used in this study, this receives further evidence from the high sales ﬁgures that have made the Addams Family model the all-time popular pinball machine. [sent-34, score-0.72]
</p><p>17 Given the reaction-time critical pinball game and the intrinsic delays imposed on the subjects by the BCI technology, it is very interesting to observe that subjects can manage to control and maintain the necessary timing and dynamics. [sent-35, score-0.935]
</p><p>18 The prediction of upcoming game situations and behavioral adaptation to the machine and BCI constraints are necessary ingredients to master this difﬁcult task. [sent-36, score-0.172]
</p><p>19 3 brieﬂy introduce the used motor paradigm, spatial ﬁlter methods, the experimental paradigm, the decoding and machine learning techniques used, Sec. [sent-39, score-0.164]
</p><p>20 1  Background Neurophysiology  Macroscopic brain activity during resting wakefulness contains distinct rhythms located over various brain areas. [sent-43, score-0.135]
</p><p>21 Sensorimotor cortices show rhythmic macroscopic EEG oscillations (µ-rhythm or sensorimotor rhythm, SMR), with spectral peak energies of about 8–14 Hz (α-band) and/or 16–28 Hz (β-band) localized in the motor and somatosensory cortex ([8]). [sent-44, score-0.151]
</p><p>22 A large class of EEG-based BCI systems relies on the fact that amplitude modulations of sensorimotor rhythms can be caused, e. [sent-45, score-0.077]
</p><p>23 For example, the power of the µ-rhythm decreases during imagined hand movements in the corresponding representation area which is located in the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. [sent-48, score-0.151]
</p><p>24 This phenomenon is called event-related desynchronization (ERD, [9, 10]), while the increase of band power is termed event-related synchronization (ERS). [sent-49, score-0.193]
</p><p>25 , during motor imagery over ﬂanking sensorimotor areas, possibly reﬂecting an ‘surround inhibition’ enhancing focal cortical activation, see [11, 10]. [sent-52, score-0.25]
</p><p>26 The exact location and the exact frequency band of the sensorimotor rhythm is subject-speciﬁc. [sent-53, score-0.214]
</p><p>27 Since variance of band-pass ﬁltered signals is equal to band power, CSP analysis is applied to band-pass ﬁltered signals in order to obtain an effective discrimination of mental states that are characterized by ERD/ERS effects (see above). [sent-66, score-0.235]
</p><p>28 right hand motor imagery, the CSP algorithm will ﬁnd two groups of spatial ﬁlters. [sent-68, score-0.133]
</p><p>29 The ﬁrst will show high band power during left hand motor imagery and low band power during right hand motor imagery, and the second vice versa. [sent-69, score-0.485]
</p><p>30 , the ith spatial ﬁlter) maximizes the variance for class 1, and since 1 − di is near 0, it also minimizes the variance for class 2. [sent-76, score-0.089]
</p><p>31 1  Experiment Paradigm  Standard EEG lab experiments typically realize an environment that avoids distractions in order to have maximum control over all parameters of the experiment. [sent-84, score-0.226]
</p><p>32 Since the subjects respond to a small number of artiﬁcial stimuli, a stimulus-locked averaging reveals the average characteristics of their brain response. [sent-85, score-0.144]
</p><p>33 However, gaining even only partial introspection into the system states of complex physical devices and into the interaction processes between the system and the mental processes of the user requires a huge effort. [sent-91, score-0.287]
</p><p>34 2  Setup  In this study seven subjects played with the pinball machine. [sent-101, score-0.485]
</p><p>35 One subject played successfully and enjoyed it, but was excluded from further analysis as his/her games had not been video-taped. [sent-103, score-0.243]
</p><p>36 From the remaining six subjects, three managed to acquire good control, played very successfully and enjoyed this experience. [sent-104, score-0.083]
</p><p>37 One subject managed to get limited control and reported to enjoy the games although some of his/her scores were close to chance. [sent-105, score-0.357]
</p><p>38 The performance of these four subjects was measured in a rigorous manner. [sent-106, score-0.091]
</p><p>39 The remaining two subjects could not establish reliable control and were also excluded from further analysis. [sent-107, score-0.288]
</p><p>40 The experiment was organized in several stages: the calibration of the BCI system (Sec. [sent-110, score-0.081]
</p><p>41 3), the ﬁne-tuning of parameters in a simple cursor feedback paradigm (Sec. [sent-112, score-0.133]
</p><p>42 4), the application of the BCI control system during pinball games (Sec. [sent-114, score-0.656]
</p><p>43 EEG Amplifier / Digitizer Feedback Filter (FQ / spatial) Classifier  Player  Low-level controller Paddle control signal  Figure 2: Schematic view of the BCI-controlled pinball machine. [sent-121, score-0.598]
</p><p>44 The user’s EEG signals upon motor imagery are ampliﬁed, digitized, ﬁltered in the frequency domain and the spatial domain by CSP. [sent-122, score-0.27]
</p><p>45 The classiﬁer output is translated by a low-level controller into paddle movements. [sent-124, score-0.218]
</p><p>46 3  Calibration of the BCI system  The BCI system was calibrated individually for each of the subjects (VPMa, VPks, VPzq, VPlf ) to discriminate two classes of motor imagery (left hand and right hand). [sent-126, score-0.264]
</p><p>47 The calibration procedure followed a standard Berlin BCI (BBCI) paradigm based on spatial ﬁlters and oscillatory features that avoids and prevents the use of class-correlated EOG or EMG artefacts (see [29, 28] for details). [sent-127, score-0.179]
</p><p>48 Visualizing the spatial ﬁlters and the resulting patterns of activity showed that EOG or EMG components were disregarded for the calibration of the BCI system. [sent-128, score-0.14]
</p><p>49 For the calibration, 100 (VPMa) or 75 (VPks, VPzq, VPlf ) trials of motor imagery were collected for each class. [sent-129, score-0.173]
</p><p>50 For every trial of 4–5s duration, the class of the motor imagery was indicated on a computer screen by visual cues. [sent-130, score-0.173]
</p><p>51 The calibration procedure included the determination of a subject-speciﬁc frequency band for the mu-rhythm (see Sec. [sent-131, score-0.169]
</p><p>52 All subjects showed a crossvalidation error below 10% on the calibration data. [sent-136, score-0.172]
</p><p>53 4  Cursor feedback control by BCI  The bias of the classiﬁer, a gain factor and thresholds for an idle-class (for classiﬁer outputs close to the decision plane) were adapted during a short control task running on a computer screen. [sent-138, score-0.436]
</p><p>54 The subject had to control a horizontally moving cursor to a target on the left or right side of the screen 4  for approximately 2 minutes while ﬁxating a cross in the center. [sent-139, score-0.31]
</p><p>55 For an exhaustive study on the role of bias adaptation in BCI, especially in the context of changing from calibration to feedback, see [30, 24]. [sent-142, score-0.118]
</p><p>56 5  Pinball control by BCI  A real, physical pinball machine (in our study an Addams Family model) needs good control in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and timing (dynamics). [sent-144, score-0.862]
</p><p>57 The subject has to learn the physical properties of the machine to play well. [sent-145, score-0.138]
</p><p>58 1) can cause the ball to go into rather unpredictable directions. [sent-147, score-0.119]
</p><p>59 This interaction with the pinball machine makes the game interesting and challenging. [sent-148, score-0.543]
</p><p>60 Fast brain dynamics that participate in the eye-hand coordination and visual memory play an essential role to cope with these difﬁculties. [sent-149, score-0.083]
</p><p>61 Three modiﬁcations were implemented in order to reduce the frequency of manual ball launches (1 and 3) and to increase the frequency of balls passing the paddle areas (1 and 2). [sent-152, score-0.41]
</p><p>62 While the original character of the game was not changed, the modiﬁcations introduced slight simpliﬁcation to conduct the experiment. [sent-153, score-0.135]
</p><p>63 side limits that prevents balls from exiting without passing the paddles 2. [sent-156, score-0.205]
</p><p>64 a soft central bump in front of the paddles that biases balls to pass one of the paddles rather than exiting in a perfect vertical trajectory. [sent-157, score-0.27]
</p><p>65 a reduced slope of the game ﬁeld (about half the original slope), that somewhat slows down the game speed. [sent-160, score-0.27]
</p><p>66 During the BCI-controlled gaming (”bci” control mode), the subject sat in front of the pinball machine, hands resting on the arm rests except for short times when new balls had to be launched with the pulling lever. [sent-161, score-0.872]
</p><p>67 The EEG signals recorded in the previous 500ms were translated by the BCI system into a control signal. [sent-162, score-0.273]
</p><p>68 A simple low-level control mechanism was implemented in software that translated the continuous classiﬁer output by thresholding into a three-class signal (left ﬂipper, idle, right ﬂipper) using the thresholds pre-determined during the cursor control (see Sec. [sent-163, score-0.525]
</p><p>69 Furthermore it introduced a logic that translated a very long lasting control signal for the left or right class into a hold-and-shoot mechanism. [sent-166, score-0.276]
</p><p>70 This allowed the user to catch slow balls rolling sideways down towards a paddle. [sent-167, score-0.146]
</p><p>71 The user played several games of 10 to 12 balls each. [sent-168, score-0.279]
</p><p>72 Performance was observed in terms of the playing time per ball, the score per game and the number of high-quality shots. [sent-169, score-0.207]
</p><p>73 6  Pseudo random control mode  This ”rand” control mode was incorporated into the experimental setup in order to deliver a fair performance baseline. [sent-172, score-0.578]
</p><p>74 Here, the BCI system was up and running with the same settings as in the BCI-controlled pinball game, but no player was present. [sent-173, score-0.36]
</p><p>75 Instead an EEG ﬁle previously recorded during the BCI-controlled pinball game was fed into the BCI system and generated the control signal for the pinball machine. [sent-174, score-1.093]
</p><p>76 These signals produced the same statistics of paddle movements as in the real feedback setting. [sent-175, score-0.303]
</p><p>77 But as the balls were launched at random time points, the paddle behavior was not synchronized with the ball positions. [sent-176, score-0.459]
</p><p>78 Therefore, the pseudo random control mode marks 5  the chance level of the system. [sent-177, score-0.327]
</p><p>79 In this mode several games of 10-12 balls each were performed. [sent-178, score-0.302]
</p><p>80 7  No control mode  For performance comparisons, two performance ratings (time per ball and points per game) were also taken for a series of balls that were launched without any paddle movements (”none” control mode). [sent-181, score-1.06]
</p><p>81 4  Results  As video recordings have been available for the four subjects, a detailed analysis of the game performances was possible. [sent-182, score-0.164]
</p><p>82 The analysis compares three different scoring measures for BCI control (bbci), pseudo-random control (rand) and no control (none) and shows the histogram of high-quality shots per ball. [sent-185, score-0.725]
</p><p>83 ball duration (median) is signiﬁcantly higher for the BCI-controlled gaming (average of 15s over 81 balls) than for the pseudo-random control (average of 8s over 112 balls). [sent-187, score-0.422]
</p><p>84 The increased average ball duration under BCI control is caused by the larger number of highquality shots per ball. [sent-191, score-0.491]
</p><p>85 While in pseudo-random control only 7% of the balls scored more than one high-quality shot per ball, this rate raises drastically to 45% for the BCI control of subject VPMa. [sent-192, score-0.645]
</p><p>86 A comparison of the game scores for 10 games of BCI control and 10 games of pseudo-random control shows, that these differ even stronger due to the nonlinear characteristic of the score. [sent-193, score-0.727]
</p><p>87 Again, BCI control is signiﬁcantly superior to the pseudo random control. [sent-198, score-0.235]
</p><p>88 The difference in normalized histograms between BCI control and pseudo random control reveals, that even for the pooled data BCI-controlled games more often have a larger number of high-quality shots. [sent-199, score-0.574]
</p><p>89 Not surprisingly, the BCI-controlled games showed a number of paddle movements in moments, when no ball was in the vicinity of the paddles. [sent-200, score-0.441]
</p><p>90 As pseudo-random control mode was able to gain signiﬁcantly better results than no control at all (see e. [sent-202, score-0.486]
</p><p>91 In order to study this issue, the pseudo-random control was based on an EEG ﬁle, which had been previously recorded during the BCI-controlled gaming, the dynamics of the paddle movements was identical during both of these control modes. [sent-206, score-0.617]
</p><p>92 Under these very similar conditions, the higher scores of the BCI control must be credited to the control ability of the BCI user, especially to the precise timing of a large number of paddle shots. [sent-207, score-0.635]
</p><p>93 A video of the gaming performance which provides an impression of the astonishing level of timing and dynamical control – much better than the ﬁgures can show – is available under http://www. [sent-208, score-0.352]
</p><p>94 Learning curves and traces of adaptation on the subject side, the use of error potentials as well as emerging subject speciﬁc strategy differences and many other exciting question must remain untouched in this ﬁrst study. [sent-217, score-0.159]
</p><p>95 Emotion, surprise and other mental states or cognitive processes that play an important role in such complex real-time paradigms still await their consideration in future studies. [sent-218, score-0.101]

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>3 0.10220225 <a title="180-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>
<p>Author: Stefan Haufe, Vadim V. Nikulin, Andreas Ziehe, Klaus-Robert Müller, Guido Nolte</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for estimating vector ﬁelds using sparse basis ﬁeld expansions (S-FLEX). The notion of basis ﬁelds, which are an extension of scalar basis functions, arises naturally in our framework from a rotational invariance requirement. We consider a regression setting as well as inverse problems. All variants discussed lead to second-order cone programming formulations.

<p>Author: Jeremy Hill, Jason Farquhar, Suzanna Martens, Felix Biessmann, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: From an information-theoretic perspective, a noisy transmission system such as a visual Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) speller could beneﬁt from the use of errorcorrecting codes. However, optimizing the code solely according to the maximal minimum-Hamming-distance criterion tends to lead to an overall increase in target frequency of target stimuli, and hence a signiﬁcantly reduced average target-to-target interval (TTI), leading to difﬁculties in classifying the individual event-related potentials (ERPs) due to overlap and refractory effects. Clearly any change to the stimulus setup must also respect the possible psychophysiological consequences. Here we report new EEG data from experiments in which we explore stimulus types and codebooks in a within-subject design, ﬁnding an interaction between the two factors. Our data demonstrate that the traditional, rowcolumn code has particular spatial properties that lead to better performance than one would expect from its TTIs and Hamming-distances alone, but nonetheless error-correcting codes can improve performance provided the right stimulus type is used. 1</p><p>5 0.08585529 <a title="180-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Unifying_the_Sensory_and_Motor_Components_of_Sensorimotor_Adaptation.html">244 nips-2008-Unifying the Sensory and Motor Components of Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrian Haith, Carl P. Jackson, R. C. Miall, Sethu Vijayakumar</p><p>Abstract: Adaptation of visually guided reaching movements in novel visuomotor environments (e.g. wearing prism goggles) comprises not only motor adaptation but also substantial sensory adaptation, corresponding to shifts in the perceived spatial location of visual and proprioceptive cues. Previous computational models of the sensory component of visuomotor adaptation have assumed that it is driven purely by the discrepancy introduced between visual and proprioceptive estimates of hand position and is independent of any motor component of adaptation. We instead propose a uniﬁed model in which sensory and motor adaptation are jointly driven by optimal Bayesian estimation of the sensory and motor contributions to perceived errors. Our model is able to account for patterns of performance errors during visuomotor adaptation as well as the subsequent perceptual aftereﬀects. This uniﬁed model also makes the surprising prediction that force ﬁeld adaptation will elicit similar perceptual shifts, even though there is never any discrepancy between visual and proprioceptive observations. We conﬁrm this prediction with an experiment. 1</p><p>6 0.075534016 <a title="180-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Temporal_Dynamics_of_Cognitive_Control.html">231 nips-2008-Temporal Dynamics of Cognitive Control</a></p>

In the present study, however, we demonstrate and report on the interaction of subjects with a real device: a pinball machine. Results of this study clearly show that fast and well-timed control well beyond chance level is possible, even though the environment is extremely rich and requires precisely timed and complex predictive behavior. Using machine learning methods for mental state decoding, BCI-based pinball control is possible within the ﬁrst session without the necessity to employ lengthy subject training.

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup</p><p>Abstract: EEG connectivity measures could provide a new type of feature space for inferring a subject’s intention in Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs). However, very little is known on EEG connectivity patterns for BCIs. In this study, EEG connectivity during motor imagery (MI) of the left and right is investigated in a broad frequency range across the whole scalp by combining Beamforming with Transfer Entropy and taking into account possible volume conduction effects. Observed connectivity patterns indicate that modulation intentionally induced by MI is strongest in the γ-band, i.e., above 35 Hz. Furthermore, modulation between MI and rest is found to be more pronounced than between MI of different hands. This is in contrast to results on MI obtained with bandpower features, and might provide an explanation for the so far only moderate success of connectivity features in BCIs. It is concluded that future studies on connectivity based BCIs should focus on high frequency bands and consider experimental paradigms that maximally vary cognitive demands between conditions. 1</p><p>3 0.58150917 <a title="180-lsi-3" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>

<p>Author: Lavi Shpigelman, Hagai Lalazar, Eilon Vaadia</p><p>Abstract: Using machine learning algorithms to decode intended behavior from neural activity serves a dual purpose. First, these tools allow patients to interact with their environment through a Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). Second, analyzing the characteristics of such methods can reveal the relative signiﬁcance of various features of neural activity, task stimuli, and behavior. In this study we adapted, implemented and tested a machine learning method called Kernel Auto-Regressive Moving Average (KARMA), for the task of inferring movements from neural activity in primary motor cortex. Our version of this algorithm is used in an online learning setting and is updated after a sequence of inferred movements is completed. We ﬁrst used it to track real hand movements executed by a monkey in a standard 3D reaching task. We then applied it in a closed-loop BMI setting to infer intended movement, while the monkey’s arms were comfortably restrained, thus performing the task using the BMI alone. KARMA is a recurrent method that learns a nonlinear model of output dynamics. It uses similarity functions (termed kernels) to compare between inputs. These kernels can be structured to incorporate domain knowledge into the method. We compare KARMA to various state-of-the-art methods by evaluating tracking performance and present results from the KARMA based BMI experiments. 1</p><p>5 0.48100328 <a title="180-lsi-5" href="./nips-2008-Unifying_the_Sensory_and_Motor_Components_of_Sensorimotor_Adaptation.html">244 nips-2008-Unifying the Sensory and Motor Components of Sensorimotor Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alex J. Smola, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: Models for near-rigid shape matching are typically based on distance-related features, in order to infer matches that are consistent with the isometric assumption. However, real shapes from image datasets, even when expected to be related by “almost isometric” transformations, are actually subject not only to noise but also, to some limited degree, to variations in appearance and scale. In this paper, we introduce a graphical model that parameterises appearance, distance, and angle features and we learn all of the involved parameters via structured prediction. The outcome is a model for near-rigid shape matching which is robust in the sense that it is able to capture the possibly limited but still important scale and appearance variations. Our experimental results reveal substantial improvements upon recent successful models, while maintaining similar running times. 1</p><p>3 0.58291036 <a title="180-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Supervised_Dictionary_Learning.html">226 nips-2008-Supervised Dictionary Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Julien Mairal, Jean Ponce, Guillermo Sapiro, Andrew Zisserman, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: It is now well established that sparse signal models are well suited for restoration tasks and can be effectively learned from audio, image, and video data. Recent research has been aimed at learning discriminative sparse models instead of purely reconstructive ones. This paper proposes a new step in that direction, with a novel sparse representation for signals belonging to different classes in terms of a shared dictionary and discriminative class models. The linear version of the proposed model admits a simple probabilistic interpretation, while its most general variant admits an interpretation in terms of kernels. An optimization framework for learning all the components of the proposed model is presented, along with experimental results on standard handwritten digit and texture classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.45213896 <a title="180-lda-4" href="./nips-2008-Estimating_vector_fields_using_sparse_basis_field_expansions.html">75 nips-2008-Estimating vector fields using sparse basis field expansions</a></p>

<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Polysemy is a problem for methods that exploit image search engines to build object category models. Existing unsupervised approaches do not take word sense into consideration. We propose a new method that uses a dictionary to learn models of visual word sense from a large collection of unlabeled web data. The use of LDA to discover a latent sense space makes the model robust despite the very limited nature of dictionary deﬁnitions. The deﬁnitions are used to learn a distribution in the latent space that best represents a sense. The algorithm then uses the text surrounding image links to retrieve images with high probability of a particular dictionary sense. An object classiﬁer is trained on the resulting sense-speciﬁc images. We evaluate our method on a dataset obtained by searching the web for polysemous words. Category classiﬁcation experiments show that our dictionarybased approach outperforms baseline methods. 1</p><p>6 0.44497341 <a title="180-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Understanding_Brain_Connectivity_Patterns_during_Motor_Imagery_for_Brain-Computer_Interfacing.html">243 nips-2008-Understanding Brain Connectivity Patterns during Motor Imagery for Brain-Computer Interfacing</a></p>

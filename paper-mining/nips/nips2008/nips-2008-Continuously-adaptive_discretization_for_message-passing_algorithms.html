<p>Author: Lukas Kroc, Ashish Sabharwal, Bart Selman</p><p>Abstract: We show that an important and computationally challenging solution space feature of the graph coloring problem (COL), namely the number of clusters of solutions, can be accurately estimated by a technique very similar to one for counting the number of solutions. This cluster counting approach can be naturally written in terms of a new factor graph derived from the factor graph representing the COL instance. Using a variant of the Belief Propagation inference framework, we can efﬁciently approximate cluster counts in random COL problems over a large range of graph densities. We illustrate the algorithm on instances with up to 100, 000 vertices. Moreover, we supply a methodology for computing the number of clusters exactly using advanced techniques from the knowledge compilation literature. This methodology scales up to several hundred variables. 1</p><p>3 0.17938323 <a title="50-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2008-Bounds_on_marginal_probability_distributions.html">40 nips-2008-Bounds on marginal probability distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Joris M. Mooij, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel bound on single-variable marginal probability distributions in factor graphs with discrete variables. The bound is obtained by propagating local bounds (convex sets of probability distributions) over a subtree of the factor graph, rooted in the variable of interest. By construction, the method not only bounds the exact marginal probability distribution of a variable, but also its approximate Belief Propagation marginal (“belief”). Thus, apart from providing a practical means to calculate bounds on marginals, our contribution also lies in providing a better understanding of the error made by Belief Propagation. We show that our bound outperforms the state-of-the-art on some inference problems arising in medical diagnosis. 1</p><p>4 0.16731076 <a title="50-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2008-Clusters_and_Coarse_Partitions_in_LP_Relaxations.html">49 nips-2008-Clusters and Coarse Partitions in LP Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: David Sontag, Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new class of consistency constraints for Linear Programming (LP) relaxations for ﬁnding the most probable (MAP) conﬁguration in graphical models. Usual cluster-based LP relaxations enforce joint consistency on the beliefs of a cluster of variables, with computational cost increasing exponentially with the size of the clusters. By partitioning the state space of a cluster and enforcing consistency only across partitions, we obtain a class of constraints which, although less tight, are computationally feasible for large clusters. We show how to solve the cluster selection and partitioning problem monotonically in the dual LP, using the current beliefs to guide these choices. We obtain a dual message passing algorithm and apply it to protein design problems where the variables have large state spaces and the usual cluster-based relaxations are very costly. The resulting method solves many of these problems exactly, and signiﬁcantly faster than a method that does not use partitioning. 1</p><p>5 0.15723851 <a title="50-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2008-Gates.html">89 nips-2008-Gates</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Minka, John Winn</p><p>Abstract: Gates are a new notation for representing mixture models and context-sensitive independence in factor graphs. Factor graphs provide a natural representation for message-passing algorithms, such as expectation propagation. However, message passing in mixture models is not well captured by factor graphs unless the entire mixture is represented by one factor, because the message equations have a containment structure. Gates capture this containment structure graphically, allowing both the independences and the message-passing equations for a model to be readily visualized. Different variational approximations for mixture models can be understood as different ways of drawing the gates in a model. We present general equations for expectation propagation and variational message passing in the presence of gates. 1</p><p>6 0.12065893 <a title="50-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2008-Estimation_of_Information_Theoretic_Measures_for_Continuous_Random_Variables.html">76 nips-2008-Estimation of Information Theoretic Measures for Continuous Random Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Longin J. Latecki, Chengen Lu, Marc Sobel, Xiang Bai</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new interpretation of multiscale random ﬁelds (MSRFs) that admits efﬁcient optimization in the framework of regular (single level) random ﬁelds (RFs). It is based on a new operator, called append, that combines sets of random variables (RVs) to single RVs. We assume that a MSRF can be decomposed into disjoint trees that link RVs at different pyramid levels. The append operator is then applied to map RVs in each tree structure to a single RV. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed approach on a challenging task involving grouping contours of target shapes in images. It provides a natural representation of multiscale contour models, which is needed in order to cope with unstable contour decompositions. The append operator allows us to ﬁnd optimal image segment labels using the classical framework of relaxation labeling. Alternative methods like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) could also be used.</p><p>2 0.88309908 <a title="50-lda-2" href="./nips-2008-Empirical_performance_maximization_for_linear_rank_statistics.html">72 nips-2008-Empirical performance maximization for linear rank statistics</a></p>
<p>Author: Stéphan J. Clémençcon, Nicolas Vayatis</p><p>Abstract: The ROC curve is known to be the golden standard for measuring performance of a test/scoring statistic regarding its capacity of discrimination between two populations in a wide variety of applications, ranging from anomaly detection in signal processing to information retrieval, through medical diagnosis. Most practical performance measures used in scoring applications such as the AUC, the local AUC, the p-norm push, the DCG and others, can be seen as summaries of the ROC curve. This paper highlights the fact that many of these empirical criteria can be expressed as (conditional) linear rank statistics. We investigate the properties of empirical maximizers of such performance criteria and provide preliminary results for the concentration properties of a novel class of random variables that we will call a linear rank process. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.84800959 <a title="50-lda-3" href="./nips-2008-Continuously-adaptive_discretization_for_message-passing_algorithms.html">50 nips-2008-Continuously-adaptive discretization for message-passing algorithms</a></p>

Most message-passing algorithms approximate continuous probability distributions using either: a family of continuous distributions such as the exponential family; a particle-set of discrete samples; or a ﬁxed, uniform discretization.

<p>Author: Charles Cadieu, Bruno A. Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a hierarchical, probabilistic model that learns to extract complex motion from movies of the natural environment. The model consists of two hidden layers: the ﬁrst layer produces a sparse representation of the image that is expressed in terms of local amplitude and phase variables. The second layer learns the higher-order structure among the time-varying phase variables. After training on natural movies, the top layer units discover the structure of phase-shifts within the ﬁrst layer. We show that the top layer units encode transformational invariants: they are selective for the speed and direction of a moving pattern, but are invariant to its spatial structure (orientation/spatial-frequency). The diversity of units in both the intermediate and top layers of the model provides a set of testable predictions for representations that might be found in V1 and MT. In addition, the model demonstrates how feedback from higher levels can inﬂuence representations at lower levels as a by-product of inference in a graphical model. 1</p><p>5 0.79815674 <a title="50-lda-5" href="./nips-2008-An_improved_estimator_of_Variance_Explained_in_the_presence_of_noise.html">24 nips-2008-An improved estimator of Variance Explained in the presence of noise</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf M. Haefner, Bruce G. Cumming</p><p>Abstract: A crucial part of developing mathematical models of information processing in the brain is the quantiﬁcation of their success. One of the most widely-used metrics yields the percentage of the variance in the data that is explained by the model. Unfortunately, this metric is biased due to the intrinsic variability in the data. We derive a simple analytical modiﬁcation of the traditional formula that signiﬁcantly improves its accuracy (as measured by bias) with similar or better precision (as measured by mean-square error) in estimating the true underlying Variance Explained by the model class. Our estimator advances on previous work by a) accounting for overﬁtting due to free model parameters mitigating the need for a separate validation data set, b) adjusting for the uncertainty in the noise estimate and c) adding a conditioning term. We apply our new estimator to binocular disparity tuning curves of a set of macaque V1 neurons and ﬁnd that on a population level almost all of the variance unexplained by Gabor functions is attributable to noise. 1</p><p>6 0.79541683 <a title="50-lda-6" href="./nips-2008-Non-stationary_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">152 nips-2008-Non-stationary dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>

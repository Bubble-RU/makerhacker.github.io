<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-84-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5207-deep-neural-networks-for-object-detection.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Christian Szegedy, Alexander Toshev, Dumitru Erhan</p><p>Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have recently shown outstanding performance on image classiﬁcation tasks [14]. In this paper we go one step further and address the problem of object detection using DNNs, that is not only classifying but also precisely localizing objects of various classes. We present a simple and yet powerful formulation of object detection as a regression problem to object bounding box masks. We deﬁne a multi-scale inference procedure which is able to produce high-resolution object detections at a low cost by a few network applications. State-of-the-art performance of the approach is shown on Pascal VOC. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-159-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5010-learning-prices-for-repeated-auctions-with-strategic-buyers.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Kareem Amin, Afshin Rostamizadeh, Umar Syed</p><p>Abstract: Inspired by real-time ad exchanges for online display advertising, we consider the problem of inferring a buyer’s value distribution for a good when the buyer is repeatedly interacting with a seller through a posted-price mechanism. We model the buyer as a strategic agent, whose goal is to maximize her long-term surplus, and we are interested in mechanisms that maximize the seller’s long-term revenue. We deﬁne the natural notion of strategic regret — the lost revenue as measured against a truthful (non-strategic) buyer. We present seller algorithms that are no(strategic)-regret when the buyer discounts her future surplus — i.e. the buyer prefers showing advertisements to users sooner rather than later. We also give a lower bound on strategic regret that increases as the buyer’s discounting weakens and shows, in particular, that any seller algorithm will suffer linear strategic regret if there is no discounting. 1</p><br/>

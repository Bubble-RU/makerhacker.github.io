<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-102-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5011-efficient-algorithm-for-privately-releasing-smooth-queries.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ziteng Wang, Kai Fan, Jiaqi Zhang, Liwei Wang</p><p>Abstract: We study differentially private mechanisms for answering smooth queries on databases consisting of data points in Rd . A K-smooth query is speciﬁed by a function whose partial derivatives up to order K are all bounded. We develop an -differentially private mechanism which for the class of K-smooth queries has K accuracy O(n− 2d+K / ). The mechanism ﬁrst outputs a summary of the database. To obtain an answer of a query, the user runs a public evaluation algorithm which contains no information of the database. Outputting the summary runs in time d O(n1+ 2d+K ), and the evaluation algorithm for answering a query runs in time d+2+ 2d K ˜ O(n 2d+K ). Our mechanism is based on L∞ -approximation of (transformed) smooth functions by low degree even trigonometric polynomials with small and efﬁciently computable coefﬁcients. 1</p><br/>

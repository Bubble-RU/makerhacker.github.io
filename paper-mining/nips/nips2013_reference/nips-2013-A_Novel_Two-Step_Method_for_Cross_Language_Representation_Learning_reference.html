<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-12-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5164-a-novel-two-step-method-for-cross-language-representation-learning.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Min Xiao, Yuhong Guo</p><p>Abstract: Cross language text classiﬁcation is an important learning task in natural language processing. A critical challenge of cross language learning arises from the fact that words of different languages are in disjoint feature spaces. In this paper, we propose a two-step representation learning method to bridge the feature spaces of different languages by exploiting a set of parallel bilingual documents. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst formulate a matrix completion problem to produce a complete parallel document-term matrix for all documents in two languages, and then induce a low dimensional cross-lingual document representation by applying latent semantic indexing on the obtained matrix. We use a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the formulated matrix completion problem with convergence guarantees. The proposed method is evaluated by conducting a set of experiments with cross language sentiment classiﬁcation tasks on Amazon product reviews. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed learning method outperforms a number of other cross language representation learning methods, especially when the number of parallel bilingual documents is small. 1</p><br/>

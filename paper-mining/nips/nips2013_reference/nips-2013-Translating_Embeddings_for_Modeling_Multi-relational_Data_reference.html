<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2013-336-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5071-translating-embeddings-for-modeling-multi-relational-data.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Antoine Bordes, Nicolas Usunier, Alberto Garcia-Duran, Jason Weston, Oksana Yakhnenko</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of embedding entities and relationships of multirelational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. Our objective is to propose a canonical model which is easy to train, contains a reduced number of parameters and can scale up to very large databases. Hence, we propose TransE, a method which models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. Despite its simplicity, this assumption proves to be powerful since extensive experiments show that TransE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in link prediction on two knowledge bases. Besides, it can be successfully trained on a large scale data set with 1M entities, 25k relationships and more than 17M training samples. 1</p><br/>

<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael Mozer</p><p>Abstract: The goal of many unsupervised learning procedures is to bring two probability distributions into alignment. Generative models such as Gaussian mixtures and Boltzmann machines can be cast in this light, as can recoding models such as ICA and projection pursuit. We propose a novel sample-based error measure for these classes of models, which applies even in situations where maximum likelihood (ML) and probability density estimation-based formulations cannot be applied, e.g., models that are nonlinear or have intractable posteriors. Furthermore, our sample-based error measure avoids the difficulties of approximating a density function. We prove that with an unconstrained model, (1) our approach converges on the correct solution as the number of samples goes to infinity, and (2) the expected solution of our approach in the generative framework is the ML solution. Finally, we evaluate our approach via simulations of linear and nonlinear models on mixture of Gaussians and ICA problems. The experiments show the broad applicability and generality of our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.15371573 <a title="137-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Natural_Sound_Statistics_and_Divisive_Normalization_in_the_Auditory_System.html">89 nips-2000-Natural Sound Statistics and Divisive Normalization in the Auditory System</a></p>
<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli preprocessed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially reduced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the rectified responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natural sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for nonlinearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by comparing model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Thus, divisive normalization appears to be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities. Signals in the real world are highly structured. For example, natural sounds typically contain both harmonic and rythmic structure. It is reasonable to assume that biological auditory systems are designed to represent these structures in an efficient manner [e.g., 1,2]. Specifically, Barlow hypothesized that a role of early sensory processing is to remove redundancy in the sensory input, resulting in a set of neural responses that are statistically independent. Experimentally, one can test this hypothesis by examining the statistical properties of neural responses under natural stimulation conditions [e.g., 3,4], or the statistical dependency of pairs (or groups) of neural responses. Due to their technical difficulty, such multi-cellular experiments are only recently becoming possible, and the earliest reports in vision appear consistent with the hypothesis [e.g., 5]. An alternative approach, which we follow here, is to develop a neural model from the statistics of natural signals and show that response properties of this model are similar to those of biological sensory neurons. A number of researchers have derived linear filter models using statistical criterion. For visual images, this results in linear filters localized in frequency, orientation and phase [6, 7]. Similar work in audition has yielded filters localized in frequency and phase [8]. Although these linear models provide an important starting point for neural modeling, sensory neurons are highly nonlinear. In addition, the statistical properties of natural signals are too complex to expect a linear transformation to result in an independent set of components. Recent results indicate that nonlinear gain control plays an important role in neural processing. Ruderman and Bialek [9] have shown that division by a local estimate of standard deviation can increase the entropy of responses of center-surround filters to natural images. Such a model is consistent with the properties of neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. Heeger and colleagues have shown that the nonlinear behaviors of neurons in primary visual cortex may be described using a form of gain control known as divisive normalization [10], in which the response of a linear kernel is rectified and divided by the sum of other rectified kernel responses and a constant. We have recently shown that the responses of oriented linear filters exhibit nonlinear statistical dependencies that may be substantially reduced using a variant of this model, in which the normalization signal is computed from a weighted sum of other rectified kernel responses [11, 12]. The resulting model, with weighting parameters determined from image statistics, accounts qualitatively for physiological nonlinearities observed in primary visual cortex. In this paper, we demonstrate that the responses of bandpass linear filters to natural sounds exhibit striking statistical dependencies, analogous to those found in visual images. A divisive normalization procedure can substantially remove these dependencies. We show that this model, with parameters optimized for a collection of natural sounds, can account for nonlinear behaviors of neurons at the level of the auditory nerve. Specifically, we show that: 1) the shape offrequency tuning curves varies with sound pressure level, even though the underlying linear filters are fixed; and 2) superposition of a non-optimal tone suppresses the response of a linear filter in a divisive fashion, and the amount of suppression depends on the distance between the frequency of the tone and the preferred frequency of the filter. 1 Empirical observations of natural sound statistics The basic statistical properties of natural sounds, as observed through a linear filter, have been previously documented by Attias [13]. In particular, he showed that, as with visual images, the spectral energy falls roughly according to a power law, and that the histograms of filter responses are more kurtotic than a Gaussian (i.e., they have a sharp peak at zero, and very long tails). Here we examine the joint statistical properties of a pair of linear filters tuned for nearby temporal frequencies. We choose a fixed set of filters that have been widely used in modeling the peripheral auditory system [14]. Figure 1 shows joint histograms of the instantaneous responses of a particular pair of linear filters to five different types of natural sound, and white noise. First note that the responses are approximately decorrelated: the expected value of the y-axis value is roughly zero for all values of the x-axis variable. The responses are not, however, statistically independent: the width of the distribution of responses of one filter increases with the response amplitude of the other filter. If the two responses were statistically independent, then the response of the first filter should not provide any information about the distribution of responses of the other filter. We have found that this type of variance dependency (sometimes accompanied by linear correlation) occurs in a wide range of natural sounds, ranging from animal sounds to music. We emphasize that this dependency is a property of natural sounds, and is not due purely to our choice of linear filters. For example, no such dependency is observed when the input consists of white noise (see Fig. 1). The strength of this dependency varies for different pairs of linear filters . In addition, we see this type of dependency between instantaneous responses of a single filter at two Speech o -1 Drums • Monkey Cat White noise Nocturnal nature I~ ~; ~ • Figure 1: Joint conditional histogram of instantaneous linear responses of two bandpass filters with center frequencies 2000 and 2840 Hz. Pixel intensity corresponds to frequency of occurrence of a given pair of values, except that each column has been independently rescaled to fill the full intensity range. For the natural sounds, responses are not independent: the standard deviation of the ordinate is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the abscissa. Natural sounds were recorded from CDs and converted to sampling frequency of 22050 Hz. nearby time instants. Since the dependency involves the variance of the responses, we can substantially reduce it by dividing. In particular, the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of responses of other rectified filters and an additive constant.

<p>Author: Michael S. Gray, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Javier R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: We examine eight different techniques for developing visual representations in machine vision tasks. In particular we compare different versions of principal component and independent component analysis in combination with stepwise regression methods for variable selection. We found that local methods, based on the statistics of image patches, consistently outperformed global methods based on the statistics of entire images. This result is consistent with previous work on emotion and facial expression recognition. In addition, the use of a stepwise regression technique for selecting variables and regions of interest substantially boosted performance. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87309283 <a title="137-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-The_Unscented_Particle_Filter.html">137 nips-2000-The Unscented Particle Filter</a></p>

<p>Author: Vasin Punyakanok, Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of combining the outcomes of several different classifiers in a way that provides a coherent inference that satisfies some constraints. In particular, we develop two general approaches for an important subproblem - identifying phrase structure. The first is a Markovian approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We develop efficient combination algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing.</p><p>4 0.66010815 <a title="137-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Color_Opponency_Constitutes_a_Sparse_Representation_for_the_Chromatic_Structure_of_Natural_Scenes.html">32 nips-2000-Color Opponency Constitutes a Sparse Representation for the Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Te-Won Lee, Thomas Wachtler, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This color opponency has been shown to constitute an efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals. We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions such that they constitute a representation with minimal redundancy. Independent component analysis finds the basis functions that transforms the spatiochromatic data such that the outputs (activations) are statistically as independent as possible, i.e. least redundant. The resulting basis functions show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges), along a blueyellow direction, and along a red-blue direction. Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient representation of colors. Our findings suggest that color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitivities. 1 Statistical structure of natural scenes Efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for information processing systems and its study may provide insights into coding principles of biological visual systems.

<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>6 0.59986341 <a title="137-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Redundancy_and_Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Sparse-Distributed_Representations_of_Natural_Objects_in_Terms_of_Their_Local_Features.html">109 nips-2000-Redundancy and Dimensionality Reduction in Sparse-Distributed Representations of Natural Objects in Terms of Their Local Features</a></p>

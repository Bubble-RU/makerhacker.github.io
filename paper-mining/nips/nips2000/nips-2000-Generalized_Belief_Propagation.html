<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Erik B. Sudderth, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.11820747 <a title="62-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Error-correcting_Codes_on_a_Bethe-like_Lattice.html">47 nips-2000-Error-correcting Codes on a Bethe-like Lattice</a></p>
<p>Author: Renato Vicente, David Saad, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze Gallager codes by employing a simple mean-field approximation that distorts the model geometry and preserves important interactions between sites. The method naturally recovers the probability propagation decoding algorithm as an extremization of a proper free-energy. We find a thermodynamic phase transition that coincides with information theoretical upper-bounds and explain the practical code performance in terms of the free-energy landscape.</p><p>5 0.11428285 <a title="62-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Overfitting_in_Neural_Nets%3A_Backpropagation%2C_Conjugate_Gradient%2C_and_Early_Stopping.html">97 nips-2000-Overfitting in Neural Nets: Backpropagation, Conjugate Gradient, and Early Stopping</a></p>
<p>Author: Rich Caruana, Steve Lawrence, C. Lee Giles</p><p>Abstract: The conventional wisdom is that backprop nets with excess hidden units generalize poorly. We show that nets with excess capacity generalize well when trained with backprop and early stopping. Experiments suggest two reasons for this: 1) Overfitting can vary significantly in different regions of the model. Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.</p><p>6 0.11266818 <a title="62-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Second_Order_Approximations_for_Probability_Models.html">114 nips-2000-Second Order Approximations for Probability Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Milind R. Naphade, Igor Kozintsev, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing. We define probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects) to map low-level media features to high-level semantic labels. A graphical network of such multijects (multinet) captures scene context by discovering intra-frame as well as inter-frame dependency relations between the concepts. The main contribution is a novel application of a factor graph framework to model this network. We model relations between semantic concepts in terms of their co-occurrence as well as the temporal dependencies between these concepts within video shots. Using the sum-product algorithm [1] for approximate or exact inference in these factor graph multinets, we attempt to correct errors made during isolated concept detection by forcing high-level constraints. This results in a significant improvement in the overall detection performance. 1</p><p>5 0.37596589 <a title="62-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Using_the_Nystr%C3%B6m_Method_to_Speed_Up_Kernel_Machines.html">143 nips-2000-Using the Nystr√∂m Method to Speed Up Kernel Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Lucas C. Parra, Clay Spence, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: We present evidence that several higher-order statistical properties of natural images and signals can be explained by a stochastic model which simply varies scale of an otherwise stationary Gaussian process. We discuss two interesting consequences. The first is that a variety of natural signals can be related through a common model of spherically invariant random processes, which have the attractive property that the joint densities can be constructed from the one dimensional marginal. The second is that in some cases the non-stationarity assumption and only second order methods can be explicitly exploited to find a linear basis that is equivalent to independent components obtained with higher-order methods. This is demonstrated on spectro-temporal components of speech. 1</p><p>3 0.62696362 <a title="62-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Convergence_of_Large_Margin_Separable_Linear_Classification.html">37 nips-2000-Convergence of Large Margin Separable Linear Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>5 0.56343532 <a title="62-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>6 0.56293714 <a title="62-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Rate-coded_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_Face_Recognition.html">107 nips-2000-Rate-coded Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Sallans, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task. The product of experts model is found to perform comparably to table-based Q-Iearning for small instances of the task, and continues to perform well when the problem becomes too large for a table-based representation.</p><p>4 0.15907951 <a title="73-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Incorporating_Second-Order_Functional_Knowledge_for_Better_Option_Pricing.html">69 nips-2000-Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Dugas, Yoshua Bengio, François Bélisle, Claude Nadeau, René Garcia</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.</p><p>5 0.13205115 <a title="73-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Decomposition_of_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Admission_Control_of_Self-Similar_Call_Arrival_Processes.html">39 nips-2000-Decomposition of Reinforcement Learning for Admission Control of Self-Similar Call Arrival Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob Carlström</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplifying reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-future call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call arrival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in significantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1</p><p>6 0.12104491 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Automated_State_Abstraction_for_Options_using_the_U-Tree_Algorithm.html">26 nips-2000-Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Morimoto, Kenji Doya</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that explicitly takes into account input disturbance as well as modeling errors. The use of environmental models in RL is quite popular for both off-line learning by simulations and for on-line action planning. However, the difference between the model and the real environment can lead to unpredictable, often unwanted results. Based on the theory of H oocontrol, we consider a differential game in which a 'disturbing' agent (disturber) tries to make the worst possible disturbance while a 'control' agent (actor) tries to make the best control input. The problem is formulated as finding a minmax solution of a value function that takes into account the norm of the output deviation and the norm of the disturbance. We derive on-line learning algorithms for estimating the value function and for calculating the worst disturbance and the best control in reference to the value function. We tested the paradigm, which we call</p><p>3 0.62213105 <a title="73-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Incorporating_Second-Order_Functional_Knowledge_for_Better_Option_Pricing.html">69 nips-2000-Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing</a></p>

<p>Author: David Andre, Stuart J. Russell</p><p>Abstract: We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process.The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program. For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.</p><p>6 0.49747747 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Automated_State_Abstraction_for_Options_using_the_U-Tree_Algorithm.html">26 nips-2000-Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Naftali Tishby, Noam Slonim</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new, non-parametric and principled, distance based clustering method. This method combines a pairwise based approach with a vector-quantization method which provide a meaningful interpretation to the resulting clusters. The idea is based on turning the distance matrix into a Markov process and then examine the decay of mutual-information during the relaxation of this process. The clusters emerge as quasi-stable structures during this relaxation, and then are extracted using the information bottleneck method. These clusters capture the information about the initial point of the relaxation in the most effective way. The method can cluster data with no geometric or other bias and makes no assumption about the underlying distribution. 1</p><p>4 0.58627301 <a title="73-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Function_Approximation_Converges_to_a_Region.html">112 nips-2000-Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation Converges to a Region</a></p>

We implement this description for the HodgkinHuxley model, identify the most relevant dimensions and find the nonlinearity. A two dimensional description already captures a significant fraction of the information that spikes carry about dynamic inputs. This description also shows that computation in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is more complex than a simple integrateand-fire or perceptron model. 1</p><p>6 0.58361471 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Mixtures_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">85 nips-2000-Mixtures of Gaussian Processes</a></p>

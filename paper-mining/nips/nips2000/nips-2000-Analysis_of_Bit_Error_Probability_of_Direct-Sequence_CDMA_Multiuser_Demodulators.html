<p>Author: Cynthia Archer, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: We establish a principled framework for adaptive transform coding. Transform coders are often constructed by concatenating an ad hoc choice of transform with suboptimal bit allocation and quantizer design. Instead, we start from a probabilistic latent variable model in the form of a mixture of constrained Gaussian mixtures. From this model we derive a transform coding algorithm, which is a constrained version of the generalized Lloyd algorithm for vector quantizer design. A byproduct of our derivation is the introduction of a new transform basis, which unlike other transforms (PCA, DCT, etc.) is explicitly optimized for coding. Image compression experiments show adaptive transform coders designed with our algorithm improve compressed image signal-to-noise ratio up to 3 dB compared to global transform coding and 0.5 to 2 dB compared to other adaptive transform coders. 1</p><p>5 0.03459277 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-The_Early_Word_Catches_the_Weights.html">131 nips-2000-The Early Word Catches the Weights</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark A. Smith, Garrison W. Cottrell, Karen L. Anderson</p><p>Abstract: The strong correlation between the frequency of words and their naming latency has been well documented. However, as early as 1973, the Age of Acquisition (AoA) of a word was alleged to be the actual variable of interest, but these studies seem to have been ignored in most of the literature. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in AoA. While some studies have shown that frequency has no effect when AoA is controlled for, more recent studies have found independent contributions of frequency and AoA. Connectionist models have repeatedly shown strong effects of frequency, but little attention has been paid to whether they can also show AoA effects. Indeed, several researchers have explicitly claimed that they cannot show AoA effects. In this work, we explore these claims using a simple feed forward neural network. We find a significant contribution of AoA to naming latency, as well as conditions under which frequency provides an independent contribution. 1 Background Naming latency is the time between the presentation of a picture or written word and the beginning of the correct utterance of that word. It is undisputed that there are significant differences in the naming latency of many words, even when controlling word length, syllabic complexity, and other structural variants. The cause of differences in naming latency has been the subject of numerous studies. Earlier studies found that the frequency with which a word appears in spoken English is the best determinant of its naming latency (Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). More recent psychological studies, however, show that the age at which a word is learned, or its Age of Acquisition (AoA), may be a better predictor of naming latency. Further, in many multiple regression analyses, frequency is not found to be significant when AoA is controlled for (Brown & Watson, 1987; Carroll & White, 1973; Morrison et al. 1992; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). These studies show that frequency and AoA are highly correlated (typically r =-.6) explaining the confound of older studies on frequency. However, still more recent studies question this finding and find that both AoA and frequency are significant and contribute independently to naming latency (Ellis & Morrison, 1998; Gerhand & Barry, 1998,1999). Much like their psychological counterparts, connectionist networks also show very strong frequency effects. However, the ability of a connectionist network to show AoA effects has been doubted (Gerhand & Barry, 1998; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). Most of these claims are based on the well known fact that connectionist networks exhibit</p><p>6 0.02866224 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Improved_Output_Coding_for_Classification_Using_Continuous_Relaxation.html">68 nips-2000-Improved Output Coding for Classification Using Continuous Relaxation</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>6 0.22772463 <a title="25-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-From_Mixtures_of_Mixtures_to_Adaptive_Transform_Coding.html">59 nips-2000-From Mixtures of Mixtures to Adaptive Transform Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland</p><p>Abstract: Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown. 1</p><p>3 0.37773219 <a title="25-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Erik B. Sudderth, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.28433511 <a title="25-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Error-correcting_Codes_on_a_Bethe-like_Lattice.html">47 nips-2000-Error-correcting Codes on a Bethe-like Lattice</a></p>
<p>Author: Renato Vicente, David Saad, Yoshiyuki Kabashima</p><p>Abstract: We analyze Gallager codes by employing a simple mean-field approximation that distorts the model geometry and preserves important interactions between sites. The method naturally recovers the probability propagation decoding algorithm as an extremization of a proper free-energy. We find a thermodynamic phase transition that coincides with information theoretical upper-bounds and explain the practical code performance in terms of the free-energy landscape.</p><p>5 0.25741339 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Segmentation_by_Random_Walks.html">79 nips-2000-Learning Segmentation by Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Meila, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: We present a new view of image segmentation by pairwise similarities. We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foundation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1</p><p>6 0.25074959 <a title="25-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Occam%27s_Razor.html">92 nips-2000-Occam's Razor</a></p>

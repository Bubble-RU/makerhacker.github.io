</p><p>2 Mel Department of Biomedical Engineering University of Southern California Los Angeles, CA 90089-1451  Abstract Neurons in area V4 have relatively large receptive fields (RFs), so multiple visual features are simultaneously "seen" by these cells. [sent-3, score-0.142]
</p><p>3 Recordings from single V4 neurons suggest that simultaneously presented stimuli compete to set the output firing rate, and that attention acts to isolate individual features by biasing the competition in favor of the attended object. [sent-4, score-0.877]
</p><p>4 We propose that both stimulus competition and attentional biasing arise from the spatial segregation of afferent synapses onto different regions of the excitable dendritic tree of V4 neurons. [sent-5, score-1.113]
</p><p>5 The pattern of feedforward, stimulus-driven inputs follows from a Hebbian rule: excitatory afferents with similar RFs tend to group together on the dendritic tree, avoiding randomly located inhibitory inputs with similar RFs. [sent-6, score-0.944]
</p><p>6 The same principle guides the formation of inputs that mediate attentional modulation. [sent-7, score-0.241]
</p><p>7 Using both biophysically detailed compartmental models and simplified models of computation in single neurons, we demonstrate that such an architecture could account for the response properties and attentional modulation of V4 neurons. [sent-8, score-0.671]
</p><p>8 Our results suggest an important role for nonlinear dendritic conductances in extrastriate cortical processing. [sent-9, score-0.327]
</p><p>9 1 Introduction Neurons in higher regions of visual cortex have relatively large receptive fields (RFs): for example, neurons representing the central visual field in macaque area V4 have RFs up to 5ě§¸ across (Desimone & Schein, 1987). [sent-10, score-0.362]
</p><p>10 Such large RFs often contain multiple potentially significant features in a single image, leading to the question: How can these neurons extract information about individual objects? [sent-11, score-0.09]
</p><p>11 Moran and Desimone (1985) showed that when multiple stimuli are present within the RF of a V4 neuron, attention effectively reduces the RF extent of the cell, so that only the attended feature contributes to its output. [sent-12, score-0.451]
</p><p>12 Desimone (1992) noted that one way this modulation could be performed is to assign input from each RF subregion to a single dendritic branch of the V4 neuron; modulatory inhibition could then "tum off" branches, so that subregions of the RF could be independently gated. [sent-13, score-0.897]
</p><p>13 Recent experiments have revealed a more subtle picture regarding both the interactions between simultaneously presented stimuli and the effects of attentional modulation. [sent-14, score-0.292]
</p><p>14 Record-  ings from individual V4 neurons have shown that simultanously presented stimuli compete to set the output firing rate (Luck, Chelazzi, Hillyard, & Desimone, 1997; Reynolds, Chelazzi, & Desimone, 1999). [sent-15, score-0.345]
</p><p>15 For example, consider a cell for which stimulus S, presented by itself, produces a strong response consisting of s spikes, and stimulus W produces a weak response of w spikes. [sent-16, score-1.2]
</p><p>16 Presenting the two stimuli Sand W together generally produces an output less than s but more than w. [sent-17, score-0.142]
</p><p>17 Note that the "weak" stimulus W is excitatory for the cell when presented alone, since it increases the response from 0 to w, but effectively inhibitory when presented together with "strong" stimulus S. [sent-18, score-1.417]
</p><p>18 Attention serves to bias the competition, so that attending to S would increase the output of the V4 cell (moving it closer to s), while attending to W would decrease the output (moving it closer to w). [sent-19, score-0.365]
</p><p>19 (1999) proposed a mathematical model in which individual stimuli both excite and inhibit the V4 neuron. [sent-21, score-0.107]
</p><p>20 The sum of excitatory and inhibitory input is acted on by divisive normalization proportional to the total strength of input to produce a competitive interaction between simultaneous stimuli. [sent-22, score-0.681]
</p><p>21 Attention is then implemented as a multiplicative gain on both excitatory and inhibitory input arising from the attended stimulus. [sent-23, score-0.773]
</p><p>22 In previous work using biophysically detailed compartmental models of neurons with active dendrites, we observed that increasing the stimulus contrast produced a multiplicative scaling of the tuning curve of a complex cell (Archie & Mel, 2000, Fig. [sent-24, score-0.933]
</p><p>23 2 Methods We used both biophysically detailed compartmental models and a simplified model of a single cortical neuron to test whether competition and attentional biasing could arise from interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs in a nonlinear dendritic tree. [sent-27, score-1.623]
</p><p>24 An overview of the input segregation common to both classes of model is shown in Fig. [sent-28, score-0.118]
</p><p>25 The LGN was modeled as 4 arrays (ON- and OFF-center, left and right eye) of differenceof-Gaussian spatial filters, as described in Archie and Mel (2000). [sent-34, score-0.086]
</p><p>26 Responses of the cortical cells were calculated using the NEURON simulation environment (Hines & Carnevale, 1997). [sent-35, score-0.175]
</p><p>27 Complex cells contained 4 basal branches, each 1 /. [sent-36, score-0.14]
</p><p>28 Hodgkin-Huxley-style Na+ and K+ conductances were present in the membrane of the entire cell, with lO-fold higher density in the axon (9Na = 0. [sent-47, score-0.067]

</p><p>30 The V4 cell was modeled with the same parameters as the complex cells, but with 8 basal branches instead of 4. [sent-52, score-0.415]
</p><p>31 Figure 1: Segregation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. [sent-53, score-0.601]
</p><p>32 Two sources of stimulus-driven input are shown, Sl and S2, each corresponding to an independently attendable subregion of the RF of the V4 cell. [sent-54, score-0.185]
</p><p>33 Note that each source of stimulus-driven input makes both excitatory projections to a specific branch on the V4 cell, and inhibitory projections (through an interneuron) to other branches. [sent-55, score-0.824]
</p><p>34 Similarly, the modulatory inputs Al and A2 each direct attention to a particular branch; for example, Al adds excitatory modulation to the branch corresponding to the Sl RF subregion and (indirectly) inhibitory modulation to other branches. [sent-56, score-1.567]
</p><p>35 V4 inhibitory  /interneurons  Figure 2: Design of the biophysically detailed model. [sent-57, score-0.494]
</p><p>36 Complex cells were arranged in a grid with overlapping RFs and similar orientation preferences. [sent-58, score-0.143]
</p><p>37 Each vertical stripe of cells formed an RF subregion to which attention could be directed. [sent-59, score-0.571]
</p><p>38 Each complex cell within a subregion formed one excitatory and one (indirect) inhibitory connection onto the V4 cell. [sent-60, score-0.989]
</p><p>39 All excitatory connections for a given subregion were targeted to a single branch, while the corresponding inhibitory synapses were distributed across all of the other branches of the cell. [sent-62, score-0.992]
</p><p>40 Attentional modulatory and background synapses, both described in the text, are not shown. [sent-63, score-0.131]
</p><p>41 Excitatory synapses were modeled as having both voltage-dependent (NMDA) and voltageindependent (AMPAikainate) components, while inhibitory synapses were fast and voltageindependent (GABA-A). [sent-64, score-0.678]
</p><p>42 All synapses were modeled using the kinetic scheme of Destexhe, Mainen, and Sejnowski (1994), with peak conductance values scaled inversely by the local input resistance to reduce the dependence of local EPSP size on synapse location. [sent-65, score-0.321]
</p><p>43 The complex cells received input from the LGN, using the spatial arrangement of excitatory and inhibitory inputs described in Archie and Mel (2000), with inhibitory inputs distributed throughout the input branches (rather than, e. [sent-66, score-1.485]
</p><p>44 We have previously shown that this arrangement of inputs produces phase- and contrast-invariant tuning to stimulus orientation, similar to that seen in cortical complex cells. [sent-69, score-0.566]
</p><p>45 All 64 complex cells had the same preferred orientation, which we will for convenience call vertical. [sent-70, score-0.164]
</p><p>46 For each stimulus image, each complex cell was simulated for 1 second and the resulting firing rate was used to set the activity level of one excitatory and one inhibitory synapse onto the V4 cell. [sent-71, score-1.294]
</p><p>47 The inhibition was assumed to emanate from an implicit inhibitory interneuron in V4. [sent-72, score-0.366]
</p><p>48 The stimulus-driven inputs to the V4 neuron were modeled as Poisson trains whose mean rate was set to the corresponding complex cell firing rate for excitatory synapses, and 1. [sent-73, score-0.883]
</p><p>49 3 times the corresponding complex cell firing rate for inhibitory synapses. [sent-74, score-0.635]
</p><p>50 The inputs were arranged on the V4 cell so that all of the complex cells with RFs distributed along a vertical stripe of the V4 RF (i. [sent-75, score-0.462]
</p><p>51 , aligned with the preferred orientation of the complex cells) formed one subregion and made their excitatory projections to a single branch (Fig. [sent-77, score-0.753]
</p><p>52 The inhibitory synapse from each complex cell was placed on a different branch than the corresponding excitatory synapse, with the specific location chosen at random. [sent-79, score-1.093]
</p><p>53 Attention was implemented by placing two modulatory synapses on each branch, one excitatory and one inhibitory. [sent-80, score-0.604]
</p><p>54 In the absence of attention, all modulatory synapses had a mean event rate of 0. [sent-81, score-0.307]
</p><p>55 Attention was directed to a particular subregion by increasing the firing rate of the excitatory modulation on the corresponding branch to 100 Hz, and increasing the inhibitory modulation on all other branches to 67 Hz. [sent-83, score-1.315]
</p><p>56 Each branch of the V4 cell also received a single excitatory synapse with mean firing rate 25 Hz, representing background (non-stimulus driven) input from the cortical network. [sent-84, score-0.986]
</p><p>57 These synapses provided most of the input needed for the cell to fire action potentials, while the stimulus-driven inputs modulated the firing rate. [sent-85, score-0.542]
</p><p>58 Similarly, excitatory synapses would tend to avoid inhibitory synapses driven by the same stimuli, since if the two are near each other on the dendrite, the efficacy of the excitation is systematically reduced by the corresponding inhibition. [sent-87, score-0.958]
</p><p>59 We have previously proposed that an individual cortical pyramidal neuron may carry out high-order computations that roughly fit the form of an energy model, i. [sent-89, score-0.118]
</p><p>60 , a sum of half-squared linear filters, with electrotonic ally isolated regions of the dendritic tree performing the quadratic subunit computations. [sent-91, score-0.245]
</p><p>61 Only excitatory inputs were previously considered, leaving open the question of how inhibition might fit in such a model. [sent-92, score-0.465]
</p><p>62 An obvious implementation of inhibition is to simply subtract the mean firing rates of inhibitory inputs, just as excitatory inputs are added. [sent-93, score-0.828]
</p><p>63 The sum-of-squares model thus has the form: f(x) = Lj((LiEBj WiXi)+)2, where y+ denotes y if y 2: 0,0 otherwise; 8 j is the set of inputs i that project to branch j; and Wi is +1 if input i is excitatory, -1 if inhibitory. [sent-94, score-0.307]

</p><p>67 Combined stimulus in the absence of attention yields output between the responses to either stimulus alone. [sent-103, score-0.833]
</p><p>68 Attention to either the strong or the weak stimulus pushes the cell's response toward the individual response for that stimulus. [sent-104, score-0.68]
</p><p>69 A strong stimulus (a vertical bar) and a weak stimulus (a bar of the same length, turned 60 0 from vertical) were selected. [sent-107, score-0.777]
</p><p>70 Figure 3 shows the stimulus images and simulated V4 cell response for each stimulus alone and for the combined stimulus in various attentional states. [sent-108, score-1.299]
</p><p>71 In the absence of attention within the receptive field (attention away), the response of the cell to the combined image lay between the responses to the strong image alone or the weak image alone. [sent-109, score-0.966]
</p><p>72 This competition between stimuli was also biased by attentional modulation (Fig. [sent-111, score-0.465]
</p><p>73 Attending to the strong stimulus elevated the response to the combined image compared to the condition where attention was directed away, thus bringing the response closer to the response to the strong stimulus alone. [sent-113, score-1.396]
</p><p>74 Similarly, attention to the weak stimulus lowered the response to the combined stimulus. [sent-114, score-0.785]
</p><p>75 A stimulus in this model is a 4-dimensional vector, with each component representing the total input (excitatory positive, inhibitory negative) to a single subunit. [sent-117, score-0.582]
</p><p>76 Most  stimuli tested had equal excitatory and inhibitory influence, so that the sum of the components was zero, and had excitatory influence confined to one subunit (i. [sent-118, score-1.107]

</p><p>78 The most common type of failure was that attending to the strong stimulus in the combined image led to a larger response than that produced by the strong stimulus alone. [sent-125, score-1.036]
</p><p>79 We also saw this happen for certain parameter sets in the biophysically detailed model, as described below; a similar result is seen in some of the data of Reynolds et ai. [sent-126, score-0.219]
</p><p>80 When the complex-cell output from the detailed model was used as input to a sum-ofsquared-filters model with 8 subunits, results qualitatively similar to the detailed simulation results were obtained. [sent-129, score-0.188]

</p><p>82 4 Discussion A variety of previous models for attention have considered how the RF of cortical neurons can be dynamically modulated (Olshausen, Anderson, & Van Essen, 1993; Niebur & Koch, 1994; Salinas & Abbott, 1997; Lee, Itti, Koch, & Braun, 1999). [sent-136, score-0.414]
</p><p>83 Our model, an extension of the proposal of Desimone (1992), specifies a biophysical mechanism for the multiplicative gain used in previous models (Salinas & Abbott, 1997; Reynolds et aI. [sent-137, score-0.041]
</p><p>84 , 1999), and suggests that both the stimulus competition and attentional effects seen in area V4 could be implemented by a straightforward mapping of stimulus-driven and modulatory afferents, both excitatory and inhibitory, onto the dendrites of V4 neurons. [sent-138, score-1.179]
</p><p>85 The results from the sumof-squared-filters models demonstrate that even a crude model of computation in single neurons can account for the complicated response properties of V4 neurons, given several quasi-independent nonlinear dendritic subunits and a suitable spatial arrangement of synapses.

<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

The resulting synaptic matrices have an outer-product form in which the oscillating patterns are represented as complex vectors. In a simple model, the even part of A(r) enhances the resonant response to learned stimulus by reducing the effective damping, while the odd part determines the frequency of oscillation.

<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

The resulting synaptic matrices have an outer-product form in which the oscillating patterns are represented as complex vectors. In a simple model, the even part of A(r) enhances the resonant response to learned stimulus by reducing the effective damping, while the odd part determines the frequency of oscillation.

<p>Author: Sophie Denève, Jean-René Duhamel, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocentric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions. The level of grey represent the frequency of discharge (In spikes per seconds). The white cross is the fixation point (the head is fixed). The cell's receptive field is moving with the eyes, but only partially. Here the receptive field shift is 60% of the total gaze shift. Moreover this cell is gain modulated by eye position (adapted from Duhamel et al). that the representations should be useful for sensory-motor transformations, rather than encode an</p><p>6 0.42981771 <a title="40-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Natural_Sound_Statistics_and_Divisive_Normalization_in_the_Auditory_System.html">89 nips-2000-Natural Sound Statistics and Divisive Normalization in the Auditory System</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland</p><p>Abstract: Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown. 1</p><p>6 0.45782423 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Finding_the_Key_to_a_Synapse.html">55 nips-2000-Finding the Key to a Synapse</a></p>

<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

<p>Author: Sophie Denève, Jean-René Duhamel, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocentric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions. The level of grey represent the frequency of discharge (In spikes per seconds). The white cross is the fixation point (the head is fixed). The cell's receptive field is moving with the eyes, but only partially. Here the receptive field shift is 60% of the total gaze shift. Moreover this cell is gain modulated by eye position (adapted from Duhamel et al). that the representations should be useful for sensory-motor transformations, rather than encode an</p><p>4 0.18438582 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Multiple_Timescales_of_Adaptation_in_a_Neural_Code.html">88 nips-2000-Multiple Timescales of Adaptation in a Neural Code</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrienne L. Fairhall, Geoffrey D. Lewen, William Bialek, Robert R. de Ruyter van Steveninck</p><p>Abstract: Many neural systems extend their dynamic range by adaptation. We examine the timescales of adaptation in the context of dynamically modulated rapidly-varying stimuli, and demonstrate in the fly visual system that adaptation to the statistical ensemble of the stimulus dynamically maximizes information transmission about the time-dependent stimulus. Further, while the rate response has long transients, the adaptation takes place on timescales consistent with optimal variance estimation.</p><p>5 0.17094454 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Finding_the_Key_to_a_Synapse.html">55 nips-2000-Finding the Key to a Synapse</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Natschläger, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: Experimental data have shown that synapses are heterogeneous: different synapses respond with different sequences of amplitudes of postsynaptic responses to the same spike train. Neither the role of synaptic dynamics itself nor the role of the heterogeneity of synaptic dynamics for computations in neural circuits is well understood. We present in this article methods that make it feasible to compute for a given synapse with known synaptic parameters the spike train that is optimally fitted to the synapse, for example in the sense that it produces the largest sum of postsynaptic responses. To our surprise we find that most of these optimally fitted spike trains match common firing patterns of specific types of neurons that are discussed in the literature.</p><p>6 0.16590698 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Place_Cells_and_Spatial_Navigation_Based_on_2D_Visual_Feature_Extraction%2C_Path_Integration%2C_and_Reinforcement_Learning.html">101 nips-2000-Place Cells and Spatial Navigation Based on 2D Visual Feature Extraction, Path Integration, and Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Sham Kakade, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Substantial data support a temporal difference (TO) model of dopamine (OA) neuron activity in which the cells provide a global error signal for reinforcement learning. However, in certain circumstances, OA activity seems anomalous under the TO model, responding to non-rewarding stimuli. We address these anomalies by suggesting that OA cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including Sutton's exploration bonuses and Ng et al's non-distorting shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for OA in terms of the unconditional attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration. 1</p><p>5 0.45370328 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Productive%2C_Systematic_Framework_for_the_Representation_of_Visual_Structure.html">10 nips-2000-A Productive, Systematic Framework for the Representation of Visual Structure</a></p>

We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions.

The cell's receptive field is moving with the eyes, but only partially. Here the receptive field shift is 60% of the total gaze shift. Moreover this cell is gain modulated by eye position (adapted from Duhamel et al). that the representations should be useful for sensory-motor transformations, rather than encode an</p><p>4 0.34703642 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Winner-take-all_Competition_Between_Groups_of_Neurons_in_Lateral_Inhibitory_Networks.html">81 nips-2000-Learning Winner-take-all Competition Between Groups of Neurons in Lateral Inhibitory Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computational function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as permitted sets of coactive neurons. In traditional winner-take-all networks, lateral inhibition is used to enforce a localized, or</p><p>5 0.33342576 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Divisive_and_Subtractive_Mask_Effects%3A_Linking_Psychophysics_and_Biophysics.html">42 nips-2000-Divisive and Subtractive Mask Effects: Linking Psychophysics and Biophysics</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

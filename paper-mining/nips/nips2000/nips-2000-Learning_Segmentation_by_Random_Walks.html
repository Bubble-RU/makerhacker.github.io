This method combines a pairwise based approach with a vector-quantization method which provide a meaningful interpretation to the resulting clusters.

The clusters emerge as quasi-stable structures during this relaxation, and then are extracted using the information bottleneck method.

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Erik B. Sudderth, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.084689185 <a title="79-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Discovering_Hidden_Variables%3A_A_Structure-Based_Approach.html">41 nips-2000-Discovering Hidden Variables: A Structure-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Noam Lotner, Nir Friedman, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hidden variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models.

<p>Author: Asa Ben-Hur, David Horn, Hava T. Siegelmann, Vladimir Vapnik</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel method for clustering using the support vector machine approach. Data points are mapped to a high dimensional feature space, where support vectors are used to define a sphere enclosing them. The boundary of the sphere forms in data space a set of closed contours containing the data. Data points enclosed by each contour are defined as a cluster. As the width parameter of the Gaussian kernel is decreased, these contours fit the data more tightly and splitting of contours occurs. The algorithm works by separating clusters according to valleys in the underlying probability distribution, and thus clusters can take on arbitrary geometrical shapes. As in other SV algorithms, outliers can be dealt with by introducing a soft margin constant leading to smoother cluster boundaries. The structure of the data is explored by varying the two parameters. We investigate the dependence of our method on these parameters and apply it to several data sets.</p><p>5 0.34641612 <a title="79-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Learning_and_Tracking_Cyclic_Human_Motion.html">82 nips-2000-Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human Motion</a></p>

<p>Author: Oren Shriki, Haim Sompolinsky, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: The principle of maximizing mutual information is applied to learning overcomplete and recurrent representations. The underlying model consists of a network of input units driving a larger number of output units with recurrent interactions. In the limit of zero noise, the network is deterministic and the mutual information can be related to the entropy of the output units. Maximizing this entropy with respect to both the feedforward connections as well as the recurrent interactions results in simple learning rules for both sets of parameters. The conventional independent components (ICA) learning algorithm can be recovered as a special case where there is an equal number of output units and no recurrent connections. The application of these new learning rules is illustrated on a simple two-dimensional input example.</p><p>2 0.88351905 <a title="79-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Using_Free_Energies_to_Represent_Q-values_in_a_Multiagent_Reinforcement_Learning_Task.html">142 nips-2000-Using Free Energies to Represent Q-values in a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Task</a></p>

The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network.

Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task.

This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic principle of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the experimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs.

<p>Author: Guy Mayraz, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The product of experts learning procedure [1] can discover a set of stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of handwritten images of digits. The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - l)th level model. After training, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logistic classification network that is trained on separate data. On the MNIST database, our system is comparable with current state-of-the-art discriminative methods, demonstrating that the product of experts learning procedure can produce effective generative models of high-dimensional data. 1 Learning products of stochastic binary experts Hinton [1] describes a learning algorithm for probabilistic generative models that are composed of a number of experts. Each expert specifies a probability distribution over the visible variables and the experts are combined by multiplying these distributions together and renormalizing. (1) where d is a data vector in a discrete space, Om is all the parameters of individual model m, Pm(dIOm) is the probability of d under model m, and c is an index over all possible vectors in the data space. A Restricted Boltzmann machine [2, 3] is a special case of a product of experts in which each expert is a single, binary stochastic hidden unit that has symmetrical connections to a set of visible units, and connections between the hidden units are forbidden. Inference in an RBM is much easier than in a general Boltzmann machine and it is also much easier than in a causal belief net because there is no explaining away. There is therefore no need to perform any iteration to determine the activities of the hidden units. The hidden states, Sj , are conditionally independent given the visible states, Si, and the distribution of Sj is given by the standard logistic function : 1 p(Sj = 1) = (2) 1 + exp( - Li WijSi) Conversely, the hidden states of an RBM are marginally dependent so it is easy for an RBM to learn population codes in which units may be highly correlated. It is hard to do this in causal belief nets with one hidden layer because the generative model of a causal belief net assumes marginal independence. An RBM can be trained using the standard Boltzmann machine learning algorithm which follows a noisy but unbiased estimate of the gradient of the log likelihood of the data. One way to implement this algorithm is to start the network with a data vector on the visible units and then to alternate between updating all of the hidden units in parallel and updating all of the visible units in parallel. Each update picks a binary state for a unit from its posterior distribution given the current states of all the units in the other set. If this alternating Gibbs sampling is run to equilibrium, there is a very simple way to update the weights so as to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence, QOIIQoo, between the data distribution, QO, and the equilibrium distribution of fantasies over the visible units, Qoo, produced by the RBM [4]: flWij oc QO - Q~ (3) where < SiSj >Qo is the expected value of SiSj when data is clamped on the visible units and the hidden states are sampled from their conditional distribution given the data, and Q ~ is the expected value of SiSj after prolonged Gibbs sampling. This learning rule does not work well because it can take a long time to approach thermal equilibrium and the sampling noise in the estimate of  Q ~ can swamp the gradient. [1] shows that it is far more effective to minimize the difference between QOllQoo and Q111Qoo where Q1 is the distribution of the one-step reconstructions of the data that are produced by first picking binary hidden states from their conditional distribution given the data and then picking binary visible states from their conditional distribution given the hidden states.

</p><p>11 1  Introduction  Kernel machines have recently gained a lot of attention due to the popularisation of the support vector machine (SVM) [13] with a focus on classification and the revival of Gaussian Processes (GP) for regression [15]. [sent-17, score-0.203]
</p><p>12 Subsequently, SVMs have been modified to handle regression [12] and GPs have been adapted to the problem of classification [8]. [sent-18, score-0.085]
</p><p>13 Both schemes essentially work in the same function space that is characterised by kernels (SVM) and covariance functions (GP), respectively. [sent-19, score-0.077]
</p><p>14 The SVM was inspired by results from statistical/PAC learning theory while GPs are usually considered in a Bayesian framework. [sent-21, score-0.039]
</p><p>15 This ideological clash can be viewed as a continuation in machine learning of the by now classical disagreement between Bayesian and frequentistic statistics. [sent-22, score-0.105]
</p><p>16 Of course there exists a strong relationship between the two ideas, in particular with the Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator being the solution of an optimisation problem. [sent-24, score-0.106]
</p><p>17 Interestingly, the two viewpoints have recently been reconciled theoretically in the so-called PAC-Bayesian framework [5] that combines the idea of a Bayesian prior with PAC-style performance guarantees and has been the basis of the so far tightest margin bound for SVMs [3]. [sent-25, score-0.218]
</p><p>18 In practice, optimisation based algorithms have the advantage of a unique, deterministic solution and the availability of the cost function as an indicator for the quality of the solution. [sent-26, score-0.205]
</p><p>19 In contrast, Bayesian algorithms based on sampling and voting are more flexible and have the so-called "anytime" property, providing a relatively good solution at any point in time. [sent-27, score-0.181]
</p><p>20 Often, however, they suffer from the computational costs of sampling the Bayesian posterior. [sent-28, score-0.12]
</p><p>21 In this contribution we review the idea of the Bayes point machine (BPM) as an approximation to Bayesian inference for linear classifiers in kernel space in Section 2. [sent-29, score-0.476]
</p><p>22 In contrast to the GP viewpoint we do not define a Gaussian prior on the length Ilwllx: of the weight vector. [sent-30, score-0.09]
</p><p>23 Instead, we only consider weight vectors of length Ilwllx: = 1 because it is only the spatial direction of the weight vector that matters for classification. [sent-31, score-0.039]
</p><p>24 It is then natural to define a uniform prior on the resulting ballshaped hypothesis space. [sent-32, score-0.083]
</p><p>25 Hence, we determine the centre of mass ("Bayes point") of the resulting posterior that is uniform in version space, i. [sent-33, score-0.285]
</p><p>26 While the version space could be sampled using some form of Gibbs sampling (see, e. [sent-36, score-0.219]
</p><p>27 [6] for an overview) or an ergodic dynamic system such as a billiard [4] we suggest to use the perceptron algorithm trained on permutations of the training set for sampling in Section 3. [sent-38, score-0.612]
</p><p>28 This extremely simple sampling scheme proves to be efficient enough to make the BPM applicable to large data sets. [sent-39, score-0.085]

</p><p>30 The symbols P, E and I denote a probability measure, the expectation of a random variable and the indicator function, respectively. [sent-53, score-0.039]
</p><p>31 2  Bayes Point Machines  Let us consider the task of classifying patterns X E X into one of the two classes y E Y = {-1, + 1} using functions h : X ~ Y from a given set 1t known as the hypothesis space. [sent-54, score-0.097]
</p><p>32 If all that is needed for learning and classification are the inner products (. [sent-56, score-0.083]
</p><p>33 )x: in the feature space K, it is convenient to specify Â¢ only by its inner product function 1 For notational convenience we shall abbreviate cf> (x) by x. [sent-58, score-0.091]
</p><p>34 This should not be confused with the set x of training points. [sent-59, score-0.076]
</p><p>35 For simplicity, let us assume that there exists a classifier 2 w* E W that labels all our data, i. [sent-63, score-0.062]
</p><p>36 (2) This assumption can easily be relaxed by introducing slack variables as done in the soft margin variant of the SVM. [sent-67, score-0.085]
</p><p>37 Then given a training set z = (x, y) of m points Xi together with their classes Yi assigned by hw' drawn iid from an unknown data distribution P z = PYIXP X we can assume the existence of a version space V (z), i. [sent-68, score-0.269]
</p><p>38 the set of all classifiers w E W consistent with z: (3) In a Bayesian spirit we incorporate all of our prior knowledge about w* into a prior distribution Pw over W. [sent-70, score-0.374]
</p><p>39 In the absence of any a priori knowledge we suggest a uniform prior over the spatial direction of weight vectors w. [sent-71, score-0.125]
</p><p>40 Now, given the training set z we update our prior belief by Bayes' formula, i. [sent-72, score-0.119]
</p><p>41 The Bayesian classification of a novel test point x is then given by =  argmaxyEy Pw1zm=z ({hw (x) = y})  = =  Bayes z (x)  sign (EWlzm=z [hw (x)]) sign (Ew1zm=z [sign ((x, W}dD  Unfortunately, the strategy Bayes z is in general not contained in the set 1-l of classifiers considered beforehand. [sent-75, score-0.53]
</p><p>42 Since Pw1zm=z is only non-zero inside version space, it has been suggested to use the centre of mass w crn as an approximation for Bayes z , i. [sent-76, score-0.314]
</p><p>43 wcrn  sign (Ew1zm=z [(x, W}JCl) sign ((x, wcrn}d , EWlzm=z [W] . [sent-78, score-0.24]
</p><p>44 In a previous work [4] we calculated Wcrn using a first order Markov chain based on a billiard-like algorithm (see also [10]). [sent-80, score-0.045]
</p><p>45 We entered the version space V (z) using a perceptron algorithm and started playing billiards in version space V (z) thus creating a sequence of pseudo-random samples Wi due to the chaotic nature of the billiard dynamics. [sent-81, score-0.82]
</p><p>46 Playing billiards in V (z) is possible because each training point (Xi, Yi) E z defines a hyperplane {w E W I Yi (Xi, w}JC = O} ~ W. [sent-82, score-0.199]
</p><p>47 Hence, the version space is a convex polyhedron on the surface of W. [sent-83, score-0.134]
</p><p>48 After N bounces of the billiard ball the Bayes point was estimated by 1 N  \V crn  =N  LWi. [sent-84, score-0.262]
</p><p>49 and w E W a classifier because there is a one-to-one correspondence between the two by virtue of (1) . [sent-86, score-0.062]
</p><p>50 Although this algorithm shows excellent generalisation performance when compared to state-of-the art learning algorithms like support vector machines (SVM) [13], its effort scales like 0 (m 2 ) and 0 (N . [sent-87, score-0.683]
</p><p>51 m2 ) in terms of memory and computational requirements, respectively. [sent-88, score-0.084]
</p><p>52 3  Sampling the Version Space  Clearly, all we need for estimating the Bayes point (4) is a set of classifiers W drawn uniformly from V (z). [sent-89, score-0.295]
</p><p>53 In order to save computational resources it might be advantageous to achieve a uniform sample only approximately. [sent-90, score-0.116]
</p><p>54 The classical perceptron learning algorithm offers the possibility to obtain up to m! [sent-91, score-0.325]
</p><p>55 different classifiers in version space simply by learning on different permutations of the training set. [sent-92, score-0.54]
</p><p>56 , m} the perceptron algorithm works as follows: 1. [sent-99, score-0.22]
</p><p>57 A classical theorem due to Novikoff [7] guarantees the convergence of this procedure and furthermore provides an upper bound on the number t of mistakes needed until convergence. [sent-114, score-0.152]
</p><p>58 More precisely, if there exists a classifier WSVM with margin 'Y% (WSVM )  . [sent-115, score-0.147]
</p><p>59 then the number of mistakes until convergence - which is an upper bound on the sparsity of the solution - is not more than R2 (x) y;2 (WSVM), where R (x) is the smallest real number such that Vx Ex: II Â¢ (x) II K. [sent-118, score-0.175]
</p><p>60 The quantity 'Y% (WSVM) is maximised for the solution WSVM found by the SVM, and whenever the SVM is theoretically justified by results from learning theory (see [11, 13]) the ratio d = R2 (x) 'Y;2 (WSVM) is considerably less than m, say dÂ« m. [sent-120, score-0.135]
</p><p>61 Algorithmically, we can benefit from this sparsity by the following "trick": since m  W=  2: QiXi i=l  all we need to store is the m-dimensional vector o. [sent-121, score-0.086]
</p><p>62 Furthermore, we keep track of the m-dimensional vector 0 of real valued outputs m  0i = Yi  (Xi, Wt)K. [sent-122, score-0.039]
</p><p>63 =  2: Qjk (Xi, Xj) j=l  of the current solution at the i-th training point. [sent-123, score-0.118]
</p><p>64 Now, if 0i :::; 0 we update Qi by Qi +Yi and update 0 by OJ ~ OJ +Yik (Xi, Xj) which requires only m kernel calculations. [sent-125, score-0.14]
</p><p>65 In summary, the memory requirement of this algorithm is 2m and the number of kernel calculations is not more than dÂ·m. [sent-126, score-0.292]
</p><p>66 As a consequence, the computational requirement of this algorithm is no more than the computational requirement for the evaluation ofthe margin 'Y% (WSVM)! [sent-127, score-0.316]
</p><p>67 We suggest to use this efficient perceptron learning algorithm in order to obtain samples Wi for the computation of the Bayes point by (4). [sent-128, score-0.429]

</p><p>70 In order to investigate the usefulness of this approach experimentally, we compared the distribution of generalisation errors of samples obtained by perceptron learning on permuted training sets (as suggested earlier by [14]) with samples obtained by a full Gibbs sampling [2]. [sent-133, score-1.059]
</p><p>71 For computational reasons, we used only 188 training patterns and 453 test patterns of the classes "I" and "2" from the MNIST data set 3 . [sent-134, score-0.301]
</p><p>72 In Figure 1 (a) and (b) we plotted the distribution over 1000 random samples using the kernel 4 k(x,x') = Â«(x,x'h+1)5 . [sent-135, score-0.214]
</p><p>73 (5) Using a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot technique we can compare both distributions in one graph (see Figure 1 (c)). [sent-136, score-0.052]
</p><p>74 These plots suggest that by simple permutation of the training set we are able to obtain a sample of classifiers exhibiting the same generalisation error distribution as with time-consuming Gibbs sampling. [sent-137, score-0.822]
</p><p>75 4  Experimental Results  In our large scale experiment we used the full MNIST data set with 60000 training examples and 10000 test examples of 28 x 28 grey value images of handwritten digits. [sent-138, score-0.224]
</p><p>76 As input vector x we used the 784 dimensional vector of grey values. [sent-139, score-0.117]
</p><p>77 The images were labelled by one of the ten classes "0" to "I". [sent-140, score-0.111]
</p><p>78 , 9} we ran the perceptron algorithm N = 10 times each time labelling all training points of class y by + 1 and the remaining training points by -1. [sent-144, score-0.372]
</p><p>79 For the classification of a test image x we calculated the real-valued output of all 100 different classifiers5 by  Ii (x) =  where we used the kernel k given by (5). [sent-146, score-0.239]
</p><p>80 (Oi)j refers to the expansion coefficient corresponding to the i- th classifier and the j - th data point. [sent-147, score-0.062]
</p><p>81 4We decided to use this kernel because it showed excellent generalisation performance when using the support vector machine. [sent-152, score-0.695]
</p><p>82 5For notational simplicity we assume that the first N classifiers are classifiers for the class "0", the next N for class "1" and so on. [sent-153, score-0.532]

</p><p>88 Note that ibp ,y (x) [9] can be interpreted as an (unnormalised) approximation of the posterior probability that x is of class y when restricted to the function class (1). [sent-176, score-0.246]
</p><p>89 In order to test the dependence of the generalisation error on the magnitude max y ibp ,y (x) we fixed a certain rejection rate r E [0,1] and rejected the set of rÂ· 10000 test points with the smallest value of maxy ibp ,y (x). [sent-177, score-1.213]
</p><p>90 As can be seen from this plot, even without rejection the Bayes point has excellent generalisation performance6 . [sent-179, score-0.806]
</p><p>91 Furthermore, rejection based on the real-valued output ibp (x) turns out to be excellent thus reducing the generalisation error to 0. [sent-180, score-1.006]
</p><p>92 One should also bear in mind that the learning time for this simple algorithm was comparable to that of SVMs. [sent-182, score-0.084]
</p><p>93 A very advantageous feature of our approach as compared to SVMs are its adjustable time and memory requirements and the "anytime" availability of a solution due to sampling. [sent-183, score-0.192]
</p><p>94 If the training set grows further and we are not able to spend more time with learning, we can adjust the number N of samples used at the price of slightly worse generalisation error. [sent-184, score-0.52]
</p><p>95 5  Conclusion  In this paper we have presented an algorithm for approximating the Bayes point by rerunning the classical perceptron algorithm with a permuted training set. [sent-185, score-0.53]
</p><p>96 particularly exploited the sparseness of the solution which must exist whenever the success of the SVM is theoretically justified. [sent-189, score-0.096]
</p><p>97 The restriction to the zero training error case can be overcome by modifying the kernel as  k>. [sent-190, score-0.262]

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m 2 ) of memory and 0 (N . m2 ) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior.

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.41141436 <a title="75-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: A new incremental learning algorithm is described which approximates the maximal margin hyperplane w.r.t. norm p ~ 2 for a set of linearly separable data. Our algorithm, called ALMAp (Approximate Large Margin algorithm w.r.t. norm p), takes 0 ((P~21;;2) corrections to separate the data with p-norm margin larger than (1 - 0:) ,,(, where,,( is the p-norm margin of the data and X is a bound on the p-norm of the instances. ALMAp avoids quadratic (or higher-order) programming methods. It is very easy to implement and is as fast as on-line algorithms, such as Rosenblatt's perceptron. We report on some experiments comparing ALMAp to two incremental algorithms: Perceptron and Li and Long's ROMMA. Our algorithm seems to perform quite better than both. The accuracy levels achieved by ALMAp are slightly inferior to those obtained by Support vector Machines (SVMs). On the other hand, ALMAp is quite faster and easier to implement than standard SVMs training algorithms.</p><p>6 0.14134574 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Sparse_Representation_for_Gaussian_Process_Models.html">122 nips-2000-Sparse Representation for Gaussian Process Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m 2 ) of memory and 0 (N . m2 ) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior. Finally, rejecting test points on the basis of their (approximative) posterior probability leads to a rapid decrease in generalisation error, e.g. 0.1% generalisation error for a given rejection rate of 10%. 1</p><p>2 0.86303496 <a title="75-lsi-2" href="./nips-2000-A_PAC-Bayesian_Margin_Bound_for_Linear_Classifiers%3A_Why_SVMs_work.html">9 nips-2000-A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear Classifiers: Why SVMs work</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length.

<p>Author: William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: Many processes in biology, from the regulation of gene expression in bacteria to memory in the brain, involve switches constructed from networks of biochemical reactions. Crucial molecules are present in small numbers, raising questions about noise and stability. Analysis of noise in simple reaction schemes indicates that switches stable for years and switchable in milliseconds can be built from fewer than one hundred molecules. Prospects for direct tests of this prediction, as well as implications, are discussed. 1</p><p>6 0.51433241 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

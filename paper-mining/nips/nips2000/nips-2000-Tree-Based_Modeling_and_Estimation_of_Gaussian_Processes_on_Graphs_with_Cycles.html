<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>3 0.16575721 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Second_Order_Approximations_for_Probability_Models.html">114 nips-2000-Second Order Approximations for Probability Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we derive a second order mean field theory for directed graphical probability models. By using an information theoretic argument it is shown how this can be done in the absense of a partition function. This method is a direct generalisation of the well-known TAP approximation for Boltzmann Machines. In a numerical example, it is shown that the method greatly improves the first order mean field approximation. For a restricted class of graphical models, so-called single overlap graphs, the second order method has comparable complexity to the first order method. For sigmoid belief networks, the method is shown to be particularly fast and effective.</p><p>4 0.16129933 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Discovering_Hidden_Variables%3A_A_Structure-Based_Approach.html">41 nips-2000-Discovering Hidden Variables: A Structure-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Noam Lotner, Nir Friedman, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hidden variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models.

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP. 1</p><p>6 0.1294436 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Sequentially_Fitting_%60%60Inclusive%27%27_Trees_for_Inference_in_Noisy-OR_Networks.html">115 nips-2000-Sequentially Fitting ``Inclusive'' Trees for Inference in Noisy-OR Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Relu Patrascu, Tommi Jaakkola, Jodi Moran</p><p>Abstract: An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisyOR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's parents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is intractable, but approximate methods (e .g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One problem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ignoring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisyOR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree. We compare this method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT medical diagnostic network. 1 Inclusive variational approximations Approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference are gaining in popularity and are now even being incorporated into VLSI hardware (T. Richardson, personal communication). Approximate methods include variational techniques (Ghahramani and Jordan 1997; Saul et al. 1996; Frey and Hinton 1999; Jordan et al. 1999), local probability propagation (Gallager 1963; Pearl 1988; Frey 1998; MacKay 1999a; Freeman and Weiss 2001) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Neal 1993; MacKay 1999b). Many algorithms have been proposed in each of these classes. One problem that most of the above algorithms suffer from is a tendency to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes of the target distribution (the distribution being approximated). In the case of medical diagnosis, different modes correspond to different explanations of the symptoms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are usually guaranteed to eventually sample from all the modes, but this may take an extremely long time, even when tempered transitions (Neal 1996) are (a) ,,</p><p>3 0.55702424 <a title="140-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Generalized_Belief_Propagation.html">62 nips-2000-Generalized Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander G. Gray, Andrew W. Moore</p><p>Abstract: We present efficient algorithms for all-point-pairs problems , or 'Nbody '-like problems , which are ubiquitous in statistical learning. We focus on six examples, including nearest-neighbor classification, kernel density estimation, outlier detection , and the two-point correlation. These include any problem which abstractly requires a comparison of each of the N points in a dataset with each other point and would naively be solved using N 2 distance computations. In practice N is often large enough to make this infeasible. We present a suite of new geometric t echniques which are applicable in principle to any 'N-body ' computation including large-scale mixtures of Gaussians, RBF neural networks, and HMM 's. Our algorithms exhibit favorable asymptotic scaling and are empirically several orders of magnitude faster than the naive computation, even for small datasets. We are aware of no exact algorithms for these problems which are more efficient either empirically or theoretically. In addition, our framework yields simple and elegant algorithms. It also permits two important generalizations beyond the standard all-point-pairs problems, which are more difficult. These are represented by our final examples, the multiple two-point correlation and the notorious n-point correlation. 1</p><p>5 0.5262776 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Accumulator_Networks%3A_Suitors_of_Local_Probability_Propagation.html">15 nips-2000-Accumulator Networks: Suitors of Local Probability Propagation</a></p>

The problem of multiuser demodulation is cast into the finite-temperature decoding problem, and replica analysis is applied to evaluate the performance of the resulting MPM (Marginal Posterior Mode) demodulators, which include the optimal demodulator and the MAP demodulator as special cases. An approximate implementation of demodulators is proposed using analog-valued Hopfield model as a naive mean-field approximation to the MPM demodulators, and its performance is also evaluated by the replica analysis. Results of the performance evaluation shows effectiveness of the optimal demodulator and the mean-field demodulator compared with the conventional one, especially in the cases of small information bit rate and low noise level. 1</p><p>2 0.88290203 <a title="140-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-On_Reversing_Jensen%27s_Inequality.html">94 nips-2000-On Reversing Jensen's Inequality</a></p>
<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland</p><p>Abstract: Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86848652 <a title="140-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.78081965 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Segmentation_by_Random_Walks.html">79 nips-2000-Learning Segmentation by Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Meila, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: We present a new view of image segmentation by pairwise similarities. We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foundation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1</p><p>5 0.77535999 <a title="140-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Improved_Output_Coding_for_Classification_Using_Continuous_Relaxation.html">68 nips-2000-Improved Output Coding for Classification Using Continuous Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>6 0.77112722 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>

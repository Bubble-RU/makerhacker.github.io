<p>Author: Suzanna Becker, Neil Burgess</p><p>Abstract: We present a computational model of the neural mechanisms in the parietal and temporal lobes that support spatial navigation, recall of scenes and imagery of the products of recall. Long term representations are stored in the hippocampus, and are associated with local spatial and object-related features in the parahippocampal region. Viewer-centered representations are dynamically generated from long term memory in the parietal part of the model. The model thereby simulates recall and imagery of locations and objects in complex environments. After parietal damage, the model exhibits hemispatial neglect in mental imagery that rotates with the imagined perspective of the observer, as in the famous Milan Square experiment [1]. Our model makes novel predictions for the neural representations in the parahippocampal and parietal regions and for behavior in healthy volunteers and neuropsychological patients.</p><p>3 0.11402465 <a title="66-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Place_Cells_and_Spatial_Navigation_Based_on_2D_Visual_Feature_Extraction%2C_Path_Integration%2C_and_Reinforcement_Learning.html">101 nips-2000-Place Cells and Spatial Navigation Based on 2D Visual Feature Extraction, Path Integration, and Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Bosco S. Tjan</p><p>Abstract: Theories of object recognition often assume that only one representation scheme is used within one visual-processing pathway. Versatility of the visual system comes from having multiple visual-processing pathways, each specialized in a different category of objects. We propose a theoretically simpler alternative, capable of explaining the same set of data and more. A single primary visual-processing pathway, loosely modular, is assumed. Memory modules are attached to sites along this pathway. Object-identity decision is made independently at each site. A site's response time is a monotonic-decreasing function of its confidence regarding its decision. An observer's response is the first-arriving response from any site. The effective representation(s) of such a system, determined empirically, can appear to be specialized for different tasks and stimuli, consistent with recent clinical and functional-imaging findings. This, however, merely reflects a decision being made at its appropriate level of abstraction. The system itself is intrinsically flexible and adaptive.</p><p>6 0.084388003 <a title="66-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Hierarchical_Memory-Based_Reinforcement_Learning.html">63 nips-2000-Hierarchical Memory-Based Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical Suffix Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic corridor navigation task. 1</p><p>4 0.46070018 <a title="66-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Spike-Timing-Dependent_Learning_for_Oscillatory_Networks.html">124 nips-2000-Spike-Timing-Dependent Learning for Oscillatory Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Jun Morimoto, Kenji Doya</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that explicitly takes into account input disturbance as well as modeling errors. The use of environmental models in RL is quite popular for both off-line learning by simulations and for on-line action planning. However, the difference between the model and the real environment can lead to unpredictable, often unwanted results. Based on the theory of H oocontrol, we consider a differential game in which a 'disturbing' agent (disturber) tries to make the worst possible disturbance while a 'control' agent (actor) tries to make the best control input. The problem is formulated as finding a minmax solution of a value function that takes into account the norm of the output deviation and the norm of the disturbance. We derive on-line learning algorithms for estimating the value function and for calculating the worst disturbance and the best control in reference to the value function. We tested the paradigm, which we call</p><p>3 0.43876642 <a title="66-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Who_Does_What%3F_A_Novel_Algorithm_to_Determine_Function_Localization.html">147 nips-2000-Who Does What?

<p>Author: Ranit Aharonov-Barki, Isaac Meilijson, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm, termed PPA (Performance Prediction Algorithm), that quantitatively measures the contributions of elements of a neural system to the tasks it performs. The algorithm identifies the neurons or areas which participate in a cognitive or behavioral task, given data about performance decrease in a small set of lesions. It also allows the accurate prediction of performances due to multi-element lesions. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated in two models of recurrent neural networks with complex interactions among the elements. The algorithm is scalable and applicable to the analysis of large neural networks. Given the recent advances in reversible inactivation techniques, it has the potential to significantly contribute to the understanding of the organization of biological nervous systems, and to shed light on the long-lasting debate about local versus distributed computation in the brain.</p><p>4 0.43013024 <a title="66-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Spike-Timing-Dependent_Learning_for_Oscillatory_Networks.html">124 nips-2000-Spike-Timing-Dependent Learning for Oscillatory Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The paradigm of Hebbian learning has recently received a novel interpretation with the discovery of synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes. This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic principle of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the experimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs. These results suggest experimental prediction as to the dependency of the learning rule on neuronal biophysical parameters 1</p><p>6 0.41794735 <a title="66-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Bayes_Networks_on_Ice%3A_Robotic_Search_for_Antarctic_Meteorites.html">29 nips-2000-Bayes Networks on Ice: Robotic Search for Antarctic Meteorites</a></p>

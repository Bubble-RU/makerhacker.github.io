<p>Author: Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Using statistical mechanics results, I calculate learning curves (average generalization error) for Gaussian processes (GPs) and Bayesian neural networks (NNs) used for regression. Applying the results to learning a teacher defined by a two-layer network, I can directly compare GP and Bayesian NN learning. I find that a GP in general requires CJ (d S )-training examples to learn input features of order s (d is the input dimension), whereas a NN can learn the task with order the number of adjustable weights training examples. Since a GP can be considered as an infinite NN, the results show that even in the Bayesian approach, it is important to limit the complexity of the learning machine. The theoretical findings are confirmed in simulations with analytical GP learning and a NN mean field algorithm.</p><p>4 0.15621208 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Convergence_of_Large_Margin_Separable_Linear_Classification.html">37 nips-2000-Convergence of Large Margin Separable Linear Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m 2 ) of memory and 0 (N . m2 ) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior. Finally, rejecting test points on the basis of their (approximative) posterior probability leads to a rapid decrease in generalisation error, e.g. 0.1% generalisation error for a given rejection rate of 10%. 1</p><p>6 0.14008126 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-A_PAC-Bayesian_Margin_Bound_for_Linear_Classifiers%3A_Why_SVMs_work.html">9 nips-2000-A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear Classifiers: Why SVMs work</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In theory, the Winnow multiplicative update has certain advantages over the Perceptron additive update when there are many irrelevant attributes. Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods.</p><p>3 0.61327541 <a title="7-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Convergence_of_Large_Margin_Separable_Linear_Classification.html">37 nips-2000-Convergence of Large Margin Separable Linear Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Ben-David, Hans-Ulrich Simon</p><p>Abstract: We consider the existence of efficient algorithms for learning the class of half-spaces in ~n in the agnostic learning model (Le., making no prior assumptions on the example-generating distribution). The resulting combinatorial problem - finding the best agreement half-space over an input sample - is NP hard to approximate to within some constant factor. We suggest a way to circumvent this theoretical bound by introducing a new measure of success for such algorithms. An algorithm is IL-margin successful if the agreement ratio of the half-space it outputs is as good as that of any half-space once training points that are inside the IL-margins of its separating hyper-plane are disregarded. We prove crisp computational complexity results with respect to this success measure: On one hand, for every positive IL, there exist efficient (poly-time) IL-margin successful learning algorithms. On the other hand, we prove that unless P=NP, there is no algorithm that runs in time polynomial in the sample size and in 1/ IL that is IL-margin successful for all IL> O. 1</p><p>6 0.45355844 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Computing_with_Finite_and_Infinite_Networks.html">35 nips-2000-Computing with Finite and Infinite Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Colin Campbell, Kristin P. Bennett</p><p>Abstract: Novelty detection involves modeling the normal behaviour of a system hence enabling detection of any divergence from normality. It has potential applications in many areas such as detection of machine damage or highlighting abnormal features in medical data. One approach is to build a hypothesis estimating the support of the normal data i. e. constructing a function which is positive in the region where the data is located and negative elsewhere. Recently kernel methods have been proposed for estimating the support of a distribution and they have performed well in practice - training involves solution of a quadratic programming problem. In this paper we propose a simpler kernel method for estimating the support based on linear programming. The method is easy to implement and can learn large datasets rapidly. We demonstrate the method on medical and fault detection datasets. 1 Introduction. An important classification task is the ability to distinguish b etween new instances similar to m embers of the training set and all other instances that can occur. For example, we may want to learn the normal running behaviour of a machine and highlight any significant divergence from normality which may indicate onset of damage or faults. This issue is a generic problem in many fields. For example, an abnormal event or feature in medical diagnostic data typically leads to further investigation. Novel events can be highlighted by constructing a real-valued density estimation function. However, here we will consider the simpler task of modelling the support of a data distribution i.e. creating a binary-valued function which is positive in those regions of input space where the data predominantly lies and negative elsewhere. Recently kernel methods have been applied to this problem [4]. In this approach data is implicitly mapped to a high-dimensional space called feature space [13]. Suppose the data points in input space are X i (with i = 1, . . . , m) and the mapping is Xi --+ ¢;(Xi) then in the span of {¢;(Xi)}, we can expand a vector w = Lj cr.j¢;(Xj). Hence we can define separating hyperplanes in feature space by w . ¢;(x;) + b = O. We will refer to w . ¢;(Xi) + b as the margin which will be positive on one side of the separating hyperplane and negative on the other. Thus we can also define a decision function: (1) where z is a new data point. The data appears in the form of an inner product in feature space so we can implicitly define feature space by our choice of kernel function: (2) A number of choices for the kernel are possible, for example, RBF kernels: (3) With the given kernel the decision function is therefore given by: (4) One approach to novelty detection is to find a hypersphere in feature space with a minimal radius R and centre a which contains most of the data: novel test points lie outside the boundary of this hypersphere [3 , 12] . This approach to novelty detection was proposed by Tax and Duin [10] and successfully used on real life applications [11] . The effect of outliers is reduced by using slack variables to allow for datapoints outside the sphere and the task is to minimise the volume of the sphere and number of datapoints outside i.e. e i mIll s.t. [R2 + oX L i ei 1 (Xi - a) . (Xi - a) S R2 + e ei i, ~ a (5) Since the data appears in the form of inner products kernel substitution can be applied and the learning task can be reduced to a quadratic programming problem. An alternative approach has been developed by Scholkopf et al. [7]. Suppose we restricted our attention to RBF kernels (3) then the data lies on the surface of a hypersphere in feature space since ¢;(x) . ¢;(x) = K(x , x) = l. The objective is therefore to separate off the surface region constaining data from the region containing no data. This is achieved by constructing a hyperplane which is maximally distant from the origin with all datapoints lying on the opposite side from the origin and such that the margin is positive. The learning task in dual form involves minimisation of: mIll s.t. W(cr.) = t L7,'k=l cr.icr.jK(Xi, Xj) a S cr.i S C, L::1 cr.i = l. (6) However, the origin plays a special role in this model. As the authors point out [9] this is a disadvantage since the origin effectively acts as a prior for where the class of abnormal instances is assumed to lie. In this paper we avoid this problem: rather than repelling the hyperplane away from an arbitrary point outside the data distribution we instead try and attract the hyperplane towards the centre of the data distribution. In this paper we will outline a new algorithm for novelty detection which can be easily implemented using linear programming (LP) techniques. As we illustrate in section 3 it performs well in practice on datasets involving the detection of abnormalities in medical data and fault detection in condition monitoring. 2 The Algorithm For the hard margin case (see Figure 1) the objective is to find a surface in input space which wraps around the data clusters: anything outside this surface is viewed as abnormal. This surface is defined as the level set, J(z) = 0, of some nonlinear function. In feature space, J(z) = L; O'.;K(z, x;) + b, this corresponds to a hyperplane which is pulled onto the mapped datapoints with the restriction that the margin always remains positive or zero. We make the fit of this nonlinear function or hyperplane as tight as possible by minimizing the mean value of the output of the function, i.e., Li J(x;). This is achieved by minimising: (7) subject to: m LO'.jK(x;,Xj) + b 2:: 0 (8) j=l m L 0'.; = 1, 0'.; 2:: 0 (9) ;=1 The bias b is just treated as an additional parameter in the minimisation process though unrestricted in sign. The added constraints (9) on 0'. bound the class of models to be considered - we don't want to consider simple linear rescalings of the model. These constraints amount to a choice of scale for the weight vector normal to the hyperplane in feature space and hence do not impose a restriction on the model. Also, these constraints ensure that the problem is well-posed and that an optimal solution with 0'. i- 0 exists. Other constraints on the class of functions are possible, e.g. 110'.111 = 1 with no restriction on the sign of O'.i. Many real-life datasets contain noise and outliers. To handle these we can introduce a soft margin in analogy to the usual approach used with support vector machines. In this case we minimise: (10) subject to: m LO:jJ{(Xi , Xj)+b~-ei' ei~O (11) j=l and constraints (9). The parameter). controls the extent of margin errors (larger ). means fewer outliers are ignored: ). -+ 00 corresponds to the hard margin limit). The above problem can be easily solved for problems with thousands of points using standard simplex or interior point algorithms for linear programming. With the addition of column generation techniques, these same approaches can be adopted for very large problems in which the kernel matrix exceeds the capacity of main memory. Column generation algorithms incrementally add and drop columns each corresponding to a single kernel function until optimality is reached. Such approaches have been successfully applied to other support vector problems [6 , 2]. Basic simplex algorithms were sufficient for the problems considered in this paper, so we defer a listing of the code for column generation to a later paper together with experiments on large datasets [1]. 3 Experiments Artificial datasets. Before considering experiments on real-life data we will first illustrate the performance of the algorithm on some artificial datasets. In Figure 1 the algorithm places a boundary around two data clusters in input space: a hard margin was used with RBF kernels and (J</p><p>3 0.67893398 <a title="7-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Regularized_Winnow_Methods.html">111 nips-2000-Regularized Winnow Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In theory, the Winnow multiplicative update has certain advantages over the Perceptron additive update when there are many irrelevant attributes. Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods.</p><p>4 0.6777631 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We present an improvement of Novikoff's perceptron convergence theorem. Reinterpreting this mistake bound as a margin dependent sparsity guarantee allows us to give a PAC-style generalisation error bound for the classifier learned by the perceptron learning algorithm. The bound value crucially depends on the margin a support vector machine would achieve on the same data set using the same kernel. Ironically, the bound yields better guarantees than are currently available for the support vector solution itself. 1</p><p>5 0.67157584 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Constrained_Independent_Component_Analysis.html">36 nips-2000-Constrained Independent Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Lu, Jagath C. Rajapakse</p><p>Abstract: The paper presents a novel technique of constrained independent component analysis (CICA) to introduce constraints into the classical ICA and solve the constrained optimization problem by using Lagrange multiplier methods. This paper shows that CICA can be used to order the resulted independent components in a specific manner and normalize the demixing matrix in the signal separation procedure. It can systematically eliminate the ICA's indeterminacy on permutation and dilation. The experiments demonstrate the use of CICA in ordering of independent components while providing normalized demixing processes.

<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: For many problems which would be natural for reinforcement learning, the reward signal is not a single scalar value but has multiple scalar components. Examples of such problems include agents with multiple goals and agents with multiple users. Creating a single reward value by combining the multiple components can throwaway vital information and can lead to incorrect solutions. We describe the multiple reward source problem and discuss the problems with applying traditional reinforcement learning.

<p>Author: Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical Suffix Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic corridor navigation task. 1</p><p>6 0.40129572 <a title="43-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Occam%27s_Razor.html">92 nips-2000-Occam's Razor</a></p>

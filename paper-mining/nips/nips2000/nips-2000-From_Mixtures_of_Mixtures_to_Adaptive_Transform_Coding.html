Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines.

<p>Author: Mark J. F. Gales</p><p>Abstract: A new form of covariance modelling for Gaussian mixture models and hidden Markov models is presented. This is an extension to an efficient form of covariance modelling used in speech recognition, semi-tied covariance matrices. In the standard form of semi-tied covariance matrices the covariance matrix is decomposed into a highly shared decorrelating transform and a component-specific diagonal covariance matrix. The use of a factored decorrelating transform is presented in this paper. This factoring effectively increases the number of possible transforms without increasing the number of free parameters. Maximum likelihood estimation schemes for all the model parameters are presented including the component/transform assignment, transform and component parameters. This new model form is evaluated on a large vocabulary speech recognition task. It is shown that using this factored form of covariance modelling reduces the word error rate.</p><p>5 0.15439701 <a title="59-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Comparison_of_Image_Processing_Techniques_for_Visual_Speech_Recognition_Applications.html">2 nips-2000-A Comparison of Image Processing Techniques for Visual Speech Recognition Applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael S. Gray, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Javier R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: We examine eight different techniques for developing visual representations in machine vision tasks. In particular we compare different versions of principal component and independent component analysis in combination with stepwise regression methods for variable selection. We found that local methods, based on the statistics of image patches, consistently outperformed global methods based on the statistics of entire images. This result is consistent with previous work on emotion and facial expression recognition. In addition, the use of a stepwise regression technique for selecting variables and regions of interest substantially boosted performance. 1</p><p>6 0.14066464 <a title="59-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Emergence_of_Movement_Sensitive_Neurons%27_Properties_by_Learning_a_Sparse_Code_for_Natural_Moving_Images.html">45 nips-2000-Emergence of Movement Sensitive Neurons' Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Moving Images</a></p>

<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Andr茅 Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel way of obtaining PAC-style bounds on the generalization error of learning algorithms, explicitly using their stability properties. A stable learner is one for which the learned solution does not change much with small changes in the training set. The bounds we obtain do not depend on any measure of the complexity of the hypothesis space (e.g. VC dimension) but rather depend on how the learning algorithm searches this space, and can thus be applied even when the VC dimension is infinite. We demonstrate that regularization networks possess the required stability property and apply our method to obtain new bounds on their generalization performance. 1</p><p>3 0.33091876 <a title="59-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Stagewise_Processing_in_Error-correcting_Codes_and_Image_Restoration.html">126 nips-2000-Stagewise Processing in Error-correcting Codes and Image Restoration</a></p>

<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>5 0.31444401 <a title="59-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Redundancy_and_Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Sparse-Distributed_Representations_of_Natural_Objects_in_Terms_of_Their_Local_Features.html">109 nips-2000-Redundancy and Dimensionality Reduction in Sparse-Distributed Representations of Natural Objects in Terms of Their Local Features</a></p>

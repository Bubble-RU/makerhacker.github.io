<p>Author: Susanne Still, Bernhard Schölkopf, Klaus Hepp, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg movements by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the outputs of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The relationship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal relationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and offsets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given. The machine learns from (unlabeled) examples how to set the parameters to the chip in order to obtain a desired motor behavior.</p><p>4 0.1530571 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-A_Silicon_Primitive_for_Competitive_Learning.html">11 nips-2000-A Silicon Primitive for Competitive Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: David Hsu, Miguel Figueroa, Chris Diorio</p><p>Abstract: Competitive learning is a technique for training classification and clustering networks. We have designed and fabricated an 11transistor primitive, that we term an automaximizing bump circuit, that implements competitive learning dynamics. The circuit performs a similarity computation, affords nonvolatile storage, and implements simultaneous local adaptation and computation. We show that our primitive is suitable for implementing competitive learning in VLSI, and demonstrate its effectiveness in a standard clustering task.</p><p>5 0.12002265 <a title="118-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-A_New_Model_of_Spatial_Representation_in_Multimodal_Brain_Areas.html">8 nips-2000-A New Model of Spatial Representation in Multimodal Brain Areas</a></p>
<p>Author: Sophie Denève, Jean-René Duhamel, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocentric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions. The level of grey represent the frequency of discharge (In spikes per seconds). The white cross is the fixation point (the head is fixed). The cell's receptive field is moving with the eyes, but only partially. Here the receptive field shift is 60% of the total gaze shift. Moreover this cell is gain modulated by eye position (adapted from Duhamel et al). that the representations should be useful for sensory-motor transformations, rather than encode an</p><p>6 0.10626945 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Place_Cells_and_Spatial_Navigation_Based_on_2D_Visual_Feature_Extraction%2C_Path_Integration%2C_and_Reinforcement_Learning.html">101 nips-2000-Place Cells and Spatial Navigation Based on 2D Visual Feature Extraction, Path Integration, and Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Un-Min Bae, Soo-Young Lee</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm which compensates for the mismatches between characteristics of real-world problems and assumptions of independent component analysis algorithm. To provide additional information to the ICA network, we incorporate top-down selective attention. An MLP classifier is added to the separated signal channel and the error of the classifier is backpropagated to the ICA network. This backpropagation process results in estimation of expected ICA output signal for the top-down attention. Then, the unmixing matrix is retrained according to a new cost function representing the backpropagated error as well as independence. It modifies the density of recovered signals to the density appropriate for classification. For noisy speech signal recorded in real environments, the algorithm improved the recognition performance and showed robustness against parametric changes. 1</p><p>3 0.29027975 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-A_New_Model_of_Spatial_Representation_in_Multimodal_Brain_Areas.html">8 nips-2000-A New Model of Spatial Representation in Multimodal Brain Areas</a></p>
<p>Author: Sophie Denève, Jean-René Duhamel, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocentric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions. The level of grey represent the frequency of discharge (In spikes per seconds). The white cross is the fixation point (the head is fixed). The cell's receptive field is moving with the eyes, but only partially. Here the receptive field shift is 60% of the total gaze shift. Moreover this cell is gain modulated by eye position (adapted from Duhamel et al). that the representations should be useful for sensory-motor transformations, rather than encode an</p><p>4 0.2833271 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Winner-take-all_Competition_Between_Groups_of_Neurons_in_Lateral_Inhibitory_Networks.html">81 nips-2000-Learning Winner-take-all Competition Between Groups of Neurons in Lateral Inhibitory Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computational function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as permitted sets of coactive neurons. In traditional winner-take-all networks, lateral inhibition is used to enforce a localized, or</p><p>5 0.28133482 <a title="118-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Gradient-Based_Boosting_Algorithm_for_Regression_Problems.html">3 nips-2000-A Gradient-Based Boosting Algorithm for Regression Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Toniann Pitassi</p><p>Abstract: In adaptive boosting, several weak learners trained sequentially are combined to boost the overall algorithm performance. Recently adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, all chosen to optimize a single common objective function. We propose an analogous formulation for adaptive boosting of regression problems, utilizing a novel objective function that leads to a simple boosting algorithm. We prove that this method reduces training error, and compare its performance to other regression methods.

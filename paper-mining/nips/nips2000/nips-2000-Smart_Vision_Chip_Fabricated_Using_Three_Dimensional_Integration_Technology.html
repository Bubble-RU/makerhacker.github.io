</p><p>3 Three dimensional technology has great potential to realize new neuromorphic systems inspired by not only the biological function but also the biological structure. [sent-17, score-0.942]
</p><p>4 In this paper, we describe our three dimensional LSI technology for neuromorphic circuits and the design of smart vision chips . [sent-18, score-1.941]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction Recently, the demand for very fast image processing systems with real time operation capability has significantly increased. [sent-19, score-0.239]
</p><p>6 Conventional image processing systems based on the system level integration of a camera and a digital processor, do not have the potential for application in general purpose consumer electronic products . [sent-20, score-0.486]
</p><p>7 This is simply due to the cost, size and complexity of these systems . [sent-21, score-0.042]
</p><p>8 Therefore the smart vision chip will be an inevitable component of future intelligent systems . [sent-22, score-1.054]
</p><p>9 In smart vision chips, 2D images are simultaneously processed in parallel. [sent-23, score-0.877]
</p><p>10 Therefore very high speed image processing can be realized. [sent-24, score-0.193]
</p><p>11 In order to receive a light signal as much as possible, the photo-detector should occupy a large proportion of the pixel area. [sent-26, score-0.214]
</p><p>12 However the successi ve processing circuits must become larger in each pixel to realize high level image processing. [sent-27, score-0.635]
</p><p>13 It is very difficult to achieve smart vision chips by using conventional two dimensional (2D) LSI technology because such smart vision chips have low fill-factor and low resolution. [sent-28, score-2.509]
</p><p>14 This problem can be overcome if three dimensional (3D) integration technology can be employed for the smart vision  chip. [sent-29, score-1.375]
</p><p>15 In this paper, we propose a smart vision chip fabricated by three dimensional integration technology. [sent-30, score-1.512]
</p><p>16 We also discuss the key technologies for realizing three dimensional integration and preliminary test results of three dimensional image sensor chips. [sent-31, score-1.044]
</p><p>17 2  Three Dimensional Integrated Vision Chips  Figure 1 shows the cross-sectional structure of the three dimensional integrated vision chip. [sent-32, score-0.675]
</p><p>18 Several circuit layers with different functions are stacked into one chip in 3D LSI. [sent-33, score-0.47]
</p><p>19 For example, the first layer consists of a photo detector array acting like photo receptive cells in the retina, the second layer is horizontal/bipolar cell circuits, the third layer is ganglion cell circuits and so on. [sent-34, score-1.832]
</p><p>20 Each circuit layer is stacked and electrically connected vertically using buried interconnections and micro bumps. [sent-35, score-0.619]
</p><p>21 By using three dimensional integration technology, a photo detector can be formed with a high fill-factor and high resolution, because several successive processing circuits with large areas are formed on the lower layers underneath the photo detector layer. [sent-36, score-1.789]
</p><p>22 Every photo detector is directly connected with successive processing circuits (ie . [sent-37, score-0.76]
</p><p>23 horizontal and bipolar cell circuits) in parallel via the vertical interconnections. [sent-38, score-0.291]
</p><p>24 The signals in every pixel are simultaneously transferred in the vertical direction and processed in parallel in each layer. [sent-39, score-0.446]
</p><p>25 Therefore high performance real time vision chips can be realized. [sent-40, score-0.584]
</p><p>26 We considered the 3D LSI suitable for realizing neuromorphic LSI, because the three dimensional structure is quite similar to the structure of the retina or cortex. [sent-41, score-0.726]
</p><p>27 Three dimensional technology will realize new neuromorphic systems inspired by not only the biological function but also the biological structure. [sent-42, score-0.872]
</p><p>28 Figure 2 shows the neuromorphic analog circuits implemented into 3D LSI. [sent-45, score-0.493]

<p>Author: Susanne Still, Bernhard Schölkopf, Klaus Hepp, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: To control the walking gaits of a four-legged robot we present a novel neuromorphic VLSI chip that coordinates the relative phasing of the robot's legs similar to how spinal Central Pattern Generators are believed to control vertebrate locomotion [3]. The chip controls the leg movements by driving motors with time varying voltages which are the outputs of a small network of coupled oscillators. The characteristics of the chip's output voltages depend on a set of input parameters. The relationship between input parameters and output voltages can be computed analytically for an idealized system. In practice, however, this ideal relationship is only approximately true due to transistor mismatch and offsets. Fine tuning of the chip's input parameters is done automatically by the robotic system, using an unsupervised Support Vector (SV) learning algorithm introduced recently [7]. The learning requires only that the description of the desired output is given. The machine learns from (unlabeled) examples how to set the parameters to the chip in order to obtain a desired motor behavior.</p><p>4 0.077515215 <a title="118-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-A_Silicon_Primitive_for_Competitive_Learning.html">11 nips-2000-A Silicon Primitive for Competitive Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Malcolm Slaney, Michele Covell</p><p>Abstract: FaceSync is an optimal linear algorithm that finds the degree of synchronization between the audio and image recordings of a human speaker. Using canonical correlation, it finds the best direction to combine all the audio and image data, projecting them onto a single axis. FaceSync uses Pearson's correlation to measure the degree of synchronization between the audio and image data. We derive the optimal linear transform to combine the audio and visual information and describe an implementation that avoids the numerical problems caused by computing the correlation matrices. 1 Motivation In many applications, we want to know about the synchronization between an audio signal and the corresponding image data. In a teleconferencing system, we might want to know which of the several people imaged by a camera is heard by the microphones; then, we can direct the camera to the speaker. In post-production for a film, clean audio dialog is often dubbed over the video; we want to adjust the audio signal so that the lip-sync is perfect. When analyzing a film, we want to know when the person talking is in the shot, instead of off camera. When evaluating the quality of dubbed films, we can measure of how well the translated words and audio fit the actor's face. This paper describes an algorithm, FaceSync, that measures the degree of synchronization between the video image of a face and the associated audio signal. We can do this task by synthesizing the talking face, using techniques such as Video Rewrite [1], and then comparing the synthesized video with the test video. That process, however, is expensive. Our solution finds a linear operator that, when applied to the audio and video signals, generates an audio-video-synchronization-error signal. The linear operator gathers information from throughout the image and thus allows us to do the computation inexpensively. Hershey and Movellan [2] describe an approach based on measuring the mutual information between the audio signal and individual pixels in the video. The correlation between the audio signal, x, and one pixel in the image y, is given by Pearson's correlation, r. The mutual information between these two variables is given by f(x,y) = -1/2 log(l-?). They create movies that show the regions of the video that have high correlation with the audio; 1. Currently at IBM Almaden Research, 650 Harry Road, San Jose, CA 95120. 2.

<p>Author: William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: Many processes in biology, from the regulation of gene expression in bacteria to memory in the brain, involve switches constructed from networks of biochemical reactions. Crucial molecules are present in small numbers, raising questions about noise and stability. Analysis of noise in simple reaction schemes indicates that switches stable for years and switchable in milliseconds can be built from fewer than one hundred molecules. Prospects for direct tests of this prediction, as well as implications, are discussed. 1</p><p>4 0.44820473 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Color_Opponency_Constitutes_a_Sparse_Representation_for_the_Chromatic_Structure_of_Natural_Scenes.html">32 nips-2000-Color Opponency Constitutes a Sparse Representation for the Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes</a></p>
<p>Author: Te-Won Lee, Thomas Wachtler, Terrence J. Sejnowski</p><p>Abstract: The human visual system encodes the chromatic signals conveyed by the three types of retinal cone photoreceptors in an opponent fashion. This color opponency has been shown to constitute an efficient encoding by spectral decorrelation of the receptor signals. We analyze the spatial and chromatic structure of natural scenes by decomposing the spectral images into a set of linear basis functions such that they constitute a representation with minimal redundancy. Independent component analysis finds the basis functions that transforms the spatiochromatic data such that the outputs (activations) are statistically as independent as possible, i.e. least redundant. The resulting basis functions show strong opponency along an achromatic direction (luminance edges), along a blueyellow direction, and along a red-blue direction. Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient representation of colors. Our findings suggest that color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitivities. 1 Statistical structure of natural scenes Efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for information processing systems and its study may provide insights into coding principles of biological visual systems.

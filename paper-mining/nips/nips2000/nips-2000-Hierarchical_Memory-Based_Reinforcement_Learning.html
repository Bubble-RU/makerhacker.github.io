<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew G. Barto</p><p>Abstract: Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accomplish the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hierarchical structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction, and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be automated. We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illustrate the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective.</p><p>3 0.17977895 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Balancing_Multiple_Sources_of_Reward_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">28 nips-2000-Balancing Multiple Sources of Reward in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: For many problems which would be natural for reinforcement learning, the reward signal is not a single scalar value but has multiple scalar components. Examples of such problems include agents with multiple goals and agents with multiple users. Creating a single reward value by combining the multiple components can throwaway vital information and can lead to incorrect solutions. We describe the multiple reward source problem and discuss the problems with applying traditional reinforcement learning. We then present an new algorithm for finding a solution and results on simulated environments.</p><p>4 0.16522227 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Using_Free_Energies_to_Represent_Q-values_in_a_Multiagent_Reinforcement_Learning_Task.html">142 nips-2000-Using Free Energies to Represent Q-values in a Multiagent Reinforcement Learning Task</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Sallans, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task. The product of experts model is found to perform comparably to table-based Q-Iearning for small instances of the task, and continues to perform well when the problem becomes too large for a table-based representation.</p><p>5 0.15814155 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Programmable_Reinforcement_Learning_Agents.html">105 nips-2000-Programmable Reinforcement Learning Agents</a></p>

Russell</p><p>Abstract: We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process.The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program. For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.</p><p>6 0.11123114 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Adaptive_Object_Representation_with_Hierarchically-Distributed_Memory_Sites.html">19 nips-2000-Adaptive Object Representation with Hierarchically-Distributed Memory Sites</a></p>

<p>Author: Bosco S. Tjan</p><p>Abstract: Theories of object recognition often assume that only one representation scheme is used within one visual-processing pathway. Versatility of the visual system comes from having multiple visual-processing pathways, each specialized in a different category of objects. We propose a theoretically simpler alternative, capable of explaining the same set of data and more. A single primary visual-processing pathway, loosely modular, is assumed. Memory modules are attached to sites along this pathway. Object-identity decision is made independently at each site. A site's response time is a monotonic-decreasing function of its confidence regarding its decision. An observer's response is the first-arriving response from any site. The effective representation(s) of such a system, determined empirically, can appear to be specialized for different tasks and stimuli, consistent with recent clinical and functional-imaging findings. This, however, merely reflects a decision being made at its appropriate level of abstraction. The system itself is intrinsically flexible and adaptive.</p><p>5 0.51220483 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Hippocampally-Dependent_Consolidation_in_a_Hierarchical_Model_of_Neocortex.html">66 nips-2000-Hippocampally-Dependent Consolidation in a Hierarchical Model of Neocortex</a></p>
<p>Author: Szabolcs KĂĄli, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: In memory consolidation, declarative memories which initially require the hippocampus for their recall, ultimately become independent of it. Consolidation has been the focus of numerous experimental and qualitative modeling studies, but only little quantitative exploration. We present a consolidation model in which hierarchical connections in the cortex, that initially instantiate purely semantic information acquired through probabilistic unsupervised learning, come to instantiate episodic information as well. The hippocampus is responsible for helping complete partial input patterns before consolidation is complete, while also training the cortex to perform appropriate completion by itself.</p><p>6 0.4376902 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Balancing_Multiple_Sources_of_Reward_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">28 nips-2000-Balancing Multiple Sources of Reward in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jakob Carlström</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplifying reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-future call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call arrival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in significantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1</p><p>2 0.88070077 <a title="63-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Bayes_Networks_on_Ice%3A_Robotic_Search_for_Antarctic_Meteorites.html">29 nips-2000-Bayes Networks on Ice: Robotic Search for Antarctic Meteorites</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>3 0.17528032 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Active_Learning_for_Parameter_Estimation_in_Bayesian_Networks.html">17 nips-2000-Active Learning for Parameter Estimation in Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Simon Tong, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian networks are graphical representations of probability distributions. In virtually all of the work on learning these networks, the assumption is that we are presented with a data set consisting of randomly generated instances from the underlying distribution. In many situations, however, we also have the option of active learning, where we have the possibility of guiding the sampling process by querying for certain types of samples. This paper addresses the problem of estimating the parameters of Bayesian networks in an active learning setting. We provide a theoretical framework for this problem, and an algorithm that chooses which active learning queries to generate based on the model learned so far. We present experimental results showing that our active learning algorithm can significantly reduce the need for training data in many situations.</p><p>4 0.17307907 <a title="41-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Second_Order_Approximations_for_Probability_Models.html">114 nips-2000-Second Order Approximations for Probability Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we derive a second order mean field theory for directed graphical probability models. By using an information theoretic argument it is shown how this can be done in the absense of a partition function. This method is a direct generalisation of the well-known TAP approximation for Boltzmann Machines. In a numerical example, it is shown that the method greatly improves the first order mean field approximation. For a restricted class of graphical models, so-called single overlap graphs, the second order method has comparable complexity to the first order method. For sigmoid belief networks, the method is shown to be particularly fast and effective.</p><p>5 0.16703014 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Recognizing_Hand-written_Digits_Using_Hierarchical_Products_of_Experts.html">108 nips-2000-Recognizing Hand-written Digits Using Hierarchical Products of Experts</a></p>
<p>Author: Guy Mayraz, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The product of experts learning procedure [1] can discover a set of stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of handwritten images of digits. The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - l)th level model. After training, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logistic classification network that is trained on separate data. On the MNIST database, our system is comparable with current state-of-the-art discriminative methods, demonstrating that the product of experts learning procedure can produce effective generative models of high-dimensional data. 1 Learning products of stochastic binary experts Hinton [1] describes a learning algorithm for probabilistic generative models that are composed of a number of experts. Each expert specifies a probability distribution over the visible variables and the experts are combined by multiplying these distributions together and renormalizing. (1) where d is a data vector in a discrete space, Om is all the parameters of individual model m, Pm(dIOm) is the probability of d under model m, and c is an index over all possible vectors in the data space. A Restricted Boltzmann machine [2, 3] is a special case of a product of experts in which each expert is a single, binary stochastic hidden unit that has symmetrical connections to a set of visible units, and connections between the hidden units are forbidden. Inference in an RBM is much easier than in a general Boltzmann machine and it is also much easier than in a causal belief net because there is no explaining away. There is therefore no need to perform any iteration to determine the activities of the hidden units. The hidden states, Sj , are conditionally independent given the visible states, Si, and the distribution of Sj is given by the standard logistic function : 1 p(Sj = 1) = (2) 1 + exp( - Li WijSi) Conversely, the hidden states of an RBM are marginally dependent so it is easy for an RBM to learn population codes in which units may be highly correlated. It is hard to do this in causal belief nets with one hidden layer because the generative model of a causal belief net assumes marginal independence. An RBM can be trained using the standard Boltzmann machine learning algorithm which follows a noisy but unbiased estimate of the gradient of the log likelihood of the data. One way to implement this algorithm is to start the network with a data vector on the visible units and then to alternate between updating all of the hidden units in parallel and updating all of the visible units in parallel. Each update picks a binary state for a unit from its posterior distribution given the current states of all the units in the other set. If this alternating Gibbs sampling is run to equilibrium, there is a very simple way to update the weights so as to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence, QOIIQoo, between the data distribution, QO, and the equilibrium distribution of fantasies over the visible units, Qoo, produced by the RBM [4]: flWij oc QO - Q~ (3) where < SiSj >Qo is the expected value of SiSj when data is clamped on the visible units and the hidden states are sampled from their conditional distribution given the data, and Q ~ is the expected value of SiSj after prolonged Gibbs sampling. This learning rule does not work well because it can take a long time to approach thermal equilibrium and the sampling noise in the estimate of  Q ~ can swamp the gradient. [1] shows that it is far more effective to minimize the difference between QOllQoo and Q111Qoo where Q1 is the distribution of the one-step reconstructions of the data that are produced by first picking binary hidden states from their conditional distribution given the data and then picking binary visible states from their conditional distribution given the hidden states.

Individuals are then recognized by finding the highest relative probability pair among all pairs that consist of a test image and an image whose identity is known. Our method compares favorably with other methods in the literature. The generative model consists of a single layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors and it has the property that, given a data vector, the true posterior probability distribution over the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or approximation.

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Anitha Kannan</p><p>Abstract: One way to approximate inference in richly-connected graphical models is to apply the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. probability propagation algorithm), while ignoring the fact that the graph has cycles. The sum-product algorithm can be directly applied in Gaussian networks and in graphs for coding, but for many conditional probability functions - including the sigmoid function - direct application of the sum-product algorithm is not possible.

<p>Author: Milind R. Naphade, Igor Kozintsev, Thomas S. Huang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel probabilistic framework for semantic video indexing. We define probabilistic multimedia objects (multijects) to map low-level media features to high-level semantic labels. A graphical network of such multijects (multinet) captures scene context by discovering intra-frame as well as inter-frame dependency relations between the concepts. The main contribution is a novel application of a factor graph framework to model this network. We model relations between semantic concepts in terms of their co-occurrence as well as the temporal dependencies between these concepts within video shots. Using the sum-product algorithm [1] for approximate or exact inference in these factor graph multinets, we attempt to correct errors made during isolated concept detection by forcing high-level constraints. This results in a significant improvement in the overall detection performance. 1</p><p>3 0.98639232 <a title="41-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-A_Gradient-Based_Boosting_Algorithm_for_Regression_Problems.html">3 nips-2000-A Gradient-Based Boosting Algorithm for Regression Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Toniann Pitassi</p><p>Abstract: In adaptive boosting, several weak learners trained sequentially are combined to boost the overall algorithm performance. Recently adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, all chosen to optimize a single common objective function. We propose an analogous formulation for adaptive boosting of regression problems, utilizing a novel objective function that leads to a simple boosting algorithm. We prove that this method reduces training error, and compare its performance to other regression methods. The aim of boosting algorithms is to</p><p>same-paper 4 0.98610497 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Discovering_Hidden_Variables%3A_A_Structure-Based_Approach.html">41 nips-2000-Discovering Hidden Variables: A Structure-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Noam Lotner, Nir Friedman, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hidden variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models. A very natural approach is to search for</p><p>5 0.8750267 <a title="41-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Sequentially_Fitting_%60%60Inclusive%27%27_Trees_for_Inference_in_Noisy-OR_Networks.html">115 nips-2000-Sequentially Fitting ``Inclusive'' Trees for Inference in Noisy-OR Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Relu Patrascu, Tommi Jaakkola, Jodi Moran</p><p>Abstract: An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisyOR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's parents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is intractable, but approximate methods (e .g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One problem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ignoring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisyOR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree. We compare this method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT medical diagnostic network. 1 Inclusive variational approximations Approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference are gaining in popularity and are now even being incorporated into VLSI hardware (T. Richardson, personal communication). Approximate methods include variational techniques (Ghahramani and Jordan 1997; Saul et al. 1996; Frey and Hinton 1999; Jordan et al. 1999), local probability propagation (Gallager 1963; Pearl 1988; Frey 1998; MacKay 1999a; Freeman and Weiss 2001) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Neal 1993; MacKay 1999b). Many algorithms have been proposed in each of these classes. One problem that most of the above algorithms suffer from is a tendency to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes of the target distribution (the distribution being approximated). In the case of medical diagnosis, different modes correspond to different explanations of the symptoms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are usually guaranteed to eventually sample from all the modes, but this may take an extremely long time, even when tempered transitions (Neal 1996) are (a) ,,</p><p>6 0.82452577 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

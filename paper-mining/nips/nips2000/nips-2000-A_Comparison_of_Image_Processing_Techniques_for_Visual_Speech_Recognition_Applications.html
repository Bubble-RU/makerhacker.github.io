Individuals are then recognized by finding the highest relative probability pair among all pairs that consist of a test image and an image whose identity is known. Our method compares favorably with other methods in the literature. The generative model consists of a single layer of rate-coded, non-linear feature detectors and it has the property that, given a data vector, the true posterior probability distribution over the feature detector activities can be inferred rapidly without iteration or approximation. The weights of the feature detectors are learned by comparing the correlations of pixel intensities and feature activations in two phases: When the network is observing real data and when it is observing reconstructions of real data generated from the feature activations.</p><p>3 0.21816887 <a title="2-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Sparse_Kernel_Principal_Component_Analysis.html">121 nips-2000-Sparse Kernel Principal Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping</p><p>Abstract: 'Kernel' principal component analysis (PCA) is an elegant nonlinear generalisation of the popular linear data analysis method, where a kernel function implicitly defines a nonlinear transformation into a feature space wherein standard PCA is performed. Unfortunately, the technique is not 'sparse', since the components thus obtained are expressed in terms of kernels associated with every training vector. This paper shows that by approximating the covariance matrix in feature space by a reduced number of example vectors, using a maximum-likelihood approach, we may obtain a highly sparse form of kernel PCA without loss of effectiveness. 1</p><p>4 0.20618714 <a title="2-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Emergence_of_Movement_Sensitive_Neurons%27_Properties_by_Learning_a_Sparse_Code_for_Natural_Moving_Images.html">45 nips-2000-Emergence of Movement Sensitive Neurons' Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Moving Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>5 0.19192761 <a title="2-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Color_Opponency_Constitutes_a_Sparse_Representation_for_the_Chromatic_Structure_of_Natural_Scenes.html">32 nips-2000-Color Opponency Constitutes a Sparse Representation for the Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Penio S. Penev</p><p>Abstract: Low-dimensional representations are key to solving problems in highlevel vision, such as face compression and recognition. Factorial coding strategies for reducing the redundancy present in natural images on the basis of their second-order statistics have been successful in accounting for both psychophysical and neurophysiological properties of early vision. Class-specific representations are presumably formed later, at the higher-level stages of cortical processing. Here we show that when retinotopic factorial codes are derived for ensembles of natural objects, such as human faces, not only redundancy, but also dimensionality is reduced. We also show that objects are built from parts in a non-Gaussian fashion which allows these local-feature codes to have dimensionalities that are substantially lower than the respective Nyquist sampling rates.</p><p>6 0.5407865 <a title="2-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Sparse_Kernel_Principal_Component_Analysis.html">121 nips-2000-Sparse Kernel Principal Component Analysis</a></p>

In particular, we develop two general approaches for an important subproblem - identifying phrase structure. The first is a Markovian approach that extends standard HMMs to allow the use of a rich observation structure and of general classifiers to model state-observation dependencies. The second is an extension of constraint satisfaction formalisms. We develop efficient combination algorithms under both models and study them experimentally in the context of shallow parsing.</p><p>4 0.69334513 <a title="2-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Color_Opponency_Constitutes_a_Sparse_Representation_for_the_Chromatic_Structure_of_Natural_Scenes.html">32 nips-2000-Color Opponency Constitutes a Sparse Representation for the Chromatic Structure of Natural Scenes</a></p>

Furthermore, the resulting activations have very sparse distributions, suggesting that the use of color opponency in the human visual system achieves a highly efficient representation of colors. Our findings suggest that color opponency is a result of the properties of natural spectra and not solely a consequence of the overlapping cone spectral sensitivities. 1 Statistical structure of natural scenes Efficient encoding of visual sensory information is an important task for information processing systems and its study may provide insights into coding principles of biological visual systems.

<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>6 0.6273433 <a title="2-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Redundancy_and_Dimensionality_Reduction_in_Sparse-Distributed_Representations_of_Natural_Objects_in_Terms_of_Their_Local_Features.html">109 nips-2000-Redundancy and Dimensionality Reduction in Sparse-Distributed Representations of Natural Objects in Terms of Their Local Features</a></p>

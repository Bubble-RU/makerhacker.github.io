We examine the timescales of adaptation in the context of dynamically modulated rapidly-varying stimuli, and demonstrate in the fly visual system that adaptation to the statistical ensemble of the stimulus dynamically maximizes information transmission about the time-dependent stimulus.

<p>Author: Vladimir Pavlovic, James M. Rehg, John MacCormick</p><p>Abstract: The human figure exhibits complex and rich dynamic behavior that is both nonlinear and time-varying. Effective models of human dynamics can be learned from motion capture data using switching linear dynamic system (SLDS) models. We present results for human motion synthesis, classification, and visual tracking using learned SLDS models. Since exact inference in SLDS is intractable, we present three approximate inference algorithms and compare their performance. In particular, a new variational inference algorithm is obtained by casting the SLDS model as a Dynamic Bayesian Network. Classification experiments show the superiority of SLDS over conventional HMM's for our problem domain.</p><p>4 0.090676397 <a title="125-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Divisive_and_Subtractive_Mask_Effects%3A_Linking_Psychophysics_and_Biophysics.html">42 nips-2000-Divisive and Subtractive Mask Effects: Linking Psychophysics and Biophysics</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Zenger, Christof Koch</p><p>Abstract: We describe an analogy between psychophysically measured effects in contrast masking, and the behavior of a simple integrate-andfire neuron that receives time-modulated inhibition. In the psychophysical experiments, we tested observers ability to discriminate contrasts of peripheral Gabor patches in the presence of collinear Gabor flankers. The data reveal a complex interaction pattern that we account for by assuming that flankers provide divisive inhibition to the target unit for low target contrasts, but provide subtractive inhibition to the target unit for higher target contrasts. A similar switch from divisive to subtractive inhibition is observed in an integrate-and-fire unit that receives inhibition modulated in time such that the cell spends part of the time in a high-inhibition state and part of the time in a low-inhibition state. The similarity between the effects suggests that one may cause the other. The biophysical model makes testable predictions for physiological single-cell recordings. 1 Psychophysics Visual images of Gabor patches are thought to excite a small and specific subset of neurons in the primary visual cortex and beyond. By measuring psychophysically in humans the contrast detection and discrimination thresholds of peripheral Gabor patches, one can estimate the sensitivity of this subset of neurons. Furthermore, spatial interactions between different neuronal populations can be probed by testing the effects of additional Gabor patches (masks) on performance. Such experiments have revealed a highly configuration-specific pattern of excitatory and inhibitory spatial interactions [1, 2]. 1.1 Methods Two vertical Gabor patches with a spatial frequency of 4cyc/deg were presented at 4 deg eccentricity left and right of fixation, and observers had to report which patch had the higher contrast (spatial 2AFC).

<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, AndrèŒ… Elisseeff</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel way of obtaining PAC-style bounds on the generalization error of learning algorithms, explicitly using their stability properties. A stable learner is one for which the learned solution does not change much with small changes in the training set. The bounds we obtain do not depend on any measure of the complexity of the hypothesis space (e.g. VC dimension) but rather depend on how the learning algorithm searches this space, and can thus be applied even when the VC dimension is infinite. We demonstrate that regularization networks possess the required stability property and apply our method to obtain new bounds on their generalization performance. 1</p><p>6 0.070813075 <a title="125-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Machine_Learning_for_Video-Based_Rendering.html">83 nips-2000-Machine Learning for Video-Based Rendering</a></p>

<p>Author: Arno SchÃ¶dl, Irfan A. Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present techniques for rendering and animation of realistic scenes by analyzing and training on short video sequences. This work extends the new paradigm for computer animation, video textures, which uses recorded video to generate novel animations by replaying the video samples in a new order. Here we concentrate on video sprites, which are a special type of video texture. In video sprites, instead of storing whole images, the object of interest is separated from the background and the video samples are stored as a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated velocity information. They can be rendered anywhere on the screen to create a novel animation of the object. We present methods to create such animations by finding a sequence of sprite samples that is both visually smooth and follows a desired path. To estimate visual smoothness, we train a linear classifier to estimate visual similarity between video samples. If the motion path is known in advance, we use beam search to find a good sample sequence. We can specify the motion interactively by precomputing the sequence cost function using Q-Iearning.</p><p>6 0.25420502 <a title="125-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Algorithmic_Stability_and_Generalization_Performance.html">21 nips-2000-Algorithmic Stability and Generalization Performance</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Blaise AgÃ¼era y Arcas, Adrienne L.

We implement this description for the HodgkinHuxley model, identify the most relevant dimensions and find the nonlinearity. A two dimensional description already captures a significant fraction of the information that spikes carry about dynamic inputs. This description also shows that computation in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is more complex than a simple integrateand-fire or perceptron model. 1</p><p>4 0.32198742 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Occam%27s_Razor.html">92 nips-2000-Occam's Razor</a></p>

We give simple examples of both kinds of behaviour. The two views are reconciled when measuring complexity of functions, rather than of the machinery used to implement them. We analyze the complexity of functions for some linear in the parameter models that are equivalent to Gaussian Processes, and always find Occam's Razor at work.</p><p>5 0.3217743 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Variational_Mean-Field_Theory_for_Sigmoidal_Belief_Networks.html">14 nips-2000-A Variational Mean-Field Theory for Sigmoidal Belief Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Chiranjib Bhattacharyya, S. Sathiya Keerthi</p><p>Abstract: A variational derivation of Plefka's mean-field theory is presented. This theory is then applied to sigmoidal belief networks with the aid of further approximations. Empirical evaluation on small scale networks show that the proposed approximations are quite competitive. 1</p><p>6 0.32129097 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Interactive_Parts_Model%3A_An_Application_to_Recognition_of_On-line_Cursive_Script.html">71 nips-2000-Interactive Parts Model: An Application to Recognition of On-line Cursive Script</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>4 0.12386472 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-The_Kernel_Gibbs_Sampler.html">133 nips-2000-The Kernel Gibbs Sampler</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that samples the hypothesis space of kernel classifiers. Given a uniform prior over normalised weight vectors and a likelihood based on a model of label noise leads to a piecewise constant posterior that can be sampled by the kernel Gibbs sampler (KGS). The KGS is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that chooses a random direction in parameter space and samples from the resulting piecewise constant density along the line chosen. The KGS can be used as an analytical tool for the exploration of Bayesian transduction, Bayes point machines, active learning, and evidence-based model selection on small data sets that are contaminated with label noise. For a simple toy example we demonstrate experimentally how a Bayes point machine based on the KGS outperforms an SVM that is incapable of taking into account label noise. 1</p><p>5 0.11950403 <a title="53-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Shape_Context%3A_A_New_Descriptor_for_Shape_Matching_and_Object_Recognition.html">117 nips-2000-Shape Context: A New Descriptor for Shape Matching and Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Serge Belongie, Jitendra Malik, Jan Puzicha</p><p>Abstract: We develop an approach to object recognition based on matching shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques. 1</p><p>6 0.1101289 <a title="53-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Large_Scale_Bayes_Point_Machines.html">75 nips-2000-Large Scale Bayes Point Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Modern classification applications necessitate supplementing the few available labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classification performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploiting unlabeled examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved essentially by expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via both labeled and unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method can be interpreted as a discriminative kernel density estimate and is readily trained via the EM algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative and achieves the optimal solution. We provide, in addition, a purely discriminative formulation of the estimation problem by appealing to the maximum entropy framework. We demonstrate that the proposed approach requires very few labeled examples for high classification accuracy.</p><p>3 0.57723612 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Support_Vector_Novelty_Detection_Applied_to_Jet_Engine_Vibration_Spectra.html">128 nips-2000-Support Vector Novelty Detection Applied to Jet Engine Vibration Spectra</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas P. Minka</p><p>Abstract: A central issue in principal component analysis (PCA) is choosing the number of principal components to be retained. By interpreting PCA as density estimation, we show how to use Bayesian model selection to estimate the true dimensionality of the data. The resulting estimate is simple to compute yet guaranteed to pick the correct dimensionality, given enough data. The estimate involves an integral over the Steifel manifold of k-frames, which is difficult to compute exactly. But after choosing an appropriate parameterization and applying Laplace's method, an accurate and practical estimator is obtained. In simulations, it is convincingly better than cross-validation and other proposed algorithms, plus it runs much faster.</p><p>6 0.57385802 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Function_Approximation_Converges_to_a_Region.html">112 nips-2000-Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation Converges to a Region</a></p>

</p><p>2 Most existing approaches assume that features can be tracked across frames, whereas methods that exploit rigidity constraints to facilitate matching do so only under restricted camera motion. [sent-5, score-0.343]
</p><p>3 In this paper we propose a Bayesian approach that avoids the brittleness associated with singling out one "best" correspondence, and instead consider the distribution over all possible correspondences. [sent-6, score-0.147]
</p><p>4 We treat both a fully Bayesian approach that yields a posterior distribution, and a MAP approach that makes use of EM to maximize this posterior. [sent-7, score-0.251]
</p><p>5 We show how Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be used to implement these techniques in practice, and present experimental results on real data. [sent-8, score-0.084]
</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Structure from motion (SFM) addresses the problem of simultaneously recovering camera pose and a three-dimensional model from a collection of images. [sent-9, score-0.306]
</p><p>7 This problem has received considerable attention in the computer vision community [1 , 2, 3]. [sent-10, score-0.169]
</p><p>8 Methods that can robustly reconstruct the 3D structure of environments have a potentially large impact in many areas of societal importance, such as architecture, entertainment, space exploration and mobile robotics. [sent-11, score-0.157]
</p><p>9 , the question of determining correspondence between features observed in different images. [sent-14, score-0.406]
</p><p>10 This problem has been referred to as the most difficult part of structure recovery [4], and is particularly challenging if the images have been taken from widely separated viewpoints. [sent-15, score-0.212]
</p><p>11 Virtually all existing approaches assume that either the correspondence is known a priori, or that features can be tracked from frame to frame [1 , 2]. [sent-16, score-0.616]
</p><p>12 Methods based on the robust recovery of epipolar geometry [3 , 4] can cope with larger inter-frame displacements, but still depend on the ability to identify a set of initial correspondences to seed the robust matching process. [sent-17, score-0.185]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we are interested in cases where individual camera images are recorded from vastly different viewpoints, which renders existing SFM approaches inapplicable. [sent-18, score-0.295]
</p><p>14 Traditional approaches for  establishing correspondence between sets of 2D features [5 , 6, 7] are of limited use in this domain, as the projected 3D structure can look very different in each image. [sent-19, score-0.538]
</p><p>15 This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to data association. [sent-20, score-0.046]
</p><p>16 Instead of considering a single correspondence only (which we conjecture to be brittle), our approach considers whole distributions over correspondences. [sent-21, score-0.437]
</p><p>17 As a result, our approach is more robust, and from a Bayesian perspective it is also sound. [sent-22, score-0.046]
</p><p>18 Unfortunately, no closed-form solution exists for calculating these distributions conditioned on the camera images. [sent-23, score-0.179]
</p><p>19 Therefore, we propose to use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, a popular Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, to sample from the posterior. [sent-24, score-0.209]
</p><p>20 The first method, discussed in Section 2, is mathematically more powerful but computationally expensive. [sent-26, score-0.046]
</p><p>21 It uses MCMC to sample from the joint distribution over both correspondences and threedimensional scene structure. [sent-27, score-0.274]
</p><p>22 While this approach is mathematically elegant from a Bayesian point of view, we have so far only been able to obtain results for simple, artificial domains. [sent-28, score-0.092]
</p><p>23 Thus, to cope with large-scale data sets, we propose in Section 3 a maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach using the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to maximize the posterior. [sent-29, score-0.232]
</p><p>24 Here we use MCMC sampling only for the data association problem. [sent-30, score-0.24]
</p><p>25 Simulated annealing is used to reduce the danger of getting stuck in local minima. [sent-31, score-0.298]
</p><p>26 Experimental results obtained in realistic domains and presented in Section 4 suggest that this approach works well in the general SFM case, and that it scales favorably to complex computer vision problems. [sent-32, score-0.211]
</p><p>27 The idea of using MCMC for data association has been used before by [8] in the context of a traffic surveillance application. [sent-33, score-0.124]
</p><p>28 However, their approach is not directly applicable to SFM, as the computer vision domain is characterized by a large number of local minima. [sent-34, score-0.22]
</p><p>29 Our paper goes beyond theirs in two important aspects: First, we develop a framework for MCMC sampling over both the data association and the model, and second, we apply annealing to smooth the posterior so as to reduce the chance to get stuck in local minima. [sent-35, score-0.624]
</p><p>30 2  A Fully Bayesian Approach using MCMC  Below we derive the general approach for MCMC sampling from the joint posterior over data association and models. [sent-37, score-0.478]
</p><p>31 We only show results for a simple example from pose estimation, as this approach is computationally very demanding. [sent-38, score-0.123]
</p><p>32 An EM approach based on the general principles described here, but applicable to largerscale problems, will be described in the next section. [sent-39, score-0.088]
</p><p>33 1  Structure from Motion  The structure from motion problem is this: given a set of images of a scene, taken from different viewpoints, recover the 3D structure of the scene along with the camera parameters. [sent-41, score-0.6]
</p><p>34 In the feature-based approach to SFM, we consider the situation in which a set of N 3D features Xj is viewed by a set of m cameras with parameters mi. [sent-42, score-0.161]
</p><p>35 As input data we are given the set of 2D measurements Uik in the images, where k E {l. [sent-43, score-0.149]
</p><p>36 Ki} and Ki is the number of measurements in the i-th image. [sent-45, score-0.149]
</p><p>37 To model correspondence information, we introduce for each measurement Uik the indicator variable j ik, indicating that Uik is a measurement of the jik-th feature Xj,k. [sent-46, score-0.597]
</p><p>38 The choice of feature type and camera model determines the measurement function h(mi,Xj), predicting the measurement Uik given mi and Xj (with j =jik): Uik  = h(mi, Xj) + n  where n is the measurement noise. [sent-47, score-0.547]
</p><p>39 Without loss of generality, let us consider the case in which the features Xj are 3D points and the measurements Uik are points in the 2D image. [sent-48, score-0.29]
</p><p>40 In this case the measurement function can be written as a 3D rigid displacement followed by a projection:  (1) where Ri and ti are the rotation matrix and translation of the i-th camera, respectively, and   : ~ 3 -+ ~ 2 is the camera projection model. [sent-49, score-0.387]
</p><p>41 2  Deriving the Posterior  Whereas previous methods single out a single "best" correspondence across images, in a Bayesian framework we are interested in characterizing our knowledge about the unknowns conditioned on the data only, averaging over all possible correspondences. [sent-51, score-0.429]
</p><p>42 Thus, we are interested in the posterior distribution P(OIU), where 0 collects the unknown model parameters mi and Xj. [sent-52, score-0.3]
</p><p>43 In the case of unknown correspondence, we need to sum over all possible assignments J = {jik} to obtain  P(O IU)  = L:P(J,O IU) ex P(O) L:P(UIJ,O)P(JIO) J  (2)  J  where we have applied Bayes law and the chain rule. [sent-53, score-0.299]
</p><p>44 Let us assume for now that there are no occlusions or spurious measurements, so that Ki = Nand J is a set of m permutations J i of the indices l. [sent-54, score-0.046]
</p><p>45 normally distributed noise on the measurements, each term in (2) can be calculated using  (3) if each J i is a permutation, and a otherwise. [sent-60, score-0.082]
</p><p>46 3  Sampling from the Posterior using MCMC  Unfortunately, direct computation of the total posterior distribution P(OIU) in (2) is intractable in general, because the number of correspondence assignments J is combinatorial in the number of features and images. [sent-66, score-0.761]
</p><p>47 As a solution to this computational challenge we propose to instead sample from P(O IU). [sent-67, score-0.125]
</p><p>48 Sampling directly from P(O IU) is equally difficult , but if we can obtain a sample {(o(r) , J(r))} from the joint distribution P (0, J IU), we can simply discard the correspondence part J(r) to obtain a sample {o(r)} from the marginal distribution P(OIU). [sent-68, score-0.676]
</p><p>49 To sample from the joint distribution P(O, JIU) we propose to use MCMC sampling, in particular the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm [10]. [sent-69, score-0.232]
</p><p>50 This method involves simulating a Markov chain whose equilibrium distribution is the desired posterior distribution P(O,JIU). [sent-70, score-0.292]

</p><p>53 The true rotation is 70 degrees, noise is zero-mean Gaussian. [sent-81, score-0.145]
</p><p>54 The sequence of tuples (e(r), J(r)) thus generated will be a sample from p(e, J IV), if the sampler is run sufficiently long. [sent-82, score-0.264]
</p><p>55 To calculate the acceptance ratio a, we assume that the noise on the feature measurements is normally distributed and isotropic. [sent-83, score-0.267]

</p><p>59 This rotated shape is shown at right in the figure, along with 6 noisy measurements Uk on the feature points. [sent-93, score-0.252]
</p><p>60 In Figure 2 at left we show the posterior distribution over the rotation parameter, given the measurements from Figure 1 and with known correspondence. [sent-94, score-0.427]

</p><p>66 This provides a way to jump between probability modes. [sent-102, score-0.049]
</p><p>67 Note that Q(X(r); X') /Q(X/; X(r)) = 1 for this proposal density. [sent-103, score-0.068]
</p><p>68 The result of the sampling procedure is shown as a histogram of the rotation parameter in Figure 3. [sent-104, score-0.306]

</p><p>73 3  Maximum a Posteriori Estimation using MCEM  As illustrated above, sampling from the joint probability over assignments J and parameters 0 using MCMC can be very expensive. [sent-113, score-0.319]
</p><p>74 However, if only a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate is needed, sampling over the joint space can be avoided by means of the EM algorithm. [sent-114, score-0.269]
</p><p>75 This is intractable in general because of the combinatorial number of terms. [sent-116, score-0.051]
</p><p>76 The EM algorithm provides a tractable alternative to maximizing P (0 IU), using the correspondence J as a hidden variable [ll). [sent-117, score-0.345]
</p><p>77 Although the images were originally taken as a sequence in time, the ordering of the images is irrelevant to our method. [sent-123, score-0.178]

</p><p>80 The sampling proceeds as in the previous section, using the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, but now with a fixed parameter f) f)t. [sent-132, score-0.149]
</p><p>81 Note that at each iteration the estimate f)t changes and we sample from a different posterior distribution P(JIU, f)t). [sent-133, score-0.266]
</p><p>82 =  In practice it is important to add annealing to this basic EM scheme, to avoid getting stuck in local minima. [sent-134, score-0.298]
</p><p>83 In simulated annealing we artificially increase the noise parameter (T for the early iterations, gradually decreasing it to its correct value. [sent-135, score-0.285]
</p><p>84 First, the posterior distribution P(JIU, f)t) is less peaked when (T is high, allowing the MCMC sampler to explore the space of assignments J more easily. [sent-137, score-0.44]
</p><p>85 The input data in this experiment consisted of 55 manually selected measurements in each of 11 input images, three of which are shown in Figure 4. [sent-140, score-0.149]
</p><p>86 Note that features are not tracked from frame to frame and the images can be presented in arbitrary order. [sent-141, score-0.321]
</p><p>87 To initialize the 11 cameras mi are all placed at the origin, looking towards the 55 model points Xj, who themselves are normally distributed at unit distance from the cameras. [sent-142, score-0.198]
</p><p>88 The EM algorithm was run for 100 iterations, and the sampler for 10000 steps per image. [sent-144, score-0.199]
</p><p>89 The algorithm converges consistently and fast to an estimate for the structure and motion where the correct correspondence is the most probable one, and where all  assignments in the different images agree with each other. [sent-146, score-0.786]
</p><p>90 A typical run of the algorithm is shown in Figure 5, where we have shown a wireframe model of the recovered structure at several points during the run. [sent-147, score-0.186]
</p><p>91 There are two important points to note: (a) the gross structure is recovered in the very first iteration, starting from random initial structure, and (b) finer details of the structure are gradually resolved as the annealing parameter (T is decreased. [sent-148, score-0.628]
</p><p>92 The estimate for the structure after convergence is almost identical to the one found by the factorization method [1] when this is provided with the correct correspondence. [sent-149, score-0.151]
</p><p>93 5  Conclusions and Future Directions  In this paper we presented a theoretically sound method to deal with ambiguous feature correspondence, and have shown how Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling can be used to obtain practical algorithms. [sent-150, score-0.236]
</p><p>94 We have detailed this for two cases: (1) obtaining a posterior distribution over the parameters fJ, and (2) obtaining a MAP estimate by means of EM. [sent-151, score-0.275]
</p><p>95 In future work, we would like to apply these methods in other domains where data association plays a central role. [sent-152, score-0.157]
</p><p>96 In particular, in the highly active area of mobile robot mapping, the data association problem is currently a major obstacle to building large-scale maps [12, 13]. [sent-153, score-0.235]
</p><p>97 We conjecture that our approach is equally applicable to the robotic mapping problem, and can lead to qualitatively new solutions in that domain. [sent-154, score-0.187]

<p>Author: Serge Belongie, Jitendra Malik, Jan Puzicha</p><p>Abstract: We develop an approach to object recognition based on matching shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.11065458 <a title="53-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-The_Kernel_Gibbs_Sampler.html">133 nips-2000-The Kernel Gibbs Sampler</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that samples the hypothesis space of kernel classifiers. Given a uniform prior over normalised weight vectors and a likelihood based on a model of label noise leads to a piecewise constant posterior that can be sampled by the kernel Gibbs sampler (KGS). The KGS is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that chooses a random direction in parameter space and samples from the resulting piecewise constant density along the line chosen. The KGS can be used as an analytical tool for the exploration of Bayesian transduction, Bayes point machines, active learning, and evidence-based model selection on small data sets that are contaminated with label noise.

<p>Author: Serge Belongie, Jitendra Malik, Jan Puzicha</p><p>Abstract: We develop an approach to object recognition based on matching shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques. 1</p><p>3 0.52530015 <a title="53-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-The_Manhattan_World_Assumption%3A_Regularities_in_Scene_Statistics_which_Enable_Bayesian_Inference.html">135 nips-2000-The Manhattan World Assumption: Regularities in Scene Statistics which Enable Bayesian Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm that samples the hypothesis space of kernel classifiers. Given a uniform prior over normalised weight vectors and a likelihood based on a model of label noise leads to a piecewise constant posterior that can be sampled by the kernel Gibbs sampler (KGS). The KGS is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method that chooses a random direction in parameter space and samples from the resulting piecewise constant density along the line chosen. The KGS can be used as an analytical tool for the exploration of Bayesian transduction, Bayes point machines, active learning, and evidence-based model selection on small data sets that are contaminated with label noise. For a simple toy example we demonstrate experimentally how a Bayes point machine based on the KGS outperforms an SVM that is incapable of taking into account label noise. 1</p><p>6 0.39742544 <a title="53-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Keeping_Flexible_Active_Contours_on_Track_using_Metropolis_Updates.html">72 nips-2000-Keeping Flexible Active Contours on Track using Metropolis Updates</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>3 0.42052901 <a title="53-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Gaussianization.html">60 nips-2000-Gaussianization</a></p>

We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foundation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1</p><p>5 0.39664268 <a title="53-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>6 0.39576018 <a title="53-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-The_Kernel_Gibbs_Sampler.html">133 nips-2000-The Kernel Gibbs Sampler</a></p>

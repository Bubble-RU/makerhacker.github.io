<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>3 0.14422975 <a title="94-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Beyond_Maximum_Likelihood_and_Density_Estimation%3A_A_Sample-Based_Criterion_for_Unsupervised_Learning_of_Complex_Models.html">31 nips-2000-Beyond Maximum Likelihood and Density Estimation: A Sample-Based Criterion for Unsupervised Learning of Complex Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael Mozer</p><p>Abstract: The goal of many unsupervised learning procedures is to bring two probability distributions into alignment. Generative models such as Gaussian mixtures and Boltzmann machines can be cast in this light, as can recoding models such as ICA and projection pursuit. We propose a novel sample-based error measure for these classes of models, which applies even in situations where maximum likelihood (ML) and probability density estimation-based formulations cannot be applied, e.g., models that are nonlinear or have intractable posteriors. Furthermore, our sample-based error measure avoids the difficulties of approximating a density function. We prove that with an unconstrained model, (1) our approach converges on the correct solution as the number of samples goes to infinity, and (2) the expected solution of our approach in the generative framework is the ML solution. Finally, we evaluate our approach via simulations of linear and nonlinear models on mixture of Gaussians and ICA problems. The experiments show the broad applicability and generality of our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.13799928 <a title="94-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-A_Tighter_Bound_for_Graphical_Models.html">13 nips-2000-A Tighter Bound for Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Martijn A. R. Leisink, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to bound the partition function of a Boltzmann machine neural network with any odd order polynomial. This is a direct extension of the mean field bound, which is first order. We show that the third order bound is strictly better than mean field. Additionally we show the rough outline how this bound is applicable to sigmoid belief networks. Numerical experiments indicate that an error reduction of a factor two is easily reached in the region where expansion based approximations are useful. 1</p><p>5 0.12886928 <a title="94-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Kernel_Expansions_with_Unlabeled_Examples.html">74 nips-2000-Kernel Expansions with Unlabeled Examples</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Szummer, Tommi Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: Modern classification applications necessitate supplementing the few available labeled examples with unlabeled examples to improve classification performance. We present a new tractable algorithm for exploiting unlabeled examples in discriminative classification. This is achieved essentially by expanding the input vectors into longer feature vectors via both labeled and unlabeled examples. The resulting classification method can be interpreted as a discriminative kernel density estimate and is readily trained via the EM algorithm, which in this case is both discriminative and achieves the optimal solution. We provide, in addition, a purely discriminative formulation of the estimation problem by appealing to the maximum entropy framework. We demonstrate that the proposed approach requires very few labeled examples for high classification accuracy.</p><p>6 0.11903211 <a title="94-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Position_Variance%2C_Recurrence_and_Perceptual_Learning.html">102 nips-2000-Position Variance, Recurrence and Perceptual Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Sumio Watanabe</p><p>Abstract: Algebraic geometry is essential to learning theory. In hierarchical learning machines such as layered neural networks and gaussian mixtures, the asymptotic normality does not hold , since Fisher information matrices are singular. In this paper , the rigorous asymptotic form of the stochastic complexity is clarified based on resolution of singularities and two different problems are studied. (1) If the prior is positive, then the stochastic complexity is far smaller than BIO, resulting in the smaller generalization error than regular statistical models, even when the true distribution is not contained in the parametric model. (2) If Jeffreys' prior, which is coordinate free and equal to zero at singularities, is employed then the stochastic complexity has the same form as BIO. It is useful for model selection, but not for generalization. 1</p><p>3 0.47432724 <a title="94-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Vladimir Koltchinskii, Dmitriy Panchenko, Fernando Lozano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop the method of bounding the generalization error of a classifier in terms of its margin distribution which was introduced in the recent papers of Bartlett and Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. The theory of Gaussian and empirical processes allow us to prove the margin type inequalities for the most general functional classes, the complexity of the class being measured via the so called Gaussian complexity functions. As a simple application of our results, we obtain the bounds of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee for the generalization error of boosting. We also substantially improve the results of Bartlett on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of h -norms of the weights of neurons. Furthermore, under additional assumptions on the complexity of the class of hypotheses we provide some tighter bounds, which in the case of boosting improve the results of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. 1 Introduction and margin type inequalities for general functional classes Let (X, Y) be a random couple, where X is an instance in a space Sand Y E {-I, I} is a label. Let 9 be a set of functions from S into JR. For 9 E g, sign(g(X)) will be used as a predictor (a classifier) of the unknown label Y. If the distribution of (X, Y) is unknown, then the choice of the predictor is based on the training data (Xl, Y l ), ... , (Xn, Y n ) that consists ofn i.i.d. copies of (X, Y). The goal ofleaming is to find a predictor 9 E 9 (based on the training data) whose generalization (classification) error JP'{Yg(X) :::; O} is small enough. We will first introduce some probabilistic bounds for general functional classes and then give several examples of their applications to bounding the generalization error of boosting and neural networks. We omit all the proofs and refer an interested reader to [5]. Let (8, A, P) be a probability space and let F be a class of measurable functions from (8, A) into lR. Let {Xd be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables taking values in (8, A) with common distribution P.

The problem of multiuser demodulation is cast into the finite-temperature decoding problem, and replica analysis is applied to evaluate the performance of the resulting MPM (Marginal Posterior Mode) demodulators, which include the optimal demodulator and the MAP demodulator as special cases. An approximate implementation of demodulators is proposed using analog-valued Hopfield model as a naive mean-field approximation to the MPM demodulators, and its performance is also evaluated by the replica analysis. Results of the performance evaluation shows effectiveness of the optimal demodulator and the mean-field demodulator compared with the conventional one, especially in the cases of small information bit rate and low noise level. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7361719 <a title="94-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-On_Reversing_Jensen%27s_Inequality.html">94 nips-2000-On Reversing Jensen's Inequality</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Erik B. Sudderth, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.42751878 <a title="94-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Speech_Denoising_and_Dereverberation_Using_Probabilistic_Models.html">123 nips-2000-Speech Denoising and Dereverberation Using Probabilistic Models</a></p>

The key idea is to use a strong speech model that is pre-trained on a large data set of clean speech. Computational efficiency is achieved by using variational EM, working in the frequency domain, and employing conjugate priors. The framework covers both single and multiple microphones. We apply this approach to noisy reverberant speech signals and get results substantially better than standard methods.</p><p>5 0.42633307 <a title="94-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Function_Approximation_Converges_to_a_Region.html">112 nips-2000-Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation Converges to a Region</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms for approximate reinforcement learning are not known to converge. In fact, there are counterexamples showing that the adjustable weights in some algorithms may oscillate within a region rather than converging to a point. This paper shows that, for two popular algorithms, such oscillation is the worst that can happen: the weights cannot diverge, but instead must converge to a bounded region. The algorithms are SARSA(O) and V(O); the latter algorithm was used in the well-known TD-Gammon program. 1</p><p>6 0.42631465 <a title="94-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-A_New_Approximate_Maximal_Margin_Classification_Algorithm.html">7 nips-2000-A New Approximate Maximal Margin Classification Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhaoping Li, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Stimulus arrays are inevitably presented at different positions on the retina in visual tasks, even those that nominally require fixation. In particular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that perceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely linear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent connections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination performance of a recurrent network. We propose that learning the feedforward and recurrent neural connections for these tasks corresponds to the fast and slow components of learning observed in perceptual learning tasks.</p><p>3 0.15749402 <a title="24-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Temporally_Dependent_Plasticity%3A_An_Information_Theoretic_Account.html">129 nips-2000-Temporally Dependent Plasticity: An Information Theoretic Account</a></p>

<p>Author: Ranit Aharonov-Barki, Isaac Meilijson, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm, termed PPA (Performance Prediction Algorithm), that quantitatively measures the contributions of elements of a neural system to the tasks it performs. The algorithm identifies the neurons or areas which participate in a cognitive or behavioral task, given data about performance decrease in a small set of lesions. It also allows the accurate prediction of performances due to multi-element lesions. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated in two models of recurrent neural networks with complex interactions among the elements. The algorithm is scalable and applicable to the analysis of large neural networks. Given the recent advances in reversible inactivation techniques, it has the potential to significantly contribute to the understanding of the organization of biological nervous systems, and to shed light on the long-lasting debate about local versus distributed computation in the brain.</p><p>4 0.45275784 <a title="24-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Temporally_Dependent_Plasticity%3A_An_Information_Theoretic_Account.html">129 nips-2000-Temporally Dependent Plasticity: An Information Theoretic Account</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Sallans, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task. The product of experts model is found to perform comparably to table-based Q-Iearning for small instances of the task, and continues to perform well when the problem becomes too large for a table-based representation.</p><p>3 0.60481465 <a title="24-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Segmentation_by_Random_Walks.html">79 nips-2000-Learning Segmentation by Random Walks</a></p>

We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix.

In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1</p><p>4 0.53081173 <a title="24-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Temporally_Dependent_Plasticity%3A_An_Information_Theoretic_Account.html">129 nips-2000-Temporally Dependent Plasticity: An Information Theoretic Account</a></p>

<p>Author: Guy Mayraz, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The product of experts learning procedure [1] can discover a set of stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of handwritten images of digits. The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - l)th level model. After training, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logistic classification network that is trained on separate data. On the MNIST database, our system is comparable with current state-of-the-art discriminative methods, demonstrating that the product of experts learning procedure can produce effective generative models of high-dimensional data. 1 Learning products of stochastic binary experts Hinton [1] describes a learning algorithm for probabilistic generative models that are composed of a number of experts. Each expert specifies a probability distribution over the visible variables and the experts are combined by multiplying these distributions together and renormalizing. (1) where d is a data vector in a discrete space, Om is all the parameters of individual model m, Pm(dIOm) is the probability of d under model m, and c is an index over all possible vectors in the data space. A Restricted Boltzmann machine [2, 3] is a special case of a product of experts in which each expert is a single, binary stochastic hidden unit that has symmetrical connections to a set of visible units, and connections between the hidden units are forbidden. Inference in an RBM is much easier than in a general Boltzmann machine and it is also much easier than in a causal belief net because there is no explaining away. There is therefore no need to perform any iteration to determine the activities of the hidden units. The hidden states, Sj , are conditionally independent given the visible states, Si, and the distribution of Sj is given by the standard logistic function : 1 p(Sj = 1) = (2) 1 + exp( - Li WijSi) Conversely, the hidden states of an RBM are marginally dependent so it is easy for an RBM to learn population codes in which units may be highly correlated. It is hard to do this in causal belief nets with one hidden layer because the generative model of a causal belief net assumes marginal independence. An RBM can be trained using the standard Boltzmann machine learning algorithm which follows a noisy but unbiased estimate of the gradient of the log likelihood of the data. One way to implement this algorithm is to start the network with a data vector on the visible units and then to alternate between updating all of the hidden units in parallel and updating all of the visible units in parallel. Each update picks a binary state for a unit from its posterior distribution given the current states of all the units in the other set. If this alternating Gibbs sampling is run to equilibrium, there is a very simple way to update the weights so as to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence, QOIIQoo, between the data distribution, QO, and the equilibrium distribution of fantasies over the visible units, Qoo, produced by the RBM [4]: flWij oc QO - Q~ (3) where < SiSj >Qo is the expected value of SiSj when data is clamped on the visible units and the hidden states are sampled from their conditional distribution given the data, and Q ~ is the expected value of SiSj after prolonged Gibbs sampling. This learning rule does not work well because it can take a long time to approach thermal equilibrium and the sampling noise in the estimate of  Q ~ can swamp the gradient. [1] shows that it is far more effective to minimize the difference between QOllQoo and Q111Qoo where Q1 is the distribution of the one-step reconstructions of the data that are produced by first picking binary hidden states from their conditional distribution given the data and then picking binary visible states from their conditional distribution given the hidden states.

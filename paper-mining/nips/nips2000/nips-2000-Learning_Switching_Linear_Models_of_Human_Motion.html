<p>Author: William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: Many processes in biology, from the regulation of gene expression in bacteria to memory in the brain, involve switches constructed from networks of biochemical reactions. Crucial molecules are present in small numbers, raising questions about noise and stability. Analysis of noise in simple reaction schemes indicates that switches stable for years and switchable in milliseconds can be built from fewer than one hundred molecules. Prospects for direct tests of this prediction, as well as implications, are discussed. 1</p><p>3 0.15095016 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Multiple_Timescales_of_Adaptation_in_a_Neural_Code.html">88 nips-2000-Multiple Timescales of Adaptation in a Neural Code</a></p>
<p>Author: Adrienne L. Fairhall, Geoffrey D. Lewen, William Bialek, Robert R. de Ruyter van Steveninck</p><p>Abstract: Many neural systems extend their dynamic range by adaptation. We examine the timescales of adaptation in the context of dynamically modulated rapidly-varying stimuli, and demonstrate in the fly visual system that adaptation to the statistical ensemble of the stimulus dynamically maximizes information transmission about the time-dependent stimulus. Further, while the rate response has long transients, the adaptation takes place on timescales consistent with optimal variance estimation.</p><p>4 0.11229796 <a title="80-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Learning_and_Tracking_Cyclic_Human_Motion.html">82 nips-2000-Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human Motion</a></p>

<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>6 0.085178837 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-New_Approaches_Towards_Robust_and_Adaptive_Speech_Recognition.html">90 nips-2000-New Approaches Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Arno Schödl, Irfan A. Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present techniques for rendering and animation of realistic scenes by analyzing and training on short video sequences. This work extends the new paradigm for computer animation, video textures, which uses recorded video to generate novel animations by replaying the video samples in a new order. Here we concentrate on video sprites, which are a special type of video texture. In video sprites, instead of storing whole images, the object of interest is separated from the background and the video samples are stored as a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated velocity information. They can be rendered anywhere on the screen to create a novel animation of the object. We present methods to create such animations by finding a sequence of sprite samples that is both visually smooth and follows a desired path. To estimate visual smoothness, we train a linear classifier to estimate visual similarity between video samples. If the motion path is known in advance, we use beam search to find a good sample sequence. We can specify the motion interactively by precomputing the sequence cost function using Q-Iearning.</p><p>6 0.27980542 <a title="80-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-New_Approaches_Towards_Robust_and_Adaptive_Speech_Recognition.html">90 nips-2000-New Approaches Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew G. Barto</p><p>Abstract: Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accomplish the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hierarchical structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction, and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be automated. We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illustrate the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.73896861 <a title="80-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Switching_Linear_Models_of_Human_Motion.html">80 nips-2000-Learning Switching Linear Models of Human Motion</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>6 0.52015007 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Incorporating_Second-Order_Functional_Knowledge_for_Better_Option_Pricing.html">69 nips-2000-Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing</a></p>

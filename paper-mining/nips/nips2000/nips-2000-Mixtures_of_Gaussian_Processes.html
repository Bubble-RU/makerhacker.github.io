</p><p>2 The MGP is derived from the mixture of experts model and can also be used for modeling general conditional probability densities. [sent-5, score-0.158]
</p><p>3 We discuss how Gaussian processes -in particular in form of Gaussian process classification, the support vector machine and the MGP modelcan be used for quantifying the dependencies in graphical models. [sent-6, score-0.603]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Gaussian processes are typically used for regression where it is assumed that the underlying function is generated by one infinite-dimensional Gaussian distribution (i. [sent-7, score-0.301]
</p><p>5 In Gaussian process regression (GPR) we further assume that output data are generated by additive Gaussian noise, i. [sent-10, score-0.121]
</p><p>6 GPR can be generalized by using likelihood models from the exponential family of distributions which is useful for classification and the prediction of lifetimes or counts. [sent-13, score-0.241]
</p><p>7 The support vector machine (SVM) is a variant in which the likelihood model is not derived from the exponential family of distributions but rather uses functions with a discontinuous first derivative. [sent-14, score-0.24]
</p><p>8 In this paper we introduce another generalization of GPR in form of the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model which is a variant of the well known mixture of experts (ME) model of Jacobs et al. [sent-15, score-0.54]
</p><p>9 The MGP model allows Gaussian processes to model general conditional probability densities. [sent-17, score-0.326]
</p><p>10 An advantage of the MGP model is that it is fast to train, if compared to the neural network ME model. [sent-18, score-0.067]
</p><p>11 Even more interesting, the MGP model is one possible approach of addressing the problem of input-dependent bandwidth requirements in GPR. [sent-19, score-0.229]
</p><p>12 Input-dependent bandwidth is useful if either the complexity of the map is input dependent -requiring a higher bandwidth in regions of high complexity- or if the input data distribution is input dependent. [sent-20, score-0.62]
</p><p>13 In the latter case, one would prefer Gaussian processes with a higher bandwidth in regions with many data points and a lower bandwidth in regions with lower data density. [sent-21, score-0.746]
</p><p>14 If GPR models with different bandwidths are used, the MGP approach allows the system to self-organize by locally selecting the GPR model with the appropriate optimal bandwidth. [sent-22, score-0.082]
</p><p>15 Gaussian process classifiers, the support vector machine and the MGP can be used to model the local dependencies in graphical models. [sent-23, score-0.335]
</p><p>16 Here, we are mostly interested in the case that the dependencies of a set of variables y is modified via Gaussian processes by a set of exogenous variables x. [sent-24, score-0.637]
</p><p>17 Another example would be collaborative filtering where y might represent a set of goods and the correlation between customer preferences is modeled by a dependency network (another example of a graphical model). [sent-26, score-0.432]
</p><p>18 Here, exogenous variables such as income, gender and social status might be useful quantities to modify those dependencies. [sent-27, score-0.43]
</p><p>19 In the next section we briefly review Gaussian processes and their application to regression. [sent-29, score-0.24]
</p><p>20 In Section 3 we discuss generalizations of the simple GPR model. [sent-30, score-0.028]
</p><p>21 In Section 4 we introduce the MGP model and present experimental results. [sent-31, score-0.043]
</p><p>22 In Section 5 we discuss Gaussian processes in context with graphical models. [sent-32, score-0.341]
</p><p>23 2 Gaussian Processes In Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) one assumes that a priori a function f(x) is generated from an infinite-dimensional Gaussian distribution with zero mean and covariance K(x, Xk) = cav (f (x) , f(Xk)) where K(x, Xk) are positive definite kernel functions. [sent-34, score-0.068]
</p><p>24 In this paper we will only use Gaussian kernel functions of the form  K(X,Xk)  = Aexp (_llx - xk112) 2 28  with scale parameter 8 and amplitude A. [sent-35, score-0.027]
</p><p>25 Furthermore, we assume a set of N training data D = {(Xk' Yk) H'=l where targets are generated following a normal distribution with variance (72 such that  P(ylf(x)) ex exp ( -  2~2 (f(x) -  y)2) . [sent-36, score-0.143]
</p><p>26 (1)  The expected value j(x) to an input x given the training data is a superposition of the kernel functions of the form N  j(x) =  L WkK(X, Xk). [sent-37, score-0.055]
</p><p>27 Then we have the relation fm = Kw where the components of fm = (f(XI), . [sent-40, score-0.15]
</p><p>28 ,f(XN ))' are the values of f at the location of the training data and W = (WI' . [sent-43, score-0.025]
</p><p>29 As a result of this relationship we can either calculate the optimal W or we can calculate the optimal fm and then deduce the corresponding w-vector by matrix inversion. [sent-47, score-0.075]
</p><p>30 Following the assumptions, the optimal fm minimizes the cost function (3)  such that  jm = K(K Here y  + (72 I)-ly. [sent-49, score-0.075]
</p><p>31 3 Generalized Gaussian Processes and the Support Vector Machine In generalized Gaussian processes the Gaussian prior assumption is maintained but the likelihood model is now derived from the exponential family of distributions. [sent-54, score-0.419]
</p><p>32 The most  important special cases are two-class classification  1  P(y  = 1If(x)) = 1 + exp( - f(x))  and multiple-class classification. [sent-55, score-0.031]
</p><p>33 Here, y is a discrete variable with C states and  P(y  . [sent-56, score-0.07]
</p><p>34 , fdx)) = ~c;;-----"---'-'-----'----'--'-Â­ Lj=l exp (/i(x))  (4)  Note, that for multiple-class classification C Gaussian processes h (x), . [sent-60, score-0.325]
</p><p>35 The special case of classification was discussed by Williams and Barber (1998) from a Bayesian perspective. [sent-65, score-0.054]
</p><p>36 The related smoothing splines approaches are discussed in Fahrmeir and Tutz (1994). [sent-66, score-0.023]
</p><p>37 For generalized Gaussian processes, the optimization of the cost function is based on an iterative Fisher scoring procedure. [sent-67, score-0.105]
</p><p>38 Incidentally, the support vector machine (SVM) can also be considered to be a generalized Gaussian process model with  P(ylf(x)) ex exp (-const(l- yf(x))+). [sent-68, score-0.241]
</p><p>39 1 The SVM cost function is particularly interesting since due to its discontinuous first derivative, many components of the optimal weight vector w are zero, i. [sent-70, score-0.037]
</p><p>40 4 Mixtures of Gaussian Processes GPR employs a global scale parameter s. [sent-73, score-0.027]
</p><p>41 In many applications it might be more desirable to permit an input-dependent scale parameter: the complexity of the map might be input dependent or the input data density might be nonuniform. [sent-74, score-0.328]
</p><p>42 In the latter case one might want to use a smaller scale parameter in regions with high data density. [sent-75, score-0.147]
</p><p>43 This is the main motivation for introducing another generalization of the simple GPR model, the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model, which is a variant of the mixture of experts model of Jacobs et al. [sent-76, score-0.497]
</p><p>44 Here, a set of GPR models with different scale parameters is used and the system can autonomously decide which GPR model is appropriate for a particular region of input space. [sent-78, score-0.139]
</p><p>45 The state ofa discrete M -state variable z determines which of the GPR models is active for a given input x. [sent-84, score-0.139]
</p><p>46 The state of z is estimated by an M -class classification Gaussian process model with  P(z = iIFZ(x)) =  exp (ft(x))  L~l exp (Jj(x))  where FZ(x) = {f{(x), . [sent-85, score-0.217]
</p><p>47 Finally, we use a set of M Gaussian processes FU (x) = {ff(x) , . [sent-89, score-0.24]
</p><p>48 ,fM(X)} to model the input-dependent noise variance of the GPR models. [sent-92, score-0.071]
</p><p>49 The likelihood model given the state of z  P(ylz, P'(x), F U(x)) = G (yj ff'(x), exp(2g (x))) is a Gaussian centered at ff(x) and with variance (exp(2J:(x))). [sent-93, score-0.096]
</p><p>50 Note that G(aj b, c) is our notation for a Gaussian density with mean b, variance c, evaluated at a. [sent-95, score-0.089]
</p><p>51 In the remaining parts of the paper we will not denote the lProperly normalizing the conditional probability density is somewhat tricky and is discussed in detail in Sollich (2000). [sent-96, score-0.052]
</p><p>52 Since z is a latent variable we obtain with M  P(Ylx)  M  = LP(z = ilx) G(Yjft(x),exp(2ff(x)))  E(Ylx)  =L  i=l  P(z  = ilx)  ft(x)  i=l  the well known mixture of experts network of Jacobs et al (1991) where the Jt(x) are the (Gaussian process) experts and P(z = ilx) is the gating network. [sent-99, score-0.301]
</p><p>53 Figure 2 (left) illustrates the dependencies in the GPR model. [sent-100, score-0.133]
</p><p>54 Therefore one is typically interested in the minimum of the negative logarithm of the posterior density N  M  - L log L P(z = ilxk) G (Ykj ft(Xk), exp(2ff(xk))) k=l i=l 1M  1M  1M  +2 LU:,m)'('E:,m)-l f:,m+ 2 Lut,m)'('Er,m)-l ft,m+ 2 LU;,m)'('Ef,m)-l f;,m. [sent-103, score-0.054]
</p><p>55 In the E-step, based on the current estimates of the Gaussian processes at the data points, the state of the latent variable is estimated as  In the M-step, based on the E-step, the Gaussian processes at the data points are updated. [sent-110, score-0.599]
</p><p>56 Note, that data with a small F(z = ilxk,Yk) obtain a small weight. [sent-114, score-0.025]
</p><p>57 To update the other Gaussian processes iterative Fisher scoring steps have to be used as shown in the appendix. [sent-115, score-0.287]
</p><p>58 The reason is that the GPR model with the highest bandwidth tends to obtain the highest weight in the E-step since it provides the best fit to the data. [sent-117, score-0.287]
</p><p>59 There is an easy fix for the MGP: For calculating the responses of the Gaussian processes at Xk in the E-step we use all training data except (Xk, Yk). [sent-118, score-0.265]
</p><p>60 Fortunately, this calculation is very cheap in the case of Gaussian processes since for example  _/1-( _ 1i Xk ) - Yk - Yk - it(Xk) 1- Si ,kk where it(Xk) denotes the estimates at the training data point Xk not using (Xk, Yk) . [sent-119, score-0.265]

</p><p>63 The top left plot shows the map formed by three GPR models with different bandwidths. [sent-141, score-0.112]
</p><p>64 As can be seen no individual model achieves a good map. [sent-142, score-0.043]

</p><p>70 By dividing up the task, the MGP model can potentially achieve a performance which is better than the performance of any individual model. [sent-150, score-0.043]
</p><p>71 Table 1 shows results from artificial data sets and real world data sets. [sent-151, score-0.05]
</p><p>72 In all cases, the performance of the MGP is better than the mean performance of the GPR models and also better than the performance of the mean (obtained by averaging the predictions of all GPR models). [sent-152, score-0.103]
</p><p>73 5 Gaussian Processes for Graphical Models Gaussian processes can be useful models for quantifying the dependencies in Bayesian networks and dependency networks (the latter were introduced in Hofmann and Tresp, 1998, Heckerman et ai. [sent-153, score-0.597]

</p><p>75 If the child variable is discrete, Gaussian process classification or the SVM are appropriate models whereas when the child variable is continuous, the MGP model can be employed as a general conditional density estimator. [sent-155, score-0.301]
</p><p>76 Typically one would require that the continuous input variables to the Gaussian process systems x are known. [sent-156, score-0.153]

</p><p>84 Another example would be collaborative filtering where y might represent a set of goods and the correlation between customer preferences is modeled by a dependency network as in Heckerman et al. [sent-199, score-0.382]
</p><p>85 Here, exogenous variables such as income, gender and social status might be useful quantities to modify those correlations. [sent-201, score-0.43]
</p><p>86 Note, that the GPR model itself can also be considered to be a graphical model with dependencies modeled as Gaussian processes (compare Figure 2). [sent-202, score-0.568]
</p><p>87 Readers might also be interested in the related and independent paper by Friedman and Nachman (2000) in which those authors used GPR systems (not in form of the MGP) to perform structural learning in Bayesian networks of continuous variables. [sent-203, score-0.112]

These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables.

The method is based on a combination of a Bayesian online algorithm together with a sequential construction of a relevant subsample of the data which fully specifies the prediction of the model.

<p>Author: Richard S. Zemel, Toniann Pitassi</p><p>Abstract: In adaptive boosting, several weak learners trained sequentially are combined to boost the overall algorithm performance. Recently adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, all chosen to optimize a single common objective function. We propose an analogous formulation for adaptive boosting of regression problems, utilizing a novel objective function that leads to a simple boosting algorithm. We prove that this method reduces training error, and compare its performance to other regression methods.

<p>Author: Hilbert J. Kappen, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we derive a second order mean field theory for directed graphical probability models. By using an information theoretic argument it is shown how this can be done in the absense of a partition function. This method is a direct generalisation of the well-known TAP approximation for Boltzmann Machines. In a numerical example, it is shown that the method greatly improves the first order mean field approximation. For a restricted class of graphical models, so-called single overlap graphs, the second order method has comparable complexity to the first order method. For sigmoid belief networks, the method is shown to be particularly fast and effective.</p><p>2 0.85505551 <a title="85-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Joint_Statistical_Models_for_Audio-Visual_Fusion_and_Segregation.html">78 nips-2000-Learning Joint Statistical Models for Audio-Visual Fusion and Segregation</a></p>
<p>Author: John W. Fisher III, Trevor Darrell, William T. Freeman, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: People can understand complex auditory and visual information, often using one to disambiguate the other. Automated analysis, even at a lowlevel, faces severe challenges, including the lack of accurate statistical models for the signals, and their high-dimensionality and varied sampling rates. Previous approaches [6] assumed simple parametric models for the joint distribution which, while tractable, cannot capture the complex signal relationships. We learn the joint distribution of the visual and auditory signals using a non-parametric approach. First, we project the data into a maximally informative, low-dimensional subspace, suitable for density estimation. We then model the complicated stochastic relationships between the signals using a nonparametric density estimator. These learned densities allow processing across signal modalities. We demonstrate, on synthetic and real signals, localization in video of the face that is speaking in audio, and, conversely, audio enhancement of a particular speaker selected from the video.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82646078 <a title="85-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Mixtures_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">85 nips-2000-Mixtures of Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Martijn A. R. Leisink, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to bound the partition function of a Boltzmann machine neural network with any odd order polynomial. This is a direct extension of the mean field bound, which is first order. We show that the third order bound is strictly better than mean field. Additionally we show the rough outline how this bound is applicable to sigmoid belief networks. Numerical experiments indicate that an error reduction of a factor two is easily reached in the region where expansion based approximations are useful. 1</p><p>5 0.48680755 <a title="85-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Variational_Mean-Field_Theory_for_Sigmoidal_Belief_Networks.html">14 nips-2000-A Variational Mean-Field Theory for Sigmoidal Belief Networks</a></p>

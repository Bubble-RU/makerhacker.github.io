<p>Author: Brian Sallans, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task.

<p>Author: Jakob Carlstr√∂m</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplifying reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-future call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call arrival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in significantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1</p><p>5 0.1681205 <a title="112-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Kernel-Based_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Average-Cost_Problems%3A_An_Application_to_Optimal_Portfolio_Choice.html">73 nips-2000-Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning in Average-Cost Problems: An Application to Optimal Portfolio Choice</a></p>
<p>Author: Dirk Ormoneit, Peter W. Glynn</p><p>Abstract: Many approaches to reinforcement learning combine neural networks or other parametric function approximators with a form of temporal-difference learning to estimate the value function of a Markov Decision Process. A significant disadvantage of those procedures is that the resulting learning algorithms are frequently unstable. In this work, we present a new, kernel-based approach to reinforcement learning which overcomes this difficulty and provably converges to a unique solution. By contrast to existing algorithms, our method can also be shown to be consistent in the sense that its costs converge to the optimal costs asymptotically. Our focus is on learning in an average-cost framework and on a practical application to the optimal portfolio choice problem. 1</p><p>6 0.15288216 <a title="112-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Automated_State_Abstraction_for_Options_using_the_U-Tree_Algorithm.html">26 nips-2000-Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: David Andre, Stuart J. Russell</p><p>Abstract: We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process.The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program. For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.</p><p>5 0.5720436 <a title="112-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Robust_Reinforcement_Learning.html">113 nips-2000-Robust Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Morimoto, Kenji Doya</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm that explicitly takes into account input disturbance as well as modeling errors. The use of environmental models in RL is quite popular for both off-line learning by simulations and for on-line action planning. However, the difference between the model and the real environment can lead to unpredictable, often unwanted results. Based on the theory of H oocontrol, we consider a differential game in which a 'disturbing' agent (disturber) tries to make the worst possible disturbance while a 'control' agent (actor) tries to make the best control input. The problem is formulated as finding a minmax solution of a value function that takes into account the norm of the output deviation and the norm of the disturbance. We derive on-line learning algorithms for estimating the value function and for calculating the worst disturbance and the best control in reference to the value function. We tested the paradigm, which we call</p><p>6 0.55155849 <a title="112-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Kernel-Based_Reinforcement_Learning_in_Average-Cost_Problems%3A_An_Application_to_Optimal_Portfolio_Choice.html">73 nips-2000-Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning in Average-Cost Problems: An Application to Optimal Portfolio Choice</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical Suffix Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic corridor navigation task. 1</p><p>3 0.66522223 <a title="112-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Exact_Solutions_to_Time-Dependent_MDPs.html">48 nips-2000-Exact Solutions to Time-Dependent MDPs</a></p>

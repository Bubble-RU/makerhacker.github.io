<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Robert C. Williamson</p><p>Abstract: We present an improvement of Novikoff's perceptron convergence theorem. Reinterpreting this mistake bound as a margin dependent sparsity guarantee allows us to give a PAC-style generalisation error bound for the classifier learned by the perceptron learning algorithm. The bound value crucially depends on the margin a support vector machine would achieve on the same data set using the same kernel. Ironically, the bound yields better guarantees than are currently available for the support vector solution itself. 1</p><p>3 0.20478411 <a title="37-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-A_PAC-Bayesian_Margin_Bound_for_Linear_Classifiers%3A_Why_SVMs_work.html">9 nips-2000-A PAC-Bayesian Margin Bound for Linear Classifiers: Why SVMs work</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.19434601 <a title="37-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Weak_Learners_and_Improved_Rates_of_Convergence_in_Boosting.html">145 nips-2000-Weak Learners and Improved Rates of Convergence in Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>5 0.19180407 <a title="37-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Regularized_Winnow_Methods.html">111 nips-2000-Regularized Winnow Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: A new incremental learning algorithm is described which approximates the maximal margin hyperplane w.r.t. norm p ~ 2 for a set of linearly separable data. Our algorithm, called ALMAp (Approximate Large Margin algorithm w.r.t. norm p), takes 0 ((P~21;;2) corrections to separate the data with p-norm margin larger than (1 - 0:) ,,(, where,,( is the p-norm margin of the data and X is a bound on the p-norm of the instances. ALMAp avoids quadratic (or higher-order) programming methods. It is very easy to implement and is as fast as on-line algorithms, such as Rosenblatt's perceptron. We report on some experiments comparing ALMAp to two incremental algorithms: Perceptron and Li and Long's ROMMA. Our algorithm seems to perform quite better than both. The accuracy levels achieved by ALMAp are slightly inferior to those obtained by Support vector Machines (SVMs). On the other hand, ALMAp is quite faster and easier to implement than standard SVMs training algorithms.</p><p>4 0.69777417 <a title="37-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP. 1</p><p>3 0.74241275 <a title="37-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Higher-Order_Statistical_Properties_Arising_from_the_Non-Stationarity_of_Natural_Signals.html">65 nips-2000-Higher-Order Statistical Properties Arising from the Non-Stationarity of Natural Signals</a></p>
<p>Author: Lucas C. Parra, Clay Spence, Paul Sajda</p><p>Abstract: We present evidence that several higher-order statistical properties of natural images and signals can be explained by a stochastic model which simply varies scale of an otherwise stationary Gaussian process. We discuss two interesting consequences. The first is that a variety of natural signals can be related through a common model of spherically invariant random processes, which have the attractive property that the joint densities can be constructed from the one dimensional marginal. The second is that in some cases the non-stationarity assumption and only second order methods can be explicitly exploited to find a linear basis that is equivalent to independent components obtained with higher-order methods. This is demonstrated on spectro-temporal components of speech. 1</p><p>4 0.67769587 <a title="37-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Regularized_Winnow_Methods.html">111 nips-2000-Regularized Winnow Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: A method is described which, like the kernel trick in support vector machines (SVMs), lets us generalize distance-based algorithms to operate in feature spaces, usually nonlinearly related to the input space. This is done by identifying a class of kernels which can be represented as norm-based distances in Hilbert spaces. It turns out that common kernel algorithms, such as SVMs and kernel PCA, are actually really distance based algorithms and can be run with that class of kernels, too. As well as providing a useful new insight into how these algorithms work, the present work can form the basis for conceiving new algorithms.</p><p>6 0.64725256 <a title="37-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Efficient_Learning_of_Linear_Perceptrons.html">44 nips-2000-Efficient Learning of Linear Perceptrons</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Réjean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model.</p><p>3 0.12301335 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Shape_Context%3A_A_New_Descriptor_for_Shape_Matching_and_Object_Recognition.html">117 nips-2000-Shape Context: A New Descriptor for Shape Matching and Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Serge Belongie, Jitendra Malik, Jan Puzicha</p><p>Abstract: We develop an approach to object recognition based on matching shapes and using a resulting measure of similarity in a nearest neighbor classifier. The key algorithmic problem here is that of finding pointwise correspondences between an image shape and a stored prototype shape. We introduce a new shape descriptor, the shape context, which makes this possible, using a simple and robust algorithm. The shape context at a point captures the distribution over relative positions of other shape points and thus summarizes global shape in a rich, local descriptor. We demonstrate that shape contexts greatly simplify recovery of correspondences between points of two given shapes. Once shapes are aligned, shape contexts are used to define a robust score for measuring shape similarity. We have used this score in a nearest-neighbor classifier for recognition of hand written digits as well as 3D objects, using exactly the same distance function. On the benchmark MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, this yields an error rate of 0.63%, outperforming other published techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.11687291 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Data_Clustering_by_Markovian_Relaxation_and_the_Information_Bottleneck_Method.html">38 nips-2000-Data Clustering by Markovian Relaxation and the Information Bottleneck Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Naftali Tishby, Noam Slonim</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new, non-parametric and principled, distance based clustering method. This method combines a pairwise based approach with a vector-quantization method which provide a meaningful interpretation to the resulting clusters. The idea is based on turning the distance matrix into a Markov process and then examine the decay of mutual-information during the relaxation of this process. The clusters emerge as quasi-stable structures during this relaxation, and then are extracted using the information bottleneck method. These clusters capture the information about the initial point of the relaxation in the most effective way. The method can cluster data with no geometric or other bias and makes no assumption about the underlying distribution. 1</p><p>5 0.10195658 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-New_Approaches_Towards_Robust_and_Adaptive_Speech_Recognition.html">90 nips-2000-New Approaches Towards Robust and Adaptive Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark A. Smith, Garrison W. Cottrell, Karen L. Anderson</p><p>Abstract: The strong correlation between the frequency of words and their naming latency has been well documented. However, as early as 1973, the Age of Acquisition (AoA) of a word was alleged to be the actual variable of interest, but these studies seem to have been ignored in most of the literature. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in AoA. While some studies have shown that frequency has no effect when AoA is controlled for, more recent studies have found independent contributions of frequency and AoA. Connectionist models have repeatedly shown strong effects of frequency, but little attention has been paid to whether they can also show AoA effects. Indeed, several researchers have explicitly claimed that they cannot show AoA effects. In this work, we explore these claims using a simple feed forward neural network. We find a significant contribution of AoA to naming latency, as well as conditions under which frequency provides an independent contribution. 1 Background Naming latency is the time between the presentation of a picture or written word and the beginning of the correct utterance of that word. It is undisputed that there are significant differences in the naming latency of many words, even when controlling word length, syllabic complexity, and other structural variants. The cause of differences in naming latency has been the subject of numerous studies. Earlier studies found that the frequency with which a word appears in spoken English is the best determinant of its naming latency (Oldfield & Wingfield, 1965). More recent psychological studies, however, show that the age at which a word is learned, or its Age of Acquisition (AoA), may be a better predictor of naming latency. Further, in many multiple regression analyses, frequency is not found to be significant when AoA is controlled for (Brown & Watson, 1987; Carroll & White, 1973; Morrison et al. 1992; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). These studies show that frequency and AoA are highly correlated (typically r =-.6) explaining the confound of older studies on frequency. However, still more recent studies question this finding and find that both AoA and frequency are significant and contribute independently to naming latency (Ellis & Morrison, 1998; Gerhand & Barry, 1998,1999). Much like their psychological counterparts, connectionist networks also show very strong frequency effects. However, the ability of a connectionist network to show AoA effects has been doubted (Gerhand & Barry, 1998; Morrison & Ellis, 1995). Most of these claims are based on the well known fact that connectionist networks exhibit</p><p>4 0.46463358 <a title="71-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Shape_Context%3A_A_New_Descriptor_for_Shape_Matching_and_Object_Recognition.html">117 nips-2000-Shape Context: A New Descriptor for Shape Matching and Object Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms for approximate reinforcement learning are not known to converge. In fact, there are counterexamples showing that the adjustable weights in some algorithms may oscillate within a region rather than converging to a point. This paper shows that, for two popular algorithms, such oscillation is the worst that can happen: the weights cannot diverge, but instead must converge to a bounded region. The algorithms are SARSA(O) and V(O); the latter algorithm was used in the well-known TD-Gammon program. 1</p><p>5 0.58158922 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Learning_and_Tracking_Cyclic_Human_Motion.html">82 nips-2000-Learning and Tracking Cyclic Human Motion</a></p>

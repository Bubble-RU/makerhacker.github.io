<p>Author: Ilya Nemenman, William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: Learning of a smooth but nonparametric probability density can be regularized using methods of Quantum Field Theory. We implement a field theoretic prior numerically, test its efficacy, and show that the free parameter of the theory (,smoothness scale') can be determined self consistently by the data; this forms an infinite dimensional generalization of the MDL principle. Finally, we study the implications of one's choice of the prior and the parameterization and conclude that the smoothness scale determination makes density estimation very weakly sensitive to the choice of the prior, and that even wrong choices can be advantageous for small data sets. One of the central problems in learning is to balance 'goodness of fit' criteria against the complexity of models. An important development in the Bayesian approach was thus the realization that there does not need to be any extra penalty for model complexity: if we compute the total probability that data are generated by a model, there is a factor from the volume in parameter space-the 'Occam factor' -that discriminates against models with more parameters [1, 2]. This works remarkably welJ for systems with a finite number of parameters and creates a complexity 'razor' (after 'Occam's razor') that is almost equivalent to the celebrated Minimal Description Length (MDL) principle [3]. In addition, if the a priori distributions involved are strictly Gaussian, the ideas have also been proven to apply to some infinite-dimensional (nonparametric) problems [4]. It is not clear, however, what happens if we leave the finite dimensional setting to consider nonparametric problems which are not Gaussian, such as the estimation of a smooth probability density. A possible route to progress on the nonparametric problem was opened by noticing [5] that a Bayesian prior for density estimation is equivalent to a quantum field theory (QFT). In particular, there are field theoretic methods for computing the infinite dimensional analog of the Occam factor, at least asymptotically for large numbers of examples. These observations have led to a number of papers [6, 7, 8, 9] exploring alternative formulations and their implications for the speed of learning. Here we return to the original formulation of Ref. [5] and use numerical methods to address some of the questions left open by the analytic work [10]: What is the result of balancing the infinite dimensional Occam factor against the goodness of fit? Is the QFT inference optimal in using alJ of the information relevant for learning [II]? What happens if our learning problem is strongly atypical of the prior distribution? Following Ref. [5], if N i. i. d. samples {Xi}, i = 1 ... N, are observed, then the probability that a particular density Q(x) gave rise to these data is given by P[Q(x)l{x.}] P[Q(x)] rr~1 Q(Xi) • - J[dQ(x)]P[Q(x)] rr~1 Q(Xi) , (1) where P[Q(x)] encodes our a priori expectations of Q. Specifying this prior on a space of functions defines a QFf, and the optimal least square estimator is then Q (I{ .}) - (Q(X)Q(Xl)Q(X2) ... Q(XN)}(O) est X X. (Q(Xl)Q(X2) ... Q(XN ))(0) , (2) where ( ... )(0) means averaging with respect to the prior. Since Q(x) ~ 0, it is convenient to define an unconstrained field ¢(x), Q(x) (l/io)exp[-¢(x)]. Other definitions are also possible [6], but we think that most of our results do not depend on this choice. = The next step is to select a prior that regularizes the infinite number of degrees of freedom and allows learning. We want the prior P[¢] to make sense as a continuous theory, independent of discretization of x on small scales. We also require that when we estimate the distribution Q(x) the answer must be everywhere finite. These conditions imply that our field theory must be convergent at small length scales. For x in one dimension, a minimal choice is P[¢(x)] 1 = Z exp [£2 11 - 1 --2- f (8 dx [1 f 11 ¢)2] c5 io 8xll ] dxe-¢(x) -1 , (3) where'T/ > 1/2, Z is the normalization constant, and the c5-function enforces normalization of Q. We refer to i and 'T/ as the smoothness scale and the exponent, respectively. In [5] this theory was solved for large Nand 'T/ = 1: N (II Q(Xi))(O) ~ (4) = (5) + (6) i=1 Seff i8;¢c1 (x) where ¢cl is the 'classical' (maximum likelihood, saddle point) solution. In the effective action [Eq. (5)], it is the square root term that arises from integrating over fluctuations around the classical solution (Occam factors). It was shown that Eq. (4) is nonsingular even at finite N, that the mean value of ¢c1 converges to the negative logarithm of the target distribution P(x) very quickly, and that the variance of fluctuations 'Ij;(x) ¢(x) [- log ioP( x)] falls off as ....., 1/ iN P( x). Finally, it was speculated that if the actual i is unknown one may average over it and hope that, much as in Bayesian model selection [2], the competition between the data and the fluctuations will select the optimal smoothness scale i*. J = At the first glance the theory seems to look almost exactly like a Gaussian Process [4]. This impression is produced by a Gaussian form of the smoothness penalty in Eq. (3), and by the fluctuation determinant that plays against the goodness of fit in the smoothness scale (model) selection. However, both similarities are incomplete. The Gaussian penalty in the prior is amended by the normalization constraint, which gives rise to the exponential term in Eq. (6), and violates many familiar results that hold for Gaussian Processes, the representer theorem [12] being just one of them. In the semi--classical limit of large N, Gaussianity is restored approximately, but the classical solution is extremely non-trivial, and the fluctuation determinant is only the leading term of the Occam's razor, not the complete razor as it is for a Gaussian Process. In addition, it has no data dependence and is thus remarkably different from the usual determinants arising in the literature. The algorithm to implement the discussed density estimation procedure numerically is rather simple. First, to make the problem well posed [10, 11] we confine x to a box a ~ x ~ L with periodic boundary conditions. The boundary value problem Eq. (6) is then solved by a standard 'relaxation' (or Newton) method of iterative improvements to a guessed solution [13] (the target precision is always 10- 5 ). The independent variable x E [0,1] is discretized in equal steps [10 4 for Figs. (l.a-2.b), and 105 for Figs. (3.a, 3.b)]. We use an equally spaced grid to ensure stability of the method, while small step sizes are needed since the scale for variation of ¢el (x) is [5] (7) c5x '</p><p>4 0.16806458 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Computing_with_Finite_and_Infinite_Networks.html">35 nips-2000-Computing with Finite and Infinite Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Using statistical mechanics results, I calculate learning curves (average generalization error) for Gaussian processes (GPs) and Bayesian neural networks (NNs) used for regression. Applying the results to learning a teacher defined by a two-layer network, I can directly compare GP and Bayesian NN learning. I find that a GP in general requires CJ (d S )-training examples to learn input features of order s (d is the input dimension), whereas a NN can learn the task with order the number of adjustable weights training examples. Since a GP can be considered as an infinite NN, the results show that even in the Bayesian approach, it is important to limit the complexity of the learning machine. The theoretical findings are confirmed in simulations with analytical GP learning and a NN mean field algorithm.</p><p>5 0.13601904 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Large_Scale_Bayes_Point_Machines.html">75 nips-2000-Large Scale Bayes Point Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m 2 ) of memory and 0 (N . m2 ) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior. Finally, rejecting test points on the basis of their (approximative) posterior probability leads to a rapid decrease in generalisation error, e.g. 0.1% generalisation error for a given rejection rate of 10%. 1</p><p>6 0.12008113 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Model_Complexity%2C_Goodness_of_Fit_and_Diminishing_Returns.html">86 nips-2000-Model Complexity, Goodness of Fit and Diminishing Returns</a></p>

We explain how the approximation can be systematically improved and argue that similar techniques can be applied to general likelihood models. 1</p><p>2 0.82247907 <a title="77-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Minimum_Bayes_Error_Feature_Selection_for_Continuous_Speech_Recognition.html">84 nips-2000-Minimum Bayes Error Feature Selection for Continuous Speech Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: George Saon, Mukund Padmanabhan</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of designing a linear transformation () E lRPx n, of rank p ~ n, which projects the features of a classifier x E lRn onto y = ()x E lRP such as to achieve minimum Bayes error (or probability of misclassification). Two avenues will be explored: the first is to maximize the ()-average divergence between the class densities and the second is to minimize the union Bhattacharyya bound in the range of (). While both approaches yield similar performance in practice, they outperform standard LDA features and show a 10% relative improvement in the word error rate over state-of-the-art cepstral features on a large vocabulary telephony speech recognition task.</p><p>3 0.60460293 <a title="77-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Adaptive_Object_Representation_with_Hierarchically-Distributed_Memory_Sites.html">19 nips-2000-Adaptive Object Representation with Hierarchically-Distributed Memory Sites</a></p>
<p>Author: Bosco S. Tjan</p><p>Abstract: Theories of object recognition often assume that only one representation scheme is used within one visual-processing pathway. Versatility of the visual system comes from having multiple visual-processing pathways, each specialized in a different category of objects. We propose a theoretically simpler alternative, capable of explaining the same set of data and more. A single primary visual-processing pathway, loosely modular, is assumed. Memory modules are attached to sites along this pathway. Object-identity decision is made independently at each site. A site's response time is a monotonic-decreasing function of its confidence regarding its decision. An observer's response is the first-arriving response from any site. The effective representation(s) of such a system, determined empirically, can appear to be specialized for different tasks and stimuli, consistent with recent clinical and functional-imaging findings. This, however, merely reflects a decision being made at its appropriate level of abstraction. The system itself is intrinsically flexible and adaptive.</p><p>4 0.59392023 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-High-temperature_Expansions_for_Learning_Models_of_Nonnegative_Data.html">64 nips-2000-High-temperature Expansions for Learning Models of Nonnegative Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods. Here I present a secondorder mean-field approximation for the Nonnegative Boltzmann Machine model, obtained using a</p><p>5 0.58405149 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Mixtures_of_Gaussian_Processes.html">85 nips-2000-Mixtures of Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Tresp</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the mixture of Gaussian processes (MGP) model which is useful for applications in which the optimal bandwidth of a map is input dependent. The MGP is derived from the mixture of experts model and can also be used for modeling general conditional probability densities. We discuss how Gaussian processes -in particular in form of Gaussian process classification, the support vector machine and the MGP modelcan be used for quantifying the dependencies in graphical models.</p><p>6 0.58285767 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-A_Variational_Mean-Field_Theory_for_Sigmoidal_Belief_Networks.html">14 nips-2000-A Variational Mean-Field Theory for Sigmoidal Belief Networks</a></p>

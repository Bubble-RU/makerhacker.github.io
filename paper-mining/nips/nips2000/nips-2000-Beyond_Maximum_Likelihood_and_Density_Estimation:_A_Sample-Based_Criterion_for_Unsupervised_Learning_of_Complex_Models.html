</p><p>9 1  Introduction  Many unsupervised learning procedures can be viewed as trying to bring two probability distributions into alignment. [sent-13, score-0.519]
</p><p>10 Two well known classes of unsupervised procedures that can be cast in this manner are generative and recoding models. [sent-14, score-0.916]
</p><p>11 In a generative unsupervised framework, the environment generates training exampleswhich we will refer to as observations-by sampling from one distribution; the other distribution is embodied in the model. [sent-15, score-0.612]
</p><p>12 Examples of generative frameworks are mixtures of Gaussians (MoG) [2], factor analysis [4], and Boltzmann machines [8]. [sent-16, score-0.384]
</p><p>13 In the recoding unsupervised framework, the model transforms points from an obser-  vation space to an output space, and the output distribution is compared either to a reference distribution or to a distribution derived from the output distribution. [sent-17, score-1.043]
</p><p>14 An example is independent component analysis (leA) [11], a method that discovers a representation of vector-valued observations in which the statistical dependence among the vector elements in the output space is minimized. [sent-18, score-0.295]
</p><p>15 With ICA, the model demixes observation vectors and the output distribution is compared against a factorial distribution which is derived either from assumptions about the distribution (e. [sent-19, score-0.424]
</p><p>16 , supergaussian) or from a factorization of the output distribution. [sent-21, score-0.086]
</p><p>17 Other examples within the recoding framework are projection methods such as projection pursuit (e. [sent-22, score-0.512]
</p><p>18 In each case we have described for the unsupervised learning of a model, the objective is to bring two probability distributions- one or both of which is produced by the model- into alignment. [sent-25, score-0.364]
</p><p>19 To improve the model, we need to define a measure of the discrepancy between the two distributions, and to know how the model parameters influence the discrepancy. [sent-26, score-0.201]
</p><p>20 One natural approach is to use outputs from the model to construct a probability density estimator (PDĂ&sbquo;Ĺ ). [sent-27, score-0.173]
</p><p>21 The primary disadvantage of such an approach is that the accuracy of the learning procedure depends highly on the quality of the PDE. [sent-28, score-0.06]
</p><p>22 For the learning of generative models, maximum likelihood (ML) is a popular approach that avoids PDEs. [sent-30, score-0.551]
</p><p>23 In an ML approach, the model's generative distribution is expressed analytically, which makes it straightforward to evaluate the posterior, p(data I model), and therefore, to adjust the model parameters to maximize the likelihood of the data being generated by the model. [sent-31, score-0.536]
</p><p>24 This limits the ML approach to models that have tractable posteriors, true only of the simplest models [1, 6, 9]. [sent-32, score-0.186]
</p><p>25 We describe an approach which, like ML, avoids the construction of an explicit PDE, yet does so without requiring an analytic expression for the posterior. [sent-33, score-0.287]
</p><p>26 Our approach, which we call a sample-based method, assumes a set of samples from each distribution and proposes an error measure of the disagreement defined directly in terms of the samples. [sent-34, score-0.405]
</p><p>27 Thus, a second set of samples drawn from the model serves in place of a PDE or an analytic expression of the model's density. [sent-35, score-0.31]
</p><p>28 The sample-based method is inspired by the theory of electric fields, which describes the interactions among charged particles. [sent-36, score-0.382]
</p><p>29 In this paper, we prove that our approach converges to the optimal solution as the sample size goes to infinity, assuming an unconstrained (maximally flexible) model. [sent-38, score-0.466]
</p><p>30 We also prove that the expected solution of our approach is the ML solution in a generative context. [sent-39, score-0.605]
</p><p>31 We present empirical results showing that the sample-based approach works for both linear and nonlinear models. [sent-40, score-0.108]
</p><p>32 2  The Method  Consider a model to be learned, fw, parameterized by weights w. [sent-41, score-0.062]
</p><p>33 The model maps an input vector, zi, indexed by i, to an output vector xi = fw(zi). [sent-42, score-0.148]
</p><p>34 The model inputs are sampled from a distribution pz(. [sent-43, score-0.183]
</p><p>35 ), and the learning procedure calls for adjusting the model such that the output distribution, Px (. [sent-44, score-0.224]
</p><p>36 For unsupervised recoding models, zi is an observation, xi is the transformed representation of zi, and Py (. [sent-47, score-0.61]
</p><p>37 The Sample-based Method: The Intuitive Story  Assume that we have data points sampled from two different distributions, labeled "- " and "+" (Figure 1). [sent-52, score-0.042]
</p><p>38 The sample-based error measure specifies how samples should be moved so that the two distributions are brought into alignment. [sent-53, score-0.516]
</p><p>39 In the figure, samples from the lower left and upper right corners must be moved to the upper left and lower right corners. [sent-54, score-0.291]
</p><p>40 Our goal is to establish an explicit correspondence between each "- " sample and each "+" sample. [sent-55, score-0.146]
</p><p>41 The Sample-based Method: The Formal Presentation  In conceiving of the problem in terms of samples that attract and repel one another, it is natural to think in terms of physical interactions among charged particles. [sent-57, score-0.629]
</p><p>42 Consider a set of positively charged particles at locations denoted by xi, i = L. [sent-58, score-0.615]
</p><p>43 Nx, and a set of negatively charged particles at locations denoted by yi, j = L . [sent-59, score-0.657]
</p><p>44 The particles correspond to data samples from two distributions. [sent-61, score-0.503]
</p><p>45 The interaction among particles is characterized by the Coulomb energy, E:  where r(a, b) is a distance measure- Green's function- which results in nearby particles having a strong influence on the energy, but distant particles having only a weak influence. [sent-62, score-1.217]
</p><p>46 Green's function is defined as r(a, b) = c(d) Ilia - bll d - 2 , where d is the dimensionality of the space, c( d) is a constant only depending on d, and 11. [sent-63, score-0.05]
</p><p>47 The Coulomb energy is low when negative and positive particles are near one another, positive particles are far from one another, and negative particles are far from one another. [sent-66, score-1.152]
</p><p>48 This is exactly the state we would like to achieve for our two distributions of samples: bringing the two distributions into alignment without collapsing either distribution into a trivial form. [sent-67, score-0.457]
</p><p>49 Consequently, our sample-based method proposes using the Coulomb energy as an objective function to be minimized. [sent-68, score-0.274]
</p><p>50 The gradient of E with respect to a sample's location is readily computed (it is the force acting on that sample), and this gradient can be chained with the Jacobian of the location with respect to the model pa-to "V wE = rameters w to obtain a gradient-based update rule: ll. [sent-69, score-0.279]
</p><p>51 L(a) gives the effectiveness ofthe algorithm in moving a sample at a. [sent-71, score-0.071]
</p><p>52 For the integrated squared error (ISE) of the two distributions we obtain  ISE(t) =  J  (p(a,t))2da  ~  exp(-J. [sent-74, score-0.123]
</p><p>53 Thus, the ISE between the two distributions is guaranteed to decrease during learning, when the sample size goes to infinity. [sent-77, score-0.269]
</p><p>54 Proof: Expected Generative Solution is ML Solution  In the case of a generative model which has no constraints (i. [sent-78, score-0.352]
</p><p>55 , can model any distribution), the maximum likelihood solution will have distribution px(a) = y Ef':18(yi - a), i. [sent-80, score-0.331]
</p><p>56 , the model will produce only the observations and all of them with equal probability. [sent-82, score-0.098]
</p><p>57 For this case, we show that our sample-based method will yield the same solution in expectation as ML. [sent-83, score-0.133]

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Tony Jebara, Alex Pentland</p><p>Abstract: Jensen's inequality is a powerful mathematical tool and one of the workhorses in statistical learning. Its applications therein include the EM algorithm, Bayesian estimation and Bayesian inference. Jensen computes simple lower bounds on otherwise intractable quantities such as products of sums and latent log-likelihoods. This simplification then permits operations like integration and maximization. Quite often (i.e. in discriminative learning) upper bounds are needed as well. We derive and prove an efficient analytic inequality that provides such variational upper bounds. This inequality holds for latent variable mixtures of exponential family distributions and thus spans a wide range of contemporary statistical models. We also discuss applications of the upper bounds including maximum conditional likelihood, large margin discriminative models and conditional Bayesian inference. Convergence, efficiency and prediction results are shown. 1</p><p>5 0.10351574 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Vicinal_Risk_Minimization.html">144 nips-2000-Vicinal Risk Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Vladimir Vapnik</p><p>Abstract: The Vicinal Risk Minimization principle establishes a bridge between generative models and methods derived from the Structural Risk Minimization Principle such as Support Vector Machines or Statistical Regularization. We explain how VRM provides a framework which integrates a number of existing algorithms, such as Parzen windows, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression, Constrained Logistic Classifiers and Tangent-Prop. We then show how the approach implies new algorithms for solving problems usually associated with generative models. New algorithms are described for dealing with pattern recognition problems with very different pattern distributions and dealing with unlabeled data.

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Sepp Hochreiter, Michael Mozer</p><p>Abstract: The goal of many unsupervised learning procedures is to bring two probability distributions into alignment. Generative models such as Gaussian mixtures and Boltzmann machines can be cast in this light, as can recoding models such as ICA and projection pursuit. We propose a novel sample-based error measure for these classes of models, which applies even in situations where maximum likelihood (ML) and probability density estimation-based formulations cannot be applied, e.g., models that are nonlinear or have intractable posteriors. Furthermore, our sample-based error measure avoids the difficulties of approximating a density function. We prove that with an unconstrained model, (1) our approach converges on the correct solution as the number of samples goes to infinity, and (2) the expected solution of our approach in the generative framework is the ML solution. Finally, we evaluate our approach via simulations of linear and nonlinear models on mixture of Gaussians and ICA problems.

<p>Author: Fernando Pérez-Cruz, Pedro Luis Alarcón-Diana, Angel Navia-Vázquez, Antonio Artés-Rodríguez</p><p>Abstract: In this communication we present a new algorithm for solving Support Vector Classifiers (SVC) with large training data sets. The new algorithm is based on an Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares procedure which is used to optimize the SVc. Moreover, a novel sample selection strategy for the working set is presented, which randomly chooses the working set among the training samples that do not fulfill the stopping criteria. The validity of both proposals, the optimization procedure and sample selection strategy, is shown by means of computer experiments using well-known data sets. 1 INTRODUCTION The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful tool to solve pattern recognition problems [13, 14] in such a way that the solution is completely described as a linear combination of several training samples, named the Support Vectors. The training procedure for solving the SVC is usually based on Quadratic Programming (QP) which presents some inherent limitations, mainly the computational complexity and memory requirements for large training data sets. This problem is typically avoided by dividing the QP problem into sets of smaller ones [6, 1, 7, 11], that are iteratively solved in order to reach the SVC solution for the whole set of training samples. These schemes rely on an optimizing engine, QP, and in the sample selection strategy for each sub-problem, in order to obtain a fast solution for the SVC. An Iterative Re-Weighted Least Squares (IRWLS) procedure has already been proposed as an alternative solver for the SVC [10] and the Support Vector Regressor [9], being computationally efficient in absolute terms. In this communication, we will show that the IRWLS algorithm can replace the QP one in any chunking scheme in order to find the SVC solution for large training data sets. Moreover, we consider that the strategy to decide which training samples must j oin the working set is critical to reduce the total number of iterations needed to attain the SVC solution, and the runtime complexity as a consequence. To aim for this issue, the computer program SV cradit have been developed so as to solve the SVC for large training data sets using IRWLS procedure and fixed-size working sets. The paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we start by giving a summary of the IRWLS procedure for SVC and explain how it can be incorporated to a chunking scheme to obtain an overall implementation which efficiently deals with large training data sets. We present in Section 3 a novel strategy to make up the working set. Section 4 shows the capabilities of the new implementation and they are compared with the fastest available SVC implementation, SV Mlight [6]. We end with some concluding remarks. 2 IRWLS-SVC In order to solve classification problems, the SVC has to minimize Lp = ~llwI12+CLei- LJliei- LQi(Yi(¢(xifw+b)-l+ei) (1) i i i with respectto w, band ei and maximize it with respectto Qi and Jli, subject to Qi, Jli ~ 0, where ¢(.) is a nonlinear transformation (usually unknown) to a higher dimensional space and C is a penalization factor. The solution to (1) is defined by the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions [2]. For further details on the SVC, one can refer to the tutorial survey by Burges [2] and to the work ofVapnik [13, 14]. In order to obtain an IRWLS procedure we will first need to rearrange (1) in such a way that the terms depending on ei can be removed because, at the solution C - Qi - Jli = 0 Vi (one of the KKT conditions [2]) must hold. Lp = 1 Qi(l- Yi(¢T(Xi)W + b)) 211wl12 + L i = (2) where The weighted least square nature of (2) can be understood if ei is defined as the error on each sample and ai as its associated weight, where! IIwl1 2 is a regularizing functional. The minimization of (2) cannot be accomplished in a single step because ai = ai(ei), and we need to apply an IRWLS procedure [4], summarized below in tree steps: 1. Considering the ai fixed, minimize (2). 2. Recalculate ai from the solution on step 1. 3. Repeat until convergence. In order to work with Reproducing Kernels in Hilbert Space (RKHS), as the QP procedure does, we require that w = Ei (JiYi¢(Xi) and in order to obtain a non-zero b, that Ei {JiYi = O. Substituting them into (2), its minimum with respect to {Ji and b for a fixed set of ai is found by solving the following linear equation system l (3) IThe detailed description of the steps needed to obtain (3) from (2) can be found in [10]. where y = [Yl, Y2, ...

Finally, the dependency of ai upon the Lagrange multipliers is eliminated using the KKT conditions, obtaining a, ai 2.1 ={~ ei Yi' eiYi < Yt.et. > - ° ° (8) IRWLS ALGORITHMIC IMPLEMENTATION The SVC solution with the IRWLS procedure can be simplified by dividing the training samples into three sets. The first set, SI, contains the training samples verifying < ,8i < C, which have to be determined by solving (3). The second one, S2, includes every training sample whose,8i = 0. And the last one, S3, is made up of the training samples whose ,8i = C. This division in sets is fully justified in [10]. The IRWLS-SVC algorithm is shown in Table 1. ° 0. Initialization: SI will contain every training sample, S2 = 0 and S3 = 0.

Go to step 1 and repeat until convergence. ei Yi ' ° ° ° Table 1: IRWLS-SVC algorithm. The IRWLS-SVC procedure has to be slightly modified in order to be used inside a chunk:ing scheme as the one proposed in [8, 6], such that it can be directly applied in the one proposed in [1]. A chunking scheme is needed to solve the SVC whenever H is too large to fit into memory. In those cases, several SVC with a reduced set of training samples are iteratively solved until the solution for the whole set is found. The samples are divide into a working set, Sw, which is solved as a full SVC problem, and an inactive set, Sin. If there are support vectors in the inactive set, as it might be, the inactive set modifies the IRWLSSVC procedure, adding a contribution to the independent term in the linear equation system (3) . Those support vectors in S in can be seen as anchored samples in S3, because their ,8i is not zero and can not be modified by the IRWLS procedure. Then, such contribution (Gin and G bin ) will be calculated as G 13 and G b3 are (Table 1, 5th step), before calling the IRWLS-SVC algorithm. We have already modified the IRWLS-SVC in Table 1 to consider Gin and G bin , which must be set to zero if the Hessian matrix, H, fits into memory for the whole set of training samples. The resolution of the SVC for large training data sets, employing as minimization engine the IRWLS procedure, is summarized in the following steps: 1. Select the samples that will form the working set. 2. Construct Gin = (H)Sw,Sin (f3)s.n and G bin = -yIin (f3)Sin 3. Solve the IRWLS-SVC procedure, following the steps in Table 1. 4. Compute the error of every training sample. 5. If the stopping conditions Yiei < C eiYi> -c leiYil < C 'Vii 'Vii 'Vii (Ji = 0 (Ji = C 0 < (Ji < C (9) (10) (11) are fulfilled, the SVC solution has been reached. The stopping conditions are the ones proposed in [6] and C must be a small value around 10 - 3 , a full discussion concerning this topic can be found in [6]. 3 SAMPLE SELECTION STRATEGY The selection of the training samples that will constitute the working set in each iteration is the most critical decision in any chunking scheme, because such decision is directly involved in the number of IRWLS-SVC (or QP-SVC) procedures to be called and in the number of reproducing kernel evaluations to be made, which are, by far, the two most time consuming operations in any chunking schemes. In order to solve the SVC efficiently, we first need to define a candidate set of training samples to form the working set in each iteration. The candidate set will be made up, as it could not be otherwise, with all the training samples that violate the stopping conditions (9)-(11); and we will also add all those training samples that satisfy condition (11) but a small variation on their error will make them violate such condition. The strategies to select the working set are as numerous as the number of problems to be solved, but one can think three different simple strategies: • Select those samples which do not fulfill the stopping criteria and present the largest Iei I values. • Select those samples which do not fulfill the stopping criteria and present the smallest Iei I values. • Select them randomly from the ones that do not fulfill the stopping conditions. The first strategy seems the more natural one and it was proposed in [6]. If the largest leil samples are selected we guanrantee that attained solution gives the greatest step towards the solution of (1). But if the step is too large, which usually happens, it will cause the solution in each iteration and the (Ji values to oscillate around its optimal value. The magnitude of this effect is directly proportional to the value of C and q (size of the working set), so in the case ofsmall C (C < 10) and low q (q < 20) it would be less noticeable. The second one is the most conservative strategy because we will be moving towards the solution of (1) with small steps. Its drawback is readily discerned if the starting point is inappropriate, needing too many iterations to reach the SVC solution. The last strategy, which has been implemented together with the IRWLS-SVC procedure, is a mid-point between the other two, but if the number of samples whose 0 < (3i < C increases above q there might be some iterations where we will make no progress (working set is only made up of the training samples that fulfill the stopping condition in (11)). This situation is easily avoided by introducing one sample that violates each one of the stopping conditions per class. Finally, if the cardinality of the candidate set is less than q the working set is completed with those samples that fulfil the stopping criteria conditions and present the least leil. In summary, the sample selection strategy proposed is 2 : 1. Construct the candidate set, Se with those samples that do not fulfill stopping conditions (9) and (10), and those samples whose (3 obeys 0 < (3i < C. 2. IfISel < ngot05. 3. Choose a sample per class that violates each one of the stopping conditions and move them from Se to the working set, SW. 4. Choose randomly n - ISw I samples from Se and move then to SW. Go to Step 6. 5. Move every sample form Se to Sw and then-ISwl samples that fulfill the stopping conditions (9) and (10) and present the lowest leil values are used to complete SW . 6. Go on, obtaining Gin and Gbin. 4 BENCHMARK FOR THE IRWLS-SVC We have prepared two different experiments to test both the IRWLS and the sample selection strategy for solving the SVc. The first one compares the IRWLS against QP and the second one compares the samples selection strategy, together with the IRWLS, against a complete solving procedure for SVC, the SV Mlight. In the first trial, we have replaced the LOQO interior point optimizer used by SV M1ig ht version 3.02 [5] by the IRWLS-SVC procedure in Table 1, to compare both optimizing engines with equal samples selection strategy. The comparison has been made over a Pentium ill-450MHz with 128Mb running on Window98 and the programs have been compiled using Microsoft Developer 6.0. In Table 2, we show the results for two data sets: the first q 20 40 70 Adult44781 CPU time Optimize Time LOQO IRWLS LOQO IRWLS 21.25 20.70 0.61 0.39 20.60 19.22 1.01 0.17 21.15 18.72 2.30 0.46 Splice 2175 CPU time Optimize Time LOQO IRWLS LOQO IRWLS 46.19 30.76 21.94 4.77 71.34 24.93 46.26 8.07 53.77 20.32 34.24 7.72 Table 2: CPU Time indicates the consume time in seconds for the whole procedure. The Optimize Time indicates the consume time in second for the LOQO or IRWLS procedure. one, containing 4781 training samples, needs most CPU resources to compute the RKHS and the second one, containing 2175 training samples, uses most CPU resources to solve the SVC for each Sw, where q indicates the size of the working set. The value of C has 2In what follows, I . I represents absolute value for numbers and cardinality for sets been set to 1 and 1000, respectively, and a Radial Basis Function (RBF) RKHS [2] has been employed, where its parameter a has been set, respectively, to 10 and 70. As it can be seen, the SV M1ig ht with IRWLS is significantly faster than the LOQO procedure in all cases. The kernel cache size has been set to 64Mb for both data sets and for both procedures. The results in Table 2 validates the IRWLS procedure as the fastest SVC solver. For the second trial, we have compiled a computer program that uses the IRWLS-SVC procedure and the working set selection in Section 3, we will refer to it as svcradit from now on. We have borrowed the chunking and shrinking ideas from the SV Mlight [6] for our computer program. To test these two programs several data sets have been used. The Adult and Web data sets have been obtained from 1. Platt's web page http://research.microsoft.comr jplatt/smo.html/; the Gauss-M data set is a two dimensional classification problem proposed in [3] to test neural networks, which comprises a gaussian random variable for each class, which highly overlap. The Banana, Diabetes and Splice data sets have been obtained from Gunnar Ratsch web page http://svm.first.gmd.der raetschl. The selection of C and the RKHS has been done as indicated in [11] for Adult and Web data sets and in http://svm.first.gmd.derraetschl for Banana, Diabetes and Splice data sets. In Table 3, we show the runtime complexity for each data set, where the value of q has been elected as the one that reduces the runtime complexity. Database Dim Adult6 Adult9 Adult!

For the Web data set, which is the only data set the SV Mlight is sligthly faster, the value of C is low and most training samples end up as support vector with (3i < C. In such cases the best strategy is to take the largest step towards the solution in every iteration, as the SV Mlig ht does [6], because most training samples (3i will not be affected by the others training samples (3j value. But in those case the value of C increases the SV c radit samples selection strategy is a much more appropriate strategy than the one used in SV Mlight. 5 CONCLUSIONS In this communication a new algorithm for solving the SVC for large training data sets has been presented. Its two major contributions deal with the optimizing engine and the sample selection strategy. An IRWLS procedure is used to solve the SVC in each step, which is much faster that the usual QP procedure, and simpler to implement, because the most difficult step is the linear equation system solution that can be easily obtained by LU decomposition means [12]. The random working set selection from the samples not fulfilling the KKT conditions is the best option if the working is be large, because it reduces the number of chunks to be solved. This strategy benefits from the IRWLS procedure, which allows to work with large training data set. All these modifications have been concreted in the svcradit solving procedure, publicly available at http://svm.tsc.uc3m.es/. 6 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS We are sincerely grateful to Thorsten Joachims who has allowed and encouraged us to use his SV Mlight to test our IRWLS procedure, comparisons which could not have been properly done otherwise.

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods. Here I present a secondorder mean-field approximation for the Nonnegative Boltzmann Machine model, obtained using a</p><p>6 0.36739022 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Sparse_Representation_for_Gaussian_Process_Models.html">122 nips-2000-Sparse Representation for Gaussian Process Models</a></p>

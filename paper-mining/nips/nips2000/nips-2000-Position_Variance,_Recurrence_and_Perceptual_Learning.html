</p><p>6 1 Introduction The field of perceptual learning in simple, but high precision, visual tasks (such as vernier acuity tasks) has produced many surprising results whose import for models has yet to be fully felt. [sent-13, score-0.533]
</p><p>7 For instance, improvement through learning on an orientation discrimination task does not lead to improvement on a vernier acuity task (Fable 1997), even though both tasks presumably use the same orientation selective striate cortical cells to process inputs. [sent-16, score-1.013]
</p><p>8 Of course, learning in human psychophysics is likely to involve plasticity in a large number of different parts of the brain over various timescales. [sent-17, score-0.071]
</p><p>9 Previous studies (Poggio, Fable, & Edelman 1992, Weiss, Edelman, & Fable 1993) proposed phenomenological models of learning in a feedforward network architecture. [sent-18, score-0.347]
</p><p>10 In these models, the first stage units in the network receive the sensory inputs through the medium of basis functions relevant for the perceptual task. [sent-19, score-0.228]
</p><p>11 Over learning, a set of feedforward weights is acquired such that the weighted sum of the activities from the input units can be used to make an appropriate binary decision, eg using a threshold. [sent-20, score-0.681]
</p><p>12 These models can account for some, but not all, observations on perceptual learning (Fable et al 1995). [sent-21, score-0.16]
</p><p>13 Since the activity of VI units seems not to relate directly to behavioral decisions on these visual tasks, the feedforward connections  A  --=---------:-----~  -l+y y+E  l+y  X  x  Figure 1: Mid-point discrimination. [sent-22, score-0.422]
</p><p>14 The task is to report which of the outer bars is closer to the central bar. [sent-24, score-0.325]
</p><p>15 y represents the variable placement of the stimulus array. [sent-25, score-0.184]
</p><p>16 B) Population activities in cortical cells evoked by the stimulus bars - the activities ai is plotted against the preferred location Xi of the cells. [sent-26, score-0.873]
</p><p>17 This comes from Gaussian tuning curves (k = 20; T = 0. [sent-27, score-0.071]
</p><p>18 There are 81 units whose preferred values are placed at regular intervals of ~x = 0. [sent-29, score-0.081]
</p><p>19 The lack of generalisation between tasks that involve the same visual feature samplers suggests that the basis functions, eg the orientation selective primary cortical cells that sample the inputs, do not change their sensitivity and shapes, eg their orientation selectivity or tuning widths. [sent-32, score-0.716]
</p><p>20 However, evidence such as the specificity of learning to the eye of origin and spatial location strongly suggest that lower visual areas such as VI are directly involved in learning. [sent-33, score-0.195]
</p><p>21 Indeed, VI is a visual processor of quite some computational power (performing tasks such as segmentation, contour-integration, pop-out, noise removal) rather than being just a feedforward, linear, processing stage (eg Li, 1999; Pouget et aII998). [sent-34, score-0.186]
</p><p>22 Here, we study a paradigmatic perceptual task from a statistical perspective. [sent-35, score-0.192]
</p><p>23 Rather than suggest particular learning rules, we seek to understand what it is about the structure of the task that might lead to two phases of learning (fast and slow), and thus what computational job might be ascribed to VI processing, in particular, the role of lateral recurrent connections. [sent-36, score-0.434]
</p><p>24 We agree with the general consensus that fast learning involves the feedforward connections. [sent-37, score-0.323]
</p><p>25 However, by considering positional invariance for discrimination, we show that there is an inherently non-linear component to the overall task, which defeats feedforward algorithms. [sent-38, score-0.383]
</p><p>26 2 The bisection task Figure IA shows the bisection task. [sent-39, score-0.415]
</p><p>27 Three bars are presented at horizontal positions Xo = y + E, x_ = -1 + Y and x+ = 1 + y, where -1 « E « 1. [sent-40, score-0.186]
</p><p>28 Here y is a nuisance random number with zero mean, reflecting the variability in the position of stimulus array due to eye movements or other uncontrolled factors. [sent-41, score-0.454]
</p><p>29 The task for the subject is to report which of the outer bars is closer to the central bar, ie to report whether E is greater than or less than O. [sent-42, score-0.429]
</p><p>30 The bars create a population-coded representation in VI cells preferring vertical orientation. [sent-43, score-0.217]
</p><p>31 In figure IB, we show the activity of cells ai as a function of preferred topographic location Xi of the cell; and, for simplicity, we ignore activities from other VI cells which prefer orientations other than vertical. [sent-44, score-0.504]
</p><p>32 The net activity is ai = ai + ni, where ni is a noise term. [sent-46, score-0.405]
</p><p>33 We assume that ni comes from a Poisson distribution and is independent across the units, and E and y have mean zero and are uniformly distributed in their respective ranges. [sent-47, score-0.137]
</p><p>34 The subject must report whether E is greater or less than 0 on the basis of the activities a. [sent-48, score-0.209]
</p><p>35 Without prior information about E, y, and with Poisson noise ni = ai - iii, we have  1,>0  3 Fixed position stimulus array When the stimulus array is in a fixed position y = 0, analysis is easy, and is very similar to that carried out by Seung & Sompolinsky (1993). [sent-51, score-1.061]
</p><p>36 Dropping y, we calculate log P[Ela] and approximate it by Taylor expansion about E = 0 to second order in E: 10gP[aIE] . [sent-52, score-0.064]
</p><p>37 Provided that the last term is negative (which it indeed is, almost surely), we derive an approximately Gaussian distribution  (4)  u; =  £= u; t,  with variance [-t-IogP[aIE]I,=o]-l and mean logP[aIE]IE=o. [sent-54, score-0.045]
</p><p>38 Thus the 10gP[aIE]I,=0 is greater or subject should report that E > 0 or E < 0 if the test t(a) = less than zero respectively. [sent-55, score-0.068]
</p><p>39 For the Poisson noise case we consider, log P[aIE] = constant+ l:i ai log iii ( E) since l:i iii (E) is a constant, independent of E. [sent-56, score-0.419]
</p><p>40 Thus,  t,  (5)  Therefore, maximum likelihood discrimination can be implemented by a linear feedforward network mapping inputs ai through feedforward weights Wi = log iii to calculate as the output t(a) = l:i Wiai . [sent-57, score-1.237]
</p><p>41 A threshold of 0 on t(a) provides the discrimination E > 0 if t(a) > 0 and E < 0 for t(a) < O. [sent-58, score-0.279]
</p><p>42 Note that if the noise corrupting the activities is Gaussian, the weights should instead be  t,  Wi  a= alai. [sent-60, score-0.337]
</p><p>43 Figure 2A shows the optimal discrimination weights for the case of independent Poisson noise. [sent-61, score-0.437]
</p><p>44 The lower solid line in figure 2C shows optimal performance as a function of Eo The error rate drops precipitately from 50% for very small (and thus difficult) E to almost 0, long before E approaches the tuning width T. [sent-62, score-0.163]

</p><p>52 C) Performance of the networks with ML (lower solid line) and learned (lower dashed line) weights as a function of €. [sent-93, score-0.198]
</p><p>53 Performance is measured by drawing a randomly given € and y, and assessing the %'age of trials the answer is incorrect. [sent-94, score-0.073]

</p><p>56 weights are finely balanced about 0, the mid-point of the outer bars, giving an unbiased or balanced discrimination on E. [sent-98, score-0.582]
</p><p>57 If the whole array can move, this balance will be destroyed, and all the above conclusions change. [sent-99, score-0.137]
</p><p>58 Here, E and yare anti-correlated given activities a, because the information from the center stimulus bar only constrains their sum E + y. [sent-103, score-0.364]

</p><p>74 By comparison, a feedforward network, of weights shown in figure 4B and learned using the same error-correcting learning procedure as above, gives substantially worse performance, even though it is better than the feedforward net of Figure 2A;B. [sent-162, score-0.762]

</p><p>81 The network activities finally settle to an equilibrium u(t -+ 00) (note that Ui (t -+ 00) = ai when J = 0). [sent-172, score-0.314]
</p><p>82 The activity values u( t -+ 00) of this equilibrium are fed through feed forward weights w, that are trained for this recurrent network just as for the pure feedforward case, to reach a decision Li WiUi(t -+ 00). [sent-173, score-0.812]
</p><p>83 Figure 5C shows that using this network gives results that are almost invariant to y (as for the quadratic discriminator) ; and figure 5D shows that it generally outperforms the optimal linear discriminator by a large margin, albeit performing slightly worse than the quadratic form. [sent-174, score-0.363]
</p><p>84 The first two interaction components are translation invariant in the spatial range of Xi, Xj E [-2,2] where the stimulus array appears, in order to accommodate the positional variance in y. [sent-176, score-0.639]
</p><p>85 The last component is not translation invariant and counters variations in y. [sent-177, score-0.071]
</p><p>86 5 Discussion The problem of position invariant discrimination is common to many perceptual learning tasks, including hyper-acuity tasks such as the standard line vernier, three-dot vernier, curvature vernier, and orientation vernier tasks (Fahle et al 1995, Fahle 1997). [sent-178, score-1.046]
</p><p>87 In particular, our mathematical formulation, derivations, and thus conclusions, are general and do not depend on any particular aspect of the bisection task. [sent-180, score-0.172]
</p><p>88 The positional variable y may not have to correspond to the absolute position of the stimulus array, but merely to the error in the estimation of the absolute position of the stimulus by other neural areas. [sent-182, score-0.737]
</p><p>89 We also showed that a non-linear recurrent network, which is a close relative of a line attractor network, can perform much better than a pure feedforward network on the bisection task in the face of position variance. [sent-184, score-1.038]
</p><p>90 There is experimental evidence that lateral connections within VI change after learning the bisection task (Gilbert 2000), although we have yet to construct an appropriate learning rule. [sent-185, score-0.396]
</p><p>91 We suggest that learning the recurrent weights for  the nonlinear transform corresponds to the slow component in perceptual learning, while learning the feedforward weights corresponds to the fast component. [sent-186, score-1.138]
</p><p>92 The desired recurrent weights are expected to be much more difficult to learn, in the face of nonlinear transforms and (the easily unstable) recurrent dynamics. [sent-187, score-0.712]
</p><p>93 Further, the feedforward weights need to be adjusted further as the recurrent weights change the activities on which they work. [sent-188, score-0.989]
</p><p>94 The precise recurrent interactions in our network are very specific to the task and its parameters. [sent-189, score-0.422]
</p><p>95 In particular, the range of the interactions is completely determined by the scale of spacing between stimulus bars; and the distance-dependent excitation and inhibition in the recurrent weights is determined by the nature of the bisection task. [sent-190, score-0.839]
</p><p>96 This may be why there is little transfer of learning between tasks, when the nature and the spatial scale of the task change, even if the same input units are involved. [sent-191, score-0.243]
</p><p>97 However, our recurrent interaction model does predict that transfer is likely when the spacing between the two outer bars (here at ~x = 2) changes by a small fraction. [sent-192, score-0.607]
</p><p>98 Further, since the signs of the recurrent synapses change drastically with the distance between the interacting cells, negative transfer is likely between two bisection tasks of slightly different spatial scales. [sent-193, score-0.656]
</p><p>99 Achieving selectivity at the same time as translation invariance is a very basic requirement for position-invariant object recognition (see Riesenhuber & Poggio 1999 for a recent discussion), and arises in a pure form in this bisection task. [sent-195, score-0.312]
</p><p>100 In our case, we have shown, at least for fairly small y, that the optimal non-linearity for the task is a simple quadratic. [sent-198, score-0.071]

<p>Author: Zhaoping Li, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Stimulus arrays are inevitably presented at different positions on the retina in visual tasks, even those that nominally require fixation. In particular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that perceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely linear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent connections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination performance of a recurrent network. We propose that learning the feedforward and recurrent neural connections for these tasks corresponds to the fast and slow components of learning observed in perceptual learning tasks.</p><p>2 0.22082956 <a title="102-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2000-An_Information_Maximization_Approach_to_Overcomplete_and_Recurrent_Representations.html">24 nips-2000-An Information Maximization Approach to Overcomplete and Recurrent Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Shriki, Haim Sompolinsky, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: The principle of maximizing mutual information is applied to learning overcomplete and recurrent representations. The underlying model consists of a network of input units driving a larger number of output units with recurrent interactions. In the limit of zero noise, the network is deterministic and the mutual information can be related to the entropy of the output units. Maximizing this entropy with respect to both the feedforward connections as well as the recurrent interactions results in simple learning rules for both sets of parameters. The conventional independent components (ICA) learning algorithm can be recovered as a special case where there is an equal number of output units and no recurrent connections.

However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions.

In particular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that perceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely linear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent connections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination performance of a recurrent network.

<p>Author: Oren Shriki, Haim Sompolinsky, Daniel D. Lee</p><p>Abstract: The principle of maximizing mutual information is applied to learning overcomplete and recurrent representations. The underlying model consists of a network of input units driving a larger number of output units with recurrent interactions. In the limit of zero noise, the network is deterministic and the mutual information can be related to the entropy of the output units. Maximizing this entropy with respect to both the feedforward connections as well as the recurrent interactions results in simple learning rules for both sets of parameters. The conventional independent components (ICA) learning algorithm can be recovered as a special case where there is an equal number of output units and no recurrent connections. The application of these new learning rules is illustrated on a simple two-dimensional input example.</p><p>3 0.47579613 <a title="102-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Who_Does_What%3F_A_Novel_Algorithm_to_Determine_Function_Localization.html">147 nips-2000-Who Does What?

<p>Author: Ranit Aharonov-Barki, Isaac Meilijson, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel algorithm, termed PPA (Performance Prediction Algorithm), that quantitatively measures the contributions of elements of a neural system to the tasks it performs. The algorithm identifies the neurons or areas which participate in a cognitive or behavioral task, given data about performance decrease in a small set of lesions. It also allows the accurate prediction of performances due to multi-element lesions. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated in two models of recurrent neural networks with complex interactions among the elements. The algorithm is scalable and applicable to the analysis of large neural networks. Given the recent advances in reversible inactivation techniques, it has the potential to significantly contribute to the understanding of the organization of biological nervous systems, and to shed light on the long-lasting debate about local versus distributed computation in the brain.</p><p>4 0.4407891 <a title="102-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-Competition_and_Arbors_in_Ocular_Dominance.html">34 nips-2000-Competition and Arbors in Ocular Dominance</a></p>

<p>Author: Dirk Ormoneit, Peter W. Glynn</p><p>Abstract: Many approaches to reinforcement learning combine neural networks or other parametric function approximators with a form of temporal-difference learning to estimate the value function of a Markov Decision Process. A significant disadvantage of those procedures is that the resulting learning algorithms are frequently unstable. In this work, we present a new, kernel-based approach to reinforcement learning which overcomes this difficulty and provably converges to a unique solution. By contrast to existing algorithms, our method can also be shown to be consistent in the sense that its costs converge to the optimal costs asymptotically. Our focus is on learning in an average-cost framework and on a practical application to the optimal portfolio choice problem. 1</p><p>2 0.94395542 <a title="102-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Vicinal_Risk_Minimization.html">144 nips-2000-Vicinal Risk Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.66077828 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Explaining_Away_in_Weight_Space.html">49 nips-2000-Explaining Away in Weight Space</a></p>

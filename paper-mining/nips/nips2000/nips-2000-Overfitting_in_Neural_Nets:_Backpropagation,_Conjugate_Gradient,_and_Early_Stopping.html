<p>Author: Guy Mayraz, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The product of experts learning procedure [1] can discover a set of stochastic binary features that constitute a non-linear generative model of handwritten images of digits. The quality of generative models learned in this way can be assessed by learning a separate model for each class of digit and then comparing the unnormalized probabilities of test images under the 10 different class-specific models. To improve discriminative performance, it is helpful to learn a hierarchy of separate models for each digit class. Each model in the hierarchy has one layer of hidden units and the nth level model is trained on data that consists of the activities of the hidden units in the already trained (n - l)th level model. After training, each level produces a separate, unnormalized log probabilty score. With a three-level hierarchy for each of the 10 digit classes, a test image produces 30 scores which can be used as inputs to a supervised, logistic classification network that is trained on separate data. On the MNIST database, our system is comparable with current state-of-the-art discriminative methods, demonstrating that the product of experts learning procedure can produce effective generative models of high-dimensional data. 1 Learning products of stochastic binary experts Hinton [1] describes a learning algorithm for probabilistic generative models that are composed of a number of experts. Each expert specifies a probability distribution over the visible variables and the experts are combined by multiplying these distributions together and renormalizing. (1) where d is a data vector in a discrete space, Om is all the parameters of individual model m, Pm(dIOm) is the probability of d under model m, and c is an index over all possible vectors in the data space. A Restricted Boltzmann machine [2, 3] is a special case of a product of experts in which each expert is a single, binary stochastic hidden unit that has symmetrical connections to a set of visible units, and connections between the hidden units are forbidden. Inference in an RBM is much easier than in a general Boltzmann machine and it is also much easier than in a causal belief net because there is no explaining away. There is therefore no need to perform any iteration to determine the activities of the hidden units. The hidden states, Sj , are conditionally independent given the visible states, Si, and the distribution of Sj is given by the standard logistic function : 1 p(Sj = 1) = (2) 1 + exp( - Li WijSi) Conversely, the hidden states of an RBM are marginally dependent so it is easy for an RBM to learn population codes in which units may be highly correlated. It is hard to do this in causal belief nets with one hidden layer because the generative model of a causal belief net assumes marginal independence. An RBM can be trained using the standard Boltzmann machine learning algorithm which follows a noisy but unbiased estimate of the gradient of the log likelihood of the data. One way to implement this algorithm is to start the network with a data vector on the visible units and then to alternate between updating all of the hidden units in parallel and updating all of the visible units in parallel. Each update picks a binary state for a unit from its posterior distribution given the current states of all the units in the other set. If this alternating Gibbs sampling is run to equilibrium, there is a very simple way to update the weights so as to minimize the Kullback-Leibler divergence, QOIIQoo, between the data distribution, QO, and the equilibrium distribution of fantasies over the visible units, Qoo, produced by the RBM [4]: flWij oc QO - Q~ (3) where < SiSj >Qo is the expected value of SiSj when data is clamped on the visible units and the hidden states are sampled from their conditional distribution given the data, and Q ~ is the expected value of SiSj after prolonged Gibbs sampling. This learning rule does not work well because it can take a long time to approach thermal equilibrium and the sampling noise in the estimate of  Q ~ can swamp the gradient. [1] shows that it is far more effective to minimize the difference between QOllQoo and Q111Qoo where Q1 is the distribution of the one-step reconstructions of the data that are produced by first picking binary hidden states from their conditional distribution given the data and then picking binary visible states from their conditional distribution given the hidden states.

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP. 1</p><p>4 0.073014051 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Discovering_Hidden_Variables%3A_A_Structure-Based_Approach.html">41 nips-2000-Discovering Hidden Variables: A Structure-Based Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Elidan, Noam Lotner, Nir Friedman, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: A serious problem in learning probabilistic models is the presence of hidden variables. These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables. This problem is of interest both for improving our understanding of the domain and as a preliminary step that guides the learning procedure towards promising models.

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Réjean Ducharme, Pascal Vincent</p><p>Abstract: A goal of statistical language modeling is to learn the joint probability function of sequences of words. This is intrinsically difficult because of the curse of dimensionality: we propose to fight it with its own weapons. In the proposed approach one learns simultaneously (1) a distributed representation for each word (i.e. a similarity between words) along with (2) the probability function for word sequences, expressed with these representations. Generalization is obtained because a sequence of words that has never been seen before gets high probability if it is made of words that are similar to words forming an already seen sentence. We report on experiments using neural networks for the probability function, showing on two text corpora that the proposed approach very significantly improves on a state-of-the-art trigram model.</p><p>6 0.061508801 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Rate-coded_Restricted_Boltzmann_Machines_for_Face_Recognition.html">107 nips-2000-Rate-coded Restricted Boltzmann Machines for Face Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Rich Caruana, Steve Lawrence, C. Lee Giles</p><p>Abstract: The conventional wisdom is that backprop nets with excess hidden units generalize poorly. We show that nets with excess capacity generalize well when trained with backprop and early stopping. Experiments suggest two reasons for this: 1) Overfitting can vary significantly in different regions of the model. Excess capacity allows better fit to regions of high non-linearity, and backprop often avoids overfitting the regions of low non-linearity. 2) Regardless of size, nets learn task subcomponents in similar sequence. Big nets pass through stages similar to those learned by smaller nets. Early stopping can stop training the large net when it generalizes comparably to a smaller net. We also show that conjugate gradient can yield worse generalization because it overfits regions of low non-linearity when learning to fit regions of high non-linearity.</p><p>2 0.40353107 <a title="97-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Incorporating_Second-Order_Functional_Knowledge_for_Better_Option_Pricing.html">69 nips-2000-Incorporating Second-Order Functional Knowledge for Better Option Pricing</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Dugas, Yoshua Bengio, François Bélisle, Claude Nadeau, René Garcia</p><p>Abstract: Incorporating prior knowledge of a particular task into the architecture of a learning algorithm can greatly improve generalization performance. We study here a case where we know that the function to be learned is non-decreasing in two of its arguments and convex in one of them. For this purpose we propose a class of functions similar to multi-layer neural networks but (1) that has those properties, (2) is a universal approximator of continuous functions with these and other properties. We apply this new class of functions to the task of modeling the price of call options. Experiments show improvements on regressing the price of call options using the new types of function classes that incorporate the a priori constraints.</p><p>3 0.40307623 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Improved_Output_Coding_for_Classification_Using_Continuous_Relaxation.html">68 nips-2000-Improved Output Coding for Classification Using Continuous Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>4 0.39752248 <a title="97-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Segmentation_by_Random_Walks.html">79 nips-2000-Learning Segmentation by Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marina Meila, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: We present a new view of image segmentation by pairwise similarities. We interpret the similarities as edge flows in a Markov random walk and study the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the walk's transition matrix. This interpretation shows that spectral methods for clustering and segmentation have a probabilistic foundation. In particular, we prove that the Normalized Cut method arises naturally from our framework. Finally, the framework provides a principled method for learning the similarity function as a combination of features. 1</p><p>5 0.39609841 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Emergence_of_Movement_Sensitive_Neurons%27_Properties_by_Learning_a_Sparse_Code_for_Natural_Moving_Images.html">45 nips-2000-Emergence of Movement Sensitive Neurons' Properties by Learning a Sparse Code for Natural Moving Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Bogacz, Malcolm W. Brown, Christophe G. Giraud-Carrier</p><p>Abstract: Olshausen & Field demonstrated that a learning algorithm that attempts to generate a sparse code for natural scenes develops a complete family of localised, oriented, bandpass receptive fields, similar to those of 'simple cells' in VI. This paper describes an algorithm which finds a sparse code for sequences of images that preserves information about the input. This algorithm when trained on natural video sequences develops bases representing the movement in particular directions with particular speeds, similar to the receptive fields of the movement-sensitive cells observed in cortical visual areas. Furthermore, in contrast to previous approaches to learning direction selectivity, the timing of neuronal activity encodes the phase of the movement, so the precise timing of spikes is crucially important to the information encoding.</p><p>6 0.39472693 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Sallans, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: The problem of reinforcement learning in large factored Markov decision processes is explored. The Q-value of a state-action pair is approximated by the free energy of a product of experts network. Network parameters are learned on-line using a modified SARSA algorithm which minimizes the inconsistency of the Q-values of consecutive state-action pairs. Actions are chosen based on the current value estimates by fixing the current state and sampling actions from the network using Gibbs sampling. The algorithm is tested on a co-operative multi-agent task. The product of experts model is found to perform comparably to table-based Q-Iearning for small instances of the task, and continues to perform well when the problem becomes too large for a table-based representation.</p><p>3 0.24596246 <a title="28-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-Reinforcement_Learning_with_Function_Approximation_Converges_to_a_Region.html">112 nips-2000-Reinforcement Learning with Function Approximation Converges to a Region</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: Many algorithms for approximate reinforcement learning are not known to converge. In fact, there are counterexamples showing that the adjustable weights in some algorithms may oscillate within a region rather than converging to a point. This paper shows that, for two popular algorithms, such oscillation is the worst that can happen: the weights cannot diverge, but instead must converge to a bounded region. The algorithms are SARSA(O) and V(O); the latter algorithm was used in the well-known TD-Gammon program. 1</p><p>4 0.20026252 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Dopamine_Bonuses.html">43 nips-2000-Dopamine Bonuses</a></p>
<p>Author: Sham Kakade, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Substantial data support a temporal difference (TO) model of dopamine (OA) neuron activity in which the cells provide a global error signal for reinforcement learning. However, in certain circumstances, OA activity seems anomalous under the TO model, responding to non-rewarding stimuli. We address these anomalies by suggesting that OA cells multiplex information about reward bonuses, including Sutton's exploration bonuses and Ng et al's non-distorting shaping bonuses. We interpret this additional role for OA in terms of the unconditional attentional and psychomotor effects of dopamine, having the computational role of guiding exploration. 1</p><p>5 0.19703473 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Automated_State_Abstraction_for_Options_using_the_U-Tree_Algorithm.html">26 nips-2000-Automated State Abstraction for Options using the U-Tree Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Jonsson, Andrew G. Barto</p><p>Abstract: Learning a complex task can be significantly facilitated by defining a hierarchy of subtasks. An agent can learn to choose between various temporally abstract actions, each solving an assigned subtask, to accomplish the overall task. In this paper, we study hierarchical learning using the framework of options. We argue that to take full advantage of hierarchical structure, one should perform option-specific state abstraction, and that if this is to scale to larger tasks, state abstraction should be automated. We adapt McCallum's U-Tree algorithm to automatically build option-specific representations of the state feature space, and we illustrate the resulting algorithm using a simple hierarchical task. Results suggest that automated option-specific state abstraction is an attractive approach to making hierarchical learning systems more effective.</p><p>6 0.19695438 <a title="28-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Ensemble_Learning_and_Linear_Response_Theory_for_ICA.html">46 nips-2000-Ensemble Learning and Linear Response Theory for ICA</a></p>

<p>Author: David Andre, Stuart J. Russell</p><p>Abstract: We present an expressive agent design language for reinforcement learning that allows the user to constrain the policies considered by the learning process.The language includes standard features such as parameterized subroutines, temporary interrupts, aborts, and memory variables, but also allows for unspecified choices in the agent program. For learning that which isn't specified, we present provably convergent learning algorithms. We demonstrate by example that agent programs written in the language are concise as well as modular. This facilitates state abstraction and the transferability of learned skills.</p><p>5 0.55795735 <a title="28-lsi-5" href="./nips-2000-Ensemble_Learning_and_Linear_Response_Theory_for_ICA.html">46 nips-2000-Ensemble Learning and Linear Response Theory for ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro A. d. F. R. Højen-Sørensen, Ole Winther, Lars Kai Hansen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general Bayesian framework for performing independent component analysis (leA) which relies on ensemble learning and linear response theory known from statistical physics. We apply it to both discrete and continuous sources. For the continuous source the underdetermined (overcomplete) case is studied. The naive mean-field approach fails in this case whereas linear response theory-which gives an improved estimate of covariances-is very efficient. The examples given are for sources without temporal correlations. However, this derivation can easily be extended to treat temporal correlations. Finally, the framework offers a simple way of generating new leA algorithms without needing to define the prior distribution of the sources explicitly.</p><p>6 0.52804744 <a title="28-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Dopamine_Bonuses.html">43 nips-2000-Dopamine Bonuses</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia Hernandez-Gardiol, Sridhar Mahadevan</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge for reinforcement learning is scaling up to large partially observable domains. In this paper, we show how a hierarchy of behaviors can be used to create and select among variable length short-term memories appropriate for a task. At higher levels in the hierarchy, the agent abstracts over lower-level details and looks back over a variable number of high-level decisions in time. We formalize this idea in a framework called Hierarchical Suffix Memory (HSM). HSM uses a memory-based SMDP learning method to rapidly propagate delayed reward across long decision sequences. We describe a detailed experimental study comparing memory vs. hierarchy using the HSM framework on a realistic corridor navigation task. 1</p><p>4 0.54047209 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Model_Complexity%2C_Goodness_of_Fit_and_Diminishing_Returns.html">86 nips-2000-Model Complexity, Goodness of Fit and Diminishing Returns</a></p>

<p>Author: Jakob Carlström</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents predictive gain scheduling, a technique for simplifying reinforcement learning problems by decomposition. Link admission control of self-similar call traffic is used to demonstrate the technique. The control problem is decomposed into on-line prediction of near-future call arrival rates, and precomputation of policies for Poisson call arrival processes. At decision time, the predictions are used to select among the policies. Simulations show that this technique results in significantly faster learning without any performance loss, compared to a reinforcement learning controller that does not decompose the problem. 1</p><p>6 0.50981969 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Exact_Solutions_to_Time-Dependent_MDPs.html">48 nips-2000-Exact Solutions to Time-Dependent MDPs</a></p>

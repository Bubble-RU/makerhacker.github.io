<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.18864125 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>5 0.15102847 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-A_Tighter_Bound_for_Graphical_Models.html">13 nips-2000-A Tighter Bound for Graphical Models</a></p>

This is a direct extension of the mean field bound, which is first order. We show that the third order bound is strictly better than mean field. Additionally we show the rough outline how this bound is applicable to sigmoid belief networks. Numerical experiments indicate that an error reduction of a factor two is easily reached in the region where expansion based approximations are useful. 1</p><p>6 0.1242765 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Some_New_Bounds_on_the_Generalization_Error_of_Combined_Classifiers.html">119 nips-2000-Some New Bounds on the Generalization Error of Combined Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Vladimir Koltchinskii, Dmitriy Panchenko, Fernando Lozano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop the method of bounding the generalization error of a classifier in terms of its margin distribution which was introduced in the recent papers of Bartlett and Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. The theory of Gaussian and empirical processes allow us to prove the margin type inequalities for the most general functional classes, the complexity of the class being measured via the so called Gaussian complexity functions. As a simple application of our results, we obtain the bounds of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee for the generalization error of boosting. We also substantially improve the results of Bartlett on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of h -norms of the weights of neurons. Furthermore, under additional assumptions on the complexity of the class of hypotheses we provide some tighter bounds, which in the case of boosting improve the results of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. 1 Introduction and margin type inequalities for general functional classes Let (X, Y) be a random couple, where X is an instance in a space Sand Y E {-I, I} is a label. Let 9 be a set of functions from S into JR. For 9 E g, sign(g(X)) will be used as a predictor (a classifier) of the unknown label Y. If the distribution of (X, Y) is unknown, then the choice of the predictor is based on the training data (Xl, Y l ), ... , (Xn, Y n ) that consists ofn i.i.d. copies of (X, Y). The goal ofleaming is to find a predictor 9 E 9 (based on the training data) whose generalization (classification) error JP'{Yg(X) :::; O} is small enough. We will first introduce some probabilistic bounds for general functional classes and then give several examples of their applications to bounding the generalization error of boosting and neural networks. We omit all the proofs and refer an interested reader to [5]. Let (8, A, P) be a probability space and let F be a class of measurable functions from (8, A) into lR. Let {Xd be a sequence of i.i.d. random variables taking values in (8, A) with common distribution P. Let Pn be the empirical measure based on the sample (Xl,'</p><p>4 0.56358534 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Cynthia Archer, Todd K. Leen</p><p>Abstract: We establish a principled framework for adaptive transform coding. Transform coders are often constructed by concatenating an ad hoc choice of transform with suboptimal bit allocation and quantizer design. Instead, we start from a probabilistic latent variable model in the form of a mixture of constrained Gaussian mixtures. From this model we derive a transform coding algorithm, which is a constrained version of the generalized Lloyd algorithm for vector quantizer design. A byproduct of our derivation is the introduction of a new transform basis, which unlike other transforms (PCA, DCT, etc.) is explicitly optimized for coding. Image compression experiments show adaptive transform coders designed with our algorithm improve compressed image signal-to-noise ratio up to 3 dB compared to global transform coding and 0.5 to 2 dB compared to other adaptive transform coders. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71680653 <a title="21-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Algorithmic_Stability_and_Generalization_Performance.html">21 nips-2000-Algorithmic Stability and Generalization Performance</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, Erik B. Sudderth, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: We present the embedded trees algorithm, an iterative technique for estimation of Gaussian processes defined on arbitrary graphs. By exactly solving a series of modified problems on embedded spanning trees, it computes the conditional means with an efficiency comparable to or better than other techniques. Unlike other methods, the embedded trees algorithm also computes exact error covariances. The error covariance computation is most efficient for graphs in which removing a small number of edges reveals an embedded tree. In this context, we demonstrate that sparse loopy graphs can provide a significant increase in modeling power relative to trees, with only a minor increase in estimation complexity. 1</p><p>4 0.46842182 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>5 0.46683499 <a title="21-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Improved_Output_Coding_for_Classification_Using_Continuous_Relaxation.html">68 nips-2000-Improved Output Coding for Classification Using Continuous Relaxation</a></p>
<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Output coding is a general method for solving multiclass problems by reducing them to multiple binary classification problems. Previous research on output coding has employed, almost solely, predefined discrete codes. We describe an algorithm that improves the performance of output codes by relaxing them to continuous codes. The relaxation procedure is cast as an optimization problem and is reminiscent of the quadratic program for support vector machines. We describe experiments with the proposed algorithm, comparing it to standard discrete output codes. The experimental results indicate that continuous relaxations of output codes often improve the generalization performance, especially for short codes.</p><p>6 0.46394199 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Support_Vector_Novelty_Detection_Applied_to_Jet_Engine_Vibration_Spectra.html">128 nips-2000-Support Vector Novelty Detection Applied to Jet Engine Vibration Spectra</a></p>

<p>Author: Sophie Denève, Jean-René Duhamel, Alexandre Pouget</p><p>Abstract: Most models of spatial representations in the cortex assume cells with limited receptive fields that are defined in a particular egocentric frame of reference. However, cells outside of primary sensory cortex are either gain modulated by postural input or partially shifting. We show that solving classical spatial tasks, like sensory prediction, multi-sensory integration, sensory-motor transformation and motor control requires more complicated intermediate representations that are not invariant in one frame of reference. We present an iterative basis function map that performs these spatial tasks optimally with gain modulated and partially shifting units, and tests it against neurophysiological and neuropsychological data. In order to perform an action directed toward an object, it is necessary to have a representation of its spatial location. The brain must be able to use spatial cues coming from different modalities (e.g. vision, audition, touch, proprioception), combine them to infer the position of the object, and compute the appropriate movement. These cues are in different frames of reference corresponding to different sensory or motor modalities. Visual inputs are primarily encoded in retinotopic maps, auditory inputs are encoded in head centered maps and tactile cues are encoded in skin-centered maps. Going from one frame of reference to the other might seem easy. For example, the head-centered position of an object can be approximated by the sum of its retinotopic position and the eye position. However, positions are represented by population codes in the brain, and computing a head-centered map from a retinotopic map is a more complex computation than the underlying sum. Moreover, as we get closer to sensory-motor areas it seems reasonable to assume Spksls 150 100 50 o Figure 1: Response of a VIP cell to visual stimuli appearing in different part of the screen, for three different eye positions.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The paradigm of Hebbian learning has recently received a novel interpretation with the discovery of synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes. This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic principle of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the experimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs. These results suggest experimental prediction as to the dependency of the learning rule on neuronal biophysical parameters 1</p><p>5 0.080815919 <a title="34-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Position_Variance%2C_Recurrence_and_Perceptual_Learning.html">102 nips-2000-Position Variance, Recurrence and Perceptual Learning</a></p>

In particular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that perceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely linear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent connections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination performance of a recurrent network.

The resulting synaptic matrices have an outer-product form in which the oscillating patterns are represented as complex vectors. In a simple model, the even part of A(r) enhances the resonant response to learned stimulus by reducing the effective damping, while the odd part determines the frequency of oscillation.

<p>Author: Szabolcs KĂĄli, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: In memory consolidation, declarative memories which initially require the hippocampus for their recall, ultimately become independent of it. Consolidation has been the focus of numerous experimental and qualitative modeling studies, but only little quantitative exploration. We present a consolidation model in which hierarchical connections in the cortex, that initially instantiate purely semantic information acquired through probabilistic unsupervised learning, come to instantiate episodic information as well. The hippocampus is responsible for helping complete partial input patterns before consolidation is complete, while also training the cortex to perform appropriate completion by itself.</p><p>6 0.29646277 <a title="34-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-The_Manhattan_World_Assumption%3A_Regularities_in_Scene_Statistics_which_Enable_Bayesian_Inference.html">135 nips-2000-The Manhattan World Assumption: Regularities in Scene Statistics which Enable Bayesian Inference</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan D. Nelson, Javier R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: People are active experimenters, not just passive observers, constantly seeking new information relevant to their goals. A reasonable approach to active information gathering is to ask questions and conduct experiments that maximize the expected information gain, given current beliefs (Fedorov 1972, MacKay 1992, Oaksford & Chater 1994). In this paper we present results on an exploratory experiment designed to study people's active information gathering behavior on a concept learning task (Tenenbaum 2000). The results of the experiment are analyzed in terms of the expected information gain of the questions asked by subjects. In scientific inquiry and in everyday life, people seek out information relevant to perceptual and cognitive tasks. Scientists perform experiments to uncover causal relationships; people saccade to informative areas of visual scenes, turn their head towards surprising sounds, and ask questions to understand the meaning of concepts .

<p>Author: Ulrik Kjems, Lars Kai Hansen, Stephen C. Strother</p><p>Abstract: We demonstrate that statistical analysis of ill-posed data sets is subject to a bias, which can be observed when projecting independent test set examples onto a basis defined by the training examples. Because the training examples in an ill-posed data set do not fully span the signal space the observed training set variances in each basis vector will be too high compared to the average variance of the test set projections onto the same basis vectors. On basis of this understanding we introduce the Generalizable Singular Value Decomposition (GenSVD) as a means to reduce this bias by re-estimation of the singular values obtained in a conventional Singular Value Decomposition, allowing for a generalization performance increase of a subsequent statistical model. We demonstrate that the algorithm succesfully corrects bias in a data set from a functional PET activation study of the human brain. 1 Ill-posed Data Sets An ill-posed data set has more dimensions in each example than there are examples. Such data sets occur in many fields of research typically in connection with image measurements. The associated statistical problem is that of extracting structure from the observed high-dimensional vectors in the presence of noise. The statistical analysis can be done either supervised (Le. modelling with target values: classification, regresssion) or unsupervised (modelling with no target values: clustering, PCA, ICA). In both types of analysis the ill-posedness may lead to immediate problems if one tries to apply conventional statistical methods of analysis, for example the empirical covariance matrix is prohibitively large and will be rank-deficient. A common approach is to use Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or the analogue Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of the data. Let the N observed i-dimensional samples Xj, j = L .N, collected in the data matrix X = [Xl ... XN] of size I x N, I> N . The SVD-theorem states that such a matrix can be decomposed as (1) where U is a matrix of the same size as X with orthogonal basis vectors spanning the space of X, so that UTU = INxN. The square matrix A contains the singular values in the diagonal, A = diag( AI, ... , >w), which are ordered and positive Al ~ A2 ~ ... ~ AN ~ 0, and V is N x N and orthogonal V TV = IN. If there is a mean value significantly different from zero it may at times be advantageous to perform the above analysis on mean-subtracted data, i.e. X - X = U A V T where columns of X all contain the mean vector x = Lj xj/N. Each observation Xj can be expressed in coordinates in the basis defined by the vectors of U with no loss of information[Lautrup et al., 1995]. A change of basis is obtained by qj = U T Xj as the orthogonal basis rotation Q = [ql ... qN] = U T X = UTUAV T = AVT . (2) Since Q is only N x Nand N « I, Q is a compact representation of the data. Having now N examples of N dimension we have reduced the problem to a marginally illposed one. To further reduce the dimensionality, it is common to retain only a subset of the coordinates, e.g. the top P coordinates (P < N) and the supervised or unsupervised model can be formed in this smaller but now well-posed space. So far we have considered the procedure for modelling from a training set. Our hope is that the statistical description generalizes well to new examples proving that is is a good description of the generating process. The model should, in other words, be able to perform well on a new example, x*, and in the above framework this would mean the predictions based on q* = U T x* should generalize well. We will show in the following, that in general, the distribution of the test set projection q* is quite different from the statistics of the projections of the training examples qj. It has been noted in previous work [Hansen and Larsen, 1996, Roweis, 1998, Hansen et al., 1999] that PCA/SVD of ill-posed data does not by itself represent a probabilistic model where we can assign a likelihood to a new test data point, and procedures have been proposed which make this possible. In [Bishop, 1999] PCA has been considered in a Bayesian framework, but does not address the significant bias of the variance in training set projections in ill-posed data sets. In [Jackson, 1991] an asymptotic expression is given for the bias of eigen-values in a sample covariance matrix, but this expression is valid only in the well-posed case and is not applicable for ill-posed data. 1.1 Example Let the signal source be I-dimensional multivariate Gaussian distribution N(O,~) with a covariance matrix where the first K eigen-values equal u 2 and the last 1- K are zero, so that the covariance matrix has the decomposition ~=u2YDyT, D=diag(1, ... ,1,0, ... ,0), yTY=I (3) Our N samples of the distribution are collected in the matrix X = [Xij] with the SVD (4) A = diag(Al, ... , AN) and the representation ofthe N examples in the N basis vector coordinates defined by U is Q = [%] = U T X = A V T. The total variance per training example is ~ LX;j ~Tr(XTX) = ~Tr(VAUTUAVT) = ~Tr(VA2VT) i,j = ~ Tr(VVT A2) = ~ Tr(A2) = ~L A; i (5) Note that this variance is the same in the U-basis coordinates: 1 L...J 2 N '</p><p>5 0.39958474 <a title="34-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-APRICODD%3A_Approximate_Policy_Construction_Using_Decision_Diagrams.html">1 nips-2000-APRICODD: Approximate Policy Construction Using Decision Diagrams</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert St-Aubin, Jesse Hoey, Craig Boutilier</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method of approximate dynamic programming for Markov decision processes (MDPs) using algebraic decision diagrams (ADDs). We produce near-optimal value functions and policies with much lower time and space requirements than exact dynamic programming. Our method reduces the sizes of the intermediate value functions generated during value iteration by replacing the values at the terminals of the ADD with ranges of values. Our method is demonstrated on a class of large MDPs (with up to 34 billion states), and we compare the results with the optimal value functions.</p><p>6 0.38259035 <a title="34-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Foundations_for_a_Circuit_Complexity_Theory_of_Sensory_Processing.html">56 nips-2000-Foundations for a Circuit Complexity Theory of Sensory Processing</a></p>

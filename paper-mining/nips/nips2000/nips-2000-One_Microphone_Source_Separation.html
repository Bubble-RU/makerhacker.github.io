The framework transforms the denoising and dereverberation problems into Bayes-optimal signal estimation.

<p>Author: Jürgen Tchorz, Michael Kleinschmidt, Birger Kollmeier</p><p>Abstract: A novel noise suppression scheme for speech signals is proposed which is based on a neurophysiologically-motivated estimation of the local signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in different frequency channels. For SNR-estimation, the input signal is transformed into so-called Amplitude Modulation Spectrograms (AMS), which represent both spectral and temporal characteristics of the respective analysis frame, and which imitate the representation of modulation frequencies in higher stages of the mammalian auditory system. A neural network is used to analyse AMS patterns generated from noisy speech and estimates the local SNR. Noise suppression is achieved by attenuating frequency channels according to their SNR.

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli preprocessed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially reduced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the rectified responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natural sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for nonlinearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by comparing model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Thus, divisive normalization appears to be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities. Signals in the real world are highly structured. For example, natural sounds typically contain both harmonic and rythmic structure. It is reasonable to assume that biological auditory systems are designed to represent these structures in an efficient manner [e.g., 1,2]. Specifically, Barlow hypothesized that a role of early sensory processing is to remove redundancy in the sensory input, resulting in a set of neural responses that are statistically independent. Experimentally, one can test this hypothesis by examining the statistical properties of neural responses under natural stimulation conditions [e.g., 3,4], or the statistical dependency of pairs (or groups) of neural responses. Due to their technical difficulty, such multi-cellular experiments are only recently becoming possible, and the earliest reports in vision appear consistent with the hypothesis [e.g., 5]. An alternative approach, which we follow here, is to develop a neural model from the statistics of natural signals and show that response properties of this model are similar to those of biological sensory neurons. A number of researchers have derived linear filter models using statistical criterion. For visual images, this results in linear filters localized in frequency, orientation and phase [6, 7]. Similar work in audition has yielded filters localized in frequency and phase [8]. Although these linear models provide an important starting point for neural modeling, sensory neurons are highly nonlinear. In addition, the statistical properties of natural signals are too complex to expect a linear transformation to result in an independent set of components. Recent results indicate that nonlinear gain control plays an important role in neural processing. Ruderman and Bialek [9] have shown that division by a local estimate of standard deviation can increase the entropy of responses of center-surround filters to natural images. Such a model is consistent with the properties of neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. Heeger and colleagues have shown that the nonlinear behaviors of neurons in primary visual cortex may be described using a form of gain control known as divisive normalization [10], in which the response of a linear kernel is rectified and divided by the sum of other rectified kernel responses and a constant. We have recently shown that the responses of oriented linear filters exhibit nonlinear statistical dependencies that may be substantially reduced using a variant of this model, in which the normalization signal is computed from a weighted sum of other rectified kernel responses [11, 12]. The resulting model, with weighting parameters determined from image statistics, accounts qualitatively for physiological nonlinearities observed in primary visual cortex. In this paper, we demonstrate that the responses of bandpass linear filters to natural sounds exhibit striking statistical dependencies, analogous to those found in visual images. A divisive normalization procedure can substantially remove these dependencies. We show that this model, with parameters optimized for a collection of natural sounds, can account for nonlinear behaviors of neurons at the level of the auditory nerve. Specifically, we show that: 1) the shape offrequency tuning curves varies with sound pressure level, even though the underlying linear filters are fixed; and 2) superposition of a non-optimal tone suppresses the response of a linear filter in a divisive fashion, and the amount of suppression depends on the distance between the frequency of the tone and the preferred frequency of the filter. 1 Empirical observations of natural sound statistics The basic statistical properties of natural sounds, as observed through a linear filter, have been previously documented by Attias [13]. In particular, he showed that, as with visual images, the spectral energy falls roughly according to a power law, and that the histograms of filter responses are more kurtotic than a Gaussian (i.e., they have a sharp peak at zero, and very long tails). Here we examine the joint statistical properties of a pair of linear filters tuned for nearby temporal frequencies. We choose a fixed set of filters that have been widely used in modeling the peripheral auditory system [14]. Figure 1 shows joint histograms of the instantaneous responses of a particular pair of linear filters to five different types of natural sound, and white noise. First note that the responses are approximately decorrelated: the expected value of the y-axis value is roughly zero for all values of the x-axis variable. The responses are not, however, statistically independent: the width of the distribution of responses of one filter increases with the response amplitude of the other filter. If the two responses were statistically independent, then the response of the first filter should not provide any information about the distribution of responses of the other filter. We have found that this type of variance dependency (sometimes accompanied by linear correlation) occurs in a wide range of natural sounds, ranging from animal sounds to music. We emphasize that this dependency is a property of natural sounds, and is not due purely to our choice of linear filters. For example, no such dependency is observed when the input consists of white noise (see Fig. 1). The strength of this dependency varies for different pairs of linear filters . In addition, we see this type of dependency between instantaneous responses of a single filter at two Speech o -1 Drums • Monkey Cat White noise Nocturnal nature I~ ~; ~ • Figure 1: Joint conditional histogram of instantaneous linear responses of two bandpass filters with center frequencies 2000 and 2840 Hz. Pixel intensity corresponds to frequency of occurrence of a given pair of values, except that each column has been independently rescaled to fill the full intensity range. For the natural sounds, responses are not independent: the standard deviation of the ordinate is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the abscissa. Natural sounds were recorded from CDs and converted to sampling frequency of 22050 Hz. nearby time instants. Since the dependency involves the variance of the responses, we can substantially reduce it by dividing. In particular, the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of responses of other rectified filters and an additive constant. Specifically: L2 Ri = 2: (1) 12 j WjiLj + 0'2 where Li is the instantaneous linear response of filter i, strength of suppression of filter i by filter j. 0' is a constant and Wji controls the We would like to choose the parameters of the model (the weights Wji, and the constant 0') to optimize the independence of the normalized response to an ensemble of natural sounds. Such an optimization is quite computationally expensive. We instead assume a Gaussian form for the underlying conditional distribution, as described in [15]: P (LiILj,j E Ni ) '</p><p>6 0.18407562 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Balancing_Multiple_Sources_of_Reward_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">28 nips-2000-Balancing Multiple Sources of Reward in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

We apply it to both discrete and continuous sources. For the continuous source the underdetermined (overcomplete) case is studied. The naive mean-field approach fails in this case whereas linear response theory-which gives an improved estimate of covariances-is very efficient.

Roweis</p><p>Abstract: Source separation, or computational auditory scene analysis , attempts to extract individual acoustic objects from input which contains a mixture of sounds from different sources, altered by the acoustic environment. Unmixing algorithms such as lCA and its extensions recover sources by reweighting multiple observation sequences, and thus cannot operate when only a single observation signal is available. I present a technique called refiltering which recovers sources by a nonstationary reweighting (</p><p>2 0.82484913 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-A_Tighter_Bound_for_Graphical_Models.html">13 nips-2000-A Tighter Bound for Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Martijn A. R. Leisink, Hilbert J. Kappen</p><p>Abstract: We present a method to bound the partition function of a Boltzmann machine neural network with any odd order polynomial. This is a direct extension of the mean field bound, which is first order. We show that the third order bound is strictly better than mean field. Additionally we show the rough outline how this bound is applicable to sigmoid belief networks. Numerical experiments indicate that an error reduction of a factor two is easily reached in the region where expansion based approximations are useful. 1</p><p>3 0.79129326 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Vicinal_Risk_Minimization.html">144 nips-2000-Vicinal Risk Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Jason Weston, Léon Bottou, Vladimir Vapnik</p><p>Abstract: The Vicinal Risk Minimization principle establishes a bridge between generative models and methods derived from the Structural Risk Minimization Principle such as Support Vector Machines or Statistical Regularization. We explain how VRM provides a framework which integrates a number of existing algorithms, such as Parzen windows, Support Vector Machines, Ridge Regression, Constrained Logistic Classifiers and Tangent-Prop. We then show how the approach implies new algorithms for solving problems usually associated with generative models. New algorithms are described for dealing with pattern recognition problems with very different pattern distributions and dealing with unlabeled data. Preliminary empirical results are presented.</p><p>4 0.57373792 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Ensemble_Learning_and_Linear_Response_Theory_for_ICA.html">46 nips-2000-Ensemble Learning and Linear Response Theory for ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro A. d. F. R. Højen-Sørensen, Ole Winther, Lars Kai Hansen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a general Bayesian framework for performing independent component analysis (leA) which relies on ensemble learning and linear response theory known from statistical physics. We apply it to both discrete and continuous sources. For the continuous source the underdetermined (overcomplete) case is studied. The naive mean-field approach fails in this case whereas linear response theory-which gives an improved estimate of covariances-is very efficient. The examples given are for sources without temporal correlations. However, this derivation can easily be extended to treat temporal correlations. Finally, the framework offers a simple way of generating new leA algorithms without needing to define the prior distribution of the sources explicitly.</p><p>5 0.57346535 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Joint_Statistical_Models_for_Audio-Visual_Fusion_and_Segregation.html">78 nips-2000-Learning Joint Statistical Models for Audio-Visual Fusion and Segregation</a></p>
<p>Author: John W. Fisher III, Trevor Darrell, William T. Freeman, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: People can understand complex auditory and visual information, often using one to disambiguate the other. Automated analysis, even at a lowlevel, faces severe challenges, including the lack of accurate statistical models for the signals, and their high-dimensionality and varied sampling rates. Previous approaches [6] assumed simple parametric models for the joint distribution which, while tractable, cannot capture the complex signal relationships. We learn the joint distribution of the visual and auditory signals using a non-parametric approach. First, we project the data into a maximally informative, low-dimensional subspace, suitable for density estimation. We then model the complicated stochastic relationships between the signals using a nonparametric density estimator. These learned densities allow processing across signal modalities. We demonstrate, on synthetic and real signals, localization in video of the face that is speaking in audio, and, conversely, audio enhancement of a particular speaker selected from the video.</p><p>6 0.56998044 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-On_Reversing_Jensen%27s_Inequality.html">94 nips-2000-On Reversing Jensen's Inequality</a></p>

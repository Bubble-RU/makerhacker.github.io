<p>Author: John W. Fisher III, Trevor Darrell, William T. Freeman, Paul A. Viola</p><p>Abstract: People can understand complex auditory and visual information, often using one to disambiguate the other. Automated analysis, even at a lowlevel, faces severe challenges, including the lack of accurate statistical models for the signals, and their high-dimensionality and varied sampling rates. Previous approaches [6] assumed simple parametric models for the joint distribution which, while tractable, cannot capture the complex signal relationships. We learn the joint distribution of the visual and auditory signals using a non-parametric approach. First, we project the data into a maximally informative, low-dimensional subspace, suitable for density estimation. We then model the complicated stochastic relationships between the signals using a nonparametric density estimator. These learned densities allow processing across signal modalities. We demonstrate, on synthetic and real signals, localization in video of the face that is speaking in audio, and, conversely, audio enhancement of a particular speaker selected from the video.</p><p>4 0.145478 <a title="103-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Machine_Learning_for_Video-Based_Rendering.html">83 nips-2000-Machine Learning for Video-Based Rendering</a></p>
<p>Author: Arno Sch√∂dl, Irfan A. Essa</p><p>Abstract: We present techniques for rendering and animation of realistic scenes by analyzing and training on short video sequences. This work extends the new paradigm for computer animation, video textures, which uses recorded video to generate novel animations by replaying the video samples in a new order. Here we concentrate on video sprites, which are a special type of video texture. In video sprites, instead of storing whole images, the object of interest is separated from the background and the video samples are stored as a sequence of alpha-matted sprites with associated velocity information. They can be rendered anywhere on the screen to create a novel animation of the object. We present methods to create such animations by finding a sequence of sprite samples that is both visually smooth and follows a desired path. To estimate visual smoothness, we train a linear classifier to estimate visual similarity between video samples. If the motion path is known in advance, we use beam search to find a good sample sequence. We can specify the motion interactively by precomputing the sequence cost function using Q-Iearning.</p><p>5 0.13139458 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Accumulator_Networks%3A_Suitors_of_Local_Probability_Propagation.html">15 nips-2000-Accumulator Networks: Suitors of Local Probability Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan D. Nelson, Javier R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: People are active experimenters, not just passive observers, constantly seeking new information relevant to their goals. A reasonable approach to active information gathering is to ask questions and conduct experiments that maximize the expected information gain, given current beliefs (Fedorov 1972, MacKay 1992, Oaksford & Chater 1994). In this paper we present results on an exploratory experiment designed to study people's active information gathering behavior on a concept learning task (Tenenbaum 2000). The results of the experiment are analyzed in terms of the expected information gain of the questions asked by subjects. In scientific inquiry and in everyday life, people seek out information relevant to perceptual and cognitive tasks. Scientists perform experiments to uncover causal relationships; people saccade to informative areas of visual scenes, turn their head towards surprising sounds, and ask questions to understand the meaning of concepts .

<p>Author: Jonathan S. Yedidia, William T. Freeman, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation (BP) was only supposed to work for tree-like networks but works surprisingly well in many applications involving networks with loops, including turbo codes. However, there has been little understanding of the algorithm or the nature of the solutions it finds for general graphs. We show that BP can only converge to a stationary point of an approximate free energy, known as the Bethe free energy in statistical physics. This result characterizes BP fixed-points and makes connections with variational approaches to approximate inference. More importantly, our analysis lets us build on the progress made in statistical physics since Bethe's approximation was introduced in 1935. Kikuchi and others have shown how to construct more accurate free energy approximations, of which Bethe's approximation is the simplest. Exploiting the insights from our analysis, we derive generalized belief propagation (GBP) versions ofthese Kikuchi approximations. These new message passing algorithms can be significantly more accurate than ordinary BP, at an adjustable increase in complexity. We illustrate such a new GBP algorithm on a grid Markov network and show that it gives much more accurate marginal probabilities than those found using ordinary BP. 1</p><p>6 0.38652909 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Accumulator_Networks%3A_Suitors_of_Local_Probability_Propagation.html">15 nips-2000-Accumulator Networks: Suitors of Local Probability Propagation</a></p>

Recently adaptive boosting methods for classification problems have been derived as gradient descent algorithms. This formulation justifies key elements and parameters in the methods, all chosen to optimize a single common objective function. We propose an analogous formulation for adaptive boosting of regression problems, utilizing a novel objective function that leads to a simple boosting algorithm.

These variables are not observed, yet interact with several of the observed variables. As such, they induce seemingly complex dependencies among the latter. In recent years, much attention has been devoted to the development of algorithms for learning parameters, and in some cases structure, in the presence of hidden variables. In this paper, we address the related problem of detecting hidden variables that interact with the observed variables.

<p>Author: Brendan J. Frey, Relu Patrascu, Tommi Jaakkola, Jodi Moran</p><p>Abstract: An important class of problems can be cast as inference in noisyOR Bayesian networks, where the binary state of each variable is a logical OR of noisy versions of the states of the variable's parents. For example, in medical diagnosis, the presence of a symptom can be expressed as a noisy-OR of the diseases that may cause the symptom - on some occasions, a disease may fail to activate the symptom. Inference in richly-connected noisy-OR networks is intractable, but approximate methods (e .g., variational techniques) are showing increasing promise as practical solutions. One problem with most approximations is that they tend to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes in the true posterior, ignoring other plausible configurations of the hidden variables. We introduce a new sequential variational method for bipartite noisyOR networks, that favors including all modes of the true posterior and models the posterior distribution as a tree. We compare this method with other approximations using an ensemble of networks with network statistics that are comparable to the QMR-DT medical diagnostic network. 1 Inclusive variational approximations Approximate algorithms for probabilistic inference are gaining in popularity and are now even being incorporated into VLSI hardware (T. Richardson, personal communication). Approximate methods include variational techniques (Ghahramani and Jordan 1997; Saul et al. 1996; Frey and Hinton 1999; Jordan et al. 1999), local probability propagation (Gallager 1963; Pearl 1988; Frey 1998; MacKay 1999a; Freeman and Weiss 2001) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (Neal 1993; MacKay 1999b). Many algorithms have been proposed in each of these classes. One problem that most of the above algorithms suffer from is a tendency to concentrate on a relatively small number of modes of the target distribution (the distribution being approximated). In the case of medical diagnosis, different modes correspond to different explanations of the symptoms. Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are usually guaranteed to eventually sample from all the modes, but this may take an extremely long time, even when tempered transitions (Neal 1996) are (a) ,,</p><p>6 0.77064073 <a title="103-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Tree-Based_Modeling_and_Estimation_of_Gaussian_Processes_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">140 nips-2000-Tree-Based Modeling and Estimation of Gaussian Processes on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

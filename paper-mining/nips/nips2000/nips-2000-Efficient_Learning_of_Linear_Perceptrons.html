<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: We present a bound on the generalisation error of linear classifiers in terms of a refined margin quantity on the training set. The result is obtained in a PAC- Bayesian framework and is based on geometrical arguments in the space of linear classifiers. The new bound constitutes an exponential improvement of the so far tightest margin bound by Shawe-Taylor et al. [8] and scales logarithmically in the inverse margin. Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.12860444 <a title="44-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Large_Scale_Bayes_Point_Machines.html">75 nips-2000-Large Scale Bayes Point Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ralf Herbrich, Thore Graepel</p><p>Abstract: The concept of averaging over classifiers is fundamental to the Bayesian analysis of learning. Based on this viewpoint, it has recently been demonstrated for linear classifiers that the centre of mass of version space (the set of all classifiers consistent with the training set) - also known as the Bayes point - exhibits excellent generalisation abilities. However, the billiard algorithm as presented in [4] is restricted to small sample size because it requires o (m 2 ) of memory and 0 (N . m2 ) computational steps where m is the number of training patterns and N is the number of random draws from the posterior distribution. In this paper we present a method based on the simple perceptron learning algorithm which allows to overcome this algorithmic drawback. The method is algorithmically simple and is easily extended to the multi-class case. We present experimental results on the MNIST data set of handwritten digits which show that Bayes point machines (BPMs) are competitive with the current world champion, the support vector machine. In addition, the computational complexity of BPMs can be tuned by varying the number of samples from the posterior. Finally, rejecting test points on the basis of their (approximative) posterior probability leads to a rapid decrease in generalisation error, e.g. 0.1% generalisation error for a given rejection rate of 10%. 1</p><p>5 0.12782954 <a title="44-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2000-Weak_Learners_and_Improved_Rates_of_Convergence_in_Boosting.html">145 nips-2000-Weak Learners and Improved Rates of Convergence in Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>6 0.11367153 <a title="44-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-A_New_Approximate_Maximal_Margin_Classification_Algorithm.html">7 nips-2000-A New Approximate Maximal Margin Classification Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: A new incremental learning algorithm is described which approximates the maximal margin hyperplane w.r.t. norm p ~ 2 for a set of linearly separable data. Our algorithm, called ALMAp (Approximate Large Margin algorithm w.r.t. norm p), takes 0 ((P~21;;2) corrections to separate the data with p-norm margin larger than (1 - 0:) ,,(, where,,( is the p-norm margin of the data and X is a bound on the p-norm of the instances. ALMAp avoids quadratic (or higher-order) programming methods. It is very easy to implement and is as fast as on-line algorithms, such as Rosenblatt's perceptron. We report on some experiments comparing ALMAp to two incremental algorithms: Perceptron and Li and Long's ROMMA. Our algorithm seems to perform quite better than both. The accuracy levels achieved by ALMAp are slightly inferior to those obtained by Support vector Machines (SVMs). On the other hand, ALMAp is quite faster and easier to implement than standard SVMs training algorithms.</p><p>3 0.60526329 <a title="44-lsi-3" href="./nips-2000-Regularized_Winnow_Methods.html">111 nips-2000-Regularized Winnow Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In theory, the Winnow multiplicative update has certain advantages over the Perceptron additive update when there are many irrelevant attributes. Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods.</p><p>4 0.55582827 <a title="44-lsi-4" href="./nips-2000-From_Margin_to_Sparsity.html">58 nips-2000-From Margin to Sparsity</a></p>

<p>Author: Vladimir Koltchinskii, Dmitriy Panchenko, Fernando Lozano</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we develop the method of bounding the generalization error of a classifier in terms of its margin distribution which was introduced in the recent papers of Bartlett and Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. The theory of Gaussian and empirical processes allow us to prove the margin type inequalities for the most general functional classes, the complexity of the class being measured via the so called Gaussian complexity functions. As a simple application of our results, we obtain the bounds of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee for the generalization error of boosting. We also substantially improve the results of Bartlett on bounding the generalization error of neural networks in terms of h -norms of the weights of neurons. Furthermore, under additional assumptions on the complexity of the class of hypotheses we provide some tighter bounds, which in the case of boosting improve the results of Schapire, Freund, Bartlett and Lee. 1 Introduction and margin type inequalities for general functional classes Let (X, Y) be a random couple, where X is an instance in a space Sand Y E {-I, I} is a label. Let 9 be a set of functions from S into JR. For 9 E g, sign(g(X)) will be used as a predictor (a classifier) of the unknown label Y. If the distribution of (X, Y) is unknown, then the choice of the predictor is based on the training data (Xl, Y l ), ... , (Xn, Y n ) that consists ofn i.i.d. copies of (X, Y). The goal ofleaming is to find a predictor 9 E 9 (based on the training data) whose generalization (classification) error JP'{Yg(X) :::; O} is small enough. We will first introduce some probabilistic bounds for general functional classes and then give several examples of their applications to bounding the generalization error of boosting and neural networks. We omit all the proofs and refer an interested reader to [5]. Let (8, A, P) be a probability space and let F be a class of measurable functions from (8, A) into lR.

Even in the case of less training examples than input dimensions sufficiently large margins lead to non-trivial bound values and - for maximum margins - to a vanishing complexity term. Furthermore, the classical margin is too coarse a measure for the essential quantity that controls the generalisation error: the volume ratio between the whole hypothesis space and the subset of consistent hypotheses. The practical relevance of the result lies in the fact that the well-known support vector machine is optimal w.r.t. the new bound only if the feature vectors are all of the same length. As a consequence we recommend to use SVMs on normalised feature vectors only - a recommendation that is well supported by our numerical experiments on two benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.47447845 <a title="44-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Weak_Learners_and_Improved_Rates_of_Convergence_in_Boosting.html">145 nips-2000-Weak Learners and Improved Rates of Convergence in Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Shie Mannor, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: The problem of constructing weak classifiers for boosting algorithms is studied. We present an algorithm that produces a linear classifier that is guaranteed to achieve an error better than random guessing for any distribution on the data. While this weak learner is not useful for learning in general, we show that under reasonable conditions on the distribution it yields an effective weak learner for one-dimensional problems. Preliminary simulations suggest that similar behavior can be expected in higher dimensions, a result which is corroborated by some recent theoretical bounds. Additionally, we provide improved convergence rate bounds for the generalization error in situations where the empirical error can be made small, which is exactly the situation that occurs if weak learners with guaranteed performance that is better than random guessing can be established. 1</p><p>5 0.46346927 <a title="44-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Convergence_of_Large_Margin_Separable_Linear_Classification.html">37 nips-2000-Convergence of Large Margin Separable Linear Classification</a></p>

</p><p>2 We show how it can also arise in a Bayesian context in inference about the weights governing relationships such as those between stimuli and reinforcers in conditioning experiments such as bacA, 'Ward blocking. [sent-8, score-0.493]
</p><p>3 1 Introduction The phenomenon of expl aining away is commonplace in inference in belief networks. [sent-10, score-0.206]
</p><p>4 Explaining away is typically realized by recurrent inference procedures, such as mean field inference (see Jordan, 1998). [sent-12, score-0.315]
</p><p>5 However, explaining away is not only important in the space of on-line explanations for data; it is also important in the space of weights. [sent-13, score-0.23]
</p><p>6 This is a very general problem that we 'Ward blocking (Shanks, illustrate using a phenomenon from animal conditioning called bad 1985; Miller & Matute, 1996). [sent-14, score-0.621]
</p><p>7 Backwards blocking poses a very different problem from standard explaining away, and rather complex theories have been advanced to account for it (eg Wagner & Brandon, 1989). [sent-16, score-0.398]
</p><p>8 We treat it as a case for Kalman jiltering, and suggest a novel network model for Kalman filtering to solve it. [sent-17, score-0.091]
</p><p>9 ) in forward and backward blocking, but stronger (Rf2) in the sharing paradigm. [sent-20, score-0.327]
</p><p>10 The effect that concerns this paper is occurring during the second set of trials during backward blocking in which the association between the sound and the reward is weakened (compared with sharing), even though the sound is not presented during these trials. [sent-21, score-1.097]
</p><p>11 The apparent association between the sound and the reward established in the first set of trials is explained away in the second set of trials. [sent-22, score-0.579]
</p><p>12 Not only does this suggestion lack a statistical basis, but also its network implementation requires that the activation of the opponent sound units makes weaker the weights from the standard sound units to reward. [sent-24, score-0.552]
</p><p>13 In this paper, we first extend the Kalman filter based conditioning theory of Sutton (1992) to the case of backward blocking. [sent-26, score-0.74]
</p><p>14 Next, we show the close relationship between the key quantity for a Kalman filter - namely the covariance matrix of uncertainty about the relationship between the stimuli and the reward - and the symmetric whitening matrix for the stimuli. [sent-27, score-1.162]
</p><p>15 Then we show how the Goodall algorithm for whitening (Goodall 1960; Atick & Redlich, 1993) makes for an appropriate network implementation for weight updates based on the Kalman filter. [sent-28, score-0.412]
</p><p>16 The final algorithm is a motivated mixture of unsupervised and reinforcement (or, equivalently in this case, supervised) learning. [sent-29, score-0.072]
</p><p>17 Last, we demonstrate backward blocking in the full model. [sent-30, score-0.512]
</p><p>18 2 The Kalman filter and classical conditioning Sutton (1992) suggested that one can understand classical conditioning in terms of normative statistical inference. [sent-31, score-0.879]
</p><p>19 The idea is that on trial n there is a set of true weights Wn mediating the relationship between the presentation of stimuli Xn and the amount of reward Tn that is delivered, where (1) and En '" N[O, T2] is zero-mean Gaussian noise, independent from one trial to the next. [sent-32, score-0.419]
</p><p>20 Crucially, to allow for the possibility (realized in most conditioning experiments) that the true weights might change, the model includes a diffusion term W n +1  = Wn + 11n  (2)  where 11n '" N[O, (72][] is also Gaussian. [sent-35, score-0.409]
</p><p>21 The task for the animal is to take observations of the stimuli {xn} and rewards {Tn} and infer a distribution over W n . [sent-36, score-0.128]
</p><p>22 Provided that the initial uncertainty can be captured as Wo '" N[O, ~o] for some covariance matrix ~o , inference takes the form of a standard recursive Kalman filter, for which P(WnITl . [sent-37, score-0.364]

</p><p>25 If 1;n ex n, then the update for the mean can be seen as a standard delta rule (Widrow & Stearns, 1985; Rescorla & Wagner, 1972), involving the prediction error (or innovation) On rn - wn . [sent-46, score-0.401]
</p><p>26 Note the familiar, but at first sight counterintuitive, result that the update for the covariance matrix does not depend on the innovation or the observed rn . [sent-48, score-0.375]
</p><p>27 2  =  In backward blocking, in the first set of trials, the off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix 1;n become negative. [sent-49, score-0.494]
</p><p>28 This can either be seen from the form of the update equation for the covariance matrix (since Xn '" (1,1)), or, more intuitivep', from the fact that these trials imply a constraint only on w* + w~, therefore forcing wn and w* to be negatively correlated. [sent-50, score-0.624]
</p><p>29 The consequence of this negative correlation in the second set of trials is that the S component of 1;n . [sent-51, score-0.165]
</p><p>30 Another way of looking at this is in terms of explaining away in weight space. [sent-55, score-0.298]
</p><p>31 From the first set of trials, the animal infers that w* + w~ = R > 0; from the second, that the prediction owes to w* rather than w~, and so the old value w~ = R/2 is explained away by w*. [sent-56, score-0.271]
</p><p>32 Sutton (1992) actually suggested the approximation of forcing the off-diagonal components of the covariance matrix 1;n to be 0, which, of course, prevents the system from accounting for backward blocking. [sent-57, score-0.56]
</p><p>33 We seek a network account of explaining away in the space of weights by implementing an approximate form of Kalman filtering. [sent-58, score-0.403]
</p><p>34 3 Whitening and the Kalman filter In conventional applications of the Kalman filter, Xn would typically be constant. [sent-59, score-0.245]
</p><p>35 The plan for this section is to derive an approximate relationship between the average covariance matrix over the weights f; and a whitening matrix for the stimulus inputs. [sent-62, score-0.845]
</p><p>36 In the next section, we consider an implementation of a particular whitening algorithm as an unsupervised way of estimating the covariance matrix for the Kalman filter and show how to use it to learn the weights Wn appropriately. [sent-63, score-0.954]
</p><p>37 Consider the case that Xn are random, with correlation matrix (xx) = Q, and consider the mean covariance matrix f; for the Kalman filter, averaging across the variation in x. [sent-64, score-0.413]
</p><p>38 Then, we can solve for the average of the asymptotic value of f; in the equation for the update of the Kalman filter as f;Qf; ex  n  (5)  Thus f; is a whitening filter for the correlation matrix Q of the inputs {x}. [sent-71, score-1.003]
</p><p>39 Symmetric whitening filters (f; must be symmetric) are generally unique (Atick & Redlich, 1993). [sent-72, score-0.282]
</p><p>40 This result is very different from the standard relationship between Kalman filtering and whitening. [sent-73, score-0.093]
</p><p>41 The standard Kalman filter is a whitening filter for the innovations process on = rn - wn . [sent-74, score-0.982]
</p><p>42 X n , ie as extracting all the systematic variation into W n, leaving only random variation due to the observation noise and the diffusion process. [sent-75, score-0.235]
</p><p>43 Equation 5 is an additional level of whitening, saying that one can look at the long-run average covariance 2Note also the use of the alternative form of the Kalman filter, in which we perform observation/conditioning followed by drift, rather than drift followed by observation/conditioning.

</p><p>46 The off-diagonal components are around an order of magnitude smaller than the ondiagonal components, even in the difficult regime where v is near 0, and thus the matrix Q is nearly singular. [sent-81, score-0.101]

</p><p>50 This is inherently unsupervised, in that whitening takes place without any reference to the observed rewards (or even the innovation). [sent-86, score-0.282]
</p><p>51 Given the approximation, we tested whether f; really whitens Q by by generating Xn from a Gaussian distribution, with mean (1,1) and variance v 2 II, calculating the long-run average value of f;, and assessing whether f f;Qf; is white. [sent-87, score-0.074]
</p><p>52 The figure shows that the off-diagonal components are comparatively very small, even when v is very small, for which Q has an eigenvalue very near to 0 making the whitening matrix nearly undefined. [sent-89, score-0.383]
</p><p>53 Equally, in this case, ~n tends to have very large values, since, looking at equation 4, the growth in uncertainty coming from a 2 II is not balanced by any observation in the direction (1, -1) that is orthogonal to (1,1) . [sent-90, score-0.164]
</p><p>54 =  Of course, only the long-run average covariance matrix f; whitens Q. [sent-91, score-0.322]

</p><p>57 The network has two components, a mapping from input x to output y(t), via recurrent feedback weights B (the Goodall (1960) whitening filter), and a mapping from y, through a set of prediction weights W to an estimate of the reward. [sent-94, score-0.699]

</p><p>82 Further work is needed to understand how to set the parameters of the Goodall learning rule to match 0'2 and 7 2 exactly. [sent-184, score-0.073]
</p><p>83 Hinton (personal communication) has suggested an alternative interpretation of Kalman filtering based on a heteroassociative novelty filter. [sent-185, score-0.108]
</p><p>84 Here, the idea is to use the recurrent network B only once, rather than to equilibrium, with (as for our model) Yn(O) Xn , the prediction v = wn . [sent-186, score-0.346]
</p><p>85 If we compare the update for Bn to that for ~n (equation 4), we can see that it amounts approximately to assuming neither observation noise nor drift. [sent-196, score-0.109]
</p><p>86 Thus, whereas our network model approximates the long-run covariance matrix, the novelty filter approximates the instantaneous covariance matrix directly, and could clearly be adapted to take account of noise. [sent-197, score-0.744]
</p><p>87 Unfortunately, there are few quantitatively precise experimental results on backwards blocking, so it is hard to choose between different possible rules. [sent-198, score-0.083]

</p><p>92 The most critical concern about this is that it is not obvious how to use the resulting covariance matrix to control learning about the mean values of the weights. [sent-205, score-0.275]
</p><p>93 There is also the more theoretical concern that the covariance matrix should really be independent of the prediction errors, one manifestation of which is that the occurrence of backward blocking in the model of equation 8 is strongly sensitive to initial conditions. [sent-206, score-0.876]
</p><p>94 Although backward blocking is a robust phenomenon, particularly in human conditioning experiments (Shanks, 1985), it is not observed in all animal conditioning paradigms. [sent-207, score-1.075]
</p><p>95 One possibility for why not is that the anatomical substrate of the cross-modal recurrent network (the B weights in the model) is not ubiquitously available. [sent-208, score-0.256]
</p><p>96 In its absence, y( 00) = y(O) = Xn in response to an input X n , and so the network will perform like the standard delta or Rescorla-Wagner (Rescorla & Wagner, 1972) rule. [sent-209, score-0.157]

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli preprocessed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially reduced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the rectified responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natural sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for nonlinearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by comparing model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Thus, divisive normalization appears to be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities. Signals in the real world are highly structured. For example, natural sounds typically contain both harmonic and rythmic structure. It is reasonable to assume that biological auditory systems are designed to represent these structures in an efficient manner [e.g., 1,2]. Specifically, Barlow hypothesized that a role of early sensory processing is to remove redundancy in the sensory input, resulting in a set of neural responses that are statistically independent. Experimentally, one can test this hypothesis by examining the statistical properties of neural responses under natural stimulation conditions [e.g., 3,4], or the statistical dependency of pairs (or groups) of neural responses. Due to their technical difficulty, such multi-cellular experiments are only recently becoming possible, and the earliest reports in vision appear consistent with the hypothesis [e.g., 5]. An alternative approach, which we follow here, is to develop a neural model from the statistics of natural signals and show that response properties of this model are similar to those of biological sensory neurons. A number of researchers have derived linear filter models using statistical criterion. For visual images, this results in linear filters localized in frequency, orientation and phase [6, 7]. Similar work in audition has yielded filters localized in frequency and phase [8]. Although these linear models provide an important starting point for neural modeling, sensory neurons are highly nonlinear. In addition, the statistical properties of natural signals are too complex to expect a linear transformation to result in an independent set of components. Recent results indicate that nonlinear gain control plays an important role in neural processing. Ruderman and Bialek [9] have shown that division by a local estimate of standard deviation can increase the entropy of responses of center-surround filters to natural images. Such a model is consistent with the properties of neurons in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus. Heeger and colleagues have shown that the nonlinear behaviors of neurons in primary visual cortex may be described using a form of gain control known as divisive normalization [10], in which the response of a linear kernel is rectified and divided by the sum of other rectified kernel responses and a constant. We have recently shown that the responses of oriented linear filters exhibit nonlinear statistical dependencies that may be substantially reduced using a variant of this model, in which the normalization signal is computed from a weighted sum of other rectified kernel responses [11, 12]. The resulting model, with weighting parameters determined from image statistics, accounts qualitatively for physiological nonlinearities observed in primary visual cortex. In this paper, we demonstrate that the responses of bandpass linear filters to natural sounds exhibit striking statistical dependencies, analogous to those found in visual images. A divisive normalization procedure can substantially remove these dependencies. We show that this model, with parameters optimized for a collection of natural sounds, can account for nonlinear behaviors of neurons at the level of the auditory nerve. Specifically, we show that: 1) the shape offrequency tuning curves varies with sound pressure level, even though the underlying linear filters are fixed; and 2) superposition of a non-optimal tone suppresses the response of a linear filter in a divisive fashion, and the amount of suppression depends on the distance between the frequency of the tone and the preferred frequency of the filter. 1 Empirical observations of natural sound statistics The basic statistical properties of natural sounds, as observed through a linear filter, have been previously documented by Attias [13]. In particular, he showed that, as with visual images, the spectral energy falls roughly according to a power law, and that the histograms of filter responses are more kurtotic than a Gaussian (i.e., they have a sharp peak at zero, and very long tails). Here we examine the joint statistical properties of a pair of linear filters tuned for nearby temporal frequencies. We choose a fixed set of filters that have been widely used in modeling the peripheral auditory system [14]. Figure 1 shows joint histograms of the instantaneous responses of a particular pair of linear filters to five different types of natural sound, and white noise. First note that the responses are approximately decorrelated: the expected value of the y-axis value is roughly zero for all values of the x-axis variable. The responses are not, however, statistically independent: the width of the distribution of responses of one filter increases with the response amplitude of the other filter. If the two responses were statistically independent, then the response of the first filter should not provide any information about the distribution of responses of the other filter. We have found that this type of variance dependency (sometimes accompanied by linear correlation) occurs in a wide range of natural sounds, ranging from animal sounds to music. We emphasize that this dependency is a property of natural sounds, and is not due purely to our choice of linear filters. For example, no such dependency is observed when the input consists of white noise (see Fig. 1). The strength of this dependency varies for different pairs of linear filters . In addition, we see this type of dependency between instantaneous responses of a single filter at two Speech o -1 Drums • Monkey Cat White noise Nocturnal nature I~ ~; ~ • Figure 1: Joint conditional histogram of instantaneous linear responses of two bandpass filters with center frequencies 2000 and 2840 Hz. Pixel intensity corresponds to frequency of occurrence of a given pair of values, except that each column has been independently rescaled to fill the full intensity range. For the natural sounds, responses are not independent: the standard deviation of the ordinate is roughly proportional to the magnitude of the abscissa. Natural sounds were recorded from CDs and converted to sampling frequency of 22050 Hz. nearby time instants. Since the dependency involves the variance of the responses, we can substantially reduce it by dividing. In particular, the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of responses of other rectified filters and an additive constant. Specifically: L2 Ri = 2: (1) 12 j WjiLj + 0'2 where Li is the instantaneous linear response of filter i, strength of suppression of filter i by filter j. 0' is a constant and Wji controls the We would like to choose the parameters of the model (the weights Wji, and the constant 0') to optimize the independence of the normalized response to an ensemble of natural sounds. Such an optimization is quite computationally expensive.

<p>Author: Michael E. Tipping</p><p>Abstract: 'Kernel' principal component analysis (PCA) is an elegant nonlinear generalisation of the popular linear data analysis method, where a kernel function implicitly defines a nonlinear transformation into a feature space wherein standard PCA is performed. Unfortunately, the technique is not 'sparse', since the components thus obtained are expressed in terms of kernels associated with every training vector. This paper shows that by approximating the covariance matrix in feature space by a reduced number of example vectors, using a maximum-likelihood approach, we may obtain a highly sparse form of kernel PCA without loss of effectiveness. 1</p><p>6 0.11075812 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-The_Unscented_Particle_Filter.html">137 nips-2000-The Unscented Particle Filter</a></p>

<p>Author: Odelia Schwartz, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: We explore the statistical properties of natural sound stimuli preprocessed with a bank of linear filters. The responses of such filters exhibit a striking form of statistical dependency, in which the response variance of each filter grows with the response amplitude of filters tuned for nearby frequencies. These dependencies may be substantially reduced using an operation known as divisive normalization, in which the response of each filter is divided by a weighted sum of the rectified responses of other filters. The weights may be chosen to maximize the independence of the normalized responses for an ensemble of natural sounds. We demonstrate that the resulting model accounts for nonlinearities in the response characteristics of the auditory nerve, by comparing model simulations to electrophysiological recordings. In previous work (NIPS, 1998) we demonstrated that an analogous model derived from the statistics of natural images accounts for non-linear properties of neurons in primary visual cortex. Thus, divisive normalization appears to be a generic mechanism for eliminating a type of statistical dependency that is prevalent in natural signals of different modalities. Signals in the real world are highly structured. For example, natural sounds typically contain both harmonic and rythmic structure. It is reasonable to assume that biological auditory systems are designed to represent these structures in an efficient manner [e.g., 1,2]. Specifically, Barlow hypothesized that a role of early sensory processing is to remove redundancy in the sensory input, resulting in a set of neural responses that are statistically independent. Experimentally, one can test this hypothesis by examining the statistical properties of neural responses under natural stimulation conditions [e.g., 3,4], or the statistical dependency of pairs (or groups) of neural responses. Due to their technical difficulty, such multi-cellular experiments are only recently becoming possible, and the earliest reports in vision appear consistent with the hypothesis [e.g., 5].

<p>Author: Zhaoping Li, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Stimulus arrays are inevitably presented at different positions on the retina in visual tasks, even those that nominally require fixation. In particular, this applies to many perceptual learning tasks. We show that perceptual inference or discrimination in the face of positional variance has a structurally different quality from inference about fixed position stimuli, involving a particular, quadratic, non-linearity rather than a purely linear discrimination. We show the advantage taking this non-linearity into account has for discrimination, and suggest it as a role for recurrent connections in area VI, by demonstrating the superior discrimination performance of a recurrent network. We propose that learning the feedforward and recurrent neural connections for these tasks corresponds to the fast and slow components of learning observed in perceptual learning tasks.</p><p>6 0.38472283 <a title="49-lsi-6" href="./nips-2000-Processing_of_Time_Series_by_Neural_Circuits_with_Biologically_Realistic_Synaptic_Dynamics.html">104 nips-2000-Processing of Time Series by Neural Circuits with Biologically Realistic Synaptic Dynamics</a></p>

We show how explaining away in weight space can be accounted for using an extension of a Kalman filter model; provide a new approximate way of looking at the Kalman gain matrix as a whitener for the correlation matrix of the observation process; suggest a network implementation of this whitener using an architecture due to Goodall; and show that the resulting model exhibits backward blocking.</p><p>2 0.49301654 <a title="49-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Processing_of_Time_Series_by_Neural_Circuits_with_Biologically_Realistic_Synaptic_Dynamics.html">104 nips-2000-Processing of Time Series by Neural Circuits with Biologically Realistic Synaptic Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Blaise Agüera y Arcas, Adrienne L. Fairhall, William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we formulate a description of the computation performed by a neuron as a combination of dimensional reduction and nonlinearity. We implement this description for the HodgkinHuxley model, identify the most relevant dimensions and find the nonlinearity. A two dimensional description already captures a significant fraction of the information that spikes carry about dynamic inputs. This description also shows that computation in the Hodgkin-Huxley model is more complex than a simple integrateand-fire or perceptron model. 1</p><p>4 0.48248038 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Propagation_Algorithms_for_Variational_Bayesian_Learning.html">106 nips-2000-Propagation Algorithms for Variational Bayesian Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zoubin Ghahramani, Matthew J. Beal</p><p>Abstract: Variational approximations are becoming a widespread tool for Bayesian learning of graphical models. We provide some theoretical results for the variational updates in a very general family of conjugate-exponential graphical models. We show how the belief propagation and the junction tree algorithms can be used in the inference step of variational Bayesian learning. Applying these results to the Bayesian analysis of linear-Gaussian state-space models we obtain a learning procedure that exploits the Kalman smoothing propagation, while integrating over all model parameters. We demonstrate how this can be used to infer the hidden state dimensionality of the state-space model in a variety of synthetic problems and one real high-dimensional data set. 1</p><p>5 0.47844839 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-Partially_Observable_SDE_Models_for_Image_Sequence_Recognition_Tasks.html">98 nips-2000-Partially Observable SDE Models for Image Sequence Recognition Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Javier R. Movellan, Paul Mineiro, Ruth J. Williams</p><p>Abstract: This paper explores a framework for recognition of image sequences using partially observable stochastic differential equation (SDE) models. Monte-Carlo importance sampling techniques are used for efficient estimation of sequence likelihoods and sequence likelihood gradients. Once the network dynamics are learned, we apply the SDE models to sequence recognition tasks in a manner similar to the way Hidden Markov models (HMMs) are commonly applied. The potential advantage of SDEs over HMMS is the use of continuous state dynamics. We present encouraging results for a video sequence recognition task in which SDE models provided excellent performance when compared to hidden Markov models. 1</p><p>6 0.47232744 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Position_Variance%2C_Recurrence_and_Perceptual_Learning.html">102 nips-2000-Position Variance, Recurrence and Perceptual Learning</a></p>

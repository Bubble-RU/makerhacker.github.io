<h1>100 nips-2000-Permitted and Forbidden Sets in Symmetric Threshold-Linear Networks</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2000-100-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/1793-permitted-and-forbidden-sets-in-symmetric-threshold-linear-networks.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: Ascribing computational principles to neural feedback circuits is an important problem in theoretical neuroscience. We study symmetric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks composed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigenmodes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbidden sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we can provide a formulation of longterm memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed point attractor networks. A Lyapunov-function can be used to prove that a given set of differential equations is convergent. For example, if a neural network possesses a Lyapunov-function, then for almost any initial condition, the outputs of the neurons converge to a stable steady state. In the past, this stability-property was used to construct attractor networks that associatively recall memorized patterns. Lyapunov theory applies mainly to symmetric networks in which neurons have monotonic activation functions [1, 2]. Here we show that the restriction of activation functions to threshold-linear ones is not a mere limitation, but can yield new insights into the computational behavior of recurrent networks (for completeness, see also [3]). We present three main theorems about the neural responses to constant inputs. The first theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the synaptic weight matrix for the existence of a globally asymptotically stable set of fixed points. These conditions can be expressed in terms of copositivity, a concept from quadratic programming and linear complementarity theory. Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of certain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of submatrices of the synaptic weight matrix, making a connection to linear systems theory. The theorem guarantees that the network will produce a steady state response to any constant input. We regard this response as the computational output of the network, and its characterization is the topic of the second and third theorems.

<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computational function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as permitted sets of coactive neurons.

The algorithm identifies the neurons or areas which participate in a cognitive or behavioral task, given data about performance decrease in a small set of lesions. It also allows the accurate prediction of performances due to multi-element lesions. The effectiveness of the new algorithm is demonstrated in two models of recurrent neural networks with complex interactions among the elements. The algorithm is scalable and applicable to the analysis of large neural networks. Given the recent advances in reversible inactivation techniques, it has the potential to significantly contribute to the understanding of the organization of biological nervous systems, and to shed light on the long-lasting debate about local versus distributed computation in the brain.</p><p>4 0.14508711 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2000-Homeostasis_in_a_Silicon_Integrate_and_Fire_Neuron.html">67 nips-2000-Homeostasis in a Silicon Integrate and Fire Neuron</a></p>

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Naftali Tishby</p><p>Abstract: The paradigm of Hebbian learning has recently received a novel interpretation with the discovery of synaptic plasticity that depends on the relative timing of pre and post synaptic spikes. This paper derives a temporally dependent learning rule from the basic principle of mutual information maximization and studies its relation to the experimentally observed plasticity. We find that a supervised spike-dependent learning rule sharing similar structure with the experimentally observed plasticity increases mutual information to a stable near optimal level. Moreover, the analysis reveals how the temporal structure of time-dependent learning rules is determined by the temporal filter applied by neurons over their inputs. These results suggest experimental prediction as to the dependency of the learning rule on neuronal biophysical parameters 1</p><p>6 0.13016206 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2000-Processing_of_Time_Series_by_Neural_Circuits_with_Biologically_Realistic_Synaptic_Dynamics.html">104 nips-2000-Processing of Time Series by Neural Circuits with Biologically Realistic Synaptic Dynamics</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver B. Downs</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has exploited boundedness of data in the unsupervised learning of new types of generative model. For nonnegative data it was recently shown that the maximum-entropy generative model is a Nonnegative Boltzmann Distribution not a Gaussian distribution, when the model is constrained to match the first and second order statistics of the data. Learning for practical sized problems is made difficult by the need to compute expectations under the model distribution. The computational cost of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and low fidelity of naive mean field techniques has led to increasing interest in advanced mean field theories and variational methods.

<p>Author: Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: Ascribing computational principles to neural feedback circuits is an important problem in theoretical neuroscience. We study symmetric threshold-linear networks and derive stability results that go beyond the insights that can be gained from Lyapunov theory or energy functions. By applying linear analysis to subnetworks composed of coactive neurons, we determine the stability of potential steady states. We find that stability depends on two types of eigenmodes. One type determines global stability and the other type determines whether or not multistability is possible. We can prove the equivalence of our stability criteria with criteria taken from quadratic programming. Also, we show that there are permitted sets of neurons that can be coactive at a steady state and forbidden sets that cannot. Permitted sets are clustered in the sense that subsets of permitted sets are permitted and supersets of forbidden sets are forbidden. By viewing permitted sets as memories stored in the synaptic connections, we can provide a formulation of longterm memory that is more general than the traditional perspective of fixed point attractor networks. A Lyapunov-function can be used to prove that a given set of differential equations is convergent. For example, if a neural network possesses a Lyapunov-function, then for almost any initial condition, the outputs of the neurons converge to a stable steady state. In the past, this stability-property was used to construct attractor networks that associatively recall memorized patterns. Lyapunov theory applies mainly to symmetric networks in which neurons have monotonic activation functions [1, 2]. Here we show that the restriction of activation functions to threshold-linear ones is not a mere limitation, but can yield new insights into the computational behavior of recurrent networks (for completeness, see also [3]). We present three main theorems about the neural responses to constant inputs. The first theorem provides necessary and sufficient conditions on the synaptic weight matrix for the existence of a globally asymptotically stable set of fixed points. These conditions can be expressed in terms of copositivity, a concept from quadratic programming and linear complementarity theory. Alternatively, they can be expressed in terms of certain eigenvalues and eigenvectors of submatrices of the synaptic weight matrix, making a connection to linear systems theory. The theorem guarantees that the network will produce a steady state response to any constant input. We regard this response as the computational output of the network, and its characterization is the topic of the second and third theorems. In the second theorem, we introduce the idea of permitted and forbidden sets. Under certain conditions on the synaptic weight matrix, we show that there exist sets of neurons that are</p><p>2 0.61724561 <a title="100-lda-2" href="./nips-2000-Learning_Winner-take-all_Competition_Between_Groups_of_Neurons_in_Lateral_Inhibitory_Networks.html">81 nips-2000-Learning Winner-take-all Competition Between Groups of Neurons in Lateral Inhibitory Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaohui Xie, Richard H. R. Hahnloser, H. Sebastian Seung</p><p>Abstract: It has long been known that lateral inhibition in neural networks can lead to a winner-take-all competition, so that only a single neuron is active at a steady state. Here we show how to organize lateral inhibition so that groups of neurons compete to be active. Given a collection of potentially overlapping groups, the inhibitory connectivity is set by a formula that can be interpreted as arising from a simple learning rule. Our analysis demonstrates that such inhibition generally results in winner-take-all competition between the given groups, with the exception of some degenerate cases. In a broader context, the network serves as a particular illustration of the general distinction between permitted and forbidden sets, which was introduced recently. From this viewpoint, the computational function of our network is to store and retrieve memories as permitted sets of coactive neurons. In traditional winner-take-all networks, lateral inhibition is used to enforce a localized, or</p><p>3 0.60268241 <a title="100-lda-3" href="./nips-2000-Computing_with_Finite_and_Infinite_Networks.html">35 nips-2000-Computing with Finite and Infinite Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: Using statistical mechanics results, I calculate learning curves (average generalization error) for Gaussian processes (GPs) and Bayesian neural networks (NNs) used for regression. Applying the results to learning a teacher defined by a two-layer network, I can directly compare GP and Bayesian NN learning. I find that a GP in general requires CJ (d S )-training examples to learn input features of order s (d is the input dimension), whereas a NN can learn the task with order the number of adjustable weights training examples. Since a GP can be considered as an infinite NN, the results show that even in the Bayesian approach, it is important to limit the complexity of the learning machine. The theoretical findings are confirmed in simulations with analytical GP learning and a NN mean field algorithm.</p><p>4 0.51930082 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./nips-2000-Regularized_Winnow_Methods.html">111 nips-2000-Regularized Winnow Methods</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In theory, the Winnow multiplicative update has certain advantages over the Perceptron additive update when there are many irrelevant attributes. Recently, there has been much effort on enhancing the Perceptron algorithm by using regularization, leading to a class of linear classification methods called support vector machines. Similarly, it is also possible to apply the regularization idea to the Winnow algorithm, which gives methods we call regularized Winnows. We show that the resulting methods compare with the basic Winnows in a similar way that a support vector machine compares with the Perceptron. We investigate algorithmic issues and learning properties of the derived methods. Some experimental results will also be provided to illustrate different methods.</p><p>5 0.38864744 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./nips-2000-A_New_Approximate_Maximal_Margin_Classification_Algorithm.html">7 nips-2000-A New Approximate Maximal Margin Classification Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: A new incremental learning algorithm is described which approximates the maximal margin hyperplane w.r.t. norm p ~ 2 for a set of linearly separable data. Our algorithm, called ALMAp (Approximate Large Margin algorithm w.r.t. norm p), takes 0 ((P~21;;2) corrections to separate the data with p-norm margin larger than (1 - 0:) ,,(, where,,( is the p-norm margin of the data and X is a bound on the p-norm of the instances. ALMAp avoids quadratic (or higher-order) programming methods. It is very easy to implement and is as fast as on-line algorithms, such as Rosenblatt's perceptron. We report on some experiments comparing ALMAp to two incremental algorithms: Perceptron and Li and Long's ROMMA. Our algorithm seems to perform quite better than both. The accuracy levels achieved by ALMAp are slightly inferior to those obtained by Support vector Machines (SVMs). On the other hand, ALMAp is quite faster and easier to implement than standard SVMs training algorithms.</p><p>6 0.38803208 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./nips-2000-Occam%27s_Razor.html">92 nips-2000-Occam's Razor</a></p>

</p><p>6 We also discuss implications of these results for the understanding the inherent complexity of large-scale learning and estimation problems. [sent-14, score-0.23]
</p><p>7 For such problems, understanding the computational complexity of convex optimization is a key issue. [sent-17, score-0.496]
</p><p>8 A large body of literature is devoted to obtaining rates of convergence of speciﬁc procedures for various classes of convex optimization problems. [sent-18, score-0.369]
</p><p>9 Such analyses have been performed for many standard optimization alogrithms, among them gradient descent, mirror descent, interior point programming, and stochastic gradient descent, to name a few. [sent-20, score-0.346]
</p><p>10 We refer the reader to standard texts on optimization (e. [sent-21, score-0.188]
</p><p>11 On the other hand, there has been relatively little study of the inherent complexity of convex optimization problems. [sent-24, score-0.502]
</p><p>12 One obstacle to a classical complexity-theoretic analysis, as the authors observed, was that of casting convex optimization problems in a Turing Machine model. [sent-26, score-0.369]
</p><p>13 They avoided this problem by instead considering a natural oracle model of complexity in which at every round, the optimization procedure queries an oracle for certain information on the function being optimized. [sent-27, score-1.381]
</p><p>14 Working within this framework, the authors obtained a series of lower bounds on the computational complexity of convex optimization 1  problems. [sent-28, score-0.639]
</p><p>15 In this paper, we consider the computational complexity of stochastic convex optimization in the oracle model. [sent-30, score-1.09]
</p><p>16 First, our lower bounds have an improved dependence on the dimension of the space. [sent-33, score-0.274]
</p><p>17 In the context of statistical estimation, these bounds show how the difﬁculty of the estimation problem increases with the number of parameters. [sent-34, score-0.17]
</p><p>18 For instance, they show that the optimal oracle complexity of statistical estimation with quadratic loss is signiﬁcantly smaller than the corresponding complexity with absolute loss. [sent-36, score-0.818]
</p><p>19 Our proofs exploit a new notion of the discrepancy between two functions that appears to be natural for optimization problems. [sent-37, score-0.315]
</p><p>20 They are based on a reduction from a statistical parameter estimation problem to the stochastic optimization problem, and an application of information-theoretic lower bounds for the estimation problem. [sent-38, score-0.533]
</p><p>21 2  Background and problem formulation  In this section, we introduce background on the oracle model of complexity for convex optimization, and then deﬁne the oracles considered in this paper. [sent-39, score-1.001]
</p><p>22 1  Convex optimization in the oracle model  Convex optimization is the task of minimizing a convex function f over a convex set S ⊆ Rd . [sent-41, score-1.274]
</p><p>23 Our primary focus in this paper is the following question: given any class of convex functions F, what is the minimum computational labor any such optimization method would expend for any function in F? [sent-44, score-0.488]
</p><p>24 In order to address this question, we follow the approach of Nemirovski and Yudin [8], based on the oracle model of optimization. [sent-45, score-0.536]
</p><p>25 More precisely, an oracle is a (possibly random) function φ : S → I that answers any query x ∈ S by returning an element φ(x) in an information set I. [sent-46, score-0.658]
</p><p>26 The information set varies depending on the oracle; for instance, for an exact oracle of k th order, the answer to a query xt consists of f (xt ) and the ﬁrst k derivatives of f at xt . [sent-47, score-1.003]
</p><p>27 For the case of stochastic oracles studied in this paper, these values are corrupted with zero-mean noise with bounded variance. [sent-48, score-0.31]
</p><p>28 Given some number of rounds T , an optimization method M designed to approximately minimize the convex function f over the convex set S proceeds as follows: at any given round t = 1, T , the method M queries at xt ∈ S, and the oracle reveals the information φ(xt , f ). [sent-49, score-1.449]
</p><p>29 For a given oracle function φ, let MT denote the class of all optimization methods M that make T queries according to the procedure outlined above. [sent-51, score-0.814]
</p><p>30 For any method M ∈ MT , we deﬁne its error on function f after T steps as (M, f, S, φ) := f (xT ) − inf f (x) = f (xT ) − f (x∗ ), (1) f x∈S  where xT is the method’s query at time T . [sent-52, score-0.169]
</p><p>31 2  Minimax error  When the oracle is stochastic, the method’s query xT at time T is itself random, since it depends on the random answers provided by the oracle. [sent-55, score-0.687]
</p><p>32 In this case, the optimization error (M, f, S, φ) is also a random variable. [sent-56, score-0.167]
</p><p>33 Accordingly, for the case of stochastic oracles, we measure the accuracy in terms of the expected value Eφ [ (M, f, S, φ)], where the expectation is taken over the oracle randomness. [sent-57, score-0.626]
</p><p>34 Given a class of functions F, and the class MT of optimization methods making T oracle queries, we can deﬁne the minimax error ∗  (F, S, φ) :=  inf  sup Eφ [ (MT , f, S, φ)]. [sent-58, score-1.182]
</p><p>35 It is worth noting that oracle complexity measures only the number of queries to the oracle—for instance, the number of (approximate) function or gradient evaluations. [sent-63, score-0.766]
</p><p>36 However, it does not track computational cost within each component of the oracle query (e. [sent-64, score-0.609]
</p><p>37 Recall that a subgradient of a convex function f is any vector v ∈ Rd such that f (y) ≥ f (x) + v (y − x). [sent-74, score-0.261]
</p><p>38 For a convex set S, the radius of the largest inscribed ∞ ball is denoted as r∞ . [sent-82, score-0.373]
</p><p>39 For a convex function f , its minimizer over a set S will be denoted as x∗ when S is obvious from f context. [sent-83, score-0.231]
</p><p>40 3  Main results and their consequences  With the setup of stochastic convex optimization in place, we are now in a position to state the main results of this paper. [sent-88, score-0.459]
</p><p>41 In particular, we provide some tight lower bounds on the complexity of stochastic oracle optimization. [sent-89, score-0.98]
</p><p>42 We begin by analyzing the minimax oracle complexity of optimization for the class of convex Lipschitz functions. [sent-90, score-1.217]
</p><p>43 Recall that a function f : Rd → R is convex if for all x, y ∈ Rd and λ ∈ (0, 1), we have the inequality f (λx + (1 − λ)y) ≤ λf (x) + (1 − λ)f (y). [sent-91, score-0.231]
</p><p>44 Before stating the results, we note that scaling the Lipschitz constant scales minimax optimization error linearly. [sent-93, score-0.349]
</p><p>45 Let F C be the class of all bounded convex 1-Lipschitz functions on Rd . [sent-97, score-0.431]
</p><p>46 T  (5)  Remarks: This lower bound is tight in the minimax sense, since the method of stochastic gradient descent attains a matching upper bound for all stochastic ﬁrst order oracles for any convex set S (see Chapter 5 of NY [8]). [sent-99, score-1.136]
</p><p>47 Also, even though this lower bound requires the oracle to have only bounded variance, we will use an oracle based on Bernoulli random variables, which has all moments bounded. [sent-100, score-1.336]
</p><p>48 The above lower bound is obtained by considering the worst case over all convex sets. [sent-103, score-0.366]
</p><p>49 However, we expect optimization over a smaller convex set to be easier than over a large set. [sent-104, score-0.398]
</p><p>50 Let F C be the class of all bounded convex 1-Lipschitz functions on Rd . [sent-107, score-0.431]
</p><p>51 Let S be a convex set such that it contains an ∞ ball of radius r∞ and is contained in an ∞ ball of radius R∞ . [sent-108, score-0.558]
</p><p>52 This lower bound for the case of the 2 ball is indeed tight, and is recovered by the stochastic gradient descent algorithm [8]. [sent-114, score-0.406]
</p><p>53 Just as optimization over simpler sets gets easier, optimization over simple function classes should be easier too. [sent-115, score-0.305]
</p><p>54 A natural function class that has been studied extensively in the context of better upper bounds is that of strongly convex functions. [sent-116, score-0.501]
</p><p>55 For any given norm · on S, a function f is strongly convex with coefﬁcient κ means that f (x) ≥ f (y) + f (y)T (x − y) + κ x − y 2 for all x, y ∈ S. [sent-117, score-0.287]
</p><p>56 2 For this class of functions, we obtain a smaller lower bound on the minimax oracle complexity of optimization. [sent-118, score-0.983]
</p><p>57 Let F S be the class of all bounded strongly convex and 1-Lipschitz functions on Rd . [sent-120, score-0.487]
</p><p>58 T  (7)  Once again there is a matching upper bound using stochastic gradient descent for example, when the strong convexity is with respect to the 2 norm. [sent-122, score-0.304]
</p><p>59 Let F S be the class of all bounded convex 1-Lipschitz functions on Rd . [sent-125, score-0.431]
</p><p>60 Let S be a convex set such that it contains an ∞ ball of radius r∞ . [sent-126, score-0.373]
</p><p>61 ∞ 1 In comparison, Nemirovski and Yudin [8] obtained a lower bound scaling as Ω √T for the class F C . [sent-128, score-0.199]
</p><p>62 Their bound applies only to the class F C , and does not provide any dimension dependence, as opposed to the bounds provided here. [sent-129, score-0.275]
</p><p>63 Obtaining the correct dependence yields tight minimax results, and allows us to highlight the dependence of bounds on the geometry of the set S. [sent-130, score-0.458]
</p><p>64 We characterize the hardness of optimization in terms of a relatively easy to compute complexity measure. [sent-132, score-0.276]
</p><p>65 As a result, our technique provides tight lower bounds for smaller function classes like strongly convex functions rather easily. [sent-133, score-0.601]
</p><p>66 If the distribution were known, this is exactly the problem of computing the -accurate optimizer of a convex function, assuming the function class F is convex. [sent-137, score-0.295]
</p><p>67 If indeed the computational model of the estimator were restricted to querying these values and gradients, then the lower bounds in the previous sections would apply. [sent-142, score-0.217]
</p><p>68 Our bounds, then allow us to deduce the oracle complexity of statistical estimation problems in this realistic model. [sent-143, score-0.734]
</p><p>69 In particular, a case of interest is when we ﬁx a convex loss function and consider the worst oracle complexity over all possible distributions under which expectation is taken. [sent-144, score-0.889]
</p><p>70 From our bounds, it is straightforward to deduce: • For the absolute loss (f (x), y) = |f (x) − y|, the oracle complexity of -accurate estimation over all possible distributions is Ω d/ 2 . [sent-145, score-0.723]
</p><p>71 • For the quadratic loss (f (x), y) = (f (x) − y)2 , the oracle complexity of -accurate estimation over all possible distributions is Ω (d/ ). [sent-146, score-0.723]
</p><p>72 In contrast, our results provide algorithm-independent lower bounds on the complexity of statistical estimation within the oracle model. [sent-149, score-0.871]
</p><p>73 An interesting direction for future work is to broader the oracle model so as to more accurately reﬂect the computational trade-offs in learning and estimation problems, for instance by allowing a method to pay a higher price to query an oracle with lower variance. [sent-150, score-1.28]
</p><p>74 1  High-level outline  Our main idea is to embed the problem of estimating the parameter of a Bernoulli vector (alternatively, the biases of d coins) into a convex optimization problem. [sent-153, score-0.424]
</p><p>75 For any given function class, we then construct a “difﬁcult” subclass of functions parameterized by these hypercube vertices. [sent-155, score-0.337]
</p><p>76 We then show that being able to optimize any function in this subclass requires estimating its hypercube vertex, that is, the corresponding biases of the d coins. [sent-156, score-0.282]
</p><p>77 But the only information for this estimation would be from the coin toss outcomes revealed by the oracle in T queries. [sent-157, score-0.865]
</p><p>78 With this set-up, we are able to apply the Fano lower bound for statistical estimation, as has been done in past work on nonparametric estimation (e. [sent-158, score-0.2]
</p><p>79 Our ﬁrst step is to construct a subclass of functions G ⊆ F that we use to derive lower bounds. [sent-163, score-0.317]
</p><p>80 i=1  5  (8)  In our proofs, the subclasses Gbase and G(δ) are chosen such that G(δ) ⊆ F, the functions fi+ , fi− are bounded over the convex set S with a Lipschitz constant independent of dimension d, and the minimizers xβ of gβ over Rd are contained in S for all β ∈ V. [sent-173, score-0.515]
</p><p>81 In this step, we show that if a method can optimize over the subclass G(δ) up to a certain tolerance ψ(G(δ)), then it must be capable of identifying which function gα ∈ G(δ) was chosen. [sent-176, score-0.196]
</p><p>82 Given a convex set S ⊆ Rd and two f functions f, g, we deﬁne ρ(f, g) = inf f (x) + g(x) − f (x∗ ) − g(x∗ ) . [sent-179, score-0.353]
</p><p>83 g f Given the subclass G(δ), we quantify how densely it is packed with respect to the semimetric ρ using the quantity ψ(G(δ)) = min ρ(gα , gβ ), (10) α=β∈V  which we also denote by ψ(δ) when the class G is clear from the context. [sent-181, score-0.228]
</p><p>84 β  Suppose that we choose some function gα∗ ∈ G(δ), and some method MT is allowed to make T queries to an oracle with information function φ(·, gα∗ ). [sent-190, score-0.612]
</p><p>85 Recall the deﬁnition (2) of the minimax error in optimization: Lemma 2. [sent-192, score-0.182]
</p><p>86 Suppose that some method MT has minimax optimization error upper bounded as ψ(δ) . [sent-193, score-0.446]
</p><p>87 Given a method MT that satisﬁes the bound (11), we construct an estimator α(MT ) of the true vertex α∗ as follows. [sent-196, score-0.209]
</p><p>88 We have thus shown that having a low minimax optimization error over G(δ) implies that the vertex α ∈ V can be identiﬁed. [sent-202, score-0.394]
</p><p>89 We now demonstrate a stochastic ﬁrst order oracle φ for which the samples {φ(x1 , gα ), . [sent-205, score-0.626]
</p><p>90 In particular, we associate a coin with each dimension i ∈ {1, 2, . [sent-209, score-0.204]
</p><p>91 , 1/2 + αd δ) | α ∈ V ,  (12)  Given a particular function gα ∈ G(δ) (or equivalently, vertex α ∈ V), we consider the oracle φ that presents noisy value and gradient samples from gα according to the following prescription: • Pick an index it ∈ {1, . [sent-215, score-0.669]
</p><p>92 t t By construction, the function value and gradient samples are unbiased estimates of those of gα ; moreover, the variance of the effective “noise” is bounded independently of d as long as the Lipschitz constant is independent of d since the function values and gradients are bounded on S. [sent-221, score-0.321]
</p><p>93 Step IV: Lower bounds on coin-tossing Finally, we use information-theoretic methods to lower bound the probability of correctly estimating the true vertex α∗ ∈ V in our model. [sent-222, score-0.314]
</p><p>94 Given an arbitrary vertex α∗ ∈ V, suppose that we toss a set of d coins with bias 1 ∗ ∗ θ∗ = ( 2 + α1 δ, . [sent-224, score-0.197]
</p><p>95 , 1 + α2 δ) a total of T times, but that the outcome of only one coin chosen 2 uniformly at random is revealed at every round. [sent-227, score-0.218]
</p><p>96 , d} be the variable indicating the coin revealed at time T , and let Xt ∈ {0, 1} denote its outcome. [sent-234, score-0.218]
</p><p>97 7  Proof of Theorem 1: By the construction of our oracle, it is clear that, at each round, only one coin is revealed to the method MT . [sent-247, score-0.218]
</p><p>98 (14)  In order to obtain an upper bound on P[α(MT ) = α] using Lemma 2, we need to identify the subclass Gbase of F C . [sent-249, score-0.274]
</p><p>99 Further, if the set is contained in a ball of radius 1 R∞ , then we need to scale the function with R∞ to keep the function values bounded. [sent-266, score-0.185]
</p><p>100 The reader might suspect that the dimension dependence in our lower bound for strongly convex functions is not tight, due to the dependence of κ on the dimension d. [sent-278, score-0.725]

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We study minimax rates for estimating high-dimensional nonparametric regression models with sparse additive structure and smoothness constraints. More precisely, our goal is to estimate a function f ∗ : Rp → R that has an additive decomposition of the form ∗ ∗ f ∗ (X1 , . . . , Xp ) = j∈S hj (Xj ), where each component function hj lies in some class H of “smooth” functions, and S ⊂ {1, . . . , p} is an unknown subset with cardinality s = |S|. Given n i.i.d. observations of f ∗ (X) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise where the covariate vectors (X1 , X2 , X3 , ..., Xp ) are drawn with i.i.d. components from some distribution P, we determine lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the regression function with respect to squared-L2 (P) error. Our main result is a lower bound on the minimax rate that scales as max s log(p/s) , s ǫ2 (H) . The ﬁrst term reﬂects the sample size required for n n performing subset selection, and is independent of the function class H. The second term s ǫ2 (H) is an s-dimensional estimation term corresponding to the sample size required for n estimating a sum of s univariate functions, each chosen from the function class H. It depends linearly on the sparsity index s but is independent of the global dimension p. As a special case, if H corresponds to functions that are m-times differentiable (an mth -order Sobolev space), then the s-dimensional estimation term takes the form sǫ2 (H) ≍ s n−2m/(2m+1) . Either of n the two terms may be dominant in different regimes, depending on the relation between the sparsity and smoothness of the additive decomposition.</p><p>4 0.14440435 <a title="116-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Thresholding_Procedures_for_High_Dimensional_Variable_Selection_and_Statistical_Estimation.html">245 nips-2009-Thresholding Procedures for High Dimensional Variable Selection and Statistical Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n ≪ p, we show that the multistep thresholding procedure can accurately estimate a sparse vector β ∈ Rp in a linear model, under the restricted eigenvalue conditions (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09). Thus our conditions for model selection consistency are considerably weaker than what has been achieved in previous works. More importantly, this method allows very signiﬁcant values of s, which is the number of non-zero elements in the true parameter. For example, it works for cases where the ordinary Lasso would have failed. Finally, we show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufﬁciently sparse, the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand` se Tao 07) achieves the ℓ2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level, while selecting a sufﬁciently sparse model. 1</p><p>5 0.13919339 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Data-driven_calibration_of_linear_estimators_with_minimal_penalties.html">64 nips-2009-Data-driven calibration of linear estimators with minimal penalties</a></p>
<p>Author: Sylvain Arlot, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of selecting among several linear estimators in non-parametric regression; this includes model selection for linear regression, the choice of a regularization parameter in kernel ridge regression or spline smoothing, and the choice of a kernel in multiple kernel learning. We propose a new algorithm which ﬁrst estimates consistently the variance of the noise, based upon the concept of minimal penalty which was previously introduced in the context of model selection. Then, plugging our variance estimate in Mallows’ CL penalty is proved to lead to an algorithm satisfying an oracle inequality. Simulation experiments with kernel ridge regression and multiple kernel learning show that the proposed algorithm often improves signiﬁcantly existing calibration procedures such as 10-fold cross-validation or generalized cross-validation. 1</p><p>6 0.12970157 <a title="116-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-On_Stochastic_and_Worst-case_Models_for_Investing.html">178 nips-2009-On Stochastic and Worst-case Models for Investing</a></p>

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We study minimax rates for estimating high-dimensional nonparametric regression models with sparse additive structure and smoothness constraints. More precisely, our goal is to estimate a function f ∗ : Rp → R that has an additive decomposition of the form ∗ ∗ f ∗ (X1 , . . . , Xp ) = j∈S hj (Xj ), where each component function hj lies in some class H of “smooth” functions, and S ⊂ {1, . . . , p} is an unknown subset with cardinality s = |S|. Given n i.i.d. observations of f ∗ (X) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise where the covariate vectors (X1 , X2 , X3 , ..., Xp ) are drawn with i.i.d. components from some distribution P, we determine lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the regression function with respect to squared-L2 (P) error. Our main result is a lower bound on the minimax rate that scales as max s log(p/s) , s ǫ2 (H) . The ﬁrst term reﬂects the sample size required for n n performing subset selection, and is independent of the function class H.

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>5 0.58897114 <a title="116-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Thresholding_Procedures_for_High_Dimensional_Variable_Selection_and_Statistical_Estimation.html">245 nips-2009-Thresholding Procedures for High Dimensional Variable Selection and Statistical Estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Chenghui Cai, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental objective in reinforcement learning is the maintenance of a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. This problem becomes more challenging when the agent can only partially observe the states of its environment. In this paper we propose a dual-policy method for jointly learning the agent behavior and the balance between exploration exploitation, in partially observable environments. The method subsumes traditional exploration, in which the agent takes actions to gather information about the environment, and active learning, in which the agent queries an oracle for optimal actions (with an associated cost for employing the oracle). The form of the employed exploration is dictated by the speciﬁc problem. Theoretical guarantees are provided concerning the optimality of the balancing of exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experimental results on benchmark problems.</p><p>3 0.86692548 <a title="116-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Dual_Averaging_Method_for_Regularized_Stochastic_Learning_and_Online_Optimization.html">73 nips-2009-Dual Averaging Method for Regularized Stochastic Learning and Online Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as â&bdquo;&ldquo;1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop a new online algorithm, the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can explicitly exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. In particular, at each iteration, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple optimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss functions and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. Computational experiments show that the RDA method can be very effective for sparse online learning with â&bdquo;&ldquo;1 -regularization. 1</p><p>4 0.81799847 <a title="116-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Quantification_and_the_language_of_thought.html">196 nips-2009-Quantification and the language of thought</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Kemp</p><p>Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that the psychological complexity of a concept is related to the length of its representation in a language of thought. As yet, however, there are few concrete proposals about the nature of this language. This paper makes one such proposal: the language of thought allows ﬁrst order quantiﬁcation (quantiﬁcation over objects) more readily than second-order quantiﬁcation (quantiﬁcation over features). To support this proposal we present behavioral results from a concept learning study inspired by the work of Shepard, Hovland and Jenkins. Humans can learn and think about many kinds of concepts, including natural kinds such as elephant and water and nominal kinds such as grandmother and prime number. Understanding the mental representations that support these abilities is a central challenge for cognitive science. This paper proposes that quantiﬁcation plays a role in conceptual representation—for example, an animal X qualiﬁes as a predator if there is some animal Y such that X hunts Y . The concepts we consider are much simpler than real-world examples such as predator, but even simple laboratory studies can provide important clues about the nature of mental representation. Our approach to mental representation is based on the language of thought hypothesis [1]. As pursued here, the hypothesis proposes that mental representations are constructed in a compositional language of some kind, and that the psychological complexity of a concept is closely related to the length of its representation in this language [2, 3, 4]. Following previous researchers [2, 4], we operationalize the psychological complexity of a concept in terms of the ease with which it is learned and remembered. Given these working assumptions, the remaining challenge is to specify the representational resources provided by the language of thought. Some previous studies have relied on propositional logic as a representation language [2, 5], but we believe that the resources of predicate logic are needed to capture the structure of many human concepts. In particular, we suggest that the language of thought can accommodate relations, functions, and quantiﬁcation, and focus here on the role of quantiﬁcation. Our primary proposal is that quantiﬁcation is supported by the language of thought, but that quantiﬁcation over objects is psychologically more natural than quantiﬁcation over features. To test this idea we compare concept learning in two domains which are very similar except for one critical difference: one domain allows quantiﬁcation over objects, and the other allows quantiﬁcation over features. We consider several logical languages that can be used to formulate concepts in both domains, and ﬁnd that learning times are best predicted by a language that supports quantiﬁcation over objects but not features. Our work illustrates how theories of mental representation can be informed by comparing concept learning across two or more domains. Existing studies work with a range of domains, and it is useful to consider a “conceptual universe” that includes these possibilities along with many others that have not yet been studied. Table 1 charts a small fragment of this universe, and the penultimate column shows example stimuli that will be familiar from previous studies of concept learning. Previous studies have made important contributions by choosing a single domain in Table 1 and explaining 1 why some concepts within this domain are easier to learn than others [2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Comparisons across domains can also provide important information about learning and mental representation, and we illustrate this claim by comparing learning times across Domains 3 and 4. The next section introduces the conceptual universe in Table 1 in more detail. We then present a formal approach to concept learning that relies on a logical language and compare three candidate languages. Language OQ (for object quantiﬁcation) supports quantiﬁcation over objects but not features, language F Q (for feature quantiﬁcation) supports quantiﬁcation over features but not objects, and language OQ + F Q supports quantiﬁcation over both objects and features. We use these languages to predict learning times across Domains 3 and 4, and present an experiment which suggests that language OQ comes closest to the language of thought. 1 The conceptual universe Table 1 provides an organizing framework for thinking about the many domains in which learning can occur. The table includes 8 domains, each of which is deﬁned by specifying some number of objects, features, and relations, and by specifying the range of each feature and each relation. We refer to the elements in each domain as items, and the penultimate column of Table 1 shows items from each domain. The ﬁrst row shows a domain commonly used by studies of Boolean concept learning. Each item in this domain includes a single object a and speciﬁes whether that object has value v1 (small) or v2 (large) on feature F (size), value v3 (white) or v4 (gray) on feature G (color), and value v5 (vertical) or v6 (horizontal) on feature H (texture). Domain 2 also includes three features, but now each item includes three objects and each feature applies to only one of the objects. For example, feature H (texture) applies to only the third object in the domain (i.e. the third square on each card). Domain 3 is similar to Domain 1, but now the three features can be aligned— for any given item each feature will be absent (value 0) or present. The example in Table 1 uses three features (boundary, dots, and slash) that can each be added to an unadorned gray square. Domain 4 is similar to Domain 2, but again the feature values can be aligned, and the feature for each object will be absent (value 0) or present. Domains 5 and 6 are similar to domains 2 and 4 respectively, but each one includes relations rather than features. In Domain 6, for example, the relation R assigns value 0 (absent) or value 1 (present) to each undirected pair of objects. The ﬁrst six domains in Table 1 are all variants of Domain 1, which is the domain typically used by studies of Boolean concept learning. Focusing on six related domains helps to establish some of the dimensions along which domains can differ, but the ﬁnal two domains in Table 1 show some of the many alternative possibilities. Domain 7 includes two categorical features, each of which takes three rather than two values. Domain 8 is similar to Domain 6, but now the number of objects is 6 rather than 3 and relation R is directed rather than undirected. To mention just a handful of possibilities which do not appear in Table 1, domains may also have categorical features that are ordered (e.g. a size feature that takes values small, medium, and large), continuous valued features or relations, relations with more than two places, and objects that contain sub-objects or parts. Several learning problems can be formulated within any given domain. The most basic is to learn a single item—for example, a single item from Domain 8 [4]. A second problem is to learn a class of items—for example, a class that includes four of the items in Domain 1 and excludes the remaining four [6]. Learning an item class can be formalized as learning a unary predicate deﬁned over items, and a natural extension is to consider predicates with two or more arguments. For example, problems of the form A is to B as C is to ? can be formulated as problems where the task is to learn a binary relation analogous(·, ·) given the single example analogous(A, B). Here, however, we focus on the task of learning item classes or unary predicates. Since we focus on the role of quantiﬁcation, we will work with domains where quantiﬁcation is appropriate. Quantiﬁcation over objects is natural in cases like Domain 4 where the feature values for all objects can be aligned. Note, for example, that the statement “every object has its feature” picks out the ﬁnal example item in Domain 4 but that no such statement is possible in Domain 2. Quantiﬁcation over features is natural in cases like Domain 3 where the ranges of each feature can be aligned. For example, “object a has all three features” picks out the ﬁnal example item in Domain 3 but no such statement is possible in Domain 1. We therefore focus on Domains 3 and 4, and explore the problem of learning item classes in each domain. 2 3 {a} {a, b, c} {a} {a, b, c} {a, b, c} {a, b, c} {a} {a, b, c, d, e, f } 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 R : O × O → {0, 1} — F : O → {v1 , v2 , v3 } G : O → {v4 , v5 , v6 } — R : O × O → {0, 1} R : (a, b) → {v1 , v2 } S : (a, c) → {v3 , v4 } T : (b, c) → {v5 , v6 } — — — — Relations — — Domain speciﬁcation Features F : O → {v1 , v2 } G : O → {v3 , v4 } H : O → {v5 , v6 } F : a → {v1 , v2 } G : b → {v3 , v4 } H : c → {v5 , v6 } F : O → {0, v1 } G : O → {0, v2 } H : O → {0, v3 } F : a → {0, v1 } G : b → {0, v2 } H : c → {0, v3 } , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ... , ... , Example Items , , , , , , , , , , , , , ... , [4] [8, 9] [13] [6] [12] [6] [2, 6, 7, 10, 11] Ref. Table 1: The conceptual universe. Eight domains are shown, and each one is deﬁned by a set of objects, a set of features, and a set of relations. We call the members of each domain items, and an item is created by specifying the extension of each feature and relation in the domain. The six domains above the double lines are closely related to the work of Shepard et al. [6]. Each one includes eight items which differ along three dimensions. These dimensions, however, emerge from different underlying representations in the six cases. Objects O # (a) (b) 1 (I) 2 (II) 3 (III) 4 (III) 5 (IV) 6 (IV) 7 (V) 8 (V) 9 (V) 10 (VI) 111 110 101 011 100 010 001 000 Figure 1: (a) A stimulus lattice for domains (e.g. Domains 3, 4, and 6) that can be encoded as a triple of binary values where 0 represents “absent” and 1 represents “present.” (b) If the order of the values in the triple is not signiﬁcant, there are 10 distinct ways to partition the lattice into two classes of four items. The SHJ type for each partition is shown in parentheses. Domains 3 and 4 both include 8 items each and we will consider classes that include exactly four of these items. Each item in these domains can be represented as a triple of binary values, where 0 indicates that a feature is absent and value 1 indicates that a feature is present. Each triple represents the values of the three features (Domain 3) or the feature values for the three objects (Domain 4). By representing each domain in this way, we have effectively adopted domain speciﬁcations that are simpliﬁcations of those shown in Table 1. Domain 3 is represented using three features of the form F, G, H : O → {0, 1}, and Domain 4 is represented using a single feature of the form F : O → {0, 1}. Simpliﬁcations of this kind are possible because the features in each domain can be aligned—notice that no corresponding simpliﬁcations are possible for Domains 1 and 2. The eight binary triples in each domain can be organized into the lattice shown in Figure 1a. Here we consider all ways to partition the vertices of the lattice into two groups of four. If partitions that differ only up to a permutation of the features (Domain 3) or objects (Domain 4) are grouped into equivalence classes, there are ten of these classes, and a representative of each is shown in Figure 1b. Previous researchers [6] have pointed out that the stimuli in Domain 1 can be organized into a cube similar to Figure 1a, and that there are six ways to partition these stimuli into two groups of four up to permutations of the features and permutations of the range of each feature. We refer to these equivalence classes as the six Shepard-Hovland-Jenkins types (or SHJ types), and each partition in Figure 1b is labeled with its corresponding SHJ type label. Note, for example, that partitions 3 and 4 are both examples of SHJ type III. For us, partitions 3 and 4 are distinct since items 000 (all absent) and 111 (all present) are uniquely identiﬁable, and partition 3 assigns these items to different classes but partition 4 does not. Previous researchers have considered differences between some of the ﬁrst six domains in Table 1. Shepard et al. [6] ran experiments using compact stimuli (Domain 1) and distributed stimuli (Domains 2 and 4), and observed the same difﬁculty ranking of the six SHJ types in all cases. Their work, however, does not acknowledge that Domain 4 leads to 10 distinct types rather than 6, and therefore fails to address issues such as the relative complexities of concepts 5 and 6 in Figure 1. Social psychologists [13, 14] have studied Domain 6 and found that learning patterns depart from the standard SHJ order—in particular, that SHJ type VI (Concept 10 in Figure 1) is simpler than types III, IV and V. This ﬁnding has been used to support the claim that social learning relies on a domain-speciﬁc principle of structural balance [14]. We will see, however, that the relative simplicity of type VI in domains like 4 and 6 is consistent with a domain-general account based on representational economy. 2 A representation length approach to concept learning The conceptual universe in Table 1 calls for an account of learning that can apply across many domains. One candidate is the representation length approach, which proposes that concepts are mentally represented in a language of thought, and that the subjective complexity of a concept is 4 determined by the length of its representation in this language [4]. We consider the case where a concept corresponds to a class of items, and explore the idea that these concepts are mentally represented in a logical language. More formally, a concept is represented as a logical sentence, and the concept includes all models of this sentence, or all items that make the sentence true. The predictions of this representation length approach depend critically on the language chosen. Here we consider three languages—an object quantiﬁcation language OQ that supports quantiﬁcation over objects, a feature quantiﬁcation language F Q that supports quantiﬁcation over features, and a language OQ + F Q that supports quantiﬁcation over both objects and features. Language OQ is based on a standard logical language known as predicate logic with equality. The language includes symbols representing objects (e.g. a and b), and features (e.g. F and G) and these symbols can be combined to create literals that indicate that an object does (Fa ) or does not have a certain feature (Fa ′ ). Literals can be combined using two connectives: AND (Fa Ga ) and OR (Fa + Ga ). The language includes two quantiﬁers—for all (∀) and there exists (∃)—and allows quantiﬁcation over objects (e.g. ∀x Fx , where x is a variable that ranges over all objects in the domain). Finally, language OQ includes equality and inequality relations (= and =) which can be used to compare objects and object variables (e.g. =xa or =xy ). Table 2 shows several sentences formulated in language OQ. Suppose that the OQ complexity of each sentence is deﬁned as the number of basic propositions it contains, where a basic proposition can be a positive or negative literal (Fa or Fa ′ ) or an equality or inequality statement (=xa or =xy ). Equivalently, the complexity of a sentence is the total number of ANDs plus the total number of ORs plus one. This measure is equivalent by design to Feldman’s [2] notion of Boolean complexity when applied to a sentence without quantiﬁcation. The complexity values in Table 2 show minimal complexity values for each concept in Domains 3 and 4. Table 2 also shows a single sentence that achieves each of these complexity values, although some concepts admit multiple sentences of minimal complexity. The complexity values in Table 2 were computed using an “enumerate then combine” approach. We began by enumerating a set of sentences according to criteria described in the next paragraph. Each sentence has an extension that speciﬁes which items in the domain are consistent with the sentence. Given the extensions of all sentences generated during the enumeration phase, the combination phase considered all possible ways to combine these extensions using conjunctions or disjunctions. The procedure terminated once extensions corresponding to all of the concepts in the domain had been found. Although the number of possible sentences grows rapidly as the complexity of these sentences increases, the number of extensions is ﬁxed and relatively small (28 for domains of size 8). The combination phase is tractable since sentences with the same extension can be grouped into a single equivalence class. The enumeration phase considered all formulae which had at most two quantiﬁers and which had a complexity value lower than four. For example, this phase did not include the formula ∃x ∃y ∃z =yz F′ Fy Fz (too many quantiﬁers) or the formula ∀x ∃y =xy Fy (Fx + Gx + Hx ) (complexity x too high). Despite these restrictions, we believe that the complexity values in Table 2 are identical to the values that would be obtained if we had considered all possible sentences. Language F Q is similar to OQ but allows quantiﬁcation over features rather than objects. For example, F Q includes the statement ∀Q Qa , where Q is a variable that ranges over all features in the domain. Language F Q also allows features and feature variables to be compared for equality or inequality (e.g. =QF or =QR ). Since F Q and OQ are closely related, it follows that the F Q complexity values for Domains 3 and 4 are identical to the OQ complexity values for Domains 4 and 3. For example, F Q can express concept 5 in Domain 3 as ∀Q ∃R =QR Ra . We can combine OQ and F Q to create a language OQ + F Q that allows quantiﬁcation over both objects and features. Allowing both kinds of quantiﬁcation leads to identical complexity values for Domains 3 and 4. Language OQ + F Q can express each of the formulae for Domain 4 in Table 2, and these formulae can be converted into corresponding formulae for Domain 3 by translating each instance of object quantiﬁcation into an instance of feature quantiﬁcation. Logicians distinguish between ﬁrst-order logic, which allows quantiﬁcation over objects but not predicates, and second-order logic, which allows quantiﬁcation over objects and predicates. The difference between languages OQ and OQ + F Q is superﬁcially similar to the difference between ﬁrst-order and second-order logic, but does not cut to the heart of this matter. Since language 5 # 1 Domain 3 Domain 4 C 1 Ga C 1 Fb 2 Fa Ha + Fa Ha 4 Fa Fc + Fa Fc 4 3 Fa ′ Ga + Fa Ha 4 Fa ′ Fb + Fa Fc 4 4 Fa ′ Ga ′ + Fa Ha 4 Fa ′ Fb ′ + Fa Fc 4 5 Ga (Fa + Ha ) + Fa Ha 2 6 7 8 ′ ′ ′ ′ 5 ∀x ∃y =xy Fy ′ 5 ′ ′ 6 Ga (Fa + Ha ) + Fa Ha Ga (Fa + Ha ) + Fa Ga Ha 3 (∀x Fx ) + Fb ∃y Fy ′ ′ ′ (∀x Fx ) + Fb (Fa + Fc ) 4 ′ ′ ′ 6 ′ ′ 6 (∀x Fx ) + Fa (Fb + Fc ) 4 10 (∀x Fx ) + ∃y ∀z Fy (=zy +Fz ′ ) 4 Ha (Fa + Ga ) + Fa Ga Ha 9 Fa (Ga + Ha ) + Fa Ga Ha 10 Ga ′ (Fa Ha ′ + Fa ′ Ha ) + Ga (Fa ′ Ha ′ + Fa Ha ) ′ ′ ′ Fc (Fa + Fb ) + Fa Fb Fc ′ ′ 6 Table 2: Complexity values C and corresponding formulae for language OQ. Boolean complexity predicts complexity values for both domains that are identical to the OQ complexity values shown here for Domain 3. Language F Q predicts complexity values for Domains 3 and 4 that are identical to the OQ values for Domains 4 and 3 respectively. Language OQ + F Q predicts complexity values for both domains that are identical to the OQ complexity values for Domain 4. OQ + F Q only supports quantiﬁcation over a pre-speciﬁed set of features, it is equivalent to a typed ﬁrst order logic that includes types for objects and features [15]. Future studies, however, can explore the cognitive relevance of higher-order logic as developed by logicians. 3 Experiment Now that we have introduced languages OQ, F Q and OQ + F Q our theoretical proposals can be sharply formulated. We suggest that quantiﬁcation over objects plays an important role in mental representations, and predict that OQ complexity will account better for human learning than Boolean complexity. We also propose that quantiﬁcation over objects is more natural than quantiﬁcation over features, and predict that OQ complexity will account better for human learning than both F Q complexity and OQ + F Q complexity. We tested these predictions by designing an experiment where participants learned concepts from Domains 3 and 4. Method. 20 adults participated for course credit. Each participant was assigned to Domain 3 or Domain 4 and learned all ten concepts from that domain. The items used for each domain were the cards shown in Table 1. Note, for example, that each Domain 3 card showed one square, and that each Domain 4 card showed three squares. These items are based on stimuli developed by Sakamoto and Love [12]. The experiment was carried out using a custom built graphical interface. For each learning problem in each domain, all eight items were simultaneously presented on the screen, and participants were able to drag them around and organize them however they liked. Each problem had three phases. During the learning phase, the four items belonging to the current concept had red boundaries, and the remaining four items had blue boundaries. During the memory phase, these colored boundaries were removed, and participants were asked to sort the items into the red group and the blue group. If they made an error they returned to the learning phase, and could retake the test whenever they were ready. During the description phase, participants were asked to provide a written description of the two groups of cards. The color assignments (red or blue) were randomized across participants— in other words, the “red groups” learned by some participants were identical to the “blue groups” learned by others. The order in which participants learned the 10 concepts was also randomized. Model predictions. The OQ complexity values for the ten concepts in each domain are shown in Table 2 and plotted in Figure 2a. The complexity values in Figure 2a have been normalized so that they sum to one within each domain, and the differences of these normalized scores are shown in the ﬁnal row of Figure 2a. The two largest bars in the difference plot indicate that Concepts 10 and 5 are predicted to be easier to learn in Domain 4 than in Domain 3.

Since quantiﬁcation over features is not permitted, however, analogous statements (e.g. “object a has either 1 or 3 features”) cannot be formulated in Domain 3. Concept 10 corresponds to SHJ type VI, which often emerges as the most difﬁcult concept in studies of Boolean concept learning. Our model therefore predicts that the standard ordering of the SHJ types will not apply in Domain 4. Our model also predicts that concepts assigned to the same SHJ type will have different complexities. In Domain 4 the model predicts that Concept 6 will be harder to learn than Concept 5 (both are examples of SHJ type IV), and that Concept 8 will be harder to learn than Concepts 7 or 9 (all three are examples of SHJ type V). Results. The computer interface recorded the amount of time participants spent on the learning phase for each concept. Domain 3 was a little more difﬁcult than Domain 4 overall: on average, Domain 3 participants took 557 seconds and Domain 4 participants took 467 seconds to learn the 10 concepts. For all remaining analyses, we consider learning times that are normalized to sum to 1 for each participant. Figure 2b shows the mean values for these normalized times, and indicates the relative difﬁculties of the concepts within each condition. The difference plot in Figure 2b supports the two main predictions identiﬁed previously. Concepts 10 and 5 are the cases that differ most across the domains, and both concepts are easier to learn in Domain 3 than Domain 4. As predicted, Concept 5 is substantially easier than Concept 6 in Domain 4 even though both correspond to the same SHJ type. Concepts 7 through 9 also correspond to the same SHJ type, and the data for Domain 4 suggest that Concept 8 is the most difﬁcult of the three, although the difference between Concepts 8 and 7 is not especially large. Four sets of complexity predictions are plotted against the human data in Figure 3. Boolean complexity and OQ complexity make identical predictions about Domain 3, and OQ complexity and OQ + F Q complexity make identical predictions about Domain 4. Only OQ complexity, however, accounts for the results observed in both domains. The concept descriptions generated by participants provide additional evidence that there are psychologically important differences between Domains 3 and 4. If the descriptions for concepts 5 and 10 are combined, 18 out of 20 responses in Domain 4 referred to quantiﬁcation or counting. One representative description of Concept 5 stated that “red has multiple ﬁlled” and that “blue has one ﬁlled or none.” Only 3 of 20 responses in Domain 3 mentioned quantiﬁcation. One representative description of Concept 5 stated that “red = multiple features” and that “blue = only one feature.” 7 r=0.84 0.2 r=0.84 0.2 r=0.26 0.2 r=0.26 0.2 Learning time (Domain 3) 0.1 0.1 0 (Domain 4) 0.2 r=0.27 0.2 Learning time 0.1 0.1 0 0.2 r=0.83 0.2 0.1 0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0 0.1 0.2 r=0.27 0.2 0.1 Boolean complexity 0.1 0.1 0.2 OQ complexity 0.1 0.2 r=0.83 0.2 0.1 0 0 0.1 0 0.1 0.2 F Q complexity 0 0.1 0.2 OQ + F Q complexity Figure 3: Normalized learning times for each domain plotted against normalized complexity values predicted by four languages: Boolean logic, OQ, F Q and OQ + F Q. These results suggest that people can count or quantify over features, but that it is psychologically more natural to quantify over objects rather than features. Although we have focused on three speciﬁc languages, the results in Figure 2b can be used to evaluate alternative proposals about the language of thought. One such alternative is an extension of Language OQ that allows feature values to be compared for equality. This extended language supports concise representations of Concept 2 in both Domain 3 (Fa = Ha ) and Domain 4 (Fa = Fc ), and predicts that Concept 2 will be easier to learn than all other concepts except Concept 1. Note, however, that this prediction is not compatible with the data in Figure 2b. Other languages might also be considered, but we know of no simple language that will account for our data better than OQ. 4 Conclusion Comparing concept learning across qualitatively different domains can provide valuable information about the nature of mental representation. We compared two domains that that are similar in many respects, but that differ according to whether they include a single object (Domain 3) or multiple objects (Domain 4). Quantiﬁcation over objects is possible in Domain 4 but not Domain 3, and this difference helps to explain the different learning patterns we observed across the two domains. Our results suggest that concept representations can incorporate quantiﬁcation, and that quantifying over objects is more natural than quantifying over features. The model predictions we reported are based on a language (OQ) that is a generic version of ﬁrst order logic with equality. Our results therefore suggest that some of the languages commonly considered by logicians (e.g. ﬁrst order logic with equality) may indeed capture some aspects of the “laws of thought” [16]. A simple language like OQ offers a convenient way to explore the role of quantiﬁcation, but this language will need to be reﬁned and extended in order to provide a more accurate account of mental representation. For example, a comprehensive account of the language of thought will need to support quantiﬁcation over features in some cases, but might be formulated so that quantiﬁcation over features is typically more costly than quantiﬁcation over objects. Many possible representation languages can be imagined and a large amount of empirical data will be needed to identify the language that comes closest to the language of thought. Many relevant studies have already been conducted [2, 6, 8, 9, 13, 17], but there are vast regions of the conceptual universe (Table 1) that remain to be explored. Navigating this universe is likely to involve several challenges, but web-based experiments [18, 19] may allow it to be explored at a depth and scale that are currently unprecedented. Characterizing the language of thought is undoubtedly a long term project, but modern methods of data collection may support rapid progress towards this goal.

<p>Author: Andrew Guillory, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate methods for selecting sets of labeled vertices for use in predicting the labels of vertices on a graph. We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate. We show improved performance over baseline methods on several real world data sets. 1</p><p>6 0.79288578 <a title="116-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Solving_Stochastic_Games.html">221 nips-2009-Solving Stochastic Games</a></p>

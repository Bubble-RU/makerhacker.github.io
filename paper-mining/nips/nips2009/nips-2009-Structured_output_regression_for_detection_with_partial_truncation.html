<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, Karl Schultz, Sameer Singh</p><p>Abstract: Discriminatively trained undirected graphical models have had wide empirical success, and there has been increasing interest in toolkits that ease their application to complex relational data. The power in relational models is in their repeated structure and tied parameters; at issue is how to deﬁne these structures in a powerful and ﬂexible way. Rather than using a declarative language, such as SQL or ﬁrst-order logic, we advocate using an imperative language to express various aspects of model structure, inference, and learning. By combining the traditional, declarative, statistical semantics of factor graphs with imperative deﬁnitions of their construction and operation, we allow the user to mix declarative and procedural domain knowledge, and also gain signiﬁcant efﬁciencies. We have implemented such imperatively deﬁned factor graphs in a system we call FACTORIE, a software library for an object-oriented, strongly-typed, functional language. In experimental comparisons to Markov Logic Networks on joint segmentation and coreference, we ﬁnd our approach to be 3-15 times faster while reducing error by 20-25%—achieving a new state of the art. 1</p><p>3 0.15639472 <a title="236-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Region-based_Segmentation_and_Object_Detection.html">201 nips-2009-Region-based Segmentation and Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Gould, Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Object detection and multi-class image segmentation are two closely related tasks that can be greatly improved when solved jointly by feeding information from one task to the other [10, 11]. However, current state-of-the-art models use a separate representation for each task making joint inference clumsy and leaving the classiﬁcation of many parts of the scene ambiguous. In this work, we propose a hierarchical region-based approach to joint object detection and image segmentation. Our approach simultaneously reasons about pixels, regions and objects in a coherent probabilistic model. Pixel appearance features allow us to perform well on classifying amorphous background classes, while the explicit representation of regions facilitate the computation of more sophisticated features necessary for object detection. Importantly, our model gives a single uniﬁed description of the scene—we explain every pixel in the image and enforce global consistency between all random variables in our model. We run experiments on the challenging Street Scene dataset [2] and show signiﬁcant improvement over state-of-the-art results for object detection accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.15327056 <a title="236-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Segmenting_Scenes_by_Matching_Image_Composites.html">211 nips-2009-Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Alyosha Efros, Josef Sivic, Bill Freeman, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how, given an image, similar images sharing the same global description can help with unsupervised scene segmentation. In contrast to recent work in semantic alignment of scenes, we allow an input image to be explained by partial matches of similar scenes. This allows for a better explanation of the input scenes. We perform MRF-based segmentation that optimizes over matches, while respecting boundary information. The recovered segments are then used to re-query a large database of images to retrieve better matches for the target regions. We show improved performance in detecting the principal occluding and contact boundaries for the scene over previous methods on data gathered from the LabelMe database.</p><p>5 0.15066546 <a title="236-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Bilinear_classifiers_for_visual_recognition.html">46 nips-2009-Bilinear classifiers for visual recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Pirsiavash, Deva Ramanan, Charless C. Fowlkes</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithm for learning bilinear SVMs. Bilinear classiﬁers are a discriminative variant of bilinear models, which capture the dependence of data on multiple factors. Such models are particularly appropriate for visual data that is better represented as a matrix or tensor, rather than a vector. Matrix encodings allow for more natural regularization through rank restriction. For example, a rank-one scanning-window classiﬁer yields a separable ﬁlter. Low-rank models have fewer parameters and so are easier to regularize and faster to score at run-time. We learn low-rank models with bilinear classiﬁers. We also use bilinear classiﬁers for transfer learning by sharing linear factors between different classiﬁcation tasks. Bilinear classiﬁers are trained with biconvex programs. Such programs are optimized with coordinate descent, where each coordinate step requires solving a convex program - in our case, we use a standard off-the-shelf SVM solver. We demonstrate bilinear SVMs on difﬁcult problems of people detection in video sequences and action classiﬁcation of video sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results in both. 1</p><p>6 0.14990222 <a title="236-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Who%E2%80%99s_Doing_What%3A_Joint_Modeling_of_Names_and_Verbs_for_Simultaneous_Face_and_Pose_Annotation.html">259 nips-2009-Who’s Doing What: Joint Modeling of Names and Verbs for Simultaneous Face and Pose Annotation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jörg Lücke, Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani, Marc Henniges</p><p>Abstract: We study unsupervised learning in a probabilistic generative model for occlusion. The model uses two types of latent variables: one indicates which objects are present in the image, and the other how they are ordered in depth. This depth order then determines how the positions and appearances of the objects present, speciﬁed in the model parameters, combine to form the image. We show that the object parameters can be learnt from an unlabelled set of images in which objects occlude one another. Exact maximum-likelihood learning is intractable. However, we show that tractable approximations to Expectation Maximization (EM) can be found if the training images each contain only a small number of objects on average. In numerical experiments it is shown that these approximations recover the correct set of object parameters. Experiments on a novel version of the bars test using colored bars, and experiments on more realistic data, show that the algorithm performs well in extracting the generating causes. Experiments based on the standard bars benchmark test for object learning show that the algorithm performs well in comparison to other recent component extraction approaches. The model and the learning algorithm thus connect research on occlusion with the research ﬁeld of multiple-causes component extraction methods. 1</p><p>4 0.56286329 <a title="236-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-An_Additive_Latent_Feature_Model_for_Transparent_Object_Recognition.html">28 nips-2009-An Additive Latent Feature Model for Transparent Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Gary Bradski, Sergey Karayev, Trevor Darrell, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Existing methods for visual recognition based on quantized local features can perform poorly when local features exist on transparent surfaces, such as glass or plastic objects. There are characteristic patterns to the local appearance of transparent objects, but they may not be well captured by distances to individual examples or by a local pattern codebook obtained by vector quantization. The appearance of a transparent patch is determined in part by the refraction of a background pattern through a transparent medium: the energy from the background usually dominates the patch appearance. We model transparent local patch appearance using an additive model of latent factors: background factors due to scene content, and factors which capture a local edge energy distribution characteristic of the refraction. We implement our method using a novel LDA-SIFT formulation which performs LDA prior to any vector quantization step; we discover latent topics which are characteristic of particular transparent patches and quantize the SIFT space into transparent visual words according to the latent topic dimensions. No knowledge of the background scene is required at test time; we show examples recognizing transparent glasses in a domestic environment. 1</p><p>5 0.52353328 <a title="236-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Distribution_Matching_for_Transduction.html">72 nips-2009-Distribution Matching for Transduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, James Petterson, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many transductive inference algorithms assume that distributions over training and test estimates should be related, e.g. by providing a large margin of separation on both sets. We use this idea to design a transduction algorithm which can be used without modiﬁcation for classiﬁcation, regression, and structured estimation. At its heart we exploit the fact that for a good learner the distributions over the outputs on training and test sets should match. This is a classical two-sample problem which can be solved efﬁciently in its most general form by using distance measures in Hilbert Space. It turns out that a number of existing heuristics can be viewed as special cases of our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.52225983 <a title="236-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-FACTORIE%3A_Probabilistic_Programming_via_Imperatively_Defined_Factor_Graphs.html">89 nips-2009-FACTORIE: Probabilistic Programming via Imperatively Defined Factor Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Garcia, Maya Gupta</p><p>Abstract: We present a new empirical risk minimization framework for approximating functions from training samples for low-dimensional regression applications where a lattice (look-up table) is stored and interpolated at run-time for an efﬁcient implementation. Rather than evaluating a ﬁtted function at the lattice nodes without regard to the fact that samples will be interpolated, the proposed lattice regression approach estimates the lattice to minimize the interpolation error on the given training samples. Experiments show that lattice regression can reduce mean test error by as much as 25% compared to Gaussian process regression (GPR) for digital color management of printers, an application for which linearly interpolating a look-up table is standard. Simulations conﬁrm that lattice regression performs consistently better than the naive approach to learning the lattice. Surprisingly, in some cases the proposed method — although motivated by computational efﬁciency — performs better than directly applying GPR with no lattice at all. 1</p><p>2 0.92102873 <a title="236-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Locality-sensitive_binary_codes_from_shift-invariant_kernels.html">142 nips-2009-Locality-sensitive binary codes from shift-invariant kernels</a></p>

We introduce a simple distribution-free encoding scheme based on random projections, such that the expected Hamming distance between the binary codes of two vectors is related to the value of a shift-invariant kernel (e.g., a Gaussian kernel) between the vectors. We present a full theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of the proposed scheme, and report favorable experimental performance as compared to a recent state-of-the-art method, spectral hashing.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.90615159 <a title="236-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Structured_output_regression_for_detection_with_partial_truncation.html">236 nips-2009-Structured output regression for detection with partial truncation</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We develop a structured output model for object category detection that explicitly accounts for alignment, multiple aspects and partial truncation in both training and inference. The model is formulated as large margin learning with latent variables and slack rescaling, and both training and inference are computationally efﬁcient. We make the following contributions: (i) we note that extending the Structured Output Regression formulation of Blaschko and Lampert [1] to include a bias term signiﬁcantly improves performance; (ii) that alignment (to account for small rotations and anisotropic scalings) can be included as a latent variable and efﬁciently determined and implemented; (iii) that the latent variable extends to multiple aspects (e.g. left facing, right facing, front) with the same formulation; and (iv), most signiﬁcantly for performance, that truncated and truncated instances can be included in both training and inference with an explicit truncation mask. We demonstrate the method by training and testing on the PASCAL VOC 2007 data set – training includes the truncated examples, and in testing object instances are detected at multiple scales, alignments, and with signiﬁcant truncations. 1</p><p>4 0.87263298 <a title="236-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for ﬂexible probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message passing to compute the global likelihoods and posteriors. This algorithm, the ﬁrst parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of magnitude larger than have previously been possible. 1</p><p>5 0.87223113 <a title="236-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Markov random ﬁelds (MRF’s), or undirected graphical models, provide a powerful framework for modeling complex dependencies among random variables. Maximum likelihood learning in MRF’s is hard due to the presence of the global normalizing constant. In this paper we consider a class of stochastic approximation algorithms of the Robbins-Monro type that use Markov chain Monte Carlo to do approximate maximum likelihood learning. We show that using MCMC operators based on tempered transitions enables the stochastic approximation algorithm to better explore highly multimodal distributions, which considerably improves parameter estimates in large, densely-connected MRF’s. Our results on MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that we can successfully learn good generative models of high-dimensional, richly structured data that perform well on digit and object recognition tasks.</p><p>6 0.87190288 <a title="236-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>

We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate.

<p>Author: Amarnag Subramanya, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We prove certain theoretical properties of a graph-regularized transductive learning objective that is based on minimizing a Kullback-Leibler divergence based loss. These include showing that the iterative alternating minimization procedure used to minimize the objective converges to the correct solution and deriving a test for convergence. We also propose a graph node ordering algorithm that is cache cognizant and leads to a linear speedup in parallel computations. This ensures that the algorithm scales to large data sets. By making use of empirical evaluation on the TIMIT and Switchboard I corpora, we show this approach is able to outperform other state-of-the-art SSL approaches. In one instance, we solve a problem on a 120 million node graph. 1</p><p>4 0.094234414 <a title="102-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Subject_independent_EEG-based_BCI_decoding.html">237 nips-2009-Subject independent EEG-based BCI decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Siamac Fazli, Cristian Grozea, Marton Danoczy, Benjamin Blankertz, Florin Popescu, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: In the quest to make Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) more usable, dry electrodes have emerged that get rid of the initial 30 minutes required for placing an electrode cap. Another time consuming step is the required individualized adaptation to the BCI user, which involves another 30 minutes calibration for assessing a subject’s brain signature. In this paper we aim to also remove this calibration proceedure from BCI setup time by means of machine learning. In particular, we harvest a large database of EEG BCI motor imagination recordings (83 subjects) for constructing a library of subject-speciﬁc spatio-temporal ﬁlters and derive a subject independent BCI classiﬁer. Our ofﬂine results indicate that BCI-na¨ve ı users could start real-time BCI use with no prior calibration at only a very moderate performance loss.</p><p>5 0.09337949 <a title="102-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More%3A_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise.html">258 nips-2009-Whose Vote Should Count More: Optimal Integration of Labels from Labelers of Unknown Expertise</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Whitehill, Ting-fan Wu, Jacob Bergsma, Javier R. Movellan, Paul L. Ruvolo</p><p>Abstract: Modern machine learning-based approaches to computer vision require very large databases of hand labeled images. Some contemporary vision systems already require on the order of millions of images for training (e.g., Omron face detector [9]). New Internet-based services allow for a large number of labelers to collaborate around the world at very low cost. However, using these services brings interesting theoretical and practical challenges: (1) The labelers may have wide ranging levels of expertise which are unknown a priori, and in some cases may be adversarial; (2) images may vary in their level of difﬁculty; and (3) multiple labels for the same image must be combined to provide an estimate of the actual label of the image. Probabilistic approaches provide a principled way to approach these problems. In this paper we present a probabilistic model and use it to simultaneously infer the label of each image, the expertise of each labeler, and the difﬁculty of each image. On both simulated and real data, we demonstrate that the model outperforms the commonly used “Majority Vote” heuristic for inferring image labels, and is robust to both noisy and adversarial labelers. 1</p><p>6 0.084893465 <a title="102-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Learning%3A_The_Limit_of_Infinite_Unlabelled_Data.html">229 nips-2009-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Shobha Venkataraman, Avrim Blum, Dawn Song, Subhabrata Sen, Oliver Spatscheck</p><p>Abstract: We formulate and address the problem of discovering dynamic malicious regions on the Internet. We model this problem as one of adaptively pruning a known decision tree, but with additional challenges: (1) severe space requirements, since the underlying decision tree has over 4 billion leaves, and (2) a changing target function, since malicious activity on the Internet is dynamic. We present a novel algorithm that addresses this problem, by putting together a number of different “experts” algorithms and online paging algorithms. We prove guarantees on our algorithm’s performance as a function of the best possible pruning of a similar size, and our experiments show that our algorithm achieves high accuracy on large real-world data sets, with signiﬁcant improvements over existing approaches.</p><p>3 0.74952114 <a title="102-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Label_Selection_on_Graphs.html">122 nips-2009-Label Selection on Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Ofer Dekel</p><p>Abstract: While many advances have already been made in hierarchical classiﬁcation learning, we take a step back and examine how a hierarchical classiﬁcation problem should be formally deﬁned. We pay particular attention to the fact that many arbitrary decisions go into the design of the label taxonomy that is given with the training data. Moreover, many hand-designed taxonomies are unbalanced and misrepresent the class structure in the underlying data distribution. We attempt to correct these problems by using the data distribution itself to calibrate the hierarchical classiﬁcation loss function. This distribution-based correction must be done with care, to avoid introducing unmanageable statistical dependencies into the learning problem. This leads us off the beaten path of binomial-type estimation and into the unfamiliar waters of geometric-type estimation. In this paper, we present a new calibrated deﬁnition of statistical risk for hierarchical classiﬁcation, an unbiased estimator for this risk, and a new algorithmic reduction from hierarchical classiﬁcation to cost-sensitive classiﬁcation.</p><p>5 0.58099717 <a title="102-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More%3A_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise.html">258 nips-2009-Whose Vote Should Count More: Optimal Integration of Labels from Labelers of Unknown Expertise</a></p>

Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: While many perceptual and cognitive phenomena are well described in terms of Bayesian inference, the necessary computations are intractable at the scale of realworld tasks, and it remains unclear how the human mind approximates Bayesian computations algorithmically. We explore the proposal that for some tasks, humans use a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution over hidden variables. As a case study, we show how several phenomena of perceptual multistability can be explained as MCMC inference in simple graphical models for low-level vision. 1</p><p>3 0.64056009 <a title="102-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Learning_models_of_object_structure.html">133 nips-2009-Learning models of object structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Schlecht, Kobus Barnard</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for learning stochastic geometric models of object categories from single view images. We focus here on models expressible as a spatially contiguous assemblage of blocks. Model topologies are learned across groups of images, and one or more such topologies is linked to an object category (e.g. chairs). Fitting learned topologies to an image can be used to identify the object class, as well as detail its geometry. The latter goes beyond labeling objects, as it provides the geometric structure of particular instances. We learn the models using joint statistical inference over category parameters, camera parameters, and instance parameters. These produce an image likelihood through a statistical imaging model. We use trans-dimensional sampling to explore topology hypotheses, and alternate between Metropolis-Hastings and stochastic dynamics to explore instance parameters. Experiments on images of furniture objects such as tables and chairs suggest that this is an effective approach for learning models that encode simple representations of category geometry and the statistics thereof, and support inferring both category and geometry on held out single view images. 1</p><p>4 0.60713214 <a title="102-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Occlusive_Components_Analysis.html">175 nips-2009-Occlusive Components Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Jörg Lücke, Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani, Marc Henniges</p><p>Abstract: We study unsupervised learning in a probabilistic generative model for occlusion. The model uses two types of latent variables: one indicates which objects are present in the image, and the other how they are ordered in depth. This depth order then determines how the positions and appearances of the objects present, speciﬁed in the model parameters, combine to form the image. We show that the object parameters can be learnt from an unlabelled set of images in which objects occlude one another. Exact maximum-likelihood learning is intractable. However, we show that tractable approximations to Expectation Maximization (EM) can be found if the training images each contain only a small number of objects on average. In numerical experiments it is shown that these approximations recover the correct set of object parameters. Experiments on a novel version of the bars test using colored bars, and experiments on more realistic data, show that the algorithm performs well in extracting the generating causes. Experiments based on the standard bars benchmark test for object learning show that the algorithm performs well in comparison to other recent component extraction approaches. The model and the learning algorithm thus connect research on occlusion with the research ﬁeld of multiple-causes component extraction methods. 1</p><p>5 0.55773813 <a title="102-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Beyond_Convexity%3A_Online_Submodular_Minimization.html">45 nips-2009-Beyond Convexity: Online Submodular Minimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Masayuki Karasuyama, Ichiro Takeuchi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a multiple incremental decremental algorithm of Support Vector Machine (SVM). Conventional single incremental decremental SVM can update the trained model efﬁciently when single data point is added to or removed from the training set. When we add and/or remove multiple data points, this algorithm is time-consuming because we need to repeatedly apply it to each data point. The proposed algorithm is computationally more efﬁcient when multiple data points are added and/or removed simultaneously. The single incremental decremental algorithm is built on an optimization technique called parametric programming. We extend the idea and introduce multi-parametric programming for developing the proposed algorithm. Experimental results on synthetic and real data sets indicate that the proposed algorithm can signiﬁcantly reduce the computational cost of multiple incremental decremental operation. Our approach is especially useful for online SVM learning in which we need to remove old data points and add new data points in a short amount of time.</p><p>3 0.093874134 <a title="106-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Label_Selection_on_Graphs.html">122 nips-2009-Label Selection on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Guillory, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate methods for selecting sets of labeled vertices for use in predicting the labels of vertices on a graph. We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate. We show improved performance over baseline methods on several real world data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.08962509 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Manifold_Embeddings_for_Model-Based_Reinforcement_Learning_under_Partial_Observability.html">145 nips-2009-Manifold Embeddings for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability</a></p>
<p>Author: Keith Bush, Joelle Pineau</p><p>Abstract: Interesting real-world datasets often exhibit nonlinear, noisy, continuous-valued states that are unexplorable, are poorly described by ﬁrst principles, and are only partially observable. If partial observability can be overcome, these constraints suggest the use of model-based reinforcement learning. We experiment with manifold embeddings to reconstruct the observable state-space in the context of offline, model-based reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that the embedding of a system can change as a result of learning, and we argue that the best performing embeddings well-represent the dynamics of both the uncontrolled and adaptively controlled system. We apply this approach to learn a neurostimulation policy that suppresses epileptic seizures on animal brain slices. 1</p><p>5 0.058920234 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Graph-based_Consensus_Maximization_among_Multiple_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Models.html">102 nips-2009-Graph-based Consensus Maximization among Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jing Gao, Feng Liang, Wei Fan, Yizhou Sun, Jiawei Han</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble classiﬁers such as bagging, boosting and model averaging are known to have improved accuracy and robustness over a single model. Their potential, however, is limited in applications which have no access to raw data but to the meta-level model output. In this paper, we study ensemble learning with output from multiple supervised and unsupervised models, a topic where little work has been done. Although unsupervised models, such as clustering, do not directly generate label prediction for each individual, they provide useful constraints for the joint prediction of a set of related objects. We propose to consolidate a classiﬁcation solution by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervised constraints. We cast this ensemble task as an optimization problem on a bipartite graph, where the objective function favors the smoothness of the prediction over the graph, as well as penalizing deviations from the initial labeling provided by supervised models. We solve this problem through iterative propagation of probability estimates among neighboring nodes. Our method can also be interpreted as conducting a constrained embedding in a transformed space, or a ranking on the graph. Experimental results on three real applications demonstrate the beneﬁts of the proposed method over existing alternatives1 . 1</p><p>6 0.055774406 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Kernel_Choice_and_Classifiability_for_RKHS_Embeddings_of_Probability_Distributions.html">118 nips-2009-Kernel Choice and Classifiability for RKHS Embeddings of Probability Distributions</a></p>

<p>Author: Wu-jun Li, Dit-Yan Yeung, Zhihua Zhang</p><p>Abstract: One crucial assumption made by both principal component analysis (PCA) and probabilistic PCA (PPCA) is that the instances are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). However, this common i.i.d. assumption is unreasonable for relational data. In this paper, by explicitly modeling covariance between instances as derived from the relational information, we propose a novel probabilistic dimensionality reduction method, called probabilistic relational PCA (PRPCA), for relational data analysis. Although the i.i.d. assumption is no longer adopted in PRPCA, the learning algorithms for PRPCA can still be devised easily like those for PPCA which makes explicit use of the i.i.d. assumption. Experiments on realworld data sets show that PRPCA can effectively utilize the relational information to dramatically outperform PCA and achieve state-of-the-art performance. 1</p><p>4 0.42036057 <a title="106-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Regression_using_Hessian_energy_with_an_application_to_semi-supervised_dimensionality_reduction.html">214 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Regression using Hessian energy with an application to semi-supervised dimensionality reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang I. Kim, Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression based on the graph Laplacian suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the lack of extrapolating power. Based on these observations, we propose to use the second-order Hessian energy for semi-supervised regression which overcomes both these problems. If the data lies on or close to a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space, the Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. We ﬁrst derive the Hessian energy for smooth manifolds and continue to give a stable estimation procedure for the common case where only samples of the underlying manifold are given. The preference of ‘’linear” functions on manifolds renders the Hessian energy particularly suited for the task of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to ﬁnd a user-deﬁned embedding function given some labeled points which varies smoothly (and ideally linearly) along the manifold. The experimental results suggest superior performance of our method compared with semi-supervised regression using Laplacian regularization or standard supervised regression techniques applied to this task. 1</p><p>5 0.41413158 <a title="106-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_Label_Embeddings_for_Nearest-Neighbor_Multi-class_Classification_with_an_Application_to_Speech_Recognition.html">127 nips-2009-Learning Label Embeddings for Nearest-Neighbor Multi-class Classification with an Application to Speech Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Natasha Singh-miller, Michael Collins</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of using nearest neighbor methods to provide a conditional probability estimate, P (y|a), when the number of labels y is large and the labels share some underlying structure. We propose a method for learning label embeddings (similar to error-correcting output codes (ECOCs)) to model the similarity between labels within a nearest neighbor framework. The learned ECOCs and nearest neighbor information are used to provide conditional probability estimates. We apply these estimates to the problem of acoustic modeling for speech recognition. We demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements in terms of word error rate (WER) on a lecture recognition task over a state-of-the-art baseline GMM model. 1</p><p>6 0.40838501 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Distribution_Matching_for_Transduction.html">72 nips-2009-Distribution Matching for Transduction</a></p>

Based on this ﬁnding, we present a parameterized subset of similarity functions for choosing the best tail-heaviness for HSSNE; (2) we present a ﬁxed-point optimization algorithm that can be applied to all heavy-tailed functions and does not require the user to set any parameters; and (3) we present two empirical studies, one for unsupervised visualization showing that our optimization algorithm runs as fast and as good as the best known t-SNE implementation and the other for semi-supervised visualization showing quantitative superiority using the homogeneity measure as well as qualitative advantage in cluster separation over t-SNE.</p><p>2 0.69822651 <a title="106-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Fast_Image_Deconvolution_using_Hyper-Laplacian_Priors.html">93 nips-2009-Fast Image Deconvolution using Hyper-Laplacian Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Dilip Krishnan, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: The heavy-tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes have proven effective priors for a range of problems such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. α These distributions are well modeled by a hyper-Laplacian p(x) ∝ e−k|x| , typically with 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.8. However, the use of sparse distributions makes the problem non-convex and impractically slow to solve for multi-megapixel images. In this paper we describe a deconvolution approach that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques that use hyper-Laplacian priors. We adopt an alternating minimization scheme where one of the two phases is a non-convex problem that is separable over pixels. This per-pixel sub-problem may be solved with a lookup table (LUT). Alternatively, for two speciﬁc values of α, 1/2 and 2/3 an analytic solution can be found, by ﬁnding the roots of a cubic and quartic polynomial, respectively. Our approach (using either LUTs or analytic formulae) is able to deconvolve a 1 megapixel image in less than ∼3 seconds, achieving comparable quality to existing methods such as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) that take ∼20 minutes. Furthermore, our method is quite general and can easily be extended to related image processing problems, beyond the deconvolution application demonstrated. 1</p><p>3 0.60300797 <a title="106-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Markov random ﬁelds (MRF’s), or undirected graphical models, provide a powerful framework for modeling complex dependencies among random variables. Maximum likelihood learning in MRF’s is hard due to the presence of the global normalizing constant. In this paper we consider a class of stochastic approximation algorithms of the Robbins-Monro type that use Markov chain Monte Carlo to do approximate maximum likelihood learning. We show that using MCMC operators based on tempered transitions enables the stochastic approximation algorithm to better explore highly multimodal distributions, which considerably improves parameter estimates in large, densely-connected MRF’s. Our results on MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that we can successfully learn good generative models of high-dimensional, richly structured data that perform well on digit and object recognition tasks.</p><p>4 0.58878255 <a title="106-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_and_Accurate_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">80 nips-2009-Efficient and Accurate Lp-Norm Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Pavel Laskov, Klaus-Robert Müller, Alexander Zien, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability. Unfortunately, 1 -norm MKL is hardly observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary p -norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary p > 1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimization strategies are much faster compared to the traditionally used wrapper approaches. Finally, we apply p -norm MKL to real-world problems from computational biology, showing that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>5 0.58673096 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Periodic_Step_Size_Adaptation_for_Single_Pass_On-line_Learning.html">189 nips-2009-Periodic Step Size Adaptation for Single Pass On-line Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chun-nan Hsu, Yu-ming Chang, Hanshen Huang, Yuh-jye Lee</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that the second-order stochastic gradient descent (2SGD) method can potentially achieve generalization performance as well as empirical optimum in a single pass (i.e., epoch) through the training examples. However, 2SGD requires computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents Periodic Step-size Adaptation (PSA), which approximates the Jacobian matrix of the mapping function and explores a linear relation between the Jacobian and Hessian to approximate the Hessian periodically and achieve near-optimal results in experiments on a wide variety of models and tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.58489048 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Sparsistent_Learning_of_Varying-coefficient_Models_with_Structural_Changes.html">225 nips-2009-Sparsistent Learning of Varying-coefficient Models with Structural Changes</a></p>

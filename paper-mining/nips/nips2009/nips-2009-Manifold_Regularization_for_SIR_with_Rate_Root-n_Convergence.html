<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a sensitivity analysis in Hidden Markov Models with continuous state and observation spaces. We propose an Inﬁnitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) on the ﬁltering distribution with respect to some parameters of the model. We describe a methodology for using any algorithm that estimates the ﬁltering density, such as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, to design an algorithm that estimates its gradient. The resulting IPA estimator is proven to be asymptotically unbiased, consistent and has computational complexity linear in the number of particles. We consider an application of this analysis to the problem of identifying unknown parameters of the model given a sequence of observations. We derive an IPA estimator for the gradient of the log-likelihood, which may be used in a gradient method for the purpose of likelihood maximization. We illustrate the method with several numerical experiments.</p><p>3 0.11199945 <a title="146-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Regression_using_Hessian_energy_with_an_application_to_semi-supervised_dimensionality_reduction.html">214 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Regression using Hessian energy with an application to semi-supervised dimensionality reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang I. Kim, Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression based on the graph Laplacian suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the lack of extrapolating power. Based on these observations, we propose to use the second-order Hessian energy for semi-supervised regression which overcomes both these problems. If the data lies on or close to a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space, the Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. We ﬁrst derive the Hessian energy for smooth manifolds and continue to give a stable estimation procedure for the common case where only samples of the underlying manifold are given. The preference of ‘’linear” functions on manifolds renders the Hessian energy particularly suited for the task of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to ﬁnd a user-deﬁned embedding function given some labeled points which varies smoothly (and ideally linearly) along the manifold. The experimental results suggest superior performance of our method compared with semi-supervised regression using Laplacian regularization or standard supervised regression techniques applied to this task. 1</p><p>4 0.10694847 <a title="146-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Learning%3A_The_Limit_of_Infinite_Unlabelled_Data.html">229 nips-2009-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Nathan Srebro, Xueyuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for SemiSupervised Learning at the regime of a ﬁxed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in Rd , d 2, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the “smoothness” assumptions associated with this alternate method. 1 Introduction and Setup In this paper we consider the limit behavior of two popular semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the graph Laplacian: the regularization approach [15] and the spectral approach [3]. We consider the limit when the number of labeled points is ﬁxed and the number of unlabeled points goes to inﬁnity. This is a natural limit for SSL as the basic SSL scenario is one in which unlabeled data is virtually inﬁnite. We can also think of this limit as “perfect” SSL, having full knowledge of the marginal density p(x). The premise of SSL is that the marginal density p(x) is informative about the unknown mapping y(x) we are trying to learn, e.g. since y(x) is expected to be “smooth” in some sense relative to p(x). Studying the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit, where p(x) is fully known, allows us to formulate and understand the underlying smoothness assumptions of a particular SSL method, and judge whether it is well-posed and sensible. Understanding the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit is also a necessary ﬁrst step to studying the convergence of the ﬁnite-labeled-data estimator. We consider the following setup: Let p(x) be an unknown smooth density on a compact domain Ω ⊂ Rd with a smooth boundary. Let y : Ω → Y be the unknown function we wish to estimate. In case of regression Y = R whereas in binary classiﬁcation Y = {−1, 1}. The standard (transductive) semisupervised learning problem is formulated as follows: Given l labeled points, (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ), with yi = y(xi ), and u unlabeled points xl+1 , . . . , xl+u , with all points xi sampled i.i.d. from p(x), the goal is to construct an estimate of y(xl+i ) for any unlabeled point xl+i , utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled points. We denote the total number of points by n = l + u. We are interested in the regime where l is ﬁxed and u → ∞. 1 2 SSL with Graph Laplacian Regularization We ﬁrst consider the following graph-based approach formulated by Zhu et. al. [15]: y (x) = arg min In (y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l y where 1 n2 In (y) = Wi,j (y(xi ) − y(xj ))2 (1) (2) i,j is a Laplacian regularization term enforcing “smoothness” with respect to the n×n similarity matrix W . This formulation has several natural interpretations in terms of, e.g. random walks and electrical circuits [15]. These interpretations, however, refer to a ﬁxed graph, over a ﬁnite set of points with given similarities. In contrast, our focus here is on the more typical scenario where the points xi ∈ Rd are a random sample from a density p(x), and W is constructed based on this sample. We would like to understand the behavior of the method in terms of the density p(x), particularly in the limit where the number of unlabeled points grows. Under what assumptions on the target labeling y(x) and on the density p(x) is the method (1) sensible? The answer, of course, depends on how the matrix W is constructed. We consider the common situation where the similarities are obtained by applying some decay ﬁlter to the distances: xi −xj σ Wi,j = G (3) where G : R+ → R+ is some function with an adequately fast decay. Popular choices are the 2 Gaussian ﬁlter G(z) = e−z /2 or the ǫ-neighborhood graph obtained by the step ﬁlter G(z) = 1z<1 . For simplicity, we focus here on the formulation (1) where the solution is required to satisfy the constraints at the labeled points exactly. In practice, the hard labeling constraints are often replaced with a softer loss-based data term, which is balanced against the smoothness term In (y), e.g. [14, 6]. Our analysis and conclusions apply to such variants as well. Limit of the Laplacian Regularization Term As the number of unlabeled examples grows the regularization term (2) converges to its expectation, where the summation is replaced by integration w.r.t. the density p(x): lim In (y) = I (σ) (y) = n→∞ G Ω Ω x−x′ σ (y(x) − y(x′ ))2 p(x)p(x′ )dxdx′ . (4) In the above limit, the bandwidth σ is held ﬁxed. Typically, one would also drive the bandwidth σ to zero as n → ∞. There are two reasons for this choice. First, from a practical perspective, this makes the similarity matrix W sparse so it can be stored and processed. Second, from a theoretical perspective, this leads to a clear and well deﬁned limit of the smoothness regularization term In (y), at least when σ → 0 slowly enough1 , namely when σ = ω( d log n/n). If σ → 0 as n → ∞, and as long as nσ d / log n → ∞, then after appropriate normalization, the regularizer converges to a density weighted gradient penalty term [7, 8]: d lim d+2 In (y) n→∞ Cσ (σ) d (y) d+2 I σ→0 Cσ = lim ∇y(x) 2 p(x)2 dx = J(y) = (5) Ω where C = Rd z 2 G( z )dz, and assuming 0 < C < ∞ (which is the case for both the Gaussian and the step ﬁlters). This energy functional J(f ) therefore encodes the notion of “smoothness” with respect to p(x) that is the basis of the SSL formulation (1) with the graph constructions speciﬁed by (3). To understand the behavior and appropriateness of (1) we must understand this functional and the associated limit problem: y (x) = arg min J(y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l (6) y p When σ = o( d 1/n) then all non-diagonal weights Wi,j vanish (points no longer have any “close by” p neighbors). We are not aware of an analysis covering the regime where σ decays roughly as d 1/n, but would be surprised if a qualitatively different meaningful limit is reached. 1 2 3 Graph Laplacian Regularization in R1 We begin by considering the solution of (6) for one dimensional data, i.e. d = 1 and x ∈ R. We ﬁrst consider the situation where the support of p(x) is a continuous interval Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R (a and/or b may be inﬁnite). Without loss of generality, we assume the labeled data is sorted in increasing order a x1 < x2 < · · · < xl b. Applying the theory of variational calculus, the solution y (x) ˆ satisﬁes inside each interval (xi , xi+1 ) the Euler-Lagrange equation d dy p2 (x) = 0. dx dx Performing two integrations and enforcing the constraints at the labeled points yields y(x) = yi + x 1/p2 (t)dt xi (yi+1 xi+1 1/p2 (t)dt xi − yi ) for xi x xi+1 (7) with y(x) = x1 for a x x1 and y(x) = xl for xl x b. If the support of p(x) is a union of disjoint intervals, the above analysis and the form of the solution applies in each interval separately. The solution (7) seems reasonable and desirable from the point of view of the “smoothness” assumptions: when p(x) is uniform, the solution interpolates linearly between labeled data points, whereas across low-density regions, where p(x) is close to zero, y(x) can change abruptly. Furthermore, the regularizer J(y) can be interpreted as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) squared semi-norm, giving us additional insight into this choice of regularizer: b 1 Theorem 1. Let p(x) be a smooth density on Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R such that Ap = 4 a 1/p2 (t)dt < ∞. 2 Then, J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm J(f ) = f Kp induced by the kernel x′ ′ Kp (x, x ) = Ap − 1 2 x with a null-space of all constant functions. That is, f the RKHS induced by Kp . 1 p2 (t) dt Kp . (8) is the norm of the projection of f onto If p(x) is supported on several disjoint intervals, Ω = ∪i [ai , bi ], then J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm induced by the kernel 1 bi dt 4 ai p2 (t) ′ Kp (x, x ) = − 1 2 x′ dt x p2 (t) if x, x′ ∈ [ai , bi ] (9) if x ∈ [ai , bi ], x′ ∈ [aj , bj ], i = j 0 with a null-space spanned by indicator functions 1[ai ,bi ] (x) on the connected components of Ω. Proof. For any f (x) = i αi Kp (x, xi ) in the RKHS induced by Kp : df dx J(f ) = 2 p2 (x)dx = αi αj Jij (10) i,j where Jij = d d Kp (x, xi ) Kp (x, xj )p2 (x)dx dx dx When xi and xj are in different connected components of Ω, the gradients of Kp (·, xi ) and Kp (·, xj ) are never non-zero together and Jij = 0 = Kp (xi , xj ). When they are in the same connected component [a, b], and assuming w.l.o.g. a xi xj b: Jij = = xi 1 4 1 4 a b a 1 dt + p2 (t) 1 1 dt − p2 (t) 2 xj xi xj xi −1 dt + p2 (t) xj 1 dt p2 (t) 1 dt = Kp (xi , xj ). p2 (t) Substituting Jij = Kp (xi , xj ) into (10) yields J(f ) = 3 b αi αj Kp (xi , xj ) = f (11) Kp . Combining Theorem 1 with the Representer Theorem [13] establishes that the solution of (6) (or of any variant where the hard constraints are replaced by a data term) is of the form: l y(x) = αj Kp (x, xj ) + βi 1[ai ,bi ] (x), j=1 i where i ranges over the connected components [ai , bi ] of Ω, and we have: l J(y) = αi αj Kp (xi , xj ). (12) i,j=1 Viewing the regularizer as y 2 p suggests understanding (6), and so also its empirical approximaK tion (1), by interpreting Kp (x, x′ ) as a density-based “similarity measure” between x and x′ . This similarity measure indeed seems sensible: for a uniform density it is simply linearly decreasing as a function of the distance. When the density is non-uniform, two points are relatively similar only if they are connected by a region in which 1/p2 (x) is low, i.e. the density is high, but are much less “similar”, i.e. related to each other, when connected by a low-density region. Furthermore, there is no dependence between points in disjoint components separated by zero density regions. 4 Graph Laplacian Regularization in Higher Dimensions The analysis of the previous section seems promising, at it shows that in one dimension, the SSL method (1) is well posed and converges to a sensible limit. Regretfully, in higher dimensions this is not the case anymore. In the following theorem we show that the inﬁmum of the limit problem (6) is zero and can be obtained by a sequence of functions which are certainly not a sensible extrapolation of the labeled points. Theorem 2. Let p(x) be a smooth density over Rd , d 2, bounded from above by some constant pmax , and let (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ) be any (non-repeating) set of labeled examples. There exist continuous functions yǫ (x), for any ǫ > 0, all satisfying the constraints yǫ (xj ) = yj , j = 1, . . . , l, such ǫ→0 ǫ→0 that J(yǫ ) −→ 0 but yǫ (x) −→ 0 for all x = xj , j = 1, . . . , l. Proof. We present a detailed proof for the case of l = 2 labeled points. The generalization of the proof to more labeled points is straightforward. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we assume the ﬁrst labeled point is at x0 = 0 with y(x0 ) = 0 and the second labeled point is at x1 with x1 = 1 and y(x1 ) = 1. In addition, we assume that the ball B1 (0) of radius one centered around the origin is contained in Ω = {x ∈ Rd | p(x) > 0}. We ﬁrst consider the case d > 2. Here, for any ǫ > 0, consider the function x ǫ yǫ (x) = min ,1 which indeed satisﬁes the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1. Then, J(yǫ ) = Bǫ (0) p2 (x) dx ǫ2 pmax ǫ2 dx = p2 Vd ǫd−2 max (13) Bǫ (0) where Vd is the volume of a unit ball in Rd . Hence, the sequence of functions yǫ (x) satisfy the constraints, but for d > 2, inf ǫ J(yǫ ) = 0. For d = 2, a more extreme example is necessary: consider the functions 2 x yǫ (x) = log +ǫ ǫ log 1+ǫ ǫ for x 1 and yǫ (x) = 1 for x > 1. These functions satisfy the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1 and: J(yǫ ) = 4 h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ 4πp2 max h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ x B1 (0) log ( x 1+ǫ ǫ 2 2 +ǫ)2 p2 (x)dx 4p2 h “ max ”i2 1+ǫ log ǫ 4πp2 max ǫ→0 = −→ 0. log 1+ǫ ǫ 4 1 0 r2 (r 2 +ǫ)2 2πrdr The implication of Theorem 2 is that regardless of the values at the labeled points, as u → ∞, the solution of (1) is not well posed. Asymptotically, the solution has the form of an almost everywhere constant function, with highly localized spikes near the labeled points, and so no learning is performed. In particular, an interpretation in terms of a density-based kernel Kp , as in the onedimensional case, is not possible. Our analysis also carries over to a formulation where a loss-based data term replaces the hard label constraints, as in l 1 y = arg min ˆ (y(xj ) − yj )2 + γIn (y) y(x) l j=1 In the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, functions of the form yǫ (x) above have a zero data penalty term (since they exactly match the labels) and also drive the regularization term J(y) to zero. Hence, it is possible to drive the entire objective functional (the data term plus the regularization term) to zero with functions that do not generalize at all to unlabeled points. 4.1 Numerical Example We illustrate the phenomenon detailed by Theorem 2 with a simple example. Consider a density p(x) in R2 , which is a mixture of two unit variance spherical Gaussians, one per class, centered at the origin and at (4, 0). We sample a total of n = 3000 points, and label two points from each of the two components (four total). We then construct a similarity matrix using a Gaussian ﬁlter with σ = 0.4. Figure 1 depicts the predictor y (x) obtained from (1). In fact, two different predictors are shown, ˆ obtained by different numerical methods for solving (1). Both methods are based on the observation that the solution y (x) of (1) satisﬁes: ˆ n y (xi ) = ˆ n Wij y (xj ) / ˆ j=1 Wij on all unlabeled points i = l + 1, . . . , l + u. (14) j=1 Combined with the constraints of (1), we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved by Gaussian elimination (here invoked through MATLAB’s backslash operator). This is the method used in the top panels of Figure 1. Alternatively, (14) can be viewed as an update equation for y (xi ), ˆ which can be solved via the power method, or label propagation [2, 6]: start with zero labels on the unlabeled points and iterate (14), while keeping the known labels on x1 , . . . , xl . This is the method used in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As predicted, y (x) is almost constant for almost all unlabeled points. Although all values are very ˆ close to zero, thresholding at the “right” threshold does actually produce sensible results in terms of the true -1/+1 labels. However, beyond being inappropriate for regression, a very ﬂat predictor is still problematic even from a classiﬁcation perspective. First, it is not possible to obtain a meaningful conﬁdence measure for particular labels. Second, especially if the size of each class is not known apriori, setting the threshold between the positive and negative classes is problematic. In our example, setting the threshold to zero yields a generalization error of 45%. The differences between the two numerical methods for solving (1) also point out to another problem with the ill-posedness of the limit problem: the solution is numerically very un-stable. A more quantitative evaluation, that also validates that the effect in Figure 1 is not a result of choosing a “wrong” bandwidth σ, is given in Figure 2. We again simulated data from a mixture of two Gaussians, one Gaussian per class, this time in 20 dimensions, with one labeled point per class, and an increasing number of unlabeled points. In Figure 2 we plot the squared error, and the classiﬁcation error of the resulting predictor y (x). We plot the classiﬁcation error both when a threshold ˆ of zero is used (i.e. the class is determined by sign(ˆ(x))) and with the ideal threshold minimizing y the test error. For each unlabeled sample size, we choose the bandwidth σ yielding the best test performance (this is a “cheating” approach which provides a lower bound on the error of the best method for selecting the bandwidth). As the number of unlabeled examples increases the squared error approaches 1, indicating a ﬂat predictor. Using a threshold of zero leads to an increase in the classiﬁcation error, possibly due to numerical instability. Interestingly, although the predictors become very ﬂat, the classiﬁcation error using the ideal threshold actually improves slightly.

For each error measure and sample size, the bandwidth minimizing the test error was used, and is plotted. ideal classiﬁcation performance is achieved with a signiﬁcantly larger bandwidth than the bandwidth minimizing the squared loss, i.e. when the predictor is even ﬂatter. 4.2 Probabilistic Interpretation, Exit and Hitting Times As mentioned above, the Laplacian regularization method (1) has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of a random walk on the weighted graph. Let x(t) denote a random walk on the graph with transition matrix M = D−1 W where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij . Then, for the binary classiﬁcation case with yi = ±1 we have [15]: y (xi ) = 2 Pr x(t) hits a point labeled +1 before hitting a point labeled -1 x(0) = xi − 1 ˆ We present an interpretation of our analysis in terms of the limiting properties of this random walk. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the two classes are separated by a low density region. Then, the random walk has two intrinsic quantities of interest. The ﬁrst is the mean exit time from one cluster to the other, and the other is the mean hitting time to the labeled points in that cluster. As the number of unlabeled points increases and σ → 0, the random walk converges to a diffusion process [12]. While the mean exit time then converges to a ﬁnite value corresponding to its diffusion analogue, the hitting time to a labeled point increases to inﬁnity (as these become absorbing boundaries of measure zero). With more and more unlabeled data the random walk will fully mix, forgetting where it started, before it hits any label. Thus, the probability of hitting +1 before −1 will become uniform across the entire graph, independent of the starting location xi , yielding a ﬂat predictor. 5 Keeping σ Finite At this point, a reader may ask whether the problems found in higher dimensions are due to taking the limit σ → 0. One possible objection is that there is an intrinsic characteristic scale for the data σ0 where (with high probability) all points at a distance xi − xj < σ0 have the same label. If this is the case, then it may not necessarily make sense to take values of σ < σ0 in constructing W . However, keeping σ ﬁnite while taking the number of unlabeled points to inﬁnity does not resolve the problem. On the contrary, even the one-dimensional case becomes ill-posed in this case. To see this, consider a function y(x) which is zero everywhere except at the labeled points, where y(xj ) = yj . With a ﬁnite number of labeled points of measure zero, I (σ) (y) = 0 in any dimension 6 50 points 500 points 3500 points 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 −0.5 y 1 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 x Figure 3: Minimizer of (1) for a 1-d problem with a ﬁxed σ = 0.4, two labeled points and an increasing number of unlabeled points. and for any ﬁxed σ > 0. While this limiting function is discontinuous, it is also possible to construct ǫ→0 a sequence of continuous functions yǫ that all satisfy the constraints and for which I (σ) (yǫ ) −→ 0. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3. We generated data from a mixture of two 1-D Gaussians centered at the origin and at x = 4, with one Gaussian labeled −1 and the other +1. We used two labeled points at the centers of the Gaussians and an increasing number of randomly drawn unlabeled points. As predicted, with a ﬁxed σ, although the solution is reasonable when the number of unlabeled points is small, it becomes ﬂatter, with sharp spikes on the labeled points, as u → ∞. 6 Fourier-Eigenvector Based Methods Before we conclude, we discuss a different approach for SSL, also based on the Graph Laplacian, suggested by Belkin and Niyogi [3]. Instead of using the Laplacian as a regularizer, constraining candidate predictors y(x) non-parametrically to those with small In (y) values, here the predictors are constrained to the low-dimensional space spanned by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the Laplacian: The similarity matrix W is computed as before, and the Graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W is considered (recall D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij ). Only predictors p j=1 aj ej y (x) = ˆ (15) spanned by the ﬁrst p eigenvectors e1 , . . . , ep of L (with smallest eigenvalues) are considered. The coefﬁcients aj are chosen by minimizing a loss function on the labeled data, e.g. the squared loss: (ˆ1 , . . . , ap ) = arg min a ˆ l j=1 (yj − y (xj ))2 . ˆ (16) Unlike the Laplacian Regularization method (1), the Laplacian Eigenvector method (15)–(16) is well posed in the limit u → ∞. This follows directly from the convergence of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator [10, 4]. Eigenvector based methods were shown empirically to provide competitive generalization performance on a variety of simulated and real world problems. Belkin and Niyogi [3] motivate the approach by arguing that ‘the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator provide a natural basis for functions on the manifold and the desired classiﬁcation function can be expressed in such a basis’. In our view, the success of the method is actually not due to data lying on a low-dimensional manifold, but rather due to the low density separation assumption, which states that different class labels form high-density clusters separated by low density regions. Indeed, under this assumption and with sufﬁcient separation between the clusters, the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplace-Beltrami operator are approximately piecewise constant in each of the clusters, as in spectral clustering [12, 11], providing a basis for a labeling that is constant within clusters but variable across clusters. In other settings, such as data uniformly distributed on a manifold but without any signiﬁcant cluster structure, the success of eigenvector based methods critically depends on how well can the unknown classiﬁcation function be approximated by a truncated expansion with relatively few eigenvectors. We illustrate this issue with the following three-dimensional example: Let p(x) denote the uniform density in the box [0, 1] × [0, 0.8] × [0, 0.6], where the box lengths are different to prevent eigenvalue multiplicity. Consider learning three different functions, y1 (x) = 1x1 >0.5 , y2 (x) = 1x1 >x2 /0.8 and y3 (x) = 1x2 /0.8>x3 /0.6 . Even though all three functions are relatively simple, all having a linear separating boundary between the classes on the manifold, as shown in the experiment described in Figure 4, the Eigenvector based method (15)–(16) gives markedly different generalization performances on the three targets. This happens both when the number of eigenvectors p is set to p = l/5 as suggested by Belkin and Niyogi, as well as for the optimal (oracle) value of p selected on the test set (i.e. a “cheating” choice representing an upper bound on the generalization error of this method). 7 Prediction Error (%) p = #labeled points/5 40 optimal p 20 labeled points 40 Approx. Error 50 20 20 0 20 20 40 60 # labeled points 0 10 20 40 60 # labeled points 0 0 5 10 15 # eigenvectors 0 0 5 10 15 # eigenvectors Figure 4: Left three panels: Generalization Performance of the Eigenvector Method (15)–(16) for the three different functions described in the text. All panels use n = 3000 points. Prediction counts the number of sign agreements with the true labels. Rightmost panel: best ﬁt when many (all 3000) points are used, representing the best we can hope for with a few leading eigenvectors. The reason for this behavior is that y2 (x) and even more so y3 (x) cannot be as easily approximated by the very few leading eigenfunctions—even though they seem “simple” and “smooth”, they are signiﬁcantly more complicated than y1 (x) in terms of measure of simplicity implied by the Eigenvector Method. Since the density is uniform, the graph Laplacian converges to the standard Laplacian and its eigenfunctions have the form ψi,j,k (x) = cos(iπx1 ) cos(jπx2 /0.8) cos(kπx3 /0.6), making it hard to represent simple decision boundaries which are not axis-aligned. 7 Discussion Our results show that a popular SSL method, the Laplacian Regularization method (1), is not wellbehaved in the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, despite its empirical success in various SSL tasks. The empirical success might be due to two reasons. First, it is possible that with a large enough number of labeled points relative to the number of unlabeled points, the method is well behaved. This regime, where the number of both labeled and unlabeled points grow while l/u is ﬁxed, has recently been analyzed by Wasserman and Lafferty [9]. However, we do not ﬁnd this regime particularly satisfying as we would expect that having more unlabeled data available should improve performance, rather than require more labeled points or make the problem ill-posed. It also places the user in a delicate situation of choosing the “just right” number of unlabeled points without any theoretical guidance. Second, in our experiments we noticed that although the predictor y (x) becomes extremely ﬂat, in ˆ binary tasks, it is still typically possible to ﬁnd a threshold leading to a good classiﬁcation performance. We do not know of any theoretical explanation for such behavior, nor how to characterize it. Obtaining such an explanation would be very interesting, and in a sense crucial to the theoretical foundation of the Laplacian Regularization method. On a very practical level, such a theoretical understanding might allow us to correct the method so as to avoid the numerical instability associated with ﬂat predictors, and perhaps also make it appropriate for regression. The reason that the Laplacian regularizer (1) is ill-posed in the limit is that the ﬁrst order gradient is not a sufﬁcient penalty in high dimensions. This fact is well known in spline theory, where the Sobolev Embedding Theorem [1] indicates one must control at least d+1 derivatives in Rd . In the 2 context of Laplacian regularization, this can be done using the iterated Laplacian: replacing the d+1 graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W , where D is the diagonal degree matrix, with L 2 (matrix to d+1 the 2 power). In the inﬁnite unlabeled data limit, this corresponds to regularizing all order- d+1 2 (mixed) partial derivatives. In the typical case of a low-dimensional manifold in a high dimensional ambient space, the order of iteration should correspond to the intrinsic, rather then ambient, dimensionality, which poses a practical problem of estimating this usually unknown dimensionality. We are not aware of much practical work using the iterated Laplacian, nor a good understanding of its appropriateness for SSL. A different approach leading to a well-posed solution is to include also an ambient regularization term [5]. However, the properties of the solution and in particular its relation to various assumptions about the “smoothness” of y(x) relative to p(x) remain unclear.

Olshausen</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised manifold learning algorithm that represents a surface through a compact description of operators that traverse it. The operators are based on matrix exponentials, which are the solution to a system of ﬁrst-order linear differential equations. The matrix exponents are represented by a basis that is adapted to the statistics of the data so that the inﬁnitesimal generator for a trajectory along the underlying manifold can be produced by linearly composing a few elements. The method is applied to recover topological structure from low dimensional synthetic data, and to model local structure in how natural images change over time and scale. 1</p><p>6 0.089666687 <a title="146-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Nonlinear_Learning_using_Local_Coordinate_Coding.html">169 nips-2009-Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Kwang I. Kim, Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression based on the graph Laplacian suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the lack of extrapolating power. Based on these observations, we propose to use the second-order Hessian energy for semi-supervised regression which overcomes both these problems. If the data lies on or close to a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space, the Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. We ﬁrst derive the Hessian energy for smooth manifolds and continue to give a stable estimation procedure for the common case where only samples of the underlying manifold are given. The preference of ‘’linear” functions on manifolds renders the Hessian energy particularly suited for the task of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to ﬁnd a user-deﬁned embedding function given some labeled points which varies smoothly (and ideally linearly) along the manifold. The experimental results suggest superior performance of our method compared with semi-supervised regression using Laplacian regularization or standard supervised regression techniques applied to this task. 1</p><p>3 0.53534961 <a title="146-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Nonlinear_Learning_using_Local_Coordinate_Coding.html">169 nips-2009-Nonlinear Learning using Local Coordinate Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Tong Zhang, Yihong Gong</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a new method for semi-supervised learning on high dimensional nonlinear manifolds, which includes a phase of unsupervised basis learning and a phase of supervised function learning. The learned bases provide a set of anchor points to form a local coordinate system, such that each data point x on the manifold can be locally approximated by a linear combination of its nearby anchor points, and the linear weights become its local coordinate coding. We show that a high dimensional nonlinear function can be approximated by a global linear function with respect to this coding scheme, and the approximation quality is ensured by the locality of such coding. The method turns a difﬁcult nonlinear learning problem into a simple global linear learning problem, which overcomes some drawbacks of traditional local learning methods. 1</p><p>4 0.50191069 <a title="146-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.4817943 <a title="146-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Graph_Zeta_Function_in_the_Bethe_Free_Energy_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">103 nips-2009-Graph Zeta Function in the Bethe Free Energy and Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe, Kenji Fukumizu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to the analysis of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) by establishing a formula that connects the Hessian of the Bethe free energy with the edge zeta function. The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP. It is applied to give a sufﬁcient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive deﬁnite, which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles. The formula clariﬁes the relation between the local stability of a ﬁxed point of LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy. We also propose a new approach to the uniqueness of LBP ﬁxed point, and show various conditions of uniqueness. 1</p><p>6 0.45703891 <a title="146-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Submanifold_density_estimation.html">238 nips-2009-Submanifold density estimation</a></p>

<p>Author: Romain Brasselet, Roland Johansson, Angelo Arleo</p><p>Abstract: We study an encoding/decoding mechanism accounting for the relative spike timing of the signals propagating from peripheral nerve ﬁbers to second-order somatosensory neurons in the cuneate nucleus (CN). The CN is modeled as a population of spiking neurons receiving as inputs the spatiotemporal responses of real mechanoreceptors obtained via microneurography recordings in humans. The efﬁciency of the haptic discrimination process is quantiﬁed by a novel deﬁnition of entropy that takes into full account the metrical properties of the spike train space. This measure proves to be a suitable decoding scheme for generalizing the classical Shannon entropy to spike-based neural codes. It permits an assessment of neurotransmission in the presence of a large output space (i.e. hundreds of spike trains) with 1 ms temporal precision. It is shown that the CN population code performs a complete discrimination of 81 distinct stimuli already within 35 ms of the ﬁrst afferent spike, whereas a partial discrimination (80% of the maximum information transmission) is possible as rapidly as 15 ms. This study suggests that the CN may not constitute a mere synaptic relay along the somatosensory pathway but, rather, it may convey optimal contextual accounts (in terms of fast and reliable information transfer) of peripheral tactile inputs to downstream structures of the central nervous system. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.68857479 <a title="146-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Manifold_Regularization_for_SIR_with_Rate_Root-n_Convergence.html">146 nips-2009-Manifold Regularization for SIR with Rate Root-n Convergence</a></p>

<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on the statistical modeling of neural responses has focused on modulated renewal processes in which the spike rate is a function of the stimulus and recent spiking history. Typically, these models incorporate spike-history dependencies via either: (A) a conditionally-Poisson process with rate dependent on a linear projection of the spike train history (e.g., generalized linear model); or (B) a modulated non-Poisson renewal process (e.g., inhomogeneous gamma process). Here we show that the two approaches can be combined, resulting in a conditional renewal (CR) model for neural spike trains. This model captures both real-time and rescaled-time history effects, and can be ﬁt by maximum likelihood using a simple application of the time-rescaling theorem [1]. We show that for any modulated renewal process model, the log-likelihood is concave in the linear ﬁlter parameters only under certain restrictive conditions on the renewal density (ruling out many popular choices, e.g. gamma with shape κ = 1), suggesting that real-time history effects are easier to estimate than non-Poisson renewal properties. Moreover, we show that goodness-of-ﬁt tests based on the time-rescaling theorem [1] quantify relative-time effects, but do not reliably assess accuracy in spike prediction or stimulus-response modeling. We illustrate the CR model with applications to both real and simulated neural data. 1</p><p>4 0.5845682 <a title="146-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_Sparse_Non-Parametric_Approach_for_Single_Channel_Separation_of_Known_Sounds.html">17 nips-2009-A Sparse Non-Parametric Approach for Single Channel Separation of Known Sounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Paris Smaragdis, Madhusudana Shashanka, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm for separating mixed sounds from a monophonic recording. Our approach makes use of training data which allows us to learn representations of the types of sounds that compose the mixture. In contrast to popular methods that attempt to extract compact generalizable models for each sound from training data, we employ the training data itself as a representation of the sources in the mixture. We show that mixtures of known sounds can be described as sparse combinations of the training data itself, and in doing so produce signiﬁcantly better separation results as compared to similar systems based on compact statistical models.

<p>Author: Francois Caron, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: Over recent years Dirichlet processes and the associated Chinese restaurant process (CRP) have found many applications in clustering while the Indian buffet process (IBP) is increasingly used to describe latent feature models. These models are attractive because they ensure exchangeability (over samples). We propose here extensions of these models where the dependency between samples is given by a known decomposable graph. These models have appealing properties and can be easily learned using Monte Carlo techniques. 1 Motivation The CRP and IBP have found numerous applications in machine learning over recent years [5, 10]. We consider here the case where the data we are interested in are ‘locally’ dependent; these dependencies being represented by a known graph G where each data point/object is associated to a vertex. These local dependencies can correspond to any conceptual or real (e.g. space, time) metric. For example, in the context of clustering, we might want to propose a prior distribution on partitions enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to be in the same cluster. Similarly, in the context of latent feature models, we might be interested in a prior distribution on features enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to possess similar features. The ‘standard’ CRP and IBP correspond to the case where the graph G is complete; that is it is fully connected. In this paper, we generalize the CRP and IBP to decomposable graphs. The resulting generalized versions of the CRP and IBP enjoy attractive properties. Each clique of the graph follows marginally a CRP or an IBP process and explicit expressions for the joint prior distribution on the graph is available. It makes it easy to learn those models using straightforward generalizations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms proposed to perform inference for the CRP and IBP [5, 10, 14]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the popular Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and the Dirichlet Process (DP) partition distribution. We propose an extension of these two models to decomposable graphical models. In Section 3 we discuss nonparametric latent feature models, reviewing brieﬂy the construction in [5] and extending it to decomposable graphs. We demonstrate these models in Section 4 on two applications: an alternative to the hierarchical DP model [12] and a time-varying matrix factorization problem. 2 Prior distributions for partitions on decomposable graphs Assume we have n observations. When performing clustering, we associate to each of this observation an allocation variable zi ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K}. Let Πn be the partition of [n] = {1, . . . , n} deﬁned by the equivalence relation i ↔ j ⇔ zi = zj . The resulting partition Πn = {A1 , . . . , An(Πn ) } 1 is an unordered collection of disjoint non-empty subsets Aj of [n], j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), where ∪j Aj = [n] and n(Πn ) is the number of subsets for partition Πn . We also denote by Pn be the set of all partitions of [n] and let nj , j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), be the size of the subset Aj . Each allocation variable zi is associated to a vertex/site of an undirected graph G, which is assumed to be known. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we ﬁrst review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on z1:n , equivalently on Πn . We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs; see [2, 8] for an introduction to decomposable graphs. Finally we brieﬂy discuss the directed case. Note that the models proposed here are completely different from the hyper multinomial-Dirichlet in [2] and its recent DP extension [6]. 2.1 Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and DP partition distribution Assume for the time being that K is ﬁnite. When the graph is complete, a popular choice for the allocation variables is to consider a Dirichlet multinomial allocation model [11] θ θ , . . . , ), zi |π ∼ π (1) K K where D is the standard Dirichlet distribution and θ > 0. Integrating out π, we obtain the following Dirichlet multinomial prior distribution π ∼ D( Pr(z1:n ) = K j=1 Γ(θ) Γ(nj + θ K) (2) θ Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )K and then, using the straightforward equality Pr(Πn ) = PK where PK = {Πn ∈ Pn |n(Πn ) ≤ K}, we obtain K! (K−n(Πn ))! Pr(z1:n ) valid for for all Πn ∈ n(Π ) Pr(Πn ) = θ Γ(θ) j=1n Γ(nj + K ) K! . θ (K − n(Πn ))! Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )n(Πn ) (3) DP may be seen as a generalization of the Dirichlet multinomial model when the number of components K → ∞; see for example [10]. In this case the distribution over the partition Πn of [n] is given by [11] n(Π ) θn(Πn ) j=1n Γ(nj ) . (4) Pr(Πn ) = n i=1 (θ + i − 1) Let Π−k = {A1,−k , . . . , An(Π−k ),−k } be the partition induced by removing item k to Πn and nj,−k be the size of cluster j for j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ). It follows from (4) that an item k is assigned to an existing cluster j, j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to nj,−k / (n − 1 + θ) and forms a new cluster with probability θ/ (n − 1 + θ). This property is the basis of the CRP. We now extend the Dirichlet multinomial allocation and the DP partition distribution models to decomposable graphs. 2.2 Markov combination of Dirichlet multinomial and DP partition distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. It can be easily checked that if the marginal distribution of zC for each clique C ∈ C is deﬁned by (2) then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (2) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Dirichlet multinomial distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(zC ) S∈S Pr(zS ) C∈C Pr(z1:n ) = (5) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, we have Pr(zB ) given by (2). It follows that we have for any Πn ∈ PK Γ(θ) K! Pr(Πn ) = (K − n(Πn ))! C∈C Γ(θ) S∈S 2 K j=1 θ Γ(nj,C + K ) θ Γ(θ+nC )Γ( K )K K j=1 θ Γ(nj,S + K ) θ Γ(θ+nS )Γ( K )K (6) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items associated to cluster j, j = 1, . . . , K in B and nB is the total number of items in B. Within each complete set B, the allocation variables deﬁne a partition distributed according to the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We now extend this approach to DP partition distributions; that is we derive a joint distribution over Πn such that the distribution of ΠB over each complete set B of the graph is given by (4) with θ > 0. Such a distribution satisﬁes the consistency condition over the separators as the restriction of any partition distributed according to (4) still follows (4) [7]. G Proposition. Let Pn be the set of partitions Πn ∈ Pn such that for each decomposition A, B, and any (i, j) ∈ A × B, i ↔ j ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that k ↔ i ↔ j. As K → ∞, the prior distribution G over partitions (6) is given for each Πn ∈ Pn by Pr(Πn ) = θn(Πn ) n(ΠC ) Γ(nj,C ) j=1 nC i=1 (θ+i−1) n(ΠS ) Γ(nj,S ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 C∈C S∈S (7) where n(ΠB ) is the number of clusters in the complete set B. Proof. From (6), we have θ n(ΠC ) K(K − 1) . . . (K − n(Πn ) + 1) Pr(Πn ) = K C∈C n(ΠC )− S∈S n(ΠS ) C∈C θ n(ΠS ) S∈S n(ΠC ) θ Γ(nj,C + K ) j=1 nC (θ+i−1) i=1 n(ΠS ) θ Γ(nj,S + K ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 Thus when K → ∞, we obtain (7) if n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) and 0 otherwise. We have n(Πn ) ≤ C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) for any Πn ∈ Pn and the subset of Pn verifying G n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) corresponds to the set Pn . Example. Let the notation i ∼ j (resp. i j) indicates an edge (resp. no edge) between two sites. Let n = 3 and G be the decomposable graph deﬁned by the relations 1 ∼ 2, 2 ∼ 3 and 1 3. G The set P3 is then equal to {{{1, 2, 3}}; {{1, 2}, {3}}; {{1}, {2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}}}. Note that G the partition {{1, 3}, {2}} does not belong to P3 . Indeed, as there is no edge between 1 and 3, they cannot be in the same cluster if 2 is in another cluster. The cliques are C1 = {1, 2} and C2 = {2, 3} Pr(ΠC1 ) Pr(ΠC2 ) hence we can and the separator is S2 = {2}. The distribution is given by Pr(Π3 ) = Pr(ΠS ) 2 check that we obtain Pr({1, 2, 3}) = (θ + 1)−2 , Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = θ(θ + 1)−2 and Pr({1}, {2}, {3}) = θ2 (θ + 1)−2 . Let now deﬁne the full conditional distributions. Based on (7) the conditional assignment of an item k is proportional to the conditional over the cliques divided by the conditional over the separators. G Let denote G−k the undirected graph obtained by removing vertex k from G. Suppose that Πn ∈ Pn . G−k If Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , then do not change the value of item k. Otherwise, item k is assigned to cluster j / where j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ) with probability proportional to {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (8) and to a new cluster with probability proportional to θ, where n−k,j,C is the number of items in the set C \ {k} belonging to cluster j. The updating process is illustrated by the Chinese wedding party process1 in Fig. 1. The results of this section can be extended to the Pitman-Yor process, and more generally to species sampling models. Example (continuing). Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1}, A2 = {3}}, we have −1 Pr( item 2 assigned to A1 = {1}| Π−2 ) = Pr( item 2 assigned to A2 = {3}| Π−2 ) = (θ + 2) −1 and Pr( item 2 assigned to new cluster A3 | Π−2 ) = θ (θ + 2) . Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1, 3}}, item 2 is assigned to A1 with probability 1. 1 Note that this representation describes the full conditionals while the CRP represents the sequential updat- ing. 3 (a) (b) (d) (c) (e) Figure 1: Chinese wedding party. Consider a group of n guests attending a wedding party. Each of the n guests may belong to one or several cliques, i.e. maximal groups of people such that everybody knows everybody. The belonging of each guest to the different cliques is represented by color patches on the ﬁgures, and the graphical representation of the relationship between the guests is represented by the graphical model (e). (a) Suppose that the guests are already seated such that two guests cannot be together at the same table is they are not part of the same clique, or if there does not exist a group of other guests such that they are related (“Any friend of yours is a friend of mine”). (b) The guest number k leaves his table and either (c) joins a table where there are guests from the same clique as him, with probability proportional to the product of the number of guests from each clique over the product of the number of guests belonging to several cliques on that table or (d) he joins a new table with probability proportional to θ. 2.3 Monte Carlo inference 2.3.1 MCMC algorithm Using the full conditionals, a single site Gibbs sampler can easily be designed to approximate the posterior distribution Pr(Πn |z1:n ). Given a partition Πn , an item k is taken out of the partition. If G−k Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , item k keeps the same value. Otherwise, the item will be assigned to a cluster j, / j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to p(z{k}∪Aj,−k ) × p(zAj,−k ) {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (9) and the item will be assigned to a new cluster with probability proportional to p(z{k} ) × θ. Similarly to [3], we can also deﬁne a procedure to sample from p(θ|n(Πn ) = k)). We assume that θ ∼ G(a, b) and use p auxiliary variables x1 , . . . , xp . The procedure is as follows. • For j = 1, . . . , p, sample xj |k, θ ∼ Beta(θ + nSj , nCj − nSj ) • Sample θ|k, x1:p ∼ G(a + k, b − j log xj ) 2.3.2 Sequential Monte Carlo We have so far only treated the case of an undirected decomposable graph G. We can formulate a sequential updating rule for the corresponding perfect directed version D of G. Indeed, let (a1 , . . . a|V | ) be a perfect ordering and pa(ak ) be the set of parents of ak which is by deﬁnition complete. Let Πk−1 = {A1,k−1 , . . . , An(Πk−1 ),k−1 } denote the partition of the ﬁrst k−1 vertices a1:k−1 and let nj,pa(ak ) be the number of elements with value j in the set pa(ak ), j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ). Then the vertex ak joins the set j with probability nj,pa(ak ) / θ + cluster with probability θ/ θ + q q nq,pa(ak ) and creates a new nq,pa(ak ) . One can then design a particle ﬁlter/SMC method in a similar fashion as [4]. Consider a set of (i) (i) (i) (i) N N particles Πk−1 with weights wk−1 ∝ Pr(Πk−1 , z1:k−1 ) ( i=1 wk−1 = 1) that approximate (i) the posterior distribution Pr(Πk−1 |z1:k−1 ). For each particle i, there are n(Πk−1 ) + 1 possible 4 (i,j) allocations for component ak . We denote Πk the partition obtained by associating component ak (i,j) to cluster j. The weight associated to Πk is given by  nj,pa(ak ) (i)  if j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ) θ+ q nq,pa(ak ) (i,j) (i) p(z{ak }∪Aj,k−1 ) wk−1 = wk−1 × (10) (i) θ  θ+ n p(zAj,k−1 ) if j = n(Πk−1 ) + 1 q q,pa(ak ) (i,j) Then we can perform a deterministic resampling step by keeping the N particles Πk with highest (i,j) (i) (i) weights wk−1 . Let Πk be the resampled particles and wk the associated normalized weights. 3 Prior distributions for inﬁnite binary matrices on decomposable graphs Assume we have n objects; each of these objects being associated to the vertex of a graph G. To K each object is associated a K-dimensional binary vector zn = (zn,1 , . . . , zn,K ) ∈ {0, 1} where zn,i = 1 if object n possesses feature i and zn,i = 0 otherwise. These vectors zt form a binary n × K matrix denoted Z1:n . We denote by ξ1:n the associated equivalence class of left-ordered matrices and let EK be the set of left-ordered matrices with at most K features. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on Z1:n , equivalently on ξ1:n : the Beta-Bernoulli model and the IBP [5]. We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs. This can be used for example to deﬁne a time-varying IBP as illustrated in Section 4. 3.1 Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions The Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the allocation Z1:n is K Pr(Z1:n ) = α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) α K Γ(nj j=1 (11) where nj is the number of objects having feature j. It follows that Pr(ξ1:n ) = K K! 2n −1 h=0 α K Γ(nj α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) Kh ! j=1 (12) where Kh is the number of features possessing the history h (see [5] for details). The nonparametric model is obtained by taking the limit when K → ∞ Pr(ξ1:n ) = αK K+ + 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! exp(−αHn ) where K + is the total number of features and Hn = 3.2 (n − nj )!(nj − 1)! n! j=1 n 1 k=1 k . (13) The IBP follows from (13). Markov combination of Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. As in the Dirichlet-multinomial case, it is easily seen that if for each clique C ∈ C, the marginal distribution is deﬁned by (11), then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (11) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(ZC ) S∈S Pr(ZS ) C∈C Pr(Z1:n ) = (14) where Pr(ZB ) given by (11) for each complete set B ⊆ G. The prior over ξ1:n is thus given, for ξ1:n ∈ EK , by Pr(ξ1:n ) = K! 2n −1 h=0 Kh ! α K α Γ(nj,C + K )Γ(nC −nj,C +1) α Γ(nC +1+ K ) α α Γ(nj,S + K )Γ(nS −nj,S +1) K K α j=1 Γ(nS +1+ K ) K j=1 C∈C S∈S 5 (15) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items having feature j, j = 1, . . . , K in the set B and nB is the whole set of objects in set B. Taking the limit when K → ∞, we obtain after a few calculations Pr(ξ1:n ) = α + K[n] exp [−α ( C HnC − 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! HnS )] × C∈C + KC (nC −nj,C )!(nj,C −1)! j=1 nC ! S∈S S + KS (nS −nj,S )!(nj,S −1)! j=1 nS ! + + + + if K[n] = C KC − S KS and 0 otherwise, where KB is the number of different features possessed by objects in B. G Let En be the subset of En such that for each decomposition A, B and any (u, v) ∈ A × B: {u and v possess feature j} ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that {k possesses feature j}. Let ξ−k be the left-ordered + matrix obtained by removing object k from ξn and K−k be the total number of different features in G−k + ξ−k . For each feature j = 1, . . . , K−k , if ξ−k ∈ En−1 then we have   b C∈C nj,C if i = 1 S∈C nj,S Pr(ξk,j = i) = (16)  b C∈C (nC −nj,C ) if i = 0 (nS −nj,S ) S∈C nS where b is the appropriate normalizing constant then the customer k tries Poisson α {S∈S|k∈S} nC {C∈C|k∈C} new dishes. We can easily generalize this construction to a directed version D of G using arguments similar to those presented in Section 2; see Section 4 for an application to time-varying matrix factorization. 4 4.1 Applications Sharing clusters among relative groups: An alternative to HDP Consider that we are given d groups with nj data yi,j in each group, i = 1, . . . , nj , j = 1, . . . , d. We consider latent cluster variables zi,j that deﬁne the partition of the data. We will use alternatively the notation θi,j = Uzi,j in the following. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process [12] (HDP) is a very popular model for sharing clusters among related groups. It is based on a hierarchy of DPs G0 ∼ DP (γ, H), Gj |G0 ∼ DP (α, G0 ) j = 1, . . . d θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj . Under conjugacy assumptions, G0 , Gj and U can be integrated out and we can approximate the marginal posterior of (zi,j ) given y = (yi,j ) with Gibbs sampling using the Chinese restaurant franchise to sample from the full conditional p(zi,j |z−{i,j} , y). Using the graph formulation deﬁned in Section 2, we propose an alternative to HDP. Let θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N be N auxiliary variables belonging to what we call group 0. We deﬁne each clique Cj (j = 1, . . . , d) to be composed of elements from group j and elements from group 0. This deﬁnes a decomposable graphical model whose separator is given by the elements of group 0. We can rewrite the model in a way quite similar to HDP G0 ∼ DP (α, H), θ0,i |G0 ∼ G0 i = 1, ..., N α α Gj |θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N ∼ DP (α + N, α+N H + α+N θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj N i=1 δθ0,i ) j = 1, . . . d, N For any subset A and j = k ∈ {1, . . . , p} we have corr(Gj (A), Gk (A)) = α+N . Again, under conjugacy conditions, we can integrate out G0 , Gj and U and approximate the marginal posterior distribution over the partition using the Chinese wedding party process deﬁned in Section 2. Note that for latent variables zi,j , j = 1, . . . , d, associated to data, this is the usual CRP update. As in HDP, multiple layers can be added to the model. Figures 2 (a) and (b) resp. give the graphical DP alternative to HDP and 2-layer HDP. 6 z0 root z0 root corpora docs z1 z2 z1 z2 z3 z1,1 z1,2 z2,1 z2,2 z2,3 docs (a) Graphical DP alternative to HDP (b) Graphical DP alternative to 2-layer HDP Figure 2: Hierarchical Graphs of dependency with (a) one layer and (b) two layers of hierarchy. If N = 0, then Gj ∼ DP (α, H) for all j and this is equivalent to setting γ → ∞ in HDP. If N → ∞ then Gj = G0 for all j, G0 ∼ DP (α, H). This is equivalent to setting α → ∞ in the HDP. One interesting feature of the model is that, contrary to HDP, the marginal distribution of Gj at any layer of the tree is DP (α, H). As a consequence, the total number of clusters scales logarithmically (as in the usual DP) with the size of each group, whereas it scales doubly logarithmically in HDP. Contrary to HDP, there are at most N clusters shared between different groups. Our model is in that sense reminiscent of [9] where only a limited number of clusters can be shared. Note however that contrary to [9] we have a simple CRP-like process. The proposed methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the inﬁnite HMM [12]. The main issue of the proposed model is the setting of the number N of auxiliary parameters. Another issue is that to achieve high correlation, we need a large number of auxiliary variables. Nonetheless, the computational time used to sample from auxiliary variables is negligible compared to the time used for latent variables associated to data. Moreover, it can be easily parallelized. The model proposed offers a far richer framework and ensures that at each level of the tree, the marginal distribution of the partition is given by a DP partition model. 4.2 Time-varying matrix factorization Let X1:n be an observed matrix of dimension n × D. We want to ﬁnd a representation of this matrix in terms of two latent matrices Z1:n of dimension n × K and Y of dimension K × D. Here Z1:n 2 is a binary matrix whereas Y is a matrix of latent features. By assuming that Y ∼ N 0, σY IK×D and 2 X1:n = Z1:n Y + σX εn where εn ∼ N 0, σX In×D , we obtain p(X1:n |Z1:n ) ∝ −D/2 2 2 + Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn 1:n 1:n + (n−Kn )D σX exp − + Kn D σY 2 2 + where Σ−1 = I − Z+ Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn n 1:n 1:n 1:n −1 1 T −1 2 tr X1:n Σn X1:n 2σX (17) + Z+T , Kn the number of non-zero columns of 1:n + Z1:n and Z+ is the ﬁrst Kn columns of Z1:n . To avoid having to set K, [5, 14] assume that Z1:n 1:n follows an IBP. The resulting posterior distribution p(Z1:n |X1:n ) can be estimated through MCMC [5] or SMC [14]. We consider here a different model where the object Xt is assumed to arrive at time index t and we want a prior distribution on Z1:n ensuring that objects close in time are more likely to possess similar features. To achieve this, we consider the simple directed graphical model D of Fig. 3 where the site numbering corresponds to a time index in that case and a perfect numbering of D is (1, 2, . . .). The set of parents pa(t) is composed of the r preceding sites {{t − r}, . . . , {t − 1}}. The time-varying IBP to sample from p(Z1:n ) associated to this directed graph follows from (16) and proceeds as follows. At time t = 1 + new new • Sample K1 ∼Poisson(α), set z1,i = 1 for i = 1, ..., K1 and set K1 = Knew . At times t = 2, . . . , r n + new ∼Poisson( α ). • For k = 1, . . .

Using (17) and the prior distribution of Z1:n which can be sampled using the time-varying IBP described above, we can easily design an SMC method to sample from p(Z1:n |X1:n ). We do not detail it here. Note that contrary to [14], our algorithm does not require inverting a matrix whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the data but only a matrix of dimension r × r. In order to illustrate the model and SMC algorithm, we create 200 6 × 6 images using a ground truth Y consisting of 4 different 6 × 6 latent images. The 200 × 4 binary matrix was generated from Pr(zt,k = 1) = πt,k , where πt = ( .6 .5 0 0 ) if t = 1, . . . , 30, πt = ( .4 .8 .4 0 ) if t = 31, . . . , 50 and πt = ( 0 .3 .6 .6 ) if t = 51, . . . , 200. The order of the model is set to r = 50. The feature occurences Z1:n and true features Y and their estimates are represented in Figure 4. Two spurious features are detected by the model (features 2 and 5 on Fig. 3(c)) but quickly discarded (Fig. 4(d)). The algorithm is able to correctly estimate the varying prior occurences of the features over time.

[1] is a special case of the proposed model when G is given by Fig. 3. The bivariate DP of Walker and Muliere [13] is also a special case when G has only two cliques. In this paper, we have assumed that the structure of the graph was known beforehand and we have shown that many ﬂexible models arise from this framework. It would be interesting in the future to investigate the case where the graphical structure is unknown and must be estimated from the data.

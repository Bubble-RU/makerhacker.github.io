<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Colin Campbell, Mark Girolami</p><p>Abstract: The recent introduction of indeﬁnite SVM by Luss and d’Aspremont [15] has effectively demonstrated SVM classiﬁcation with a non-positive semi-deﬁnite kernel (indeﬁnite kernel). This paper studies the properties of the objective function introduced there. In particular, we show that the objective function is continuously differentiable and its gradient can be explicitly computed. Indeed, we further show that its gradient is Lipschitz continuous. The main idea behind our analysis is that the objective function is smoothed by the penalty term, in its saddle (min-max) representation, measuring the distance between the indeﬁnite kernel matrix and the proxy positive semi-deﬁnite one. Our elementary result greatly facilitates the application of gradient-based algorithms. Based on our analysis, we further develop Nesterov’s smooth optimization approach [17, 18] for indeﬁnite SVM which has an optimal convergence rate for smooth problems. Experiments on various benchmark datasets validate our analysis and demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed algorithms.</p><p>4 0.1365549 <a title="223-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Positive_Semidefinite_Metric_Learning_with_Boosting.html">191 nips-2009-Positive Semidefinite Metric Learning with Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The learning of appropriate distance metrics is a critical problem in image classiﬁcation and retrieval. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One of the primary difﬁculties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the Mahalanobis matrix remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on a key observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement, does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time. 1</p><p>5 0.098925397 <a title="223-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_Bregman_Distance_Functions_and_Its_Application_for_Semi-Supervised_Clustering.html">126 nips-2009-Learning Bregman Distance Functions and Its Application for Semi-Supervised Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Wu, Rong Jin, Steven C. Hoi, Jianke Zhu, Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Learning distance functions with side information plays a key role in many machine learning and data mining applications. Conventional approaches often assume a Mahalanobis distance function. These approaches are limited in two aspects: (i) they are computationally expensive (even infeasible) for high dimensional data because the size of the metric is in the square of dimensionality; (ii) they assume a ﬁxed metric for the entire input space and therefore are unable to handle heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that learns nonlinear Bregman distance functions from side information using a nonparametric approach that is similar to support vector machines. The proposed scheme avoids the assumption of ﬁxed metric by implicitly deriving a local distance from the Hessian matrix of a convex function that is used to generate the Bregman distance function. We also present an efﬁcient learning algorithm for the proposed scheme for distance function learning. The extensive experiments with semi-supervised clustering show the proposed technique (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for distance function learning, and (ii) is computationally efﬁcient for high dimensional data. 1</p><p>6 0.09610492 <a title="223-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Convex_Relaxation_of_Mixture_Regression_with_Efficient_Algorithms.html">61 nips-2009-Convex Relaxation of Mixture Regression with Efficient Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Marco Grzegorczyk, Dirk Husmeier</p><p>Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks have been applied widely to reconstruct the structure of regulatory processes from time series data. The standard approach is based on the assumption of a homogeneous Markov chain, which is not valid in many realworld scenarios. Recent research efforts addressing this shortcoming have considered undirected graphs, directed graphs for discretized data, or over-ﬂexible models that lack any information sharing among time series segments. In the present article, we propose a non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network for continuous data, in which parameters are allowed to vary among segments, and in which a common network structure provides essential information sharing across segments. Our model is based on a Bayesian multiple change-point process, where the number and location of the change-points is sampled from the posterior distribution. 1</p><p>4 0.62681454 <a title="223-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Streaming_k-means_approximation.html">234 nips-2009-Streaming k-means approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Nir Ailon, Ragesh Jaiswal, Claire Monteleoni</p><p>Abstract: We provide a clustering algorithm that approximately optimizes the k-means objective, in the one-pass streaming setting. We make no assumptions about the data, and our algorithm is very light-weight in terms of memory, and computation. This setting is applicable to unsupervised learning on massive data sets, or resource-constrained devices. The two main ingredients of our theoretical work are: a derivation of an extremely simple pseudo-approximation batch algorithm for k-means (based on the recent k-means++), in which the algorithm is allowed to output more than k centers, and a streaming clustering algorithm in which batch clustering algorithms are performed on small inputs (ﬁtting in memory) and combined in a hierarchical manner. Empirical evaluations on real and simulated data reveal the practical utility of our method. 1</p><p>5 0.62672025 <a title="223-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcel V. Gerven, Botond Cseke, Robert Oostenveld, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the speciﬁcation of constraints between and within sources. We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efﬁcient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior. 1</p><p>6 0.62456071 <a title="223-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-An_Online_Algorithm_for_Large_Scale_Image_Similarity_Learning.html">32 nips-2009-An Online Algorithm for Large Scale Image Similarity Learning</a></p>

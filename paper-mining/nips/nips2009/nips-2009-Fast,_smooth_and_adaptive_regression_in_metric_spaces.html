<p>Author: Odalric Maillard, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning, from K data, a regression function in a linear space of high dimension N using projections onto a random subspace of lower dimension M . From any algorithm minimizing the (possibly penalized) empirical risk, we provide bounds on the excess risk of the estimate computed in the projected subspace (compressed domain) in terms of the excess risk of the estimate built in the high-dimensional space (initial domain). We show that solving the problem in the compressed domain instead of the initial domain reduces the estimation error at the price of an increased (but controlled) approximation error. We apply the analysis to Least-Squares (LS) regression and discuss the excess risk and numerical complexity of the resulting “Compressed Least Squares Re√ gression” (CLSR) in terms of N , K, and M . When we choose M = O( K), we √ show that CLSR has an estimation error of order O(log K/ K). 1 Problem setting We consider a regression problem where we observe data DK = ({xk , yk }k≤K ) (where xk ∈ X and yk ∈ R) are assumed to be independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from some distribution P , where xk ∼ PX and yk = f ∗ (xk ) + ηk (xk ), where f ∗ is the (unknown) target function, and ηk a centered independent noise of variance σ 2 (xk ). For a given class of functions F, and f ∈ F, we deﬁne the empirical (quadratic) error def LK (f ) = 1 K K [yk − f (xk )]2 , k=1 and the generalization (quadratic) error def L(f ) = E(X,Y )∼P [(Y − f (X))2 ]. Our goal is to return a regression function f ∈ F with lowest possible generalization error L(f ). Notations: In the sequel we will make use of the following notations about norms: for h : X → R, we write ||h||P for the L2 norm of h with respect to (w.r.t.) the measure P , ||h||PK for the L2 norm n 2 1/2 of h w.r.t. the empirical measure PK , and for u ∈ Rn , ||u|| denotes by default . i=1 ui The measurable function minimizing the generalization error is f ∗ , but it may be the case that f ∗ ∈ F. For any regression function f , we deﬁne the excess risk / L(f ) − L(f ∗ ) = ||f − f ∗ ||2 , P which decomposes as the sum of the estimation error L(f ) − inf f ∈F L(f ) and the approximation error inf f ∈F L(f ) − L(f ∗ ) = inf f ∈F ||f − f ∗ ||2 which measures the distance between f ∗ and the P function space F. 1 In this paper we consider a class of linear functions FN deﬁned as the span of a set of N functions def def N {ϕn }1≤n≤N called features. Thus: FN = {fα = n=1 αn ϕn , α ∈ RN }. When the number of data K is larger than the number of features N , the ordinary Least-Squares Regression (LSR) provides the LS solution fα which is the minimizer of the empirical risk LK (f ) b 1 in FN . Note that here LK (fα ) rewrites K ||Φα − Y ||K where Φ is the K × N matrix with elements (ϕn (xk ))1≤n≤N,1≤k≤K and Y the K-vector with components (yk )1≤k≤K . Usual results provide bound on the estimation error as a function of the capacity of the function space and the number of data. In the case of linear approximation, the capacity measures (such as covering numbers [23] or the pseudo-dimension [16]) depend on the number of features (for example the pseudo-dimension is at most N + 1). For example, let fα be a LS estimate (minimizer of LK b in FN ), then (a more precise statement will be stated later in Subsection 3) the expected estimation error is bounded as: N log K E L(fα ) − inf L(f ) ≤ cσ2 , (1) b f ∈FN K def where c is a universal constant, σ = supx∈X σ(x), and the expectation is taken with respect to P . Now, the excess risk is the sum of this estimation error and the approximation error inf f ∈FN ||f − f ∗ ||P of the class FN . Since the later usually decreases when the number of features N increases [13] (e.g. when N FN is dense in L2 (P )), we see the usual tradeoff between small estimation error (low N ) and small approximation error (large N ). In this paper we are interested in the setting when N is large so that the approximation error is small. Whenever N is larger than K we face the overﬁtting problem since there are more parameters than actual data (more variables than constraints), which is illustrated in the bound (1) which provides no information about the generalization ability of any LS estimate. In addition, there are many minimizers (in fact a vector space of same dimension as the null space of ΦT Φ) of the empirical risk. To overcome the problem, several approaches have been proposed in the literature: • LS solution with minimal norm: The solution is the minimizer of the empirical error with minimal (l1 or l2 )-norm: α = arg minΦα=Y ||α||1 or 2 , (or a robust solution arg min||Φα−Y ||2 ≤ε ||α||1 ). The choice of 2 -norm yields the ordinary LS solution. The choice of 1 -norm has been used for generating sparse solutions (e.g. the Basis Pursuit [10]), and assuming that the target function admits a sparse decomposition, the ﬁeld of Compressed Sensing [9, 21] provides sufﬁcient conditions for recovering the exact solution. However, such conditions (e.g. that Φ possesses a Restricted Isometric Property (RIP)) does not hold in general in this regression setting. On another aspect, solving these problems (both for l1 or l2 -norm) when N is large is numerically expensive. • Regularization. The solution is the minimizer of the empirical error plus a penalty term, for example f = arg min LK (f ) + λ||f ||p , for p = 1 or 2. p f ∈FN where λ is a parameter and usual choices for the norm are 2 (ridge-regression [20]) and 1 (LASSO [19]). A close alternative is the Dantzig selector [8, 5] which solves: α = arg min||α||1 ≤λ ||ΦT (Y − Φα)||∞ . The numerical complexity and generalization bounds of those methods depend on the sparsity of the target function decomposition in FN . Now if we possess a sequence of function classes (FN )N ≥1 with increasing capacity, we may perform structural risk minimization [22] by solving in each model the empirical risk penalized by a term that depends on the size of the model: fN = arg minf ∈FN ,N ≥1 LK (f ) + pen(N, K), where the penalty term measures the capacity of the function space. In this paper we follow another approach where instead of searching in the large space FN (where N > K) for a solution that minimizes the empirical error plus a penalty term, we simply search for the empirical error minimizer in a (randomly generated) lower dimensional subspace GM ⊂ FN (where M < K). Our contribution: We consider a set of M random linear combinations of the initial N features and perform our favorite LS regression algorithm (possibly regularized) using those “compressed 2 features”. This is equivalent to projecting the K points {ϕ(xk ) ∈ RN , k = 1..K} from the initial domain (of size N ) onto a random subspace of dimension M , and then performing the regression in the “compressed domain” (i.e. span of the compressed features). This is made possible because random projections approximately preserve inner products between vectors (by a variant of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss Lemma stated in Proposition 1. Our main result is a bound on the excess risk of a linear estimator built in the compressed domain in terms of the excess risk of the linear estimator built in the initial domain (Section 2). We further detail the case of ordinary Least-Squares Regression (Section 3) and discuss, in terms of M , N , K, the different tradeoffs concerning the excess risk (reduced estimation error in the compressed domain versus increased approximation error introduced by the random projection) and the numerical complexity (reduced complexity of solving the LSR in the compressed domain versus the additional load of performing the projection). √ As a consequence, we show that by choosing M = O( K) projections we deﬁne a Compressed Least-Squares Regression which uses O(N K 3/2 ) elementary operations to compute a regression √ function with estimation error (relatively to the initial function space FN ) of order log K/ K up to a multiplicative factor which depends on the best approximation of f ∗ in FN . This is competitive with the best methods, up to our knowledge. Related works: Using dimension reduction and random projections in various learning areas has received considerable interest over the past few years. In [7], the authors use a SVM algorithm in a compressed space for the purpose of classiﬁcation and show that their resulting algorithm has good generalization properties. In [25], the authors consider a notion of compressed linear regression. For data Y = Xβ + ε, where β is the target and ε a standard noise, they use compression of the set of data, thus considering AY = AXβ + Aε, where A has a Restricted Isometric Property. They provide an analysis of the LASSO estimator built from these compressed data, and discuss a property called sparsistency, i.e. the number of random projections needed to recover β (with high probability) when it is sparse. These works differ from our approach in the fact that we do not consider a compressed (input and/or output) data space but a compressed feature space instead. In [11], the authors discuss how compressed measurements may be useful to solve many detection, classiﬁcation and estimation problems without having to reconstruct the signal ever. Interestingly, they make no assumption about the signal being sparse, like in our work. In [6, 17], the authors show how to map a kernel k(x, y) = ϕ(x) · ϕ(y) into a low-dimensional space, while still approximately preserving the inner products. Thus they build a low-dimensional feature space speciﬁc for (translation invariant) kernels. 2 Linear regression in the compressed domain We remind that the initial set of features is {ϕn : X → def N FN = {fα = n=1 αn ϕn , α ∈ components (ϕn (x))n≤N . Let us R, 1 ≤ n ≤ N } and the initial domain R } is the span of those features. We write ϕ(x) the N -vector of N now deﬁne the random projection. Let A be a M × N matrix of i.i.d. elements drawn for some distribution ρ. Examples of distributions are: • Gaussian random variables N (0, 1/M ), √ • ± Bernoulli distributions, i.e. which takes values ±1/ M with equal probability 1/2, • Distribution taking values ± 3/M with probability 1/6 and 0 with probability 2/3. The following result (proof in the supplementary material) states the property that inner-product are approximately preserved through random projections (this is a simple consequence of the JohnsonLindenstrauss Lemma): Proposition 1 Let (uk )1≤k≤K and v be vectors of RN . Let A be a M × N matrix of i.i.d. elements drawn from one of the previously deﬁned distributions. For any ε > 0, δ > 0, for M ≥ ε2 1 ε3 log 4K , we have, with probability at least 1 − δ, for all k ≤ K, δ 4 − 6 |Auk · Av − uk · v| ≤ ε||uk || ||v||. 3 def We now introduce the set of M compressed features (ψm )1≤m≤M such that ψm (x) = N We also write ψ(x) the M -vector of components (ψm (x))m≤M . Thus n=1 Am,n ϕn (x). ψ(x) = Aϕ(x). We deﬁne the compressed domain GM = {gβ = m=1 βm ψm , β ∈ RM } the span of the compressed features (vector space of dimension at most M ). Note that each ψm ∈ FN , thus GM is a subspace of FN . def 2.1 M Approximation error We now compare the approximation error assessed in the compressed domain GM versus in the initial space FN . This applies to the linear algorithms mentioned in the introduction such as ordinary LS regression (analyzed in details in Section 3), but also its penalized versions, e.g. LASSO and ridge regression. Deﬁne α+ = arg minα∈RN L(fα ) − L(f ∗ ) the parameter of the best regression function in FN . Theorem 1 For any δ > 0, any M ≥ 15 log(8K/δ), let A be a random M × N matrix deﬁned like in Proposition 1, and GM be the compressed domain resulting from this choice of A. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, inf ||g−f ∗ ||2 ≤ P g∈GM 8 log(8K/δ) + 2 ||α || M E ||ϕ(X)||2 +2 sup ||ϕ(x)||2 x∈X log 4/δ + inf ||f −f ∗ ||2 . P f ∈FN 2K (2) This theorem shows the tradeoff in terms of estimation and approximation errors for an estimator g obtained in the compressed domain compared to an estimator f obtained in the initial domain: • Bounds on the estimation error of g in GM are usually smaller than that of f in FN when M < N (since the capacity of FN is larger than that of GM ). • Theorem 1 says that the approximation error assessed in GM increases by at most O( log(K/δ) )||α+ ||2 E||ϕ(X)||2 compared to that in FN . M def def Proof: Let us write f + = fα+ = arg minf ∈FN ||f − f ∗ ||P and g + = gAα+ . The approximation error assessed in the compressed domain GM is bounded as inf ||g − f ∗ ||2 P g∈GM ≤ ||g + − f ∗ ||2 = ||g + − f + ||2 + ||f + − f ∗ ||2 , P P P (3) since f + is the orthogonal projection of f ∗ on FN and g + belongs to FN . We now bound ||g + − def def f + ||2 using concentration inequalities. Deﬁne Z(x) = Aα+ · Aϕ(x) − α+ · ϕ(x). Deﬁne ε2 = P log(8K/δ) 8 M log(8K/δ). For M ≥ 15 log(8K/δ) we have ε < 3/4 thus M ≥ ε2 /4−ε3 /6 . Proposition 1 applies and says that on an event E of probability at least 1 − δ/2, we have for all k ≤ K, def |Z(xk )| ≤ ε||α+ || ||ϕ(xk )|| ≤ ε||α+ || sup ||ϕ(x)|| = C (4) x∈X On the event E, we have with probability at least 1 − δ , ||g + − f + ||2 P = ≤ ≤ EX∼PX |Z(X)|2 ≤ ε2 ||α+ ||2 ε2 ||α+ ||2 1 K 1 K K |Z(xk )|2 + C 2 k=1 K ||ϕ(xk )||2 + sup ||ϕ(x)||2 x∈X k=1 E ||ϕ(X)||2 + 2 sup ||ϕ(x)||2 x∈X log(2/δ ) 2K log(2/δ ) 2K log(2/δ ) . 2K where we applied two times Chernoff-Hoeffding’s inequality. Combining with (3), unconditioning, and setting δ = δ/2 then with probability at least (1 − δ/2)(1 − δ ) ≥ 1 − δ we have (2). 4 2.2 Computational issues We now discuss the relative computational costs of a given algorithm applied either in the initial or in the compressed domain. Let us write Cx(DK , FN , P ) the complexity (e.g. number of elementary operations) of an algorithm A to compute the regression function f when provided with the data DK and function space FN . We plot in the table below, both for the initial and the compressed versions of the algorithm A, the order of complexity for (i) the cost for building the feature matrix, (ii) the cost for computing the estimator, (iii) the cost for making one prediction (i.e. computing f (x) for any x): Construction of the feature matrix Computing the regression function Making one prediction Initial domain NK Cx(DK , FN , P ) N Compressed domain N KM Cx(DK , GM , P ) NM Note that the values mentioned for the compressed domain are upper-bounds on the real complexity and do not take into account the possible sparsity of the projection matrix A (which would speed up matrix computations, see e.g. [2, 1]). 3 Compressed Least-Squares Regression We now analyze the speciﬁc case of Least-Squares Regression. 3.1 Excess risk of ordinary Least Squares regression In order to bound the estimation error, we follow the approach of [13] which truncates (up to the level ±L where L is a bound, assumed to be known, on ||f ∗ ||∞ ) the prediction of the LS regression function. The ordinary LS regression provides the regression function fα where b α= argmin α∈argminα ∈ RN ||α||. ||Y −Φα || Note that ΦΦT α = ΦT Y , hence α = Φ† Y ∈ RN where Φ† is the Penrose pseudo-inverse of Φ1 . def Then the truncated predictor is: fL (x) = TL [fα (x)], where b def TL (u) = u if |u| ≤ L, L sign(u) otherwise. Truncation after the computation of the parameter α ∈ RN , which is the solution of an unconstrained optimization problem, is easier than solving an optimization problem under the constraint that ||α|| is small (which is the approach followed in [23]) and allows for consistency results and prediction bounds. Indeed, the excess risk of fL is bounded as 1 + log K E(||f − f ∗ ||2 ) ≤ c max{σ2 , L2 } N + 8 inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 (5) P P f ∈FN K where a bound on c is 9216 (see [13]). We have a simpler bound when we consider the expectation EY conditionally on the input data: N EY (||f − f ∗ ||2 K ) ≤ σ2 + inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 K (6) P P K f ∈F Remark: Note that because we use the quadratic loss function, by following the analysis in [3], or by deriving tight bounds on the Rademacher complexity [14] and following Theorem 5.2 of Koltchinskii’s Saint Flour course, it is actually possible to state assumptions under which we can remove the log K term in (5). We will not further detail such bounds since our motivation here is not to provide the tightest possible bounds, but rather to show how the excess risk bound for LS regression in the initial domain extends to the compressed domain. 1 In the full rank case, Φ† = (ΦT Φ)−1 ΦT when K ≥ N and Φ† = ΦT (ΦΦT )−1 when K ≤ N 5 3.2 Compressed Least-Squares Regression (CLSR) CLSR is deﬁned as the ordinary LSR in the compressed domain. Let β = Ψ† Y ∈ RM , where Ψ is the K × M matrix with elements (ψm (xk ))1≤m≤M,1≤k≤K . The CLSR estimate is deﬁned as def gL (x) = TL [gβ (x)]. From Theorem 1, (5) and (6), we deduce the following excess risk bounds for b the CLSR estimate: √ ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 K log(8K/δ) Corollary 1 For any δ > 0, set M = 8 max(σ,L) c (1+log K) . Then whenever M ≥ 15 log(8K/δ), with probability at least 1 − δ, the expected excess risk of the CLSR estimate is bounded as √ E(||gL − f ∗ ||2 ) ≤ 16 c max{σ, L}||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 P × 1+ supx ||ϕ(x)||2 E||ϕ(X)||2 (1 + log K) log(8K/δ) K log 4/δ + 8 inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 . P f ∈FN 2K (7) √ ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 Now set M = 8K log(8K/δ). Assume N > K and that the features (ϕk )1≤k≤K σ are linearly independent. Then whenever M ≥ 15 log(8K/δ), with probability at least 1 − δ, the expected excess risk of the CLSR estimate conditionally on the input samples is upper bounded as 2 log(8K/δ) supx ||ϕ(x)||2 1+ K E||ϕ(X)||2 EY (||gL − f ∗ ||2 K ) ≤ 4σ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 P log 4/δ . 2K Proof: Whenever M ≥ 15 log(8K/δ) we deduce from Theorem 1 and (5) that the excess risk of gL is bounded as E(||gL − f ∗ ||2 ) ≤ c max{σ2 , L2 } P +8 8 log(8K/δ) + 2 ||α || M 1 + log K M K E||ϕ(X)||2 + 2 sup ||ϕ(x)||2 x log 4/δ + inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 . P f ∈FN 2K By optimizing on M , we deduce (7). Similarly, using (6) we deduce the following bound on EY (||gL − f ∗ ||2 K ): P σ2 8 M + log(8K/δ)||α+ ||2 K M E||ϕ(X)||2 + 2 sup ||ϕ(x)||2 x log 4/δ + inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 K . P f ∈FN 2K By optimizing on M and noticing that inf f ∈FN ||f − f ∗ ||2 K = 0 whenever N > K and the features P (ϕk )1≤k≤K are linearly independent, we deduce the second result. Remark 1 Note that the second term in the parenthesis of (7) is negligible whenever K Thus we have the expected excess risk log K/δ + inf ||f − f ∗ ||2 . P f ∈FN K E(||gL − f ∗ ||2 ) = O ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 √ P log 1/δ. (8) The choice of M in the previous corollary depends on ||α+ || and E||ϕ(X)|| which are a priori unknown (since f ∗ and PX are unknown). If we set M independently of ||α+ ||, then an additional multiplicative factor of ||α+ || appears in the bound, and if we replace E||ϕ(X)|| by its bound supx ||ϕ(x)|| (which is known) then this latter factor will appear instead of the former in the bound. Complexity of CLSR: The complexity of LSR for computing the regression function in the compressed domain only depends on M and K, and is (see e.g. [4]) Cx(DK , GM , P ) = O(M K 2 ) which √ is of order O(K 5/2 ) when we choose the optimized number of projections M = O( K). However the leading term when using CLSR is the cost for building the Ψ matrix: O(N K 3/2 ). 6 4 4.1 Discussion The factor ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 In light of Corollary 1, the important factor which will determine whether the CLSR provides low generalization error or not is ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 . This factor indicates that a good set of features (for CLSR) should be such that the norm of those features as well as the norm of the parameter α+ of the projection of f ∗ onto the span of those features should be small. A natural question is whether this product can be made small for appropriate choices of features. We now provide two speciﬁc cases for which this is actually the case: (1) when the features are rescaled orthonormal basis functions, and (2) when the features are speciﬁc wavelet functions. In both cases, we relate the bound to an assumption of regularity on the function f ∗ , and show that the dependency w.r.t. N decreases when the regularity increases, and may even vanish. Rescaled Orthonormal Features: Consider a set of orthonormal functions (ηi )i≥1 w.r.t a measure µ, i.e. ηi , ηj µ = δi,j . In addition we assume that the law of the input data is dominated by µ, i.e. PX ≤ Cµ where C is a constant. For instance, this is the case when the set X is compact, µ is the uniform measure and PX has bounded density. def We deﬁne the set of N features as: ϕi = ci ηi , where ci > 0, for i ∈ {1, . . . , N }. Then any f ∈ FN decomposes as f = 2 we have: ||α|| = ||α+ ||2 E||ϕ||2 ≤ C N bi 2 i=1 ( ci ) N bi 2 i=1 ( ci ) and N i=1 N bi i=1 ci ϕi , where N 2 2 i=1 ci X ηi (x)dPX (x) f, ηi ηi = E||ϕ|| = 2 def bi = f, ηi . Thus ≤ C N 2 i=1 ci . Thus N 2 i=1 ci . Now, linear approximation theory (Jackson-type theorems) tells us that assuming a function f ∗ ∈ L2 (µ) is smooth, it may be decomposed onto the span of the N ﬁrst (ηi )i∈{1,...,N } functions with decreasing coefﬁcients |bi | ≤ i−λ for some λ ≥ 0 that depends on the smoothness of f ∗ . For example the class of functions with bounded total variation may be decomposed with Fourier basis (in dimension 1) with coefﬁcients |bi | ≤ ||f ||V /(2πi). Thus here λ = 1. Other classes (such as Sobolev spaces) lead to larger values of λ related to the order of differentiability. √ N By choosing ci = i−λ/2 , we have ||α+ || E||ϕ||2 ≤ C i=1 i−λ . Thus if λ > 1, then this term is bounded by a constant that does not depend on N . If λ = 1 then it is bounded by O(log N ), and if 0 < λ < 1, then it is bounded by O(N 1−λ ). However any orthonormal basis, even rescaled, would not necessarily yield a small ||α+ || E||ϕ||2 term (this is all the more true when the dimension of X is large). The desired property that the coefﬁcients (α+ )i of the decomposition of f ∗ rapidly decrease to 0 indicates that hierarchical bases, such as wavelets, that would decompose the function at different scales, may be interesting. Wavelets: Consider an inﬁnite family of wavelets in [0, 1]: (ϕ0 ) = (ϕ0 ) (indexed by n ≥ 1 or n h,l equivalently by the scale h ≥ 0 and translation 0 ≤ l ≤ 2h − 1) where ϕ0 (x) = 2h/2 ϕ0 (2h x − l) h,l and ϕ0 is the mother wavelet. Then consider N = 2H features (ϕh,l )1≤h≤H deﬁned as the rescaled def wavelets ϕh,l = ch 2−h/2 ϕ0 , where ch > 0 are some coefﬁcients. Assume the mother wavelet h,l is C p (for p ≥ 1), has at least p vanishing moments, and that for all h ≥ 0, supx l ϕ0 (2h x − l)2 ≤ 1. Then the following result (proof in the supplementary material) provides a bound on supx∈X ||ϕ(x)||2 (thus on E||ϕ(X)||2 ) by a constant independent of N : Proposition 2 Assume that f ∗ is (L, γ)-Lipschitz (i.e. for all v ∈ X there exists a polynomial pv of degree γ such that for all u ∈ X , |f (u) − pv (u)| ≤ L|u − v|γ ) with 1/2 < γ ≤ p. Then setting γ 1 ch = 2h(1−2γ)/4 , we have ||α+ || supx ||ϕ(x)|| ≤ L 1−22 |ϕ0 |, which is independent of N . 1/2−γ 0 Notice that the Haar walevets has p = 1 vanishing moment but is not C 1 , thus the Proposition does not apply directly. However direct computations show that if f ∗ is L-Lipschitz (i.e. γ = 1) then L 0 αh,l ≤ L2−3h/2−2 , and thus ||α+ || supx ||ϕ(x)|| ≤ 4(1−2−1/2 ) with ch = 2−h/4 . 7 4.2 Comparison with other methods In the case when the factor ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 does not depend on N (such as in the previous example), the bound (8) on the excess risk of CLSR states that the estimation error (assessed in √ √ terms of FN ) of CLSR is O(log K/ K). It is clear that whenever N > K (which is the case of interest here), this is better than the ordinary LSR in the initial domain, whose estimation error is O(N log K/K). It is difﬁcult to compare this result with LASSO (or the Dantzig selector that has similar properties [5]) for which an important aspect is to design sparse regression functions or to recover a solution assumed to be sparse. From [12, 15, 24] one deduces that under some assumptions, the estimation error of LASSO is of order S log N where S is the sparsity (number of non-zero coefﬁcients) of the K√ best regressor f + in FN . If S < K then LASSO is more interesting than CLSR in terms of excess risk. Otherwise CLSR may be an interesting alternative although this method does not make any assumption about the sparsity of f + and its goal is not to recover a possible sparse f + but only to make good predictions. However, in some sense our method ﬁnds a sparse solution in the fact that the regression function gL lies in a space GM of small dimension M N and can thus be expressed using only M coefﬁcients. Now in terms of numerical complexity, CLSR requires O(N K 3/2 ) operations to build the matrix and compute the regression function, whereas according to [18], the (heuristical) complexity of the LASSO algorithm is O(N K 2 ) in the best cases (assuming that the number of steps required for convergence is O(K), which is not proved theoretically). Thus CLSR seems to be a good and simple competitor to LASSO. 5 Conclusion We considered the case when the number of features N is larger than the number of data K. The result stated in Theorem 1 enables to analyze the excess risk of any linear regression algorithm (LS or its penalized versions) performed in the compressed domain GM versus in the initial space FN . In the compressed domain the estimation error is reduced but an additional (controlled) approximation error (when compared to the best regressor in FN ) comes into the picture. In the case of LS regression, when the term ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 has a mild dependency on N , then by choosing a √ random subspace of dimension M = O( K), CLSR has an estimation error (assessed in terms of √ FN ) bounded by O(log K/ K) and has numerical complexity O(N K 3/2 ). In short, CLSR provides an alternative to usual penalization techniques where one ﬁrst selects a random subspace of lower dimension and then performs an empirical risk minimizer in this subspace. Further work needs to be done to provide additional settings (when the space X is of dimension > 1) for which the term ||α+ || E||ϕ(X)||2 is small.

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We study minimax rates for estimating high-dimensional nonparametric regression models with sparse additive structure and smoothness constraints. More precisely, our goal is to estimate a function f ∗ : Rp → R that has an additive decomposition of the form ∗ ∗ f ∗ (X1 , . . . , Xp ) = j∈S hj (Xj ), where each component function hj lies in some class H of “smooth” functions, and S ⊂ {1, . . . , p} is an unknown subset with cardinality s = |S|. Given n i.i.d. observations of f ∗ (X) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise where the covariate vectors (X1 , X2 , X3 , ..., Xp ) are drawn with i.i.d. components from some distribution P, we determine lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the regression function with respect to squared-L2 (P) error. Our main result is a lower bound on the minimax rate that scales as max s log(p/s) , s ǫ2 (H) . The ﬁrst term reﬂects the sample size required for n n performing subset selection, and is independent of the function class H. The second term s ǫ2 (H) is an s-dimensional estimation term corresponding to the sample size required for n estimating a sum of s univariate functions, each chosen from the function class H. It depends linearly on the sparsity index s but is independent of the global dimension p. As a special case, if H corresponds to functions that are m-times differentiable (an mth -order Sobolev space), then the s-dimensional estimation term takes the form sǫ2 (H) ≍ s n−2m/(2m+1) . Either of n the two terms may be dominant in different regimes, depending on the relation between the sparsity and smoothness of the additive decomposition.</p><p>6 0.088591307 <a title="91-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Kernels_and_learning_curves_for_Gaussian_process_regression_on_random_graphs.html">120 nips-2009-Kernels and learning curves for Gaussian process regression on random graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe</p><p>Abstract: It was recently shown that certain nonparametric regressors can escape the curse of dimensionality when the intrinsic dimension of data is low ([1, 2]). We prove some stronger results in more general settings. In particular, we consider a regressor which, by combining aspects of both tree-based regression and kernel regression, adapts to intrinsic dimension, operates on general metrics, yields a smooth function, and evaluates in time O(log n). We derive a tight convergence rate of the form n−2/(2+d) where d is the Assouad dimension of the input space. 1</p><p>2 0.66252357 <a title="91-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Asymptotically_Optimal_Regularization_in_Smooth_Parametric_Models.html">37 nips-2009-Asymptotically Optimal Regularization in Smooth Parametric Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Percy Liang, Guillaume Bouchard, Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Many types of regularization schemes have been employed in statistical learning, each motivated by some assumption about the problem domain. In this paper, we present a uniﬁed asymptotic analysis of smooth regularizers, which allows us to see how the validity of these assumptions impacts the success of a particular regularizer. In addition, our analysis motivates an algorithm for optimizing regularization parameters, which in turn can be analyzed within our framework. We apply our analysis to several examples, including hybrid generative-discriminative learning and multi-task learning. 1</p><p>3 0.6552794 <a title="91-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-From_PAC-Bayes_Bounds_to_KL_Regularization.html">98 nips-2009-From PAC-Bayes Bounds to KL Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Eric Garcia, Maya Gupta</p><p>Abstract: We present a new empirical risk minimization framework for approximating functions from training samples for low-dimensional regression applications where a lattice (look-up table) is stored and interpolated at run-time for an efﬁcient implementation. Rather than evaluating a ﬁtted function at the lattice nodes without regard to the fact that samples will be interpolated, the proposed lattice regression approach estimates the lattice to minimize the interpolation error on the given training samples. Experiments show that lattice regression can reduce mean test error by as much as 25% compared to Gaussian process regression (GPR) for digital color management of printers, an application for which linearly interpolating a look-up table is standard. Simulations conﬁrm that lattice regression performs consistently better than the naive approach to learning the lattice. Surprisingly, in some cases the proposed method — although motivated by computational efﬁciency — performs better than directly applying GPR with no lattice at all. 1</p><p>5 0.61335027 <a title="91-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Data-driven_calibration_of_linear_estimators_with_minimal_penalties.html">64 nips-2009-Data-driven calibration of linear estimators with minimal penalties</a></p>
<p>Author: Sylvain Arlot, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of selecting among several linear estimators in non-parametric regression; this includes model selection for linear regression, the choice of a regularization parameter in kernel ridge regression or spline smoothing, and the choice of a kernel in multiple kernel learning. We propose a new algorithm which ﬁrst estimates consistently the variance of the noise, based upon the concept of minimal penalty which was previously introduced in the context of model selection. Then, plugging our variance estimate in Mallows’ CL penalty is proved to lead to an algorithm satisfying an oracle inequality. Simulation experiments with kernel ridge regression and multiple kernel learning show that the proposed algorithm often improves signiﬁcantly existing calibration procedures such as 10-fold cross-validation or generalized cross-validation. 1</p><p>6 0.60520732 <a title="91-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Robust_Nonparametric_Regression_with_Metric-Space_Valued_Output.html">207 nips-2009-Robust Nonparametric Regression with Metric-Space Valued Output</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Alan Jern</p><p>Abstract: Most models of categorization learn categories deﬁned by characteristic features but some categories are described more naturally in terms of relations. We present a generative model that helps to explain how relational categories are learned and used. Our model learns abstract schemata that specify the relational similarities shared by instances of a category, and our emphasis on abstraction departs from previous theoretical proposals that focus instead on comparison of concrete instances. Our ﬁrst experiment suggests that abstraction can help to explain some of the ﬁndings that have previously been used to support comparison-based approaches. Our second experiment focuses on one-shot schema learning, a problem that raises challenges for comparison-based approaches but is handled naturally by our abstraction-based account. Categories such as family, sonnet, above, betray, and imitate differ in many respects but all of them depend critically on relational information. Members of a family are typically related by blood or marriage, and the lines that make up a sonnet must rhyme with each other according to a certain pattern. A pair of objects will demonstrate “aboveness” only if a certain spatial relationship is present, and an event will qualify as an instance of betrayal or imitation only if its participants relate to each other in certain ways. All of the cases just described are examples of relational categories. This paper develops a computational approach that helps to explain how simple relational categories are acquired. Our approach highlights the role of abstraction in relational learning. Given several instances of a relational category, it is often possible to infer an abstract representation that captures what the instances have in common. We refer to these abstract representations as schemata, although others may prefer to call them rules or theories. For example, a sonnet schema might specify the number of lines that a sonnet should include and the rhyming pattern that the lines should follow. Once a schema has been acquired it can support several kinds of inferences. A schema can be used to make predictions about hidden aspects of the examples already observed—if the ﬁnal word in a sonnet is illegible, the rhyming pattern can help to predict the identity of this word. A schema can be used to decide whether new examples (e.g. new poems) qualify as members of the category. Finally, a schema can be used to generate novel examples of a category (e.g. novel sonnets). Most researchers would agree that abstraction plays some role in relational learning, but Gentner [1] and other psychologists have emphasized the role of comparison instead [2, 3]. Given one example of a sonnet and the task of deciding whether a second poem is also a sonnet, a comparison-based approach might attempt to establish an alignment or mapping between the two. Approaches that rely on comparison or mapping are especially prominent in the literature on analogical reasoning [4, 5], and many of these approaches can be viewed as accounts of relational categorization [6]. For example, the problem of deciding whether two systems are analogous can be formalized as the problem of deciding whether these systems are instances of the same relational category. Despite some notable exceptions [6, 7], most accounts of analogy focus on comparison rather than abstraction, and suggest that “analogy passes from one instance of a generalization to another without pausing for explicit induction of the generalization” (p 95) [8]. 1 Schema s 0∀Q ∀x ∀y Q(x) < Q(y) ↔ D1 (x) < D1 (y) Group g Observation o Figure 1: A hierarchical generative model for learning and using relational categories. The schema s at the top level is a logical sentence that speciﬁes which groups are valid instances of the category. The group g at the second level is randomly sampled from the set of valid instances, and the observation o is a partially observed version of group g. Researchers that focus on comparison sometimes discuss abstraction, but typically suggest that abstractions emerge as a consequence of comparing two or more concrete instances of a category [3, 5, 9, 10]. This view, however, will not account for one-shot inferences, or inferences based on a single instance of a relational category. Consider a learner who is shown one instance of a sonnet then asked to create a second instance. Since only one instance is provided, it is hard to see how comparisons between instances could account for success on the task. A single instance, however, will sometimes provide enough information for a schema to be learned, and this schema should allow subsequent instances to be generated [11]. Here we develop a formal framework for exploring relational learning in general and one-shot schema learning in particular. Our framework relies on the hierarchical Bayesian approach, which provides a natural way to combine abstraction and probabilistic inference [12]. The hierarchical Bayesian approach supports representations at multiple levels of abstraction, and helps to explains how abstract representations (e.g. a sonnet schema) can be acquired given observations of concrete instances (e.g. individual sonnets). The schemata we consider are represented as sentences in a logical language, and our approach therefore builds on previous probabilistic methods for learning and using logical theories [13, 14]. Following previous authors, we propose that logical representations can help to capture the content of human knowledge, and that Bayesian inference helps to explain how these representations are acquired and how they support inductive inference. The following sections introduce our framework then evaluate it using two behavioral experiments. Our ﬁrst experiment uses a standard classiﬁcation task where participants are shown one example of a category then asked to decide which of two alternatives is more likely to belong to the same category. Tasks of this kind have previously been used to argue for the importance of comparison, but we suggest that these tasks can be handled by accounts that focus on abstraction. Our second experiment uses a less standard generation task [15, 16] where participants are shown a single example of a category then asked to generate additional examples. As predicted by our abstraction-based account, we ﬁnd that people are able to learn relational categories on the basis of a single example. 1 A generative approach to relational learning Our examples so far have used real-world relational categories such as family and sonnet but we now turn to a very simple domain where relational categorization can be studied. Each element in the domain is a group of components that vary along a number of dimensions—in Figure 1, the components are ﬁgures that vary along the dimensions of size, color, and circle position. The groups can be organized into categories—one such category includes groups where every component is black. Although our domain is rather basic it allows some simple relational regularities to be explored. We can consider categories, for example, where all components in a group must be the same along some dimension, and categories where all components must be different along some dimension. We can also consider categories deﬁned by relationships between dimensions—for example, the category that includes all groups where the size and color dimensions are correlated. Each category is associated with a schema, or an abstract representation that speciﬁes which groups are valid instances of the category. Here we consider schemata that correspond to rules formulated 2 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ﬀ ˘ ¯ ∀x D (x) =, =, <, > vk ∃xﬀ  i  ﬀ ˘ ¯ ∀x ∀y x = y → D (x) =, =, <, > Di (y) ∃x ∃y x = y ∧ 8 i9 ˘ ¯ <∧= ˘ ¯ ∀x Di (x) =, = vk ∨ Dj (x) =, = vl : ; ↔ 8 9 0 1 <∧= ˘ ¯ ˘ ¯ ∀x∀y x = y → @Di (x) =, =, <, > Di (y) ∨ Dj (x) =, =, <, > Dj (y)A : ; ↔  ﬀ ﬀ ﬀ ˘ ¯ ∀Q ∀x ∀y x = y → Q(x) =, =, <, > Q(y) ∃Q ∃x ∃y x = y ∧ 8 9 0 1  ﬀ <∧= ˘ ¯ ˘ ¯ ∀Q Q = Di → ∀x∀y x = y → @Q(x) =, =, <, > Q(y) ∨ Di (x) =, =, <, > Di (y)A ∃Q Q = Di ∧ : ; ↔ 8 9 0 1  ﬀ ﬀ <∧= ˘ ¯ ˘ ¯ ∀Q ∀R Q = R → ∀x∀y x = y → @Q(x) =, =, <, > Q(y) ∨ R(x) =, =, <, > R(y)A ∃Q ∃R Q = R ∧ : ; ↔ Table 1: Templates used to construct a hypothesis space of logical schemata. An instance of a given template can be created by choosing an element from each set enclosed in braces (some sets are laid out horizontally to save space), replacing each occurrence of Di or Dj with a dimension (e.g. D1 ) and replacing each occurrence of vk or vl with a value (e.g. 1). in a logical language. The language includes three binary connectives—and (∧), or (∨), and if and only if (↔). Four binary relations (=, =, <, and >) are available for comparing values along dimensions. Universal quantiﬁcation (∀x) and existential quantiﬁcation (∃x) are both permitted, and the language includes quantiﬁcation over objects (∀x) and dimensions (∀Q). For example, the schema in Figure 1 states that all dimensions are aligned. More precisely, if D1 is the dimension of size, the schema states that for all dimensions Q, a component x is smaller than a component y along dimension Q if and only if x is smaller in size than y. It follows that all three dimensions must increase or decrease together. To explain how rules in this logical language are learned we work with the hierarchical generative model in Figure 1. The representation at the top level is a schema s, and we assume that one or more groups g are generated from a distribution P (g|s). Following a standard approach to category learning [17, 18], we assume that g is uniformly sampled from all groups consistent with s: p(g|s) ∝ 1 g is consistent with s 0 otherwise (1) For all applications in this paper, we assume that the number of components in a group is known and ﬁxed in advance. The bottom level of the hierarchy speciﬁes observations o that are generated from a distribution P (o|g). In most cases we assume that g can be directly observed, and that P (o|g) = 1 if o = g and 0 otherwise. We also consider the setting shown in Figure 1 where o is generated by concealing a component of g chosen uniformly at random. Note that the observation o in Figure 1 includes only four of the components in group g, and is roughly analogous to our earlier example of a sonnet with an illegible ﬁnal word. To convert Figure 1 into a fully-speciﬁed probabilistic model it remains to deﬁne a prior distribution P (s) over schemata. An appealing approach is to consider all of the inﬁnitely many sentences in the logical language already mentioned, and to deﬁne a prior favoring schemata which correspond to simple (i.e. short) sentences. We approximate this approach by considering a large but ﬁnite space of sentences that includes all instances of the templates in Table 1 and all conjunctions of these instances. When instantiating one of these templates, each occurrence of Di or Dj should be replaced by one of the dimensions in the domain. For example, the schema in Figure 1 is a simpliﬁed instance of template 6 where Di is replaced by D1 . Similarly, each instance of vk or vl should be replaced by a value along one of the dimensions. Our ﬁrst experiment considers a problem where there are are three dimensions and three possible values along each dimension (i.e. vk = 1, 2, or 3). As a result there are 1568 distinct instances of the templates in Table 1 and roughly one million 3 conjunctions of these instances. Our second experiment uses three dimensions with ﬁve values along each dimension, which leads to 2768 template instances and roughly three million conjunctions of these instances. The templates in Table 1 capture most of the simple regularities that can be formulated in our logical language. Template 1 generates all rules that include quantiﬁcation over a single object variable and no binary connectives. Template 3 is similar but includes a single binary connective. Templates 2 and 4 are similar to 1 and 3 respectively, but include two object variables (x and y) rather than one. Templates 5, 6 and 7 add quantiﬁcation over dimensions to Templates 2 and 4. Although the templates in Table 1 capture a large class of regularities, several kinds of templates are not included. Since we do not assume that the dimensions are commensurable, values along different dimensions cannot be directly compared (∃x D1 (x) = D2 (x) is not permitted. For the same reason, comparisons to a dimension value must involve a concrete dimension (∀x D1 (x) = 1 is permitted) rather than a dimension variable (∀Q ∀x Q(x) = 1 is not permitted). Finally, we exclude all schemata where quantiﬁcation over objects precedes quantiﬁcation over dimensions, and as a result there are some simple schemata that our implementation cannot learn (e.g. ∃x∀y∃Q Q(x) = Q(y)). The extension of each schema is a set of groups, and schemata with the same extension can be assigned to the same equivalence class. For example, ∀x D1 (x) = v1 (an instance of template 1) and ∀x D1 (x) = v1 ∧ D1 (x) = v1 (an instance of template 3) end up in the same equivalence class. Each equivalence class can be represented by the shortest sentence that it contains, and we deﬁne our prior P (s) over a set that includes a single representative for each equivalence class. The prior probability P (s) of each sentence is inversely proportional to its length: P (s) ∝ λ|s| , where |s| is the length of schema s and λ is a constant between 0 and 1. For all applications in this paper we set λ = 0.8. The generative model in Figure 1 can be used for several purposes, including schema learning (inferring a schema s given one or more instances generated from the schema), classiﬁcation (deciding whether group gnew belongs to a category given one or more instances of the category) and generation (generating a group gnew that belongs to the same category as one or more instances). Our ﬁrst experiment explores all three of these problems. 2 Experiment 1: Relational classiﬁcation Our ﬁrst experiment is organized around a triad task where participants are shown one example of a category then asked to decide which of two choice examples is more likely to belong to the category. Triad tasks are regularly used by studies of relational categorization, and have been used to argue for the importance of comparison [1]. A comparison-based approach to this task, for instance, might compare the example object to each of the choice objects in order to decide which is the better match. Our ﬁrst experiment is intended in part to explore whether a schema-learning approach can also account for inferences about triad tasks. Materials and Method. 18 adults participated for course credit and interacted with a custom-built computer interface. The stimuli were groups of ﬁgures that varied along three dimensions (color, size, and ball position, as in Figure 1). Each shape was displayed on a single card, and all groups in Experiment 1 included exactly three cards. The cards in Figure 1 show ﬁve different values along each dimension, but Experiment 1 used only three values along each dimension. The experiment included inferences about 10 triads. Participants were told that aliens from a certain planet “enjoy organizing cards into groups,” and that “any group of cards will probably be liked by some aliens and disliked by others.” The ten triad tasks were framed as questions about the preferences of 10 aliens. Participants were shown a group that Mr X likes (different names were used for the ten triads), then shown two choice groups and told that “Mr X likes one of these groups but not the other.” Participants were asked to select one of the choice groups, then asked to generate another 3-card group that Mr X would probably like. Cards could be added to the screen using an “Add Card” button, and there were three pairs of buttons that allowed each card to be increased or decreased along the three dimensions. Finally, participants were asked to explain in writing “what kind of groups Mr X likes.” The ten triads used are shown in Figure 2. Each group is represented as a 3 by 3 matrix where rows represent cards and columns show values along the three dimensions. Triad 1, for example, 4 (a) D1 value always 3 321 332 313 1 0.5 1 231 323 333 1 4 0.5 4 311 122 333 311 113 313 8 12 16 20 24 211 222 233 211 232 223 1 4 0.5 4 211 312 113 8 12 16 20 24 1 1 4 8 12 16 20 24 312 312 312 313 312 312 1 8 12 16 20 24 211 232 123 4 8 12 16 20 24 1 0.5 231 322 213 112 212 312 4 8 12 16 20 24 4 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 1 0.5 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 4 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 1 1 4 4 (j) Some dimension has no repeats 0.5 1 311 232 123 231 132 333 1 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 111 312 213 231 222 213 (i) All dimensions have no repeats 331 122 213 4 1 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 4 8 12 16 20 24 (h) Some dimension uniform 1 4 4 0.5 1 311 212 113 0.5 1 321 122 223 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 4 0.5 331 322 313 1 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 (f) Two dimensions anti-aligned (g) All dimensions uniform 133 133 133 4 0.5 1 321 222 123 0.5 1 8 12 16 20 24 1 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 1 0.5 111 212 313 331 212 133 1 (e) Two dimensions aligned 311 322 333 311 113 323 4 (d) D1 and D3 anti-aligned 0.5 1 0.5 1 1 0.5 1 0.5 8 12 16 20 24 (c) D2 and D3 aligned 1 132 332 233 1 0.5 331 323 333 (b) D2 uniform 1 311 321 331 8 12 16 20 24 311 331 331 4 8 12 16 20 24 4 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 Figure 2: Human responses and model predictions for the ten triads in Experiment 1. The plot at the left of each panel shows model predictions (white bars) and human preferences (black bars) for the two choice groups in each triad. The plots at the right of each panel summarize the groups created during the generation phase.

The ﬁrst choice group is consistent with this regularity but the second choice group is not. The cards in each group were arrayed vertically on screen, and were initially sorted as shown in Figure 2 (i.e. ﬁrst by D3 , then by D2 and then by D1 ). The cards could be dragged around on screen, and participants were invited to move them around in order to help them understand each group. The mapping between the three dimensions in each matrix and the three dimensions in the experiment (color, position, and size) was randomized across participants, and the order in which triads were presented was also randomized. Model predictions and results. Let ge be the example group presented in the triad task and g1 and g2 be the two choice groups. We use our model to compute the relative probability of two hypotheses: h1 which states that ge and g1 are generated from the same schema and that g2 is sampled randomly from all possible groups, and h2 which states that ge and g2 are generated from the same schema. We set P (h1 ) = P (h2 ) = 0.5, and compute posterior probabilities P (h1 |ge , g1 , g2 ) and P (h2 |ge , g1 , g2 ) by integrating over all schemata in the hypothesis space already described. Our model assumes that two groups are considered similar to the extent that they appear to have been generated by the same underlying schema, and is consistent with the generative approach to similarity described by Kemp et al. [19]. Model predictions for the ten triads are shown in Figure 2. In each case, the choice probabilities plotted (white bars) are the posterior probabilities of hypotheses h1 and h2 . In nine out of ten cases the best choice according to the model is the most common human response. Responses to triads 2c and 2d support the idea that people are sensitive to relationships between dimensions (i.e. alignment and anti-alignment). Triads 2e and 2f are similar to triads studied by Kotovsky and Gentner [1], and we replicate their ﬁnding that people are sensitive to relationships between dimensions even when the dimensions involved vary from group to group. The one case where human responses diverge from model predictions is shown in Figure 2h. Note that the schema for this triad involves existential quantiﬁcation over dimensions (some dimension is uniform), and according to our prior P (s) this kind of quantiﬁcation is no more complex than other kinds of quantiﬁcation. Future applications of our approach can explore the idea that existential quantiﬁcation over dimensions (∃Q) is psychologically more complex than universal quantiﬁcation over dimensions (∀Q) or existential quantiﬁcation over cards (∃x), and can consider logical languages that incorporate this inductive bias. To model the generation phase of the experiment we computed the posterior distribution P (gnew |ge , g1 , g2 ) = P (gnew |s)P (s|h, ge , g1 , g2 )P (h|ge , g1 , g2 ) s,h where P (h|ge , g1 , g2 ) is the distribution used to model selections in the triad task. Since the space of possible groups is large, we visualize this distribution using a proﬁle that shows the posterior probability assigned to groups consistent with the 23 regularities shown in Table 2. The white bar plots in Figure 2 show proﬁles predicted by the model, and the black plots immediately above show proﬁles computed over the groups generated by our 18 participants. In many of the 10 cases the model accurately predicts regularities in the groups generated by people. In case 2c, for example, the model correctly predicts that generated groups will tend to have no repeats along dimensions D2 and D3 (regularities 15 and 16) and that these two dimensions will be aligned (regularities 2 and 5). There are, however, some departures from the model’s predictions, and a notable example occurs in case 2d. Here the model detects the regularity that dimensions D1 and D3 are anti-aligned (regularity 9). Some groups generated by participants are consistent with 6 (a) All dimensions aligned 1 0.5 1 8 12 16 20 24 (c) D1 has no repeats, D2 and D3 uniform 1 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 1 8 12 16 20 24 354 312 1 8 12 16 20 24 4 8 12 16 20 24 4 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 423 414 214 315 0.5 314 0.5 0.5 4 8 12 16 20 24 1 251 532 314 145 0.5 4 8 12 16 20 24 (f) All dimensions have no repeats 1 1 335 8 12 16 20 24 (e) All dimensions uniform 1 4 0.5 432 514 324 224 424 0.5 314 314 314 314 8 12 16 20 24 4 1 0.5 4 4 0.5 314 0.5 4 8 12 16 20 24 1 431 433 135 335 0.5 1 4 (d) D2 uniform 1 433 1 322 8 12 16 20 24 0.5 0.5 344 333 223 555 222 4 1 1 0.5 0.5 124 224 324 524 311 322 333 354 324 1 0.5 4 311 322 333 355 134 121 232 443 555 443 1 111 333 444 555 (b) D2 and D3 aligned Figure 3: Human responses and model predictions for the six cases in Experiment 2. In (a) and (b), the 4 cards used for the completion and generation phases are shown on either side of the dashed line (completion cards on the left). In the remaining cases, the same 4 cards were used for both phases. The plots at the right of each panel show model predictions (white bars) and human responses (black bars) for the generation task. In each case, the 23 elements along each x-axis correspond to the regularities listed in Table 2. The remaining plots show responses to the completion task. There are 125 possible responses, and the four responses shown always include the top two human responses and the top two model predictions. this regularity, but people also regularly generate groups where two dimensions are aligned rather than anti-aligned (regularity 2). This result may indicate that some participants are sensitive to relationships between dimensions but do not consider the difference between a positive relationship (alignment) and an inverse relationship (anti-alignment) especially important. Kotovsky and Gentner [1] suggest that comparison can explain how people respond to triad tasks, although they do not provide a computational model that can be compared with our approach. It is less clear how comparison might account for our generation data, and our next experiment considers a one-shot generation task that raises even greater challenges for a comparison-based approach. 3 Experiment 2: One-shot schema learning As described already, comparison involves constructing mappings between pairs of category instances. In some settings, however, learners make conﬁdent inferences given a single instance of a category [15, 20], and it is difﬁcult to see how comparison could play a major role when only one instance is available. Models that rely on abstraction, however, can naturally account for one-shot relational learning, and we designed a second experiment to evaluate this aspect of our approach. 7 Several previous studies have explored one-shot relational learning. Holyoak and Thagard [21] developed a study of analogical reasoning using stories as stimuli and found little evidence of oneshot schema learning. Ahn et al. [11] demonstrated, however, that one-shot learning can be achieved with complex materials such as stories, and modeled this result using explanation-based learning. Here we use much simpler stimuli and explore a probabilistic approach to one-shot learning. Materials and Method. 18 adults participated for course credit. The same individuals completed Experiments 1 and 2, and Experiment 2 was always run before Experiment 1. The same computer interface was used in both experiments, and the only important difference was that the ﬁgures in Experiment 2 could now take ﬁve values along each dimension rather than three. The experiment included two phases. During the generation phase, participants saw a 4-card group that Mr X liked and were asked to generate two 5-card groups that Mr X would probably like. During the completion phase, participants were shown four members of a 5-card group and were asked to generate the missing card. The stimuli used in each phase are shown in Figure 3. In the ﬁrst two cases, slightly different stimuli were used in the generation and completion phases, and in all remaining cases the same set of four cards was used in both cases. All participants responded to the six generation questions before answering the six completion questions. Model predictions and results. The generation phase is modeled as in Experiment 1, but now the posterior distribution P (gnew |ge ) is computed after observing a single instance of a category. The human responses in Figure 3 (white bars) are consistent with the model in all cases, and conﬁrm that a single example can provide sufﬁcient evidence for learners to acquire a relational category. For example, the most common response in case 3a was the 5-card group shown in Figure 1—a group with all three dimensions aligned. To model the completion phase, let oe represent a partial observation of group ge . Our model infers which card is missing from ge by computing the posterior distribution P (ge |oe ) ∝ P (oe |ge ) s P (ge |s)P (s), where P (oe |ge ) captures the idea that oe is generated by randomly concealing one component of ge . The white bars in Figure 3 show model predictions, and in ﬁve out of six cases the best response according to the model is the same as the most common human response. In the remaining case (Figure 3d) the model generates a diffuse distribution over all cards with value 3 on dimension 2, and all human responses satisfy this regularity. 4 Conclusion We presented a generative model that helps to explain how relational categories are learned and used. Our approach captures relational regularities using a logical language, and helps to explain how schemata formulated in this language can be learned from observed data. Our approach differs in several respects from previous accounts of relational categorization [1, 5, 10, 22]. First, we focus on abstraction rather than comparison. Second, we consider tasks where participants must generate examples of categories [16] rather than simply classify existing examples. Finally, we provide a formal account that helps to explain how relational categories can be learned from a single instance. Our approach can be developed and extended in several ways. For simplicity, we implemented our model by working with a ﬁnite space of several million schemata, but future work can consider hypothesis spaces that assign non-zero probability to all regularities that can be formulated in the language we described. The speciﬁc logical language used here is only a starting point, and future work can aim to develop languages that provide a more faithful account of human inductive biases. Finally, we worked with a domain that provides one of the simplest ways to address core questions such as one-shot learning. Future applications of our general approach can consider domains that include more than three dimensions and a richer space of relational regularities. Relational learning and analogical reasoning are tightly linked, and hierarchical generative models provide a promising approach to both problems. We focused here on relational categorization, but future studies can explore whether probabilistic accounts of schema learning can help to explain the inductive inferences typically considered by studies of analogical reasoning. Although there are many models of analogical reasoning, there are few that pursue a principled probabilistic approach, and the hierarchical Bayesian approach may help to ﬁll this gap in the literature.

<p>Author: Theodore J. Perkins</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains are used to model systems in which transitions between states as well as the time the system spends in each state are random. Many computational problems related to such chains have been solved, including determining state distributions as a function of time, parameter estimation, and control. However, the problem of inferring most likely trajectories, where a trajectory is a sequence of states as well as the amount of time spent in each state, appears unsolved. We study three versions of this problem: (i) an initial value problem, in which an initial state is given and we seek the most likely trajectory until a given ﬁnal time, (ii) a boundary value problem, in which initial and ﬁnal states and times are given, and we seek the most likely trajectory connecting them, and (iii) trajectory inference under partial observability, analogous to ﬁnding maximum likelihood trajectories for hidden Markov models. We show that maximum likelihood trajectories are not always well-deﬁned, and describe a polynomial time test for well-deﬁnedness. When well-deﬁnedness holds, we show that each of the three problems can be solved in polynomial time, and we develop efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms for doing so. 1</p><p>5 0.7336629 <a title="91-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcel V. Gerven, Botond Cseke, Robert Oostenveld, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the speciﬁcation of constraints between and within sources. We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efﬁcient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior. 1</p><p>6 0.73235577 <a title="91-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>

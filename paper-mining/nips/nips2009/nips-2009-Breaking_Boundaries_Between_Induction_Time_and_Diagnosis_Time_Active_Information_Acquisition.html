<p>Author: Bangpeng Yao, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: The human brain can be described as containing a number of functional regions. These regions, as well as the connections between them, play a key role in information processing in the brain. However, most existing multi-voxel pattern analysis approaches either treat multiple regions as one large uniform region or several independent regions, ignoring the connections between them. In this paper we propose to model such connections in an Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) framework, where the classiďŹ er of one region of interest (ROI) makes predictions based on not only its voxels but also the predictions from ROIs that it connects to. Furthermore, we propose a structural learning method in the HCRF framework to automatically uncover the connections between ROIs. We illustrate this approach with fMRI data acquired while human subjects viewed images of different natural scene categories and show that our model can improve the top-level (the classiďŹ er combining information from all ROIs) and ROI-level prediction accuracy, as well as uncover some meaningful connections between ROIs. 1</p><p>3 0.16085215 <a title="49-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_Detection_of_Regions_of_Interest_Using_Iterative_Link_Analysis.html">251 nips-2009-Unsupervised Detection of Regions of Interest Using Iterative Link Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Gunhee Kim, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and scalable alternating optimization technique to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in cluttered Web images without labels. The proposed approach discovers highly probable regions of object instances by iteratively repeating the following two functions: (1) choose the exemplar set (i.e. a small number of highly ranked reference ROIs) across the dataset and (2) reﬁne the ROIs of each image with respect to the exemplar set. These two subproblems are formulated as ranking in two different similarity networks of ROI hypotheses by link analysis. The experiments with the PASCAL 06 dataset show that our unsupervised localization performance is better than one of state-of-the-art techniques and comparable to supervised methods. Also, we test the scalability of our approach with ﬁve objects in Flickr dataset consisting of more than 200K images. 1</p><p>4 0.085891388 <a title="49-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Augmenting_Feature-driven_fMRI_Analyses%3A_Semi-supervised_learning_and_resting_state_activity.html">38 nips-2009-Augmenting Feature-driven fMRI Analyses: Semi-supervised learning and resting state activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Bartels, Matthew Blaschko, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Resting state activity is brain activation that arises in the absence of any task, and is usually measured in awake subjects during prolonged fMRI scanning sessions where the only instruction given is to close the eyes and do nothing. It has been recognized in recent years that resting state activity is implicated in a wide variety of brain function. While certain networks of brain areas have different levels of activation at rest and during a task, there is nevertheless signiﬁcant similarity between activations in the two cases. This suggests that recordings of resting state activity can be used as a source of unlabeled data to augment discriminative regression techniques in a semi-supervised setting. We evaluate this setting empirically yielding three main results: (i) regression tends to be improved by the use of Laplacian regularization even when no additional unlabeled data are available, (ii) resting state data seem to have a similar marginal distribution to that recorded during the execution of a visual processing task implying largely similar types of activation, and (iii) this source of information can be broadly exploited to improve the robustness of empirical inference in fMRI studies, an inherently data poor domain. 1</p><p>5 0.083768487 <a title="49-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Speeding_up_Magnetic_Resonance_Image_Acquisition_by_Bayesian_Multi-Slice_Adaptive_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2009-Speeding up Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition by Bayesian Multi-Slice Adaptive Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We show how to sequentially optimize magnetic resonance imaging measurement designs over stacks of neighbouring image slices, by performing convex variational inference on a large scale non-Gaussian linear dynamical system, tracking dominating directions of posterior covariance without imposing any factorization constraints. Our approach can be scaled up to high-resolution images by reductions to numerical mathematics primitives and parallelization on several levels. In a ﬁrst study, designs are found that improve signiﬁcantly on others chosen independently for each slice or drawn at random. 1</p><p>6 0.080400251 <a title="49-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Whose_Vote_Should_Count_More%3A_Optimal_Integration_of_Labels_from_Labelers_of_Unknown_Expertise.html">258 nips-2009-Whose Vote Should Count More: Optimal Integration of Labels from Labelers of Unknown Expertise</a></p>

<p>Author: Massih Amini, Nicolas Usunier, Cyril Goutte</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers when observations have multiple views, some of which may not be observed for all examples. We assume the existence of view generating functions which may complete the missing views in an approximate way. This situation corresponds for example to learning text classiﬁers from multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. In that case, Machine Translation (MT) systems may be used to translate each document in the missing languages. We derive a generalization error bound for classiﬁers learned on examples with multiple artiﬁcially created views. Our result uncovers a trade-off between the size of the training set, the number of views, and the quality of the view generating functions. As a consequence, we identify situations where it is more interesting to use multiple views for learning instead of classical single view learning. An extension of this framework is a natural way to leverage unlabeled multi-view data in semi-supervised learning. Experimental results on a subset of the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections support our ﬁndings by showing that additional views obtained from MT may signiﬁcantly improve the classiﬁcation performance in the cases identiﬁed by our trade-off. 1</p><p>5 0.5027203 <a title="49-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Graph-based_Consensus_Maximization_among_Multiple_Supervised_and_Unsupervised_Models.html">102 nips-2009-Graph-based Consensus Maximization among Multiple Supervised and Unsupervised Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jing Gao, Feng Liang, Wei Fan, Yizhou Sun, Jiawei Han</p><p>Abstract: Ensemble classiﬁers such as bagging, boosting and model averaging are known to have improved accuracy and robustness over a single model. Their potential, however, is limited in applications which have no access to raw data but to the meta-level model output. In this paper, we study ensemble learning with output from multiple supervised and unsupervised models, a topic where little work has been done. Although unsupervised models, such as clustering, do not directly generate label prediction for each individual, they provide useful constraints for the joint prediction of a set of related objects. We propose to consolidate a classiﬁcation solution by maximizing the consensus among both supervised predictions and unsupervised constraints. We cast this ensemble task as an optimization problem on a bipartite graph, where the objective function favors the smoothness of the prediction over the graph, as well as penalizing deviations from the initial labeling provided by supervised models. We solve this problem through iterative propagation of probability estimates among neighboring nodes. Our method can also be interpreted as conducting a constrained embedding in a transformed space, or a ranking on the graph. Experimental results on three real applications demonstrate the beneﬁts of the proposed method over existing alternatives1 . 1</p><p>6 0.49910682 <a title="49-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_Label_Embeddings_for_Nearest-Neighbor_Multi-class_Classification_with_an_Application_to_Speech_Recognition.html">127 nips-2009-Learning Label Embeddings for Nearest-Neighbor Multi-class Classification with an Application to Speech Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Siamac Fazli, Cristian Grozea, Marton Danoczy, Benjamin Blankertz, Florin Popescu, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: In the quest to make Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) more usable, dry electrodes have emerged that get rid of the initial 30 minutes required for placing an electrode cap. Another time consuming step is the required individualized adaptation to the BCI user, which involves another 30 minutes calibration for assessing a subject’s brain signature. In this paper we aim to also remove this calibration proceedure from BCI setup time by means of machine learning. In particular, we harvest a large database of EEG BCI motor imagination recordings (83 subjects) for constructing a library of subject-speciﬁc spatio-temporal ﬁlters and derive a subject independent BCI classiﬁer. Our ofﬂine results indicate that BCI-na¨ve ı users could start real-time BCI use with no prior calibration at only a very moderate performance loss.</p><p>2 0.72199684 <a title="49-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Models_for_Unsupervised_Event_Coreference_Resolution.html">171 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Models for Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution</a></p>

The bridging of active learning and real-time diagnostic feature acquisition leads to a new class of policies for learning and diagnosis. 1</p><p>4 0.63873935 <a title="49-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_General_Projection_Property_for_Distribution_Families.html">11 nips-2009-A General Projection Property for Distribution Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Yao-liang Yu, Yuxi Li, Dale Schuurmans, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: Surjectivity of linear projections between distribution families with ﬁxed mean and covariance (regardless of dimension) is re-derived by a new proof. We further extend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints, such as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classiﬁcation, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes. 1</p><p>5 0.60543394 <a title="49-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-On_Stochastic_and_Worst-case_Models_for_Investing.html">178 nips-2009-On Stochastic and Worst-case Models for Investing</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>6 0.59680486 <a title="49-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Learning_using_Sparse_Eigenfunction_Bases.html">213 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Learning using Sparse Eigenfunction Bases</a></p>

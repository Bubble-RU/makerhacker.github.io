<p>Author: Jean Honorio, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios, Rita Goldstein, Luis E. Ortiz</p><p>Abstract: Locality information is crucial in datasets where each variable corresponds to a measurement in a manifold (silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images). Although these datasets are typically under-sampled and high-dimensional, they often need to be represented with low-complexity statistical models, which are comprised of only the important probabilistic dependencies in the datasets. Most methods attempt to reduce model complexity by enforcing structure sparseness. However, sparseness cannot describe inherent regularities in the structure. Hence, in this paper we ﬁrst propose a new class of Gaussian graphical models which, together with sparseness, imposes local constancy through 1 -norm penalization. Second, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm which decomposes the strictly convex maximum likelihood estimation into a sequence of problems with closed form solutions. Through synthetic experiments, we evaluate the closeness of the recovered models to the ground truth. We also test the generalization performance of our method in a wide range of complex real-world datasets and demonstrate that it captures useful structures such as the rotation and shrinking of a beating heart, motion correlations between body parts during walking and functional interactions of brain regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art structure learning techniques for Gaussian graphical models both for small and large datasets. 1</p><p>3 0.12806638 <a title="228-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for ﬂexible probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message passing to compute the global likelihoods and posteriors. This algorithm, the ﬁrst parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of magnitude larger than have previously been possible. 1</p><p>4 0.1270013 <a title="228-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Multi-Label_Prediction_via_Compressed_Sensing.html">157 nips-2009-Multi-Label Prediction via Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: John Langford, Tong Zhang, Daniel J. Hsu, Sham M. Kakade</p><p>Abstract: We consider multi-label prediction problems with large output spaces under the assumption of output sparsity – that the target (label) vectors have small support. We develop a general theory for a variant of the popular error correcting output code scheme, using ideas from compressed sensing for exploiting this sparsity. The method can be regarded as a simple reduction from multi-label regression problems to binary regression problems. We show that the number of subproblems need only be logarithmic in the total number of possible labels, making this approach radically more efﬁcient than others. We also state and prove robustness guarantees for this method in the form of regret transform bounds (in general), and also provide a more detailed analysis for the linear prediction setting. 1</p><p>5 0.11196535 <a title="228-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Modeling_the_spacing_effect_in_sequential_category_learning.html">154 nips-2009-Modeling the spacing effect in sequential category learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongjing Lu, Matthew Weiden, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian sequential model for category learning. The sequential model updates two category parameters, the mean and the variance, over time. We deﬁne conjugate temporal priors to enable closed form solutions to be obtained. This model can be easily extended to supervised and unsupervised learning involving multiple categories. To model the spacing effect, we introduce a generic prior in the temporal updating stage to capture a learning preference, namely, less change for repetition and more change for variation. Finally, we show how this approach can be generalized to efﬁciently perform model selection to decide whether observations are from one or multiple categories.</p><p>6 0.1066793 <a title="228-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_estimation_of_orientation_preference_maps.html">43 nips-2009-Bayesian estimation of orientation preference maps</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaakko Luttinen, Alexander T. Ihler</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic factor analysis model which can be used for studying spatio-temporal datasets. The spatial and temporal structure is modeled by using Gaussian process priors both for the loading matrix and the factors. The posterior distributions are approximated using the variational Bayesian framework. High computational cost of Gaussian process modeling is reduced by using sparse approximations. The model is used to compute the reconstructions of the global sea surface temperatures from a historical dataset. The results suggest that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.</p><p>4 0.55196351 <a title="228-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Fast_Image_Deconvolution_using_Hyper-Laplacian_Priors.html">93 nips-2009-Fast Image Deconvolution using Hyper-Laplacian Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Dilip Krishnan, Rob Fergus</p><p>Abstract: The heavy-tailed distribution of gradients in natural scenes have proven effective priors for a range of problems such as denoising, deblurring and super-resolution. α These distributions are well modeled by a hyper-Laplacian p(x) ∝ e−k|x| , typically with 0.5 ≤ α ≤ 0.8. However, the use of sparse distributions makes the problem non-convex and impractically slow to solve for multi-megapixel images. In this paper we describe a deconvolution approach that is several orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques that use hyper-Laplacian priors. We adopt an alternating minimization scheme where one of the two phases is a non-convex problem that is separable over pixels. This per-pixel sub-problem may be solved with a lookup table (LUT). Alternatively, for two speciﬁc values of α, 1/2 and 2/3 an analytic solution can be found, by ﬁnding the roots of a cubic and quartic polynomial, respectively. Our approach (using either LUTs or analytic formulae) is able to deconvolve a 1 megapixel image in less than ∼3 seconds, achieving comparable quality to existing methods such as iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) that take ∼20 minutes. Furthermore, our method is quite general and can easily be extended to related image processing problems, beyond the deconvolution application demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.52800119 <a title="228-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_with_Compressible_Priors.html">138 nips-2009-Learning with Compressible Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Volkan Cevher</p><p>Abstract: We describe a set of probability distributions, dubbed compressible priors, whose independent and identically distributed (iid) realizations result in p-compressible signals. A signal x ∈ RN is called p-compressible with magnitude R if its sorted coefﬁcients exhibit a power-law decay as |x|(i) R · i−d , where the decay rate d is equal to 1/p. p-compressible signals live close to K-sparse signals (K N) in the r -norm (r > p) since their best K-sparse approximation error decreases with O R · K 1/r−1/p . We show that the membership of generalized Pareto, Student’s t, log-normal, Fr´ chet, and log-logistic distributions to the set of compresse ible priors depends only on the distribution parameters and is independent of N . In contrast, we demonstrate that the membership of the generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) depends both on the signal dimension and the GGD parameters: the expected decay rate of N -sample iid realizations from the GGD with the shape parameter q is given by 1/ [q log (N/q)]. As stylized examples, we show via experiments that the wavelet coefﬁcients of natural images are 1.67-compressible whereas their pixel gradients are 0.95 log (N/0.95)-compressible, on the average. We also leverage the connections between compressible priors and sparse signals to develop new iterative re-weighted sparse signal recovery algorithms that outperform the standard 1 -norm minimization. Finally, we describe how to learn the hyperparameters of compressible priors in underdetermined regression problems by exploiting the geometry of their order statistics during signal recovery. 1</p><p>6 0.52795011 <a title="228-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_transport_operators_for_image_manifolds.html">137 nips-2009-Learning transport operators for image manifolds</a></p>

Marlin</p><p>Abstract: We make several contributions in accelerating approximate Bayesian structural inference for non-decomposable GGMs. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show how to efﬁciently compute a BIC or Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood of non-decomposable graphs using convex methods for precision matrix estimation. This optimization technique can be used as a fast scoring function inside standard Stochastic Local Search (SLS) for generating posterior samples. Our second contribution is a novel framework for efﬁciently generating large sets of high-quality graph topologies without performing local search. This graph proposal method, which we call “Neighborhood Fusion” (NF), samples candidate Markov blankets at each node using sparse regression techniques. Our third contribution is a hybrid method combining the complementary strengths of NF and SLS. Experimental results in structural recovery and prediction tasks demonstrate that NF and hybrid NF/SLS out-perform state-of-the-art local search methods, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, when realistic computational limits are imposed.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.87768209 <a title="228-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Speeding_up_Magnetic_Resonance_Image_Acquisition_by_Bayesian_Multi-Slice_Adaptive_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2009-Speeding up Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition by Bayesian Multi-Slice Adaptive Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter Orbanz</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of constructing nonparametric Bayesian models on inﬁnite-dimensional random objects, such as functions, inﬁnite graphs or inﬁnite permutations. The problem has generated much interest in machine learning, where it is treated heuristically, but has not been studied in full generality in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, which tends to focus on models over probability distributions. Our approach applies a standard tool of stochastic process theory, the construction of stochastic processes from their ﬁnite-dimensional marginal distributions. The main contribution of the paper is a generalization of the classic Kolmogorov extension theorem to conditional probabilities. This extension allows a rigorous construction of nonparametric Bayesian models from systems of ﬁnitedimensional, parametric Bayes equations. Using this approach, we show (i) how existence of a conjugate posterior for the nonparametric model can be guaranteed by choosing conjugate ﬁnite-dimensional models in the construction, (ii) how the mapping to the posterior parameters of the nonparametric model can be explicitly determined, and (iii) that the construction of conjugate models in essence requires the ﬁnite-dimensional models to be in the exponential family. As an application of our constructive framework, we derive a model on inﬁnite permutations, the nonparametric Bayesian analogue of a model recently proposed for the analysis of rank data. 1</p><p>4 0.83069885 <a title="228-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.82467103 <a title="228-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>
<p>Author: Marcel V. Gerven, Botond Cseke, Robert Oostenveld, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the speciﬁcation of constraints between and within sources. We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efﬁcient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior. 1</p><p>6 0.82054627 <a title="228-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>

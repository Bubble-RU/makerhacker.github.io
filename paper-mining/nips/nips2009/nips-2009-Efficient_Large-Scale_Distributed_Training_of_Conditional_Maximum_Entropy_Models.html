<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating a given probability distribution using a simpler distribution plays an important role in several areas of machine learning, for example variational inference and classiﬁcation. Within this context, we consider the task of learning a mixture of tree distributions. Although mixtures of trees can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence using an EM algorithm, its success depends heavily on the initialization. We propose an efﬁcient strategy for obtaining a good initial set of trees that attempts to cover the entire observed distribution by minimizing the α-divergence with α = ∞. We formulate the problem using the fractional covering framework and present a convergent sequential algorithm that only relies on solving a convex program at each iteration. Compared to previous methods, our approach results in a signiﬁcantly smaller mixture of trees that provides similar or better accuracies. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by learning pictorial structures for face recognition.</p><p>4 0.096411444 <a title="75-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Convergent_Temporal-Difference_Learning_with_Arbitrary_Smooth_Function_Approximation.html">60 nips-2009-Convergent Temporal-Difference Learning with Arbitrary Smooth Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shalabh Bhatnagar, Doina Precup, David Silver, Richard S. Sutton, Hamid R. Maei, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the ﬁrst temporal-difference learning algorithms that converge with smooth value function approximators, such as neural networks. Conventional temporal-difference (TD) methods, such as TD(λ), Q-learning and Sarsa have been used successfully with function approximation in many applications. However, it is well known that off-policy sampling, as well as nonlinear function approximation, can cause these algorithms to become unstable (i.e., the parameters of the approximator may diverge). Sutton et al. (2009a, 2009b) solved the problem of off-policy learning with linear TD algorithms by introducing a new objective function, related to the Bellman error, and algorithms that perform stochastic gradient-descent on this function. These methods can be viewed as natural generalizations to previous TD methods, as they converge to the same limit points when used with linear function approximation methods. We generalize this work to nonlinear function approximation. We present a Bellman error objective function and two gradient-descent TD algorithms that optimize it. We prove the asymptotic almost-sure convergence of both algorithms, for any ﬁnite Markov decision process and any smooth value function approximator, to a locally optimal solution. The algorithms are incremental and the computational complexity per time step scales linearly with the number of parameters of the approximator. Empirical results obtained in the game of Go demonstrate the algorithms’ effectiveness. 1</p><p>5 0.072797477 <a title="75-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Kernel_Choice_and_Classifiability_for_RKHS_Embeddings_of_Probability_Distributions.html">118 nips-2009-Kernel Choice and Classifiability for RKHS Embeddings of Probability Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Arthur Gretton, Gert R. Lanckriet, Bernhard Schölkopf, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: Embeddings of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have been proposed as a straightforward and practical means of representing and comparing probabilities. In particular, the distance between embeddings (the maximum mean discrepancy, or MMD) has several key advantages over many classical metrics on distributions, namely easy computability, fast convergence and low bias of ﬁnite sample estimates. An important requirement of the embedding RKHS is that it be characteristic: in this case, the MMD between two distributions is zero if and only if the distributions coincide. Three new results on the MMD are introduced in the present study. First, it is established that MMD corresponds to the optimal risk of a kernel classiﬁer, thus forming a natural link between the distance between distributions and their ease of classiﬁcation. An important consequence is that a kernel must be characteristic to guarantee classiﬁability between distributions in the RKHS. Second, the class of characteristic kernels is broadened to incorporate all strictly positive deﬁnite kernels: these include non-translation invariant kernels and kernels on non-compact domains. Third, a generalization of the MMD is proposed for families of kernels, as the supremum over MMDs on a class of kernels (for instance the Gaussian kernels with different bandwidths). This extension is necessary to obtain a single distance measure if a large selection or class of characteristic kernels is potentially appropriate. This generalization is reasonable, given that it corresponds to the problem of learning the kernel by minimizing the risk of the corresponding kernel classiﬁer. The generalized MMD is shown to have consistent ﬁnite sample estimates, and its performance is demonstrated on a homogeneity testing example. 1</p><p>6 0.071914904 <a title="75-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Slow_Learners_are_Fast.html">220 nips-2009-Slow Learners are Fast</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanjiv Kumar, Mehryar Mohri, Ameet Talwalkar</p><p>Abstract: A crucial technique for scaling kernel methods to very large data sets reaching or exceeding millions of instances is based on low-rank approximation of kernel matrices. We introduce a new family of algorithms based on mixtures of Nystr¨ m o approximations, ensemble Nystr¨ m algorithms, that yield more accurate low-rank o approximations than the standard Nystr¨ m method. We give a detailed study of o variants of these algorithms based on simple averaging, an exponential weight method, or regression-based methods. We also present a theoretical analysis of these algorithms, including novel error bounds guaranteeing a better convergence rate than the standard Nystr¨ m method. Finally, we report results of extensive o experiments with several data sets containing up to 1M points demonstrating the signiﬁcant improvement over the standard Nystr¨ m approximation. o 1</p><p>3 0.60431916 <a title="75-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Periodic_Step_Size_Adaptation_for_Single_Pass_On-line_Learning.html">189 nips-2009-Periodic Step Size Adaptation for Single Pass On-line Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chun-nan Hsu, Yu-ming Chang, Hanshen Huang, Yuh-jye Lee</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that the second-order stochastic gradient descent (2SGD) method can potentially achieve generalization performance as well as empirical optimum in a single pass (i.e., epoch) through the training examples. However, 2SGD requires computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents Periodic Step-size Adaptation (PSA), which approximates the Jacobian matrix of the mapping function and explores a linear relation between the Jacobian and Hessian to approximate the Hessian periodically and achieve near-optimal results in experiments on a wide variety of models and tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.55864 <a title="75-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Lower_bounds_on_minimax_rates_for_nonparametric_regression_with_additive_sparsity_and_smoothness.html">144 nips-2009-Lower bounds on minimax rates for nonparametric regression with additive sparsity and smoothness</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoram Singer, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: We describe, analyze, and experiment with a new framework for empirical loss minimization with regularization. Our algorithmic framework alternates between two phases. On each iteration we ﬁrst perform an unconstrained gradient descent step. We then cast and solve an instantaneous optimization problem that trades off minimization of a regularization term while keeping close proximity to the result of the ﬁrst phase. This yields a simple yet effective algorithm for both batch penalized risk minimization and online learning. Furthermore, the two phase approach enables sparse solutions when used in conjunction with regularization functions that promote sparsity, such as ℓ1 . We derive concrete and very simple algorithms for minimization of loss functions with ℓ1 , ℓ2 , ℓ2 , and ℓ∞ regularization. We 2 also show how to construct efﬁcient algorithms for mixed-norm ℓ1 /ℓq regularization. We further extend the algorithms and give efﬁcient implementations for very high-dimensional data with sparsity. We demonstrate the potential of the proposed framework in experiments with synthetic and natural datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.50586045 <a title="75-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Convergent_Temporal-Difference_Learning_with_Arbitrary_Smooth_Function_Approximation.html">60 nips-2009-Convergent Temporal-Difference Learning with Arbitrary Smooth Function Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Waugh, Nolan Bard, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Extensive games are often used to model the interactions of multiple agents within an environment. Much recent work has focused on increasing the size of an extensive game that can be feasibly solved. Despite these improvements, many interesting games are still too large for such techniques. A common approach for computing strategies in these large games is to ﬁrst employ an abstraction technique to reduce the original game to an abstract game that is of a manageable size. This abstract game is then solved and the resulting strategy is played in the original game. Most top programs in recent AAAI Computer Poker Competitions use this approach. The trend in this competition has been that strategies found in larger abstract games tend to beat strategies found in smaller abstract games. These larger abstract games have more expressive strategy spaces and therefore contain better strategies. In this paper we present a new method for computing strategies in large games. This method allows us to compute more expressive strategies without increasing the size of abstract games that we are required to solve. We demonstrate the power of the approach experimentally in both small and large games, while also providing a theoretical justiﬁcation for the resulting improvement. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.69334537 <a title="75-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Large-Scale_Distributed_Training_of_Conditional_Maximum_Entropy_Models.html">75 nips-2009-Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Training of Conditional Maximum Entropy Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Mcdonald, Mehryar Mohri, Nathan Silberman, Dan Walker, Gideon S. Mann</p><p>Abstract: Training conditional maximum entropy models on massive data sets requires signiﬁcant computational resources. We examine three common distributed training methods for conditional maxent: a distributed gradient computation method, a majority vote method, and a mixture weight method. We analyze and compare the CPU and network time complexity of each of these methods and present a theoretical analysis of conditional maxent models, including a study of the convergence of the mixture weight method, the most resource-efﬁcient technique. We also report the results of large-scale experiments comparing these three methods which demonstrate the beneﬁts of the mixture weight method: this method consumes less resources, while achieving a performance comparable to that of standard approaches.</p><p>3 0.67682534 <a title="75-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Non-stationary_continuous_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">168 nips-2009-Non-stationary continuous dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Grzegorczyk, Dirk Husmeier</p><p>Abstract: Dynamic Bayesian networks have been applied widely to reconstruct the structure of regulatory processes from time series data. The standard approach is based on the assumption of a homogeneous Markov chain, which is not valid in many realworld scenarios. Recent research efforts addressing this shortcoming have considered undirected graphs, directed graphs for discretized data, or over-ﬂexible models that lack any information sharing among time series segments. In the present article, we propose a non-stationary dynamic Bayesian network for continuous data, in which parameters are allowed to vary among segments, and in which a common network structure provides essential information sharing across segments. Our model is based on a Bayesian multiple change-point process, where the number and location of the change-points is sampled from the posterior distribution. 1</p><p>4 0.62262982 <a title="75-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Regularized_Distance_Metric_Learning%3ATheory_and_Algorithm.html">202 nips-2009-Regularized Distance Metric Learning:Theory and Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Rong Jin, Shijun Wang, Yang Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning. We show that with appropriate constraints, the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning could be independent from the dimensionality, making it suitable for handling high dimensional data. In addition, we present an efﬁcient online learning algorithm for regularized distance metric learning. Our empirical studies with data classiﬁcation and face recognition show that the proposed algorithm is (i) effective for distance metric learning when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) efﬁcient and robust for high dimensional data.</p><p>5 0.62189662 <a title="75-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Match_Kernel_between_Sets_of_Features_for_Visual_Recognition.html">77 nips-2009-Efficient Match Kernel between Sets of Features for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: In visual recognition, the images are frequently modeled as unordered collections of local features (bags). We show that bag-of-words representations commonly used in conjunction with linear classiﬁers can be viewed as special match kernels, which count 1 if two local features fall into the same regions partitioned by visual words and 0 otherwise. Despite its simplicity, this quantization is too coarse, motivating research into the design of match kernels that more accurately measure the similarity between local features. However, it is impractical to use such kernels for large datasets due to their signiﬁcant computational cost. To address this problem, we propose efﬁcient match kernels (EMK) that map local features to a low dimensional feature space and average the resulting vectors to form a setlevel feature. The local feature maps are learned so their inner products preserve, to the best possible, the values of the speciﬁed kernel function. Classiﬁers based on EMK are linear both in the number of images and in the number of local features. We demonstrate that EMK are extremely efﬁcient and achieve the current state of the art in three difﬁcult computer vision datasets: Scene-15, Caltech-101 and Caltech-256. 1</p><p>6 0.54730898 <a title="75-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Monte_Carlo_Sampling_for_Regret_Minimization_in_Extensive_Games.html">156 nips-2009-Monte Carlo Sampling for Regret Minimization in Extensive Games</a></p>

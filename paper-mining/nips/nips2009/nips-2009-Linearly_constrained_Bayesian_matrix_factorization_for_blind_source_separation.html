<p>Author: Paris Smaragdis, Madhusudana Shashanka, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm for separating mixed sounds from a monophonic recording. Our approach makes use of training data which allows us to learn representations of the types of sounds that compose the mixture. In contrast to popular methods that attempt to extract compact generalizable models for each sound from training data, we employ the training data itself as a representation of the sources in the mixture. We show that mixtures of known sounds can be described as sparse combinations of the training data itself, and in doing so produce signiﬁcantly better separation results as compared to similar systems based on compact statistical models.

<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for ﬂexible probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message passing to compute the global likelihoods and posteriors. This algorithm, the ﬁrst parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of magnitude larger than have previously been possible. 1</p><p>6 0.08463338 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Augmenting_Feature-driven_fMRI_Analyses%3A_Semi-supervised_learning_and_resting_state_activity.html">38 nips-2009-Augmenting Feature-driven fMRI Analyses: Semi-supervised learning and resting state activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Jarno Vanhatalo, Pasi Jylänki, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: In the Gaussian process regression the observation model is commonly assumed to be Gaussian, which is convenient in computational perspective. However, the drawback is that the predictive accuracy of the model can be signiﬁcantly compromised if the observations are contaminated by outliers. A robust observation model, such as the Student-t distribution, reduces the inﬂuence of outlying observations and improves the predictions. The problem, however, is the analytically intractable inference. In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference. We compare our approach to a variational approximation and a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, which utilize the commonly used scale mixture representation of the Student-t distribution. 1</p><p>5 0.40568992 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Variational_Inference_for_the_Nested_Chinese_Restaurant_Process.html">255 nips-2009-Variational Inference for the Nested Chinese Restaurant Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: The nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian model for learning tree-based hierarchies from data. Since its posterior distribution is intractable, current inference methods have all relied on MCMC sampling. In this paper, we develop an alternative inference technique based on variational methods. To employ variational methods, we derive a tree-based stick-breaking construction of the nCRP mixture model, and a novel variational algorithm that efﬁciently explores a posterior over a large set of combinatorial structures. We demonstrate the use of this approach for text and hand written digits modeling, where we show we can adapt the nCRP to continuous data as well. 1</p><p>6 0.40253073 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Matrix_Completion_from_Noisy_Entries.html">147 nips-2009-Matrix Completion from Noisy Entries</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhi Yang, Qi Zhao, Edward Keefer, Wentai Liu</p><p>Abstract: Studying signal and noise properties of recorded neural data is critical in developing more efﬁcient algorithms to recover the encoded information. Important issues exist in this research including the variant spectrum spans of neural spikes that make it difﬁcult to choose a globally optimal bandpass ﬁlter. Also, multiple sources produce aggregated noise that deviates from the conventional white Gaussian noise. In this work, the spectrum variability of spikes is addressed, based on which the concept of adaptive bandpass ﬁlter that ﬁts the spectrum of individual spikes is proposed. Multiple noise sources have been studied through analytical models as well as empirical measurements. The dominant noise source is identiﬁed as neuron noise followed by interface noise of the electrode. This suggests that major efforts to reduce noise from electronics are not well spent. The measured noise from in vivo experiments shows a family of 1/f x spectrum that can be reduced using noise shaping techniques. In summary, the methods of adaptive bandpass ﬁltering and noise shaping together result in several dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.81887466 <a title="140-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Linearly_constrained_Bayesian_matrix_factorization_for_blind_source_separation.html">140 nips-2009-Linearly constrained Bayesian matrix factorization for blind source separation</a></p>

<p>Author: Theodore J. Perkins</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains are used to model systems in which transitions between states as well as the time the system spends in each state are random. Many computational problems related to such chains have been solved, including determining state distributions as a function of time, parameter estimation, and control. However, the problem of inferring most likely trajectories, where a trajectory is a sequence of states as well as the amount of time spent in each state, appears unsolved. We study three versions of this problem: (i) an initial value problem, in which an initial state is given and we seek the most likely trajectory until a given ﬁnal time, (ii) a boundary value problem, in which initial and ﬁnal states and times are given, and we seek the most likely trajectory connecting them, and (iii) trajectory inference under partial observability, analogous to ﬁnding maximum likelihood trajectories for hidden Markov models. We show that maximum likelihood trajectories are not always well-deﬁned, and describe a polynomial time test for well-deﬁnedness. When well-deﬁnedness holds, we show that each of the three problems can be solved in polynomial time, and we develop efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms for doing so. 1</p><p>6 0.77514929 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Lattice_Regression.html">124 nips-2009-Lattice Regression</a></p>

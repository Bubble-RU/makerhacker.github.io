<p>Author: Zhirong Yang, Irwin King, Zenglin Xu, Erkki Oja</p><p>Abstract: Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (SNE) has shown to be quite promising for data visualization. Currently, the most popular implementation, t-SNE, is restricted to a particular Student t-distribution as its embedding distribution. Moreover, it uses a gradient descent algorithm that may require users to tune parameters such as the learning step size, momentum, etc., in ﬁnding its optimum. In this paper, we propose the Heavy-tailed Symmetric Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (HSSNE) method, which is a generalization of the t-SNE to accommodate various heavytailed embedding similarity functions. With this generalization, we are presented with two difﬁculties. The ﬁrst is how to select the best embedding similarity among all heavy-tailed functions and the second is how to optimize the objective function once the heavy-tailed function has been selected. Our contributions then are: (1) we point out that various heavy-tailed embedding similarities can be characterized by their negative score functions. Based on this ﬁnding, we present a parameterized subset of similarity functions for choosing the best tail-heaviness for HSSNE; (2) we present a ﬁxed-point optimization algorithm that can be applied to all heavy-tailed functions and does not require the user to set any parameters; and (3) we present two empirical studies, one for unsupervised visualization showing that our optimization algorithm runs as fast and as good as the best known t-SNE implementation and the other for semi-supervised visualization showing quantitative superiority using the homogeneity measure as well as qualitative advantage in cluster separation over t-SNE.</p><p>3 0.087024406 <a title="160-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Label_Selection_on_Graphs.html">122 nips-2009-Label Selection on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Guillory, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate methods for selecting sets of labeled vertices for use in predicting the labels of vertices on a graph. We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate. We show improved performance over baseline methods on several real world data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.075946398 <a title="160-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Analysis_of_SVM_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">33 nips-2009-Analysis of SVM with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Colin Campbell, Mark Girolami</p><p>Abstract: The recent introduction of indeﬁnite SVM by Luss and d’Aspremont [15] has effectively demonstrated SVM classiﬁcation with a non-positive semi-deﬁnite kernel (indeﬁnite kernel). This paper studies the properties of the objective function introduced there. In particular, we show that the objective function is continuously differentiable and its gradient can be explicitly computed. Indeed, we further show that its gradient is Lipschitz continuous. The main idea behind our analysis is that the objective function is smoothed by the penalty term, in its saddle (min-max) representation, measuring the distance between the indeﬁnite kernel matrix and the proxy positive semi-deﬁnite one. Our elementary result greatly facilitates the application of gradient-based algorithms. Based on our analysis, we further develop Nesterov’s smooth optimization approach [17, 18] for indeﬁnite SVM which has an optimal convergence rate for smooth problems. Experiments on various benchmark datasets validate our analysis and demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed algorithms.</p><p>5 0.069889441 <a title="160-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Structured_output_regression_for_detection_with_partial_truncation.html">236 nips-2009-Structured output regression for detection with partial truncation</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: We develop a structured output model for object category detection that explicitly accounts for alignment, multiple aspects and partial truncation in both training and inference. The model is formulated as large margin learning with latent variables and slack rescaling, and both training and inference are computationally efﬁcient. We make the following contributions: (i) we note that extending the Structured Output Regression formulation of Blaschko and Lampert [1] to include a bias term signiﬁcantly improves performance; (ii) that alignment (to account for small rotations and anisotropic scalings) can be included as a latent variable and efﬁciently determined and implemented; (iii) that the latent variable extends to multiple aspects (e.g. left facing, right facing, front) with the same formulation; and (iv), most signiﬁcantly for performance, that truncated and truncated instances can be included in both training and inference with an explicit truncation mask. We demonstrate the method by training and testing on the PASCAL VOC 2007 data set – training includes the truncated examples, and in testing object instances are detected at multiple scales, alignments, and with signiﬁcant truncations. 1</p><p>6 0.06457743 <a title="160-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Distribution_Matching_for_Transduction.html">72 nips-2009-Distribution Matching for Transduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, James Petterson, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many transductive inference algorithms assume that distributions over training and test estimates should be related, e.g. by providing a large margin of separation on both sets. We use this idea to design a transduction algorithm which can be used without modiﬁcation for classiﬁcation, regression, and structured estimation. At its heart we exploit the fact that for a good learner the distributions over the outputs on training and test sets should match. This is a classical two-sample problem which can be solved efﬁciently in its most general form by using distance measures in Hilbert Space. It turns out that a number of existing heuristics can be viewed as special cases of our approach. 1</p><p>4 0.5113551 <a title="160-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Periodic_Step_Size_Adaptation_for_Single_Pass_On-line_Learning.html">189 nips-2009-Periodic Step Size Adaptation for Single Pass On-line Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chun-nan Hsu, Yu-ming Chang, Hanshen Huang, Yuh-jye Lee</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that the second-order stochastic gradient descent (2SGD) method can potentially achieve generalization performance as well as empirical optimum in a single pass (i.e., epoch) through the training examples. However, 2SGD requires computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents Periodic Step-size Adaptation (PSA), which approximates the Jacobian matrix of the mapping function and explores a linear relation between the Jacobian and Hessian to approximate the Hessian periodically and achieve near-optimal results in experiments on a wide variety of models and tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.49687743 <a title="160-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Large-Scale_Distributed_Training_of_Conditional_Maximum_Entropy_Models.html">75 nips-2009-Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Training of Conditional Maximum Entropy Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Mcdonald, Mehryar Mohri, Nathan Silberman, Dan Walker, Gideon S. Mann</p><p>Abstract: Training conditional maximum entropy models on massive data sets requires signiﬁcant computational resources. We examine three common distributed training methods for conditional maxent: a distributed gradient computation method, a majority vote method, and a mixture weight method. We analyze and compare the CPU and network time complexity of each of these methods and present a theoretical analysis of conditional maxent models, including a study of the convergence of the mixture weight method, the most resource-efﬁcient technique. We also report the results of large-scale experiments comparing these three methods which demonstrate the beneﬁts of the mixture weight method: this method consumes less resources, while achieving a performance comparable to that of standard approaches.</p><p>6 0.48882511 <a title="160-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Structured_output_regression_for_detection_with_partial_truncation.html">236 nips-2009-Structured output regression for detection with partial truncation</a></p>

<p>Author: Hamed Pirsiavash, Deva Ramanan, Charless C. Fowlkes</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithm for learning bilinear SVMs. Bilinear classiﬁers are a discriminative variant of bilinear models, which capture the dependence of data on multiple factors. Such models are particularly appropriate for visual data that is better represented as a matrix or tensor, rather than a vector. Matrix encodings allow for more natural regularization through rank restriction. For example, a rank-one scanning-window classiﬁer yields a separable ﬁlter. Low-rank models have fewer parameters and so are easier to regularize and faster to score at run-time. We learn low-rank models with bilinear classiﬁers. We also use bilinear classiﬁers for transfer learning by sharing linear factors between different classiﬁcation tasks. Bilinear classiﬁers are trained with biconvex programs. Such programs are optimized with coordinate descent, where each coordinate step requires solving a convex program - in our case, we use a standard off-the-shelf SVM solver. We demonstrate bilinear SVMs on difﬁcult problems of people detection in video sequences and action classiﬁcation of video sequences, achieving state-of-the-art results in both. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.71176893 <a title="160-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Multiple_Incremental_Decremental_Learning_of_Support_Vector_Machines.html">160 nips-2009-Multiple Incremental Decremental Learning of Support Vector Machines</a></p>

Our approach is especially useful for online SVM learning in which we need to remove old data points and add new data points in a short amount of time.</p><p>3 0.63007402 <a title="160-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_and_Accurate_Lp-Norm_Multiple_Kernel_Learning.html">80 nips-2009-Efficient and Accurate Lp-Norm Multiple Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Kloft, Ulf Brefeld, Pavel Laskov, Klaus-Robert Müller, Alexander Zien, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: Learning linear combinations of multiple kernels is an appealing strategy when the right choice of features is unknown. Previous approaches to multiple kernel learning (MKL) promote sparse kernel combinations to support interpretability. Unfortunately, 1 -norm MKL is hardly observed to outperform trivial baselines in practical applications. To allow for robust kernel mixtures, we generalize MKL to arbitrary p -norms. We devise new insights on the connection between several existing MKL formulations and develop two efﬁcient interleaved optimization strategies for arbitrary p > 1. Empirically, we demonstrate that the interleaved optimization strategies are much faster compared to the traditionally used wrapper approaches. Finally, we apply p -norm MKL to real-world problems from computational biology, showing that non-sparse MKL achieves accuracies that go beyond the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>4 0.62968647 <a title="160-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Periodic_Step_Size_Adaptation_for_Single_Pass_On-line_Learning.html">189 nips-2009-Periodic Step Size Adaptation for Single Pass On-line Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chun-nan Hsu, Yu-ming Chang, Hanshen Huang, Yuh-jye Lee</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that the second-order stochastic gradient descent (2SGD) method can potentially achieve generalization performance as well as empirical optimum in a single pass (i.e., epoch) through the training examples. However, 2SGD requires computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents Periodic Step-size Adaptation (PSA), which approximates the Jacobian matrix of the mapping function and explores a linear relation between the Jacobian and Hessian to approximate the Hessian periodically and achieve near-optimal results in experiments on a wide variety of models and tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.62829369 <a title="160-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Sparsistent_Learning_of_Varying-coefficient_Models_with_Structural_Changes.html">225 nips-2009-Sparsistent Learning of Varying-coefficient Models with Structural Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Mladen Kolar, Le Song, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: To estimate the changing structure of a varying-coefﬁcient varying-structure (VCVS) model remains an important and open problem in dynamic system modelling, which includes learning trajectories of stock prices, or uncovering the topology of an evolving gene network. In this paper, we investigate sparsistent learning of a sub-family of this model — piecewise constant VCVS models. We analyze two main issues in this problem: inferring time points where structural changes occur and estimating model structure (i.e., model selection) on each of the constant segments. We propose a two-stage adaptive procedure, which ﬁrst identiﬁes jump points of structural changes and then identiﬁes relevant covariates to a response on each of the segments. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the procedure, showing that with the increasing sample size, number of structural changes, and number of variables, the true model can be consistently selected. We demonstrate the performance of the method on synthetic data and apply it to the brain computer interface dataset. We also consider how this applies to structure estimation of time-varying probabilistic graphical models. 1</p><p>6 0.6275273 <a title="160-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Time-Varying_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">246 nips-2009-Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>

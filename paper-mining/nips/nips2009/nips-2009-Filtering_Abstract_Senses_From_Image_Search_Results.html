<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Fernando Pereira, Yoram Singer, Dennis Strelow</p><p>Abstract: Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text, image and video processing. While it is relatively easy to determine a suitable word dictionary for text documents, there is no simple mapping from raw images or videos to dictionary terms. The classical approach builds a dictionary using vector quantization over a large set of useful visual descriptors extracted from a training set, and uses a nearest-neighbor algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each dictionary word in documents to be encoded. More robust approaches have been proposed recently that represent each visual descriptor as a sparse weighted combination of dictionary words. While favoring a sparse representation at the level of visual descriptors, those methods however do not ensure that images have sparse representation. In this work, we use mixed-norm regularization to achieve sparsity at the image level as well as a small overall dictionary. This approach can also be used to encourage using the same dictionary words for all the images in a class, providing a discriminative signal in the construction of image representations. Experimental results on a benchmark image classiﬁcation dataset show that when compact image or dictionary representations are needed for computational efﬁciency, the proposed approach yields better mean average precision in classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.20055106 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-A_Bayesian_Analysis_of_Dynamics_in_Free_Recall.html">4 nips-2009-A Bayesian Analysis of Dynamics in Free Recall</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher, Samuel Gershman, Per Sederberg, Kenneth Norman, Adler J. Perotte, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We develop a probabilistic model of human memory performance in free recall experiments. In these experiments, a subject ﬁrst studies a list of words and then tries to recall them. To model these data, we draw on both previous psychological research and statistical topic models of text documents. We assume that memories are formed by assimilating the semantic meaning of studied words (represented as a distribution over topics) into a slowly changing latent context (represented in the same space). During recall, this context is reinstated and used as a cue for retrieving studied words. By conceptualizing memory retrieval as a dynamic latent variable model, we are able to use Bayesian inference to represent uncertainty and reason about the cognitive processes underlying memory. We present a particle ﬁlter algorithm for performing approximate posterior inference, and evaluate our model on the prediction of recalled words in experimental data. By specifying the model hierarchically, we are also able to capture inter-subject variability. 1</p><p>4 0.19725019 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Zero-shot_Learning_with_Semantic_Output_Codes.html">260 nips-2009-Zero-shot Learning with Semantic Output Codes</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Palatucci, Dean Pomerleau, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Tom M. Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of zero-shot learning, where the goal is to learn a classiﬁer f : X → Y that must predict novel values of Y that were omitted from the training set. To achieve this, we deﬁne the notion of a semantic output code classiﬁer (SOC) which utilizes a knowledge base of semantic properties of Y to extrapolate to novel classes. We provide a formalism for this type of classiﬁer and study its theoretical properties in a PAC framework, showing conditions under which the classiﬁer can accurately predict novel classes. As a case study, we build a SOC classiﬁer for a neural decoding task and show that it can often predict words that people are thinking about from functional magnetic resonance images (fMRI) of their neural activity, even without training examples for those words. 1</p><p>5 0.18217702 <a title="96-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Segmenting_Scenes_by_Matching_Image_Composites.html">211 nips-2009-Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Alyosha Efros, Josef Sivic, Bill Freeman, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how, given an image, similar images sharing the same global description can help with unsupervised scene segmentation. In contrast to recent work in semantic alignment of scenes, we allow an input image to be explained by partial matches of similar scenes. This allows for a better explanation of the input scenes. We perform MRF-based segmentation that optimizes over matches, while respecting boundary information. The recovered segments are then used to re-query a large database of images to retrieve better matches for the target regions. We show improved performance in detecting the principal occluding and contact boundaries for the scene over previous methods on data gathered from the LabelMe database.</p><p>6 0.16844214 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Simultaneous_Image_Clustering%2C_Annotation_and_Object_Segmentation.html">5 nips-2009-A Bayesian Model for Simultaneous Image Clustering, Annotation and Object Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Lan Du, Lu Ren, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A non-parametric Bayesian model is proposed for processing multiple images. The analysis employs image features and, when present, the words associated with accompanying annotations. The model clusters the images into classes, and each image is segmented into a set of objects, also allowing the opportunity to assign a word to each object (localized labeling). Each object is assumed to be represented as a heterogeneous mix of components, with this realized via mixture models linking image features to object types. The number of image classes, number of object types, and the characteristics of the object-feature mixture models are inferred nonparametrically. To constitute spatially contiguous objects, a new logistic stick-breaking process is developed. Inference is performed efﬁciently via variational Bayesian analysis, with example results presented on two image databases.</p><p>3 0.72939956 <a title="96-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Group_Sparse_Coding.html">104 nips-2009-Group Sparse Coding</a></p>

<p>Author: Tomoharu Iwata, Takeshi Yamada, Naonori Ueda</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic topic model for analyzing and extracting contentrelated annotations from noisy annotated discrete data such as web pages stored in social bookmarking services. In these services, since users can attach annotations freely, some annotations do not describe the semantics of the content, thus they are noisy, i.e. not content-related. The extraction of content-related annotations can be used as a preprocessing step in machine learning tasks such as text classiﬁcation and image recognition, or can improve information retrieval performance. The proposed model is a generative model for content and annotations, in which the annotations are assumed to originate either from topics that generated the content or from a general distribution unrelated to the content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using synthetic data and real social annotation data for text and images.</p><p>5 0.68058008 <a title="96-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Texture_Learning_and_Synthesis.html">172 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Texture Learning and Synthesis</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Zhu, Yuanahao Chen, Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for texture learning and synthesis. A texture image is represented by a 2D Hidden Markov Model (2DHMM) where the hidden states correspond to the cluster labeling of textons and the transition matrix encodes their spatial layout (the compatibility between adjacent textons). The 2DHMM is coupled with the Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which allows the number of textons and the complexity of transition matrix grow as the input texture becomes irregular. The HDP makes use of Dirichlet process prior which favors regular textures by penalizing the model complexity. This framework (HDP-2DHMM) learns the texton vocabulary and their spatial layout jointly and automatically. The HDP-2DHMM results in a compact representation of textures which allows fast texture synthesis with comparable rendering quality over the state-of-the-art patch-based rendering methods. We also show that the HDP2DHMM can be applied to perform image segmentation and synthesis. The preliminary results suggest that HDP-2DHMM is generally useful for further applications in low-level vision problems. 1</p><p>6 0.6657666 <a title="96-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Zero-shot_Learning_with_Semantic_Output_Codes.html">260 nips-2009-Zero-shot Learning with Semantic Output Codes</a></p>

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian model of document collections that decouples sparsity and smoothness in the component distributions (i.e., the “topics”). In the sparse topic model (sparseTM), each topic is represented by a bank of selector variables that determine which terms appear in the topic. Thus each topic is associated with a subset of the vocabulary, and topic smoothness is modeled on this subset. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for the sparseTM that includes a general-purpose method for sampling from a Dirichlet mixture with a combinatorial number of components. We demonstrate the sparseTM on four real-world datasets. Compared to traditional approaches, the empirical results will show that sparseTMs give better predictive performance with simpler inferred models. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86761242 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Filtering_Abstract_Senses_From_Image_Search_Results.html">96 nips-2009-Filtering Abstract Senses From Image Search Results</a></p>

As words are generally polysemous, this approach can lead to relatively noisy models if many examples due to outlier senses are added to the model. We argue that images associated with an abstract word sense should be excluded when training a visual classiﬁer to learn a model of a physical object. While image clustering can group together visually coherent sets of returned images, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish whether an image cluster relates to a desired object or to an abstract sense of the word. We propose a method that uses both image features and the text associated with the images to relate latent topics to particular senses. Our model does not require any human supervision, and takes as input only the name of an object category. We show results of retrieving concrete-sense images in two available multimodal, multi-sense databases, as well as experiment with object classiﬁers trained on concrete-sense images returned by our method for a set of ten common ofﬁce objects. 1</p><p>3 0.84565717 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Maximin_affinity_learning_of_image_segmentation.html">149 nips-2009-Maximin affinity learning of image segmentation</a></p>

Turaga</p><p>Abstract: Images can be segmented by ﬁrst using a classiﬁer to predict an afﬁnity graph that reﬂects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the afﬁnity classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassiﬁcation rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the afﬁnity graph. We present the ﬁrst machine learning algorithm for training a classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classiﬁcation of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of ﬁnding the connected components of the thresholded afﬁnity graph, we are able to train an afﬁnity classiﬁer to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin afﬁnities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity. 1</p><p>4 0.84459293 <a title="96-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>5 0.84293079 <a title="96-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli_Alignment%3A_A_Generative_Model_for_Multi-Class_Multi-Label_Multi-Instance_Corpora.html">68 nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment: A Generative Model for Multi-Class Multi-Label Multi-Instance Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang-hong Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Bao-gang Hu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predeﬁned classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-deﬁned classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classiﬁcation and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classiﬁcation and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.</p><p>6 0.83981514 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Streaming_Pointwise_Mutual_Information.html">233 nips-2009-Streaming Pointwise Mutual Information</a></p>

<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>3 0.31074727 <a title="213-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Learning%3A_The_Limit_of_Infinite_Unlabelled_Data.html">229 nips-2009-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Nathan Srebro, Xueyuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for SemiSupervised Learning at the regime of a ﬁxed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in Rd , d 2, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the “smoothness” assumptions associated with this alternate method. 1 Introduction and Setup In this paper we consider the limit behavior of two popular semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the graph Laplacian: the regularization approach [15] and the spectral approach [3]. We consider the limit when the number of labeled points is ﬁxed and the number of unlabeled points goes to inﬁnity. This is a natural limit for SSL as the basic SSL scenario is one in which unlabeled data is virtually inﬁnite. We can also think of this limit as “perfect” SSL, having full knowledge of the marginal density p(x). The premise of SSL is that the marginal density p(x) is informative about the unknown mapping y(x) we are trying to learn, e.g. since y(x) is expected to be “smooth” in some sense relative to p(x). Studying the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit, where p(x) is fully known, allows us to formulate and understand the underlying smoothness assumptions of a particular SSL method, and judge whether it is well-posed and sensible. Understanding the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit is also a necessary ﬁrst step to studying the convergence of the ﬁnite-labeled-data estimator. We consider the following setup: Let p(x) be an unknown smooth density on a compact domain Ω ⊂ Rd with a smooth boundary. Let y : Ω → Y be the unknown function we wish to estimate. In case of regression Y = R whereas in binary classiﬁcation Y = {−1, 1}. The standard (transductive) semisupervised learning problem is formulated as follows: Given l labeled points, (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ), with yi = y(xi ), and u unlabeled points xl+1 , . . . , xl+u , with all points xi sampled i.i.d. from p(x), the goal is to construct an estimate of y(xl+i ) for any unlabeled point xl+i , utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled points. We denote the total number of points by n = l + u. We are interested in the regime where l is ﬁxed and u → ∞. 1 2 SSL with Graph Laplacian Regularization We ﬁrst consider the following graph-based approach formulated by Zhu et. al. [15]: y (x) = arg min In (y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l y where 1 n2 In (y) = Wi,j (y(xi ) − y(xj ))2 (1) (2) i,j is a Laplacian regularization term enforcing “smoothness” with respect to the n×n similarity matrix W . This formulation has several natural interpretations in terms of, e.g. random walks and electrical circuits [15]. These interpretations, however, refer to a ﬁxed graph, over a ﬁnite set of points with given similarities. In contrast, our focus here is on the more typical scenario where the points xi ∈ Rd are a random sample from a density p(x), and W is constructed based on this sample. We would like to understand the behavior of the method in terms of the density p(x), particularly in the limit where the number of unlabeled points grows. Under what assumptions on the target labeling y(x) and on the density p(x) is the method (1) sensible? The answer, of course, depends on how the matrix W is constructed. We consider the common situation where the similarities are obtained by applying some decay ﬁlter to the distances: xi −xj σ Wi,j = G (3) where G : R+ → R+ is some function with an adequately fast decay. Popular choices are the 2 Gaussian ﬁlter G(z) = e−z /2 or the ǫ-neighborhood graph obtained by the step ﬁlter G(z) = 1z<1 . For simplicity, we focus here on the formulation (1) where the solution is required to satisfy the constraints at the labeled points exactly. In practice, the hard labeling constraints are often replaced with a softer loss-based data term, which is balanced against the smoothness term In (y), e.g. [14, 6]. Our analysis and conclusions apply to such variants as well. Limit of the Laplacian Regularization Term As the number of unlabeled examples grows the regularization term (2) converges to its expectation, where the summation is replaced by integration w.r.t. the density p(x): lim In (y) = I (σ) (y) = n→∞ G Ω Ω x−x′ σ (y(x) − y(x′ ))2 p(x)p(x′ )dxdx′ . (4) In the above limit, the bandwidth σ is held ﬁxed. Typically, one would also drive the bandwidth σ to zero as n → ∞. There are two reasons for this choice. First, from a practical perspective, this makes the similarity matrix W sparse so it can be stored and processed. Second, from a theoretical perspective, this leads to a clear and well deﬁned limit of the smoothness regularization term In (y), at least when σ → 0 slowly enough1 , namely when σ = ω( d log n/n). If σ → 0 as n → ∞, and as long as nσ d / log n → ∞, then after appropriate normalization, the regularizer converges to a density weighted gradient penalty term [7, 8]: d lim d+2 In (y) n→∞ Cσ (σ) d (y) d+2 I σ→0 Cσ = lim ∇y(x) 2 p(x)2 dx = J(y) = (5) Ω where C = Rd z 2 G( z )dz, and assuming 0 < C < ∞ (which is the case for both the Gaussian and the step ﬁlters). This energy functional J(f ) therefore encodes the notion of “smoothness” with respect to p(x) that is the basis of the SSL formulation (1) with the graph constructions speciﬁed by (3). To understand the behavior and appropriateness of (1) we must understand this functional and the associated limit problem: y (x) = arg min J(y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l (6) y p When σ = o( d 1/n) then all non-diagonal weights Wi,j vanish (points no longer have any “close by” p neighbors). We are not aware of an analysis covering the regime where σ decays roughly as d 1/n, but would be surprised if a qualitatively different meaningful limit is reached. 1 2 3 Graph Laplacian Regularization in R1 We begin by considering the solution of (6) for one dimensional data, i.e. d = 1 and x ∈ R. We ﬁrst consider the situation where the support of p(x) is a continuous interval Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R (a and/or b may be inﬁnite). Without loss of generality, we assume the labeled data is sorted in increasing order a x1 < x2 < · · · < xl b. Applying the theory of variational calculus, the solution y (x) ˆ satisﬁes inside each interval (xi , xi+1 ) the Euler-Lagrange equation d dy p2 (x) = 0. dx dx Performing two integrations and enforcing the constraints at the labeled points yields y(x) = yi + x 1/p2 (t)dt xi (yi+1 xi+1 1/p2 (t)dt xi − yi ) for xi x xi+1 (7) with y(x) = x1 for a x x1 and y(x) = xl for xl x b. If the support of p(x) is a union of disjoint intervals, the above analysis and the form of the solution applies in each interval separately. The solution (7) seems reasonable and desirable from the point of view of the “smoothness” assumptions: when p(x) is uniform, the solution interpolates linearly between labeled data points, whereas across low-density regions, where p(x) is close to zero, y(x) can change abruptly. Furthermore, the regularizer J(y) can be interpreted as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) squared semi-norm, giving us additional insight into this choice of regularizer: b 1 Theorem 1. Let p(x) be a smooth density on Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R such that Ap = 4 a 1/p2 (t)dt < ∞. 2 Then, J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm J(f ) = f Kp induced by the kernel x′ ′ Kp (x, x ) = Ap − 1 2 x with a null-space of all constant functions. That is, f the RKHS induced by Kp . 1 p2 (t) dt Kp . (8) is the norm of the projection of f onto If p(x) is supported on several disjoint intervals, Ω = ∪i [ai , bi ], then J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm induced by the kernel 1 bi dt 4 ai p2 (t) ′ Kp (x, x ) = − 1 2 x′ dt x p2 (t) if x, x′ ∈ [ai , bi ] (9) if x ∈ [ai , bi ], x′ ∈ [aj , bj ], i = j 0 with a null-space spanned by indicator functions 1[ai ,bi ] (x) on the connected components of Ω. Proof. For any f (x) = i αi Kp (x, xi ) in the RKHS induced by Kp : df dx J(f ) = 2 p2 (x)dx = αi αj Jij (10) i,j where Jij = d d Kp (x, xi ) Kp (x, xj )p2 (x)dx dx dx When xi and xj are in different connected components of Ω, the gradients of Kp (·, xi ) and Kp (·, xj ) are never non-zero together and Jij = 0 = Kp (xi , xj ). When they are in the same connected component [a, b], and assuming w.l.o.g. a xi xj b: Jij = = xi 1 4 1 4 a b a 1 dt + p2 (t) 1 1 dt − p2 (t) 2 xj xi xj xi −1 dt + p2 (t) xj 1 dt p2 (t) 1 dt = Kp (xi , xj ). p2 (t) Substituting Jij = Kp (xi , xj ) into (10) yields J(f ) = 3 b αi αj Kp (xi , xj ) = f (11) Kp . Combining Theorem 1 with the Representer Theorem [13] establishes that the solution of (6) (or of any variant where the hard constraints are replaced by a data term) is of the form: l y(x) = αj Kp (x, xj ) + βi 1[ai ,bi ] (x), j=1 i where i ranges over the connected components [ai , bi ] of Ω, and we have: l J(y) = αi αj Kp (xi , xj ). (12) i,j=1 Viewing the regularizer as y 2 p suggests understanding (6), and so also its empirical approximaK tion (1), by interpreting Kp (x, x′ ) as a density-based “similarity measure” between x and x′ . This similarity measure indeed seems sensible: for a uniform density it is simply linearly decreasing as a function of the distance. When the density is non-uniform, two points are relatively similar only if they are connected by a region in which 1/p2 (x) is low, i.e. the density is high, but are much less “similar”, i.e. related to each other, when connected by a low-density region. Furthermore, there is no dependence between points in disjoint components separated by zero density regions. 4 Graph Laplacian Regularization in Higher Dimensions The analysis of the previous section seems promising, at it shows that in one dimension, the SSL method (1) is well posed and converges to a sensible limit. Regretfully, in higher dimensions this is not the case anymore. In the following theorem we show that the inﬁmum of the limit problem (6) is zero and can be obtained by a sequence of functions which are certainly not a sensible extrapolation of the labeled points. Theorem 2. Let p(x) be a smooth density over Rd , d 2, bounded from above by some constant pmax , and let (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ) be any (non-repeating) set of labeled examples. There exist continuous functions yǫ (x), for any ǫ > 0, all satisfying the constraints yǫ (xj ) = yj , j = 1, . . . , l, such ǫ→0 ǫ→0 that J(yǫ ) −→ 0 but yǫ (x) −→ 0 for all x = xj , j = 1, . . . , l. Proof. We present a detailed proof for the case of l = 2 labeled points. The generalization of the proof to more labeled points is straightforward. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we assume the ﬁrst labeled point is at x0 = 0 with y(x0 ) = 0 and the second labeled point is at x1 with x1 = 1 and y(x1 ) = 1. In addition, we assume that the ball B1 (0) of radius one centered around the origin is contained in Ω = {x ∈ Rd | p(x) > 0}. We ﬁrst consider the case d > 2. Here, for any ǫ > 0, consider the function x ǫ yǫ (x) = min ,1 which indeed satisﬁes the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1. Then, J(yǫ ) = Bǫ (0) p2 (x) dx ǫ2 pmax ǫ2 dx = p2 Vd ǫd−2 max (13) Bǫ (0) where Vd is the volume of a unit ball in Rd . Hence, the sequence of functions yǫ (x) satisfy the constraints, but for d > 2, inf ǫ J(yǫ ) = 0. For d = 2, a more extreme example is necessary: consider the functions 2 x yǫ (x) = log +ǫ ǫ log 1+ǫ ǫ for x 1 and yǫ (x) = 1 for x > 1. These functions satisfy the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1 and: J(yǫ ) = 4 h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ 4πp2 max h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ x B1 (0) log ( x 1+ǫ ǫ 2 2 +ǫ)2 p2 (x)dx 4p2 h “ max ”i2 1+ǫ log ǫ 4πp2 max ǫ→0 = −→ 0. log 1+ǫ ǫ 4 1 0 r2 (r 2 +ǫ)2 2πrdr The implication of Theorem 2 is that regardless of the values at the labeled points, as u → ∞, the solution of (1) is not well posed. Asymptotically, the solution has the form of an almost everywhere constant function, with highly localized spikes near the labeled points, and so no learning is performed. In particular, an interpretation in terms of a density-based kernel Kp , as in the onedimensional case, is not possible. Our analysis also carries over to a formulation where a loss-based data term replaces the hard label constraints, as in l 1 y = arg min ˆ (y(xj ) − yj )2 + γIn (y) y(x) l j=1 In the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, functions of the form yǫ (x) above have a zero data penalty term (since they exactly match the labels) and also drive the regularization term J(y) to zero. Hence, it is possible to drive the entire objective functional (the data term plus the regularization term) to zero with functions that do not generalize at all to unlabeled points. 4.1 Numerical Example We illustrate the phenomenon detailed by Theorem 2 with a simple example. Consider a density p(x) in R2 , which is a mixture of two unit variance spherical Gaussians, one per class, centered at the origin and at (4, 0). We sample a total of n = 3000 points, and label two points from each of the two components (four total). We then construct a similarity matrix using a Gaussian ﬁlter with σ = 0.4. Figure 1 depicts the predictor y (x) obtained from (1). In fact, two different predictors are shown, ˆ obtained by different numerical methods for solving (1). Both methods are based on the observation that the solution y (x) of (1) satisﬁes: ˆ n y (xi ) = ˆ n Wij y (xj ) / ˆ j=1 Wij on all unlabeled points i = l + 1, . . . , l + u. (14) j=1 Combined with the constraints of (1), we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved by Gaussian elimination (here invoked through MATLAB’s backslash operator). This is the method used in the top panels of Figure 1. Alternatively, (14) can be viewed as an update equation for y (xi ), ˆ which can be solved via the power method, or label propagation [2, 6]: start with zero labels on the unlabeled points and iterate (14), while keeping the known labels on x1 , . . . , xl . This is the method used in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As predicted, y (x) is almost constant for almost all unlabeled points. Although all values are very ˆ close to zero, thresholding at the “right” threshold does actually produce sensible results in terms of the true -1/+1 labels. However, beyond being inappropriate for regression, a very ﬂat predictor is still problematic even from a classiﬁcation perspective. First, it is not possible to obtain a meaningful conﬁdence measure for particular labels. Second, especially if the size of each class is not known apriori, setting the threshold between the positive and negative classes is problematic. In our example, setting the threshold to zero yields a generalization error of 45%. The differences between the two numerical methods for solving (1) also point out to another problem with the ill-posedness of the limit problem: the solution is numerically very un-stable. A more quantitative evaluation, that also validates that the effect in Figure 1 is not a result of choosing a “wrong” bandwidth σ, is given in Figure 2. We again simulated data from a mixture of two Gaussians, one Gaussian per class, this time in 20 dimensions, with one labeled point per class, and an increasing number of unlabeled points. In Figure 2 we plot the squared error, and the classiﬁcation error of the resulting predictor y (x). We plot the classiﬁcation error both when a threshold ˆ of zero is used (i.e. the class is determined by sign(ˆ(x))) and with the ideal threshold minimizing y the test error. For each unlabeled sample size, we choose the bandwidth σ yielding the best test performance (this is a “cheating” approach which provides a lower bound on the error of the best method for selecting the bandwidth). As the number of unlabeled examples increases the squared error approaches 1, indicating a ﬂat predictor. Using a threshold of zero leads to an increase in the classiﬁcation error, possibly due to numerical instability. Interestingly, although the predictors become very ﬂat, the classiﬁcation error using the ideal threshold actually improves slightly.

For each error measure and sample size, the bandwidth minimizing the test error was used, and is plotted. ideal classiﬁcation performance is achieved with a signiﬁcantly larger bandwidth than the bandwidth minimizing the squared loss, i.e. when the predictor is even ﬂatter. 4.2 Probabilistic Interpretation, Exit and Hitting Times As mentioned above, the Laplacian regularization method (1) has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of a random walk on the weighted graph. Let x(t) denote a random walk on the graph with transition matrix M = D−1 W where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij . Then, for the binary classiﬁcation case with yi = ±1 we have [15]: y (xi ) = 2 Pr x(t) hits a point labeled +1 before hitting a point labeled -1 x(0) = xi − 1 ˆ We present an interpretation of our analysis in terms of the limiting properties of this random walk. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the two classes are separated by a low density region. Then, the random walk has two intrinsic quantities of interest. The ﬁrst is the mean exit time from one cluster to the other, and the other is the mean hitting time to the labeled points in that cluster. As the number of unlabeled points increases and σ → 0, the random walk converges to a diffusion process [12]. While the mean exit time then converges to a ﬁnite value corresponding to its diffusion analogue, the hitting time to a labeled point increases to inﬁnity (as these become absorbing boundaries of measure zero). With more and more unlabeled data the random walk will fully mix, forgetting where it started, before it hits any label. Thus, the probability of hitting +1 before −1 will become uniform across the entire graph, independent of the starting location xi , yielding a ﬂat predictor. 5 Keeping σ Finite At this point, a reader may ask whether the problems found in higher dimensions are due to taking the limit σ → 0. One possible objection is that there is an intrinsic characteristic scale for the data σ0 where (with high probability) all points at a distance xi − xj < σ0 have the same label. If this is the case, then it may not necessarily make sense to take values of σ < σ0 in constructing W . However, keeping σ ﬁnite while taking the number of unlabeled points to inﬁnity does not resolve the problem. On the contrary, even the one-dimensional case becomes ill-posed in this case. To see this, consider a function y(x) which is zero everywhere except at the labeled points, where y(xj ) = yj . With a ﬁnite number of labeled points of measure zero, I (σ) (y) = 0 in any dimension 6 50 points 500 points 3500 points 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 −0.5 y 1 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 x Figure 3: Minimizer of (1) for a 1-d problem with a ﬁxed σ = 0.4, two labeled points and an increasing number of unlabeled points. and for any ﬁxed σ > 0. While this limiting function is discontinuous, it is also possible to construct ǫ→0 a sequence of continuous functions yǫ that all satisfy the constraints and for which I (σ) (yǫ ) −→ 0. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3. We generated data from a mixture of two 1-D Gaussians centered at the origin and at x = 4, with one Gaussian labeled −1 and the other +1. We used two labeled points at the centers of the Gaussians and an increasing number of randomly drawn unlabeled points. As predicted, with a ﬁxed σ, although the solution is reasonable when the number of unlabeled points is small, it becomes ﬂatter, with sharp spikes on the labeled points, as u → ∞. 6 Fourier-Eigenvector Based Methods Before we conclude, we discuss a different approach for SSL, also based on the Graph Laplacian, suggested by Belkin and Niyogi [3]. Instead of using the Laplacian as a regularizer, constraining candidate predictors y(x) non-parametrically to those with small In (y) values, here the predictors are constrained to the low-dimensional space spanned by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the Laplacian: The similarity matrix W is computed as before, and the Graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W is considered (recall D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij ). Only predictors p j=1 aj ej y (x) = ˆ (15) spanned by the ﬁrst p eigenvectors e1 , . . . , ep of L (with smallest eigenvalues) are considered. The coefﬁcients aj are chosen by minimizing a loss function on the labeled data, e.g. the squared loss: (ˆ1 , . . . , ap ) = arg min a ˆ l j=1 (yj − y (xj ))2 . ˆ (16) Unlike the Laplacian Regularization method (1), the Laplacian Eigenvector method (15)–(16) is well posed in the limit u → ∞. This follows directly from the convergence of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator [10, 4]. Eigenvector based methods were shown empirically to provide competitive generalization performance on a variety of simulated and real world problems. Belkin and Niyogi [3] motivate the approach by arguing that ‘the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator provide a natural basis for functions on the manifold and the desired classiﬁcation function can be expressed in such a basis’. In our view, the success of the method is actually not due to data lying on a low-dimensional manifold, but rather due to the low density separation assumption, which states that different class labels form high-density clusters separated by low density regions. Indeed, under this assumption and with sufﬁcient separation between the clusters, the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplace-Beltrami operator are approximately piecewise constant in each of the clusters, as in spectral clustering [12, 11], providing a basis for a labeling that is constant within clusters but variable across clusters. In other settings, such as data uniformly distributed on a manifold but without any signiﬁcant cluster structure, the success of eigenvector based methods critically depends on how well can the unknown classiﬁcation function be approximated by a truncated expansion with relatively few eigenvectors. We illustrate this issue with the following three-dimensional example: Let p(x) denote the uniform density in the box [0, 1] × [0, 0.8] × [0, 0.6], where the box lengths are different to prevent eigenvalue multiplicity. Consider learning three different functions, y1 (x) = 1x1 >0.5 , y2 (x) = 1x1 >x2 /0.8 and y3 (x) = 1x2 /0.8>x3 /0.6 . Even though all three functions are relatively simple, all having a linear separating boundary between the classes on the manifold, as shown in the experiment described in Figure 4, the Eigenvector based method (15)–(16) gives markedly different generalization performances on the three targets. This happens both when the number of eigenvectors p is set to p = l/5 as suggested by Belkin and Niyogi, as well as for the optimal (oracle) value of p selected on the test set (i.e. a “cheating” choice representing an upper bound on the generalization error of this method). 7 Prediction Error (%) p = #labeled points/5 40 optimal p 20 labeled points 40 Approx.

All panels use n = 3000 points. Prediction counts the number of sign agreements with the true labels. Rightmost panel: best ﬁt when many (all 3000) points are used, representing the best we can hope for with a few leading eigenvectors. The reason for this behavior is that y2 (x) and even more so y3 (x) cannot be as easily approximated by the very few leading eigenfunctions—even though they seem “simple” and “smooth”, they are signiﬁcantly more complicated than y1 (x) in terms of measure of simplicity implied by the Eigenvector Method. Since the density is uniform, the graph Laplacian converges to the standard Laplacian and its eigenfunctions have the form ψi,j,k (x) = cos(iπx1 ) cos(jπx2 /0.8) cos(kπx3 /0.6), making it hard to represent simple decision boundaries which are not axis-aligned. 7 Discussion Our results show that a popular SSL method, the Laplacian Regularization method (1), is not wellbehaved in the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, despite its empirical success in various SSL tasks. The empirical success might be due to two reasons. First, it is possible that with a large enough number of labeled points relative to the number of unlabeled points, the method is well behaved. This regime, where the number of both labeled and unlabeled points grow while l/u is ﬁxed, has recently been analyzed by Wasserman and Lafferty [9]. However, we do not ﬁnd this regime particularly satisfying as we would expect that having more unlabeled data available should improve performance, rather than require more labeled points or make the problem ill-posed. It also places the user in a delicate situation of choosing the “just right” number of unlabeled points without any theoretical guidance. Second, in our experiments we noticed that although the predictor y (x) becomes extremely ﬂat, in ˆ binary tasks, it is still typically possible to ﬁnd a threshold leading to a good classiﬁcation performance. We do not know of any theoretical explanation for such behavior, nor how to characterize it. Obtaining such an explanation would be very interesting, and in a sense crucial to the theoretical foundation of the Laplacian Regularization method. On a very practical level, such a theoretical understanding might allow us to correct the method so as to avoid the numerical instability associated with ﬂat predictors, and perhaps also make it appropriate for regression. The reason that the Laplacian regularizer (1) is ill-posed in the limit is that the ﬁrst order gradient is not a sufﬁcient penalty in high dimensions. This fact is well known in spline theory, where the Sobolev Embedding Theorem [1] indicates one must control at least d+1 derivatives in Rd . In the 2 context of Laplacian regularization, this can be done using the iterated Laplacian: replacing the d+1 graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W , where D is the diagonal degree matrix, with L 2 (matrix to d+1 the 2 power). In the inﬁnite unlabeled data limit, this corresponds to regularizing all order- d+1 2 (mixed) partial derivatives. In the typical case of a low-dimensional manifold in a high dimensional ambient space, the order of iteration should correspond to the intrinsic, rather then ambient, dimensionality, which poses a practical problem of estimating this usually unknown dimensionality. We are not aware of much practical work using the iterated Laplacian, nor a good understanding of its appropriateness for SSL. A different approach leading to a well-posed solution is to include also an ambient regularization term [5]. However, the properties of the solution and in particular its relation to various assumptions about the “smoothness” of y(x) relative to p(x) remain unclear.

<p>Author: Peter Sollich, Matthew Urry, Camille Coti</p><p>Abstract: We investigate how well Gaussian process regression can learn functions deﬁned on graphs, using large regular random graphs as a paradigmatic example. Random-walk based kernels are shown to have some non-trivial properties: within the standard approximation of a locally tree-like graph structure, the kernel does not become constant, i.e. neighbouring function values do not become fully correlated, when the lengthscale σ of the kernel is made large. Instead the kernel attains a non-trivial limiting form, which we calculate. The fully correlated limit is reached only once loops become relevant, and we estimate where the crossover to this regime occurs. Our main subject are learning curves of Bayes error versus training set size. We show that these are qualitatively well predicted by a simple approximation using only the spectrum of a large tree as input, and generically scale with n/V , the number of training examples per vertex. We also explore how this behaviour changes for kernel lengthscales that are large enough for loops to become important. 1 Motivation and Outline Gaussian processes (GPs) have become a standard part of the machine learning toolbox [1]. Learning curves are a convenient way of characterizing their capabilities: they give the generalization error as a function of the number of training examples n, averaged over all datasets of size n under appropriate assumptions about the process generating the data. We focus here on the case of GP regression, where a real-valued output function f (x) is to be learned. The general behaviour of GP learning curves is then relatively well understood for the scenario where the inputs x come from a continuous space, typically Rn [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. For large n, the learning curves then typically decay as a power law ∝ n−α with an exponent α ≤ 1 that depends on the dimensionality n of the space as well as the smoothness properties of the function f (x) as encoded in the covariance function. But there are many interesting application domains that involve discrete input spaces, where x could be a string, an amino acid sequence (with f (x) some measure of secondary structure or biological function), a research paper (with f (x) related to impact), a web page (with f (x) giving a score used to rank pages), etc. In many such situations, similarity between different inputs – which will govern our prior beliefs about how closely related the corresponding function values are – can be represented by edges in a graph. One would then like to know how well GP regression can work in such problem domains; see also [11] for a related online regression algorithm. We study this 1 problem here theoretically by focussing on the paradigmatic example of random regular graphs, where every node has the same connectivity. Sec. 2 discusses the properties of random-walk inspired kernels [12] on such random graphs. These are analogous to the standard radial basis function kernels exp[−(x − x )2 /(2σ 2 )], but we ﬁnd that they have surprising properties on large graphs. In particular, while loops in large random graphs are long and can be neglected for many purposes, by approximating the graph structure as locally tree-like, here this leads to a non-trivial limiting form of the kernel for σ → ∞ that is not constant. The fully correlated limit, where the kernel is constant, is obtained only because of the presence of loops, and we estimate when the crossover to this regime takes place. In Sec. 3 we move on to the learning curves themselves. A simple approximation based on the graph eigenvalues, using only the known spectrum of a large tree as input, works well qualitatively and predicts the exact asymptotics for large numbers of training examples. When the kernel lengthscale is not too large, below the crossover discussed in Sec. 2 for the covariance kernel, the learning curves depend on the number of examples per vertex. We also explore how this behaviour changes as the kernel lengthscale is made larger. Sec. 4 summarizes the results and discusses some open questions. 2 Kernels on graphs and trees We assume that we are trying to learn a function deﬁned on the vertices of a graph. Vertices are labelled by i = 1 . . . V , instead of the generic input label x we used in the introduction, and the associated function values are denoted fi ∈ R. By taking the prior P (f ) over these functions f = (f1 , . . . , fV ) as a (zero mean) Gaussian process we are saying that P (f ) ∝ exp(− 1 f T C −1 f ). 2 The covariance function or kernel C is then, in our graph setting, just a positive deﬁnite V × V matrix. The graph structure is characterized by a V × V adjacency matrix, with Aij = 1 if nodes i and j are connected by an edge, and 0 otherwise. All links are assumed to be undirected, so that Aij = Aji , V and there are no self-loops (Aii = 0). The degree of each node is then deﬁned as di = j=1 Aij . The covariance kernels we discuss in this paper are the natural generalizations of the squaredexponential kernel in Euclidean space [12]. They can be expressed in terms of the normalized graph Laplacian, deﬁned as L = 1 − D −1/2 AD −1/2 , where D is a diagonal matrix with entries d1 , . . . , dV and 1 is the V × V identity matrix. An advantage of L over the unnormalized Laplacian D − A, which was used in the earlier paper [13], is that the eigenvalues of L (again a V × V matrix) lie in the interval [0,2] (see e.g. [14]). From the graph Laplacian, the covariance kernels we consider here are constructed as follows. The p-step random walk kernel is (for a ≥ 2) C ∝ (1 − a−1 L)p = 1 − a−1 1 + a−1 D −1/2 AD −1/2 p (1) while the diffusion kernel is given by 1 C ∝ exp − 2 σ 2 L ∝ exp 1 2 −1/2 AD −1/2 2σ D (2) We will always normalize these so that (1/V ) i Cii = 1, which corresponds to setting the average (over vertices) prior variance of the function to be learned to unity. To see the connection of the above kernels to random walks, assume we have a walker on the graph who at each time step selects randomly one of the neighbouring vertices and moves to it. The probability for a move from vertex j to i is then Aij /dj . The transition matrix after s steps follows as (AD −1 )s : its ij-element gives the probability of being on vertex i, having started at j. We can now compare this with the p-step kernel by expanding the p-th power in (1): p p ( p )a−s (1−a−1 )p−s (D −1/2 AD −1/2 )s = D −1/2 s C∝ s=0 ( p )a−s (1−a−1 )p−s (AD −1 )s D 1/2 s s=0 (3) Thus C is essentially a random walk transition matrix, averaged over the number of steps s with s ∼ Binomial(p, 1/a) 2 (4) a=2, d=3 K1 1 1 Cl,p 0.9 p=1 p=2 p=3 p=4 p=5 p=10 p=20 p=50 p=100 p=200 p=500 p=infty 0.8 0.6 0.4 d=3 0.8 0.7 0.6 a=2, V=infty a=2, V=500 a=4, V=infty a=4, V=500 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.2 ln V / ln(d-1) 0.1 0 0 5 10 l 0 15 1 10 p/a 100 1000 Figure 1: (Left) Random walk kernel C ,p plotted vs distance along graph, for increasing number of steps p and a = 2, d = 3. Note the convergence to a limiting shape for large p that is not the naive fully correlated limit C ,p→∞ = 1. (Right) Numerical results for average covariance K1 between neighbouring nodes, averaged over neighbours and over randomly generated regular graphs. This shows that 1/a can be interpreted as the probability of actually taking a step at each of p “attempts”. To obtain the actual C the resulting averaged transition matrix is premultiplied by D −1/2 and postmultiplied by D 1/2 , which ensures that the kernel C is symmetric. For the diffusion kernel, one ﬁnds an analogous result but the number of random walk steps is now distributed as s ∼ Poisson(σ 2 /2). This implies in particular that the diffusion kernel is the limit of the p-step kernel for p, a → ∞ at constant p/a = σ 2 /2. Accordingly, we discuss mainly the p-step kernel in this paper because results for the diffusion kernel can be retrieved as limiting cases. In the limit of a large number of steps s, the random walk on a graph will reach its stationary distribution p∞ ∝ De where e = (1, . . . , 1). (This form of p∞ can be veriﬁed by checking that it remains unchanged after multiplication with the transition matrix AD −1 .) The s-step transition matrix for large s is then p∞ eT = DeeT because we converge from any starting vertex to the stationary distribution. It follows that for large p or σ 2 the covariance kernel becomes C ∝ D 1/2 eeT D 1/2 , i.e. Cij ∝ (di dj )1/2 . This is consistent with the interpretation of σ or (p/a)1/2 as a lengthscale over which the random walk can diffuse along the graph: once this lengthscale becomes large, the covariance kernel Cij is essentially independent of the distance (along the graph) between the vertices i and j, and the function f becomes fully correlated across the graph. (Explicitly f = vD 1/2 e under the prior, with v a single Gaussian random variable.) As we next show, however, the approach to this fully correlated limit as p or σ are increased is non-trivial. We focus in this paper on kernels on random regular graphs. This means we consider adjacency matrices A which are regular in the sense that they give for each vertex the same degree, di = d. A uniform probability distribution is then taken across all A that obey this constraint [15]. What will the above kernels look like on typical samples drawn from this distribution? Such random regular graphs will have long loops, of length of order ln(V ) or larger if V is large. Their local structure is then that of a regular tree of degree d, which suggests that it should be possible to calculate the kernel accurately within a tree approximation. In a regular tree all nodes are equivalent, so the kernel can only depend on the distance between two nodes i and j. Denoting this kernel value C ,p for a p-step random walk kernel, one has then C ,p=0 = δ ,0 and γp+1 C0,p+1 γp+1 C ,p+1 = = 1− 1 ad C 1 a C0,p + −1,p 1 a + 1− C1,p 1 a C (5) ,p + d−1 ad C +1,p for ≥1 (6) where γp is chosen to achieve the desired normalization C0,p = 1 of the prior variance for every p. Fig. 1(left) shows results obtained by iterating this recursion numerically, for a regular graph (in the tree approximation) with degree d = 3, and a = 2. As expected the kernel becomes more longranged initially as p increases, but eventually it is seen to approach a non-trivial limiting form. This can be calculated as C ,p→∞ = [1 + (d − 1)/d](d − 1)− /2 (7) 3 and is also plotted in the ﬁgure, showing good agreement with the numerical iteration. There are (at least) two ways of obtaining the result (7). One is to take the limit σ → ∞ of the integral representation of the diffusion kernel on regular trees given in [16] (which is also quoted in [13] but with a typographical error that effectively removes the factor (d − 1)− /2 ). Another route is to ﬁnd the steady state of the recursion for C ,p . This is easy to do but requires as input the unknown steady state value of γp . To determine this, one can map from C ,p to the total random walk probability S ,p in each “shell” of vertices at distance from the starting vertex, changing variables to S0,p = C0,p and S ,p = d(d − 1) −1 C ,p ( ≥ 1). Omitting the factors γp , this results in a recursion for S ,p that simply describes a biased random walk on = 0, 1, 2, . . ., with a probability of 1 − 1/a of remaining at the current , probability 1/(ad) of moving to the left and probability (d − 1)/(ad) of moving to the right. The point = 0 is a reﬂecting barrier where only moves to the right are allowed, with probability 1/a. The time evolution of this random walk starting from = 0 can now be analysed as in [17]. As expected from the balance of moves to the left and right, S ,p for large p is peaked around the average position of the walk, = p(d − 2)/(ad). For smaller than this S ,p has a tail behaving as ∝ (d − 1) /2 , and converting back to C ,p gives the large- scaling of C ,p→∞ ∝ (d − 1)− /2 ; this in turn ﬁxes the value of γp→∞ and so eventually gives (7). The above analysis shows that for large p the random walk kernel, calculated in the absence of loops, does not approach the expected fully correlated limit; given that all vertices have the same degree, the latter would correspond to C ,p→∞ = 1. This implies, conversely, that the fully correlated limit is reached only because of the presence of loops in the graph. It is then interesting to ask at what point, as p is increased, the tree approximation for the kernel breaks down. To estimate this, we note that a regular tree of depth has V = 1 + d(d − 1) −1 nodes. So a regular graph can be tree-like at most out to ≈ ln(V )/ ln(d − 1). Comparing with the typical number of steps our random walk takes, which is p/a from (4), we then expect loop effects to appear in the covariance kernel when p/a ≈ ln(V )/ ln(d − 1) (8) To check this prediction, we measure the analogue of C1,p on randomly generated [15] regular graphs. Because of the presence of loops, the local kernel values are not all identical, so the appropriate estimate of what would be C1,p on a tree is K1 = Cij / Cii Cjj for neighbouring nodes i and j. Averaging over all pairs of such neighbours, and then over a number of randomly generated graphs we ﬁnd the results in Fig. 1(right). The results for K1 (symbols) accurately track the tree predictions (lines) for small p/a, and start to deviate just around the values of p/a expected from (8), as marked by the arrow. The deviations manifest themselves in larger values of K1 , which eventually – now that p/a is large enough for the kernel to “notice” the loops - approach the fully correlated limit K1 = 1. 3 Learning curves We now turn to the analysis of learning curves for GP regression on random regular graphs. We assume that the target function f ∗ is drawn from a GP prior with a p-step random walk covariance kernel C. Training examples are input-output pairs (iµ , fi∗ + ξµ ) where ξµ is i.i.d. Gaussian noise µ of variance σ 2 ; the distribution of training inputs iµ is taken to be uniform across vertices. Inference from a data set D of n such examples µ = 1, . . . , n takes place using the prior deﬁned by C and a Gaussian likelihood with noise variance σ 2 . We thus assume an inference model that is matched to the data generating process. This is obviously an over-simpliﬁcation but is appropriate for the present ﬁrst exploration of learning curves on random graphs. We emphasize that as n is increased we see more and more function values from the same graph, which is ﬁxed by the problem domain; the graph does not grow. ˆ The generalization error is the squared difference between the estimated function fi and the target fi∗ , averaged across the (uniform) input distribution, the posterior distribution of f ∗ given D, the distribution of datasets D, and ﬁnally – in our non-Euclidean setting – the random graph ensemble. Given the assumption of a matched inference model, this is just the average Bayes error, or the average posterior variance, which can be expressed explicitly as [1] (n) = V −1 Cii − k(i)T Kk−1 (i) i 4 D,graphs (9) where the average is over data sets and over graphs, K is an n × n matrix with elements Kµµ = Ciµ ,iµ + σ 2 δµµ and k(i) is a vector with entries kµ (i) = Ci,iµ . The resulting learning curve depends, in addition to n, on the graph structure as determined by V and d, and the kernel and noise level as speciﬁed by p, a and σ 2 . We ﬁx d = 3 throughout to avoid having too many parameters to vary, although similar results are obtained for larger d. Exact prediction of learning curves by analytical calculation is very difﬁcult due to the complicated way in which the random selection of training inputs enters the matrix K and vector k in (9). However, by ﬁrst expressing these quantities in terms of kernel eigenvalues (see below) and then approximating the average over datasets, one can derive the approximation [3, 6] =g n + σ2 V , g(h) = (λ−1 + h)−1 α (10) α=1 This equation for has to be solved self-consistently because also appears on the r.h.s. In the Euclidean case the resulting predictions approximate the true learning curves quite reliably. The derivation of (10) for inputs on a ﬁxed graph is unchanged from [3], provided the kernel eigenvalues λα appearing in the function g(h) are deﬁned appropriately, by the eigenfunction condition Cij φj = λφi ; the average here is over the input distribution, i.e. . . . = V −1 j . . . From the deﬁnition (1) of the p-step kernel, we see that then λα = κV −1 (1 − λL /a)p in terms of the corα responding eigenvalue of the graph Laplacian L. The constant κ has to be chosen to enforce our normalization convention α λα = Cjj = 1. Fortunately, for large V the spectrum of the Laplacian of a random regular graph can be approximated by that of the corresponding large regular tree, which has spectral density [14] L ρ(λ ) = 4(d−1) − (λL − 1)2 d2 2πdλL (2 − λL ) (11) in the range λL ∈ [λL , λL ], λL = 1 + 2d−1 (d − 1)1/2 , where the term under the square root is ± + − positive. (There are also two isolated eigenvalues λL = 0, 2 but these have weight 1/V each and so can be ignored for large V .) Rewriting (10) as = V −1 α [(V λα )−1 + (n/V )( + σ 2 )−1 ]−1 and then replacing the average over kernel eigenvalues by an integral over the spectral density leads to the following prediction for the learning curve: = dλL ρ(λL )[κ−1 (1 − λL /a)−p + ν/( + σ 2 )]−1 (12) with κ determined from κ dλL ρ(λL )(1 − λL /a)p = 1. A general consequence of the form of this result is that the learning curve depends on n and V only through the ratio ν = n/V , i.e. the number of training examples per vertex. The approximation (12) also predicts that the learning curve will have two regimes, one for small ν where σ 2 and the generalization error will be essentially 2 independent of σ ; and another for large ν where σ 2 so that can be neglected on the r.h.s. and one has a fully explicit expression for . We compare the above prediction in Fig. 2(left) to the results of numerical simulations of the learning curves, averaged over datasets and random regular graphs. The two regimes predicted by the approximation are clearly visible; the approximation works well inside each regime but less well in the crossover between the two. One striking observation is that the approximation seems to predict the asymptotic large-n behaviour exactly; this is distinct to the Euclidean case, where generally only the power-law of the n-dependence but not its prefactor come out accurately. To see why, we exploit that for large n (where σ 2 ) the approximation (9) effectively neglects ﬂuctuations in the training input “density” of a randomly drawn set of training inputs [3, 6]. This is justiﬁed in the graph case for large ν = n/V , because the number of training inputs each vertex receives, Binomial(n, 1/V ), has negligible relative ﬂuctuations away from its mean ν. In the Euclidean case there is no similar result, because all training inputs are different with probability one even for large n. Fig. 2(right) illustrates that for larger a the difference in the crossover region between the true (numerically simulated) learning curves and our approximation becomes larger. This is because the average number of steps p/a of the random walk kernel then decreases: we get closer to the limit of uncorrelated function values (a → ∞, Cij = δij ). In that limit and for low σ 2 and large V the 5 V=500 (filled) & 1000 (empty), d=3, a=2, p=10 V=500, d=3, a=4, p=10 0 0 10 10 ε ε -1 -1 10 10 -2 10 -2 10 2 σ = 0.1 2 σ = 0.1 2 -3 10 σ = 0.01 2 σ = 0.01 -3 10 2 σ = 0.001 2 σ = 0.001 2 -4 10 2 σ = 0.0001 σ = 0.0001 -4 10 2 σ =0 -5 2 σ =0 -5 10 0.1 1 ν=n/V 10 10 0.1 1 ν=n/V 10 Figure 2: (Left) Learning curves for GP regression on random regular graphs with degree d = 3 and V = 500 (small ﬁlled circles) and V = 1000 (empty circles) vertices.

Solid line: (10) with numerically determined graph eigenvalues λL as input. α true learning curve is = exp(−ν), reﬂecting the probability of a training input set not containing a particular vertex, while the approximation can be shown to predict = max{1 − ν, 0}, i.e. a decay of the error to zero at ν = 1. Plotting these two curves (not displayed here) indeed shows the same “shape” of disagreement as in Fig. 2(right), with the approximation underestimating the true generalization error. Increasing p has the effect of making the kernel longer ranged, giving an effect opposite to that of increasing a. In line with this, larger values of p improve the accuracy of the approximation (12): see Fig. 3(left). One may ask about the shape of the learning curves for large number of training examples (per vertex) ν. The roughly straight lines on the right of the log-log plots discussed so far suggest that ∝ 1/ν in this regime. This is correct in the mathematical limit ν → ∞ because the graph kernel has a nonzero minimal eigenvalue λ− = κV −1 (1−λL /a)p : for ν σ 2 /(V λ− ), the square bracket + 6 in (12) can then be approximated by ν/( +σ 2 ) and one gets (because also regime) ≈ σ 2 /ν. σ 2 in the asymptotic However, once p becomes reasonably large, V λ− can be shown – by analysing the scaling of κ, see Appendix – to be extremely (exponentially in p) small; for the parameter values in Fig. 3(left) it is around 4 × 10−30 . The “terminal” asymptotic regime ≈ σ 2 /ν is then essentially unreachable. A more detailed analysis of (12) for large p and large (but not exponentially large) ν, as sketched in the Appendix, yields ∝ (cσ 2 /ν) ln3/2 (ν/(cσ 2 )), c ∝ p−3/2 (13) This shows that there are logarithmic corrections to the naive σ 2 /ν scaling that would apply in the true terminal regime. More intriguing is the scaling of the coefﬁcient c with p, which implies that to reach a speciﬁed (low) generalization error one needs a number of training examples per vertex of order ν ∝ cσ 2 ∝ p−3/2 σ 2 . Even though the covariance kernel C ,p – in the same tree approximation that also went into (12) – approaches a limiting form for large p as discussed in Sec. 2, generalization performance thus continues to improve with increasing p. The explanation for this must presumably be that C ,p converges to the limit (7) only at ﬁxed , while in the tail ∝ p, it continues to change. For ﬁnite graph sizes V we know of course that loops will eventually become important as p increases, around the crossover point estimated in (8). The approximation for the learning curve in (12) should then break down. The most naive estimate beyond this point would be to say that the kernel becomes nearly fully correlated, Cij ∝ (di dj )1/2 which in the regular case simpliﬁes to Cij = 1. With only one function value to learn, and correspondingly only one nonzero kernel eigenvalue λα=1 = 1, one would predict = 1/(1 + n/σ 2 ). Fig. 3(right) shows, however, that this signiﬁcantly underestimates the actual generalization error, even though for this graph λα=1 = 0.994 is very close to unity so that the other eigenvalues sum to no more than 0.006. An almost perfect prediction is obtained, on the other hand, from the approximation (10) with the numerically calculated values of the Laplacian – and hence kernel – eigenvalues. The presence of the small kernel eigenvalues is again seen to cause logarithmic corrections to the naive ∝ 1/n scaling. Using the tree spectrum as an approximation and exploiting the large-p limit, one ﬁnds indeed (see Appendix, Eq. (17)) that ∝ (c σ 2 /n) ln3/2 (n/c σ 2 ) where now n enters rather than ν = n/V , c being a constant dependent only on p and a: informally, the function to be learned only has a ﬁnite (rather than ∝ V ) number of degrees of freedom. The approximation (17) in fact provides a qualitatively accurate description of the data Fig. 3(right), as the dashed line in the ﬁgure shows. We thus have the somewhat unusual situation that the tree spectrum is enough to give a good description of the learning curves even when loops are important, while (see Sec. 2) this is not so as far as the evaluation of the covariance kernel itself is concerned. 4 Summary and Outlook We have studied theoretically the generalization performance of GP regression on graphs, focussing on the paradigmatic case of random regular graphs where every vertex has the same degree d. Our initial concern was with the behaviour of p-step random walk kernels on such graphs. If these are calculated within the usual approximation of a locally tree-like structure, then they converge to a non-trivial limiting form (7) when p – or the corresponding lengthscale σ in the closely related diffusion kernel – becomes large. The limit of full correlation between all function values on the graph is only reached because of the presence of loops, and we have estimated in (8) the values of p around which the crossover to this loop-dominated regime occurs; numerical data for correlations of function values on neighbouring vertices support this result. In the second part of the paper we concentrated on the learning curves themselves. We assumed that inference is performed with the correct parameters describing the data generating process; the generalization error is then just the Bayes error. The approximation (12) gives a good qualitative description of the learning curve using only the known spectrum of a large regular tree as input. It predicts in particular that the key parameter that determines the generalization error is ν = n/V , the number of training examples per vertex. We demonstrated also that the approximation is in fact more useful than in the Euclidean case because it gives exact asymptotics for the limit ν 1. Quantitatively, we found that the learning curves decay as ∝ σ 2 /ν with non-trivial logarithmic correction terms. Slower power laws ∝ ν −α with α < 1, as in the Euclidean case, do not appear. 7 We attribute this to the fact that on a graph there is no analogue of the local roughness of a target function because there is a minimum distance (one step along the graph) between different input points. Finally we looked at the learning curves for larger p, where loops become important. These can still be predicted quite accurately by using the tree eigenvalue spectrum as an approximation, if one keeps track of the zero graph Laplacian eigenvalue which we were able to ignore previously; the approximation shows that the generalization error scales as σ 2 /n with again logarithmic corrections. In future work we plan to extend our analysis to graphs that are not regular, including ones from application domains as well as artiﬁcial ones with power-law tails in the distribution of degrees d, where qualitatively new effects are to be expected. It would also be desirable to improve the predictions for the learning curve in the crossover region ≈ σ 2 , which should be achievable using iterative approaches based on belief propagation that have already been shown to give accurate approximations for graph eigenvalue spectra [18]. These tools could then be further extended to study e.g. the effects of model mismatch in GP regression on random graphs, and how these are mitigated by tuning appropriate hyperparameters. Appendix We sketch here how to derive (13) from (12) for large p. Eq. (12) writes = g(νV /( + σ 2 )) with λL + g(h) = dλL ρ(λL )[κ−1 (1 − λL /a)−p + hV −1 ]−1 (14) λL − and κ determined from the condition g(0) = 1. (This g(h) is the tree spectrum approximation to the g(h) of (10).) Turning ﬁrst to g(0), the factor (1 − λL /a)p decays quickly to zero as λL increases above λL . One can then approximate this factor according to (1 − λL /a)p [(a − λL )/(a − λL )]p ≈ − − − (1 − λL /a)p exp[−(λL − λL )p/(a − λL )]. In the regime near λL one can also approximate the − − − − spectral density (11) by its leading square-root increase, ρ(λL ) = r(λL − λL )1/2 , with r = (d − − 1)1/4 d5/2 /[π(d − 2)2 ]. Switching then to a new integration variable y = (λL − λL )p/(a − λL ) and − − extending the integration limit to ∞ gives ∞ √ 1 = g(0) = κr(1 − λL /a)p [p/(a − λL )]−3/2 dy y e−y (15) − − 0 and this ﬁxes κ. Proceeding similarly for h > 0 gives ∞ g(h) = κr(1−λL /a)p [p/(a−λL )]−3/2 F (hκV −1 (1−λL /a)p ), − − − F (z) = √ dy y (ey +z)−1 0 (16) Dividing by g(0) = 1 shows that simply g(h) = F (hV −1 c−1 )/F (0), where c = 1/[κ(1 − σ2 λL /a)p ] = rF (0)[p/(a − λL )]−3/2 which scales as p−3/2 . In the asymptotic regime − − 2 2 we then have = g(νV /σ ) = F (ν/(cσ ))/F (0) and the desired result (13) follows from the large-z behaviour of F (z) ≈ z −1 ln3/2 (z). One can proceed similarly for the regime where loops become important. Clearly the zero Laplacian eigenvalue with weight 1/V then has to be taken into account. If we assume that the remainder of the Laplacian spectrum can still be approximated by that of a tree [18], we get (V + hκ)−1 + r(1 − λL /a)p [p/(a − λL )]−3/2 F (hκV −1 (1 − λL /a)p ) − − − g(h) = (17) V −1 + r(1 − λL /a)p [p/(a − λL )]−3/2 F (0) − − The denominator here is κ−1 and the two terms are proportional respectively to the covariance kernel eigenvalue λ1 , corresponding to λL = 0 and the constant eigenfunction, and to 1−λ1 . Dropping the 1 ﬁrst terms in the numerator and denominator of (17) by taking V → ∞ leads back to the previous analysis as it should. For a situation as in Fig. 3(right), on the other hand, where λ1 is close to unity, we have κ ≈ V and so g(h) ≈ (1 + h)−1 + rV (1 − λL /a)p [p/(a − λL )]−3/2 F (h(1 − λL /a)p ) (18) − − − The second term, coming from the small kernel eigenvalues, is the more slowly decaying because it corresponds to ﬁne detail of the target function that needs many training examples to learn accurately. It will therefore dominate the asymptotic behaviour of the learning curve: = g(n/σ 2 ) ∝ F (n/(c σ 2 )) with c = (1 − λL /a)−p independent of V . The large-n tail of the learning curve in − Fig. 3(right) is consistent with this form. 8 References [1] C E Rasmussen and C K I Williams. Gaussian processes for regression.

<p>Author: Kwang I. Kim, Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression based on the graph Laplacian suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the lack of extrapolating power. Based on these observations, we propose to use the second-order Hessian energy for semi-supervised regression which overcomes both these problems. If the data lies on or close to a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space, the Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. We ﬁrst derive the Hessian energy for smooth manifolds and continue to give a stable estimation procedure for the common case where only samples of the underlying manifold are given. The preference of ‘’linear” functions on manifolds renders the Hessian energy particularly suited for the task of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to ﬁnd a user-deﬁned embedding function given some labeled points which varies smoothly (and ideally linearly) along the manifold. The experimental results suggest superior performance of our method compared with semi-supervised regression using Laplacian regularization or standard supervised regression techniques applied to this task. 1</p><p>6 0.12364416 <a title="213-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-White_Functionals_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">257 nips-2009-White Functionals for Anomaly Detection in Dynamical Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: We present a new framework for semi-supervised learning with sparse eigenfunction bases of kernel matrices. It turns out that when the data has clustered, that is, when the high density regions are sufﬁciently separated by low density valleys, each high density area corresponds to a unique representative eigenvector. Linear combination of such eigenvectors (or, more precisely, of their Nystrom extensions) provide good candidates for good classiﬁcation functions when the cluster assumption holds. By ﬁrst choosing an appropriate basis of these eigenvectors from unlabeled data and then using labeled data with Lasso to select a classiﬁer in the span of these eigenvectors, we obtain a classiﬁer, which has a very sparse representation in this basis. Importantly, the sparsity corresponds naturally to the cluster assumption. Experimental results on a number of real-world data-sets show that our method is competitive with the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms and outperforms the natural base-line algorithm (Lasso in the Kernel PCA basis). 1</p><p>2 0.83913076 <a title="213-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>3 0.63443041 <a title="213-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Learning%3A_The_Limit_of_Infinite_Unlabelled_Data.html">229 nips-2009-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Nathan Srebro, Xueyuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for SemiSupervised Learning at the regime of a ﬁxed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in Rd , d 2, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the “smoothness” assumptions associated with this alternate method. 1 Introduction and Setup In this paper we consider the limit behavior of two popular semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the graph Laplacian: the regularization approach [15] and the spectral approach [3]. We consider the limit when the number of labeled points is ﬁxed and the number of unlabeled points goes to inﬁnity. This is a natural limit for SSL as the basic SSL scenario is one in which unlabeled data is virtually inﬁnite. We can also think of this limit as “perfect” SSL, having full knowledge of the marginal density p(x). The premise of SSL is that the marginal density p(x) is informative about the unknown mapping y(x) we are trying to learn, e.g. since y(x) is expected to be “smooth” in some sense relative to p(x). Studying the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit, where p(x) is fully known, allows us to formulate and understand the underlying smoothness assumptions of a particular SSL method, and judge whether it is well-posed and sensible. Understanding the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit is also a necessary ﬁrst step to studying the convergence of the ﬁnite-labeled-data estimator. We consider the following setup: Let p(x) be an unknown smooth density on a compact domain Ω ⊂ Rd with a smooth boundary. Let y : Ω → Y be the unknown function we wish to estimate. In case of regression Y = R whereas in binary classiﬁcation Y = {−1, 1}. The standard (transductive) semisupervised learning problem is formulated as follows: Given l labeled points, (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ), with yi = y(xi ), and u unlabeled points xl+1 , . . . , xl+u , with all points xi sampled i.i.d. from p(x), the goal is to construct an estimate of y(xl+i ) for any unlabeled point xl+i , utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled points. We denote the total number of points by n = l + u. We are interested in the regime where l is ﬁxed and u → ∞. 1 2 SSL with Graph Laplacian Regularization We ﬁrst consider the following graph-based approach formulated by Zhu et. al. [15]: y (x) = arg min In (y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l y where 1 n2 In (y) = Wi,j (y(xi ) − y(xj ))2 (1) (2) i,j is a Laplacian regularization term enforcing “smoothness” with respect to the n×n similarity matrix W . This formulation has several natural interpretations in terms of, e.g. random walks and electrical circuits [15]. These interpretations, however, refer to a ﬁxed graph, over a ﬁnite set of points with given similarities. In contrast, our focus here is on the more typical scenario where the points xi ∈ Rd are a random sample from a density p(x), and W is constructed based on this sample. We would like to understand the behavior of the method in terms of the density p(x), particularly in the limit where the number of unlabeled points grows. Under what assumptions on the target labeling y(x) and on the density p(x) is the method (1) sensible? The answer, of course, depends on how the matrix W is constructed. We consider the common situation where the similarities are obtained by applying some decay ﬁlter to the distances: xi −xj σ Wi,j = G (3) where G : R+ → R+ is some function with an adequately fast decay. Popular choices are the 2 Gaussian ﬁlter G(z) = e−z /2 or the ǫ-neighborhood graph obtained by the step ﬁlter G(z) = 1z<1 . For simplicity, we focus here on the formulation (1) where the solution is required to satisfy the constraints at the labeled points exactly. In practice, the hard labeling constraints are often replaced with a softer loss-based data term, which is balanced against the smoothness term In (y), e.g. [14, 6]. Our analysis and conclusions apply to such variants as well. Limit of the Laplacian Regularization Term As the number of unlabeled examples grows the regularization term (2) converges to its expectation, where the summation is replaced by integration w.r.t. the density p(x): lim In (y) = I (σ) (y) = n→∞ G Ω Ω x−x′ σ (y(x) − y(x′ ))2 p(x)p(x′ )dxdx′ . (4) In the above limit, the bandwidth σ is held ﬁxed. Typically, one would also drive the bandwidth σ to zero as n → ∞. There are two reasons for this choice. First, from a practical perspective, this makes the similarity matrix W sparse so it can be stored and processed. Second, from a theoretical perspective, this leads to a clear and well deﬁned limit of the smoothness regularization term In (y), at least when σ → 0 slowly enough1 , namely when σ = ω( d log n/n). If σ → 0 as n → ∞, and as long as nσ d / log n → ∞, then after appropriate normalization, the regularizer converges to a density weighted gradient penalty term [7, 8]: d lim d+2 In (y) n→∞ Cσ (σ) d (y) d+2 I σ→0 Cσ = lim ∇y(x) 2 p(x)2 dx = J(y) = (5) Ω where C = Rd z 2 G( z )dz, and assuming 0 < C < ∞ (which is the case for both the Gaussian and the step ﬁlters). This energy functional J(f ) therefore encodes the notion of “smoothness” with respect to p(x) that is the basis of the SSL formulation (1) with the graph constructions speciﬁed by (3). To understand the behavior and appropriateness of (1) we must understand this functional and the associated limit problem: y (x) = arg min J(y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l (6) y p When σ = o( d 1/n) then all non-diagonal weights Wi,j vanish (points no longer have any “close by” p neighbors). We are not aware of an analysis covering the regime where σ decays roughly as d 1/n, but would be surprised if a qualitatively different meaningful limit is reached. 1 2 3 Graph Laplacian Regularization in R1 We begin by considering the solution of (6) for one dimensional data, i.e. d = 1 and x ∈ R. We ﬁrst consider the situation where the support of p(x) is a continuous interval Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R (a and/or b may be inﬁnite). Without loss of generality, we assume the labeled data is sorted in increasing order a x1 < x2 < · · · < xl b. Applying the theory of variational calculus, the solution y (x) ˆ satisﬁes inside each interval (xi , xi+1 ) the Euler-Lagrange equation d dy p2 (x) = 0. dx dx Performing two integrations and enforcing the constraints at the labeled points yields y(x) = yi + x 1/p2 (t)dt xi (yi+1 xi+1 1/p2 (t)dt xi − yi ) for xi x xi+1 (7) with y(x) = x1 for a x x1 and y(x) = xl for xl x b. If the support of p(x) is a union of disjoint intervals, the above analysis and the form of the solution applies in each interval separately. The solution (7) seems reasonable and desirable from the point of view of the “smoothness” assumptions: when p(x) is uniform, the solution interpolates linearly between labeled data points, whereas across low-density regions, where p(x) is close to zero, y(x) can change abruptly. Furthermore, the regularizer J(y) can be interpreted as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) squared semi-norm, giving us additional insight into this choice of regularizer: b 1 Theorem 1. Let p(x) be a smooth density on Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R such that Ap = 4 a 1/p2 (t)dt < ∞. 2 Then, J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm J(f ) = f Kp induced by the kernel x′ ′ Kp (x, x ) = Ap − 1 2 x with a null-space of all constant functions. That is, f the RKHS induced by Kp . 1 p2 (t) dt Kp . (8) is the norm of the projection of f onto If p(x) is supported on several disjoint intervals, Ω = ∪i [ai , bi ], then J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm induced by the kernel 1 bi dt 4 ai p2 (t) ′ Kp (x, x ) = − 1 2 x′ dt x p2 (t) if x, x′ ∈ [ai , bi ] (9) if x ∈ [ai , bi ], x′ ∈ [aj , bj ], i = j 0 with a null-space spanned by indicator functions 1[ai ,bi ] (x) on the connected components of Ω. Proof. For any f (x) = i αi Kp (x, xi ) in the RKHS induced by Kp : df dx J(f ) = 2 p2 (x)dx = αi αj Jij (10) i,j where Jij = d d Kp (x, xi ) Kp (x, xj )p2 (x)dx dx dx When xi and xj are in different connected components of Ω, the gradients of Kp (·, xi ) and Kp (·, xj ) are never non-zero together and Jij = 0 = Kp (xi , xj ). When they are in the same connected component [a, b], and assuming w.l.o.g. a xi xj b: Jij = = xi 1 4 1 4 a b a 1 dt + p2 (t) 1 1 dt − p2 (t) 2 xj xi xj xi −1 dt + p2 (t) xj 1 dt p2 (t) 1 dt = Kp (xi , xj ). p2 (t) Substituting Jij = Kp (xi , xj ) into (10) yields J(f ) = 3 b αi αj Kp (xi , xj ) = f (11) Kp . Combining Theorem 1 with the Representer Theorem [13] establishes that the solution of (6) (or of any variant where the hard constraints are replaced by a data term) is of the form: l y(x) = αj Kp (x, xj ) + βi 1[ai ,bi ] (x), j=1 i where i ranges over the connected components [ai , bi ] of Ω, and we have: l J(y) = αi αj Kp (xi , xj ). (12) i,j=1 Viewing the regularizer as y 2 p suggests understanding (6), and so also its empirical approximaK tion (1), by interpreting Kp (x, x′ ) as a density-based “similarity measure” between x and x′ . This similarity measure indeed seems sensible: for a uniform density it is simply linearly decreasing as a function of the distance. When the density is non-uniform, two points are relatively similar only if they are connected by a region in which 1/p2 (x) is low, i.e. the density is high, but are much less “similar”, i.e. related to each other, when connected by a low-density region. Furthermore, there is no dependence between points in disjoint components separated by zero density regions. 4 Graph Laplacian Regularization in Higher Dimensions The analysis of the previous section seems promising, at it shows that in one dimension, the SSL method (1) is well posed and converges to a sensible limit. Regretfully, in higher dimensions this is not the case anymore. In the following theorem we show that the inﬁmum of the limit problem (6) is zero and can be obtained by a sequence of functions which are certainly not a sensible extrapolation of the labeled points. Theorem 2. Let p(x) be a smooth density over Rd , d 2, bounded from above by some constant pmax , and let (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ) be any (non-repeating) set of labeled examples. There exist continuous functions yǫ (x), for any ǫ > 0, all satisfying the constraints yǫ (xj ) = yj , j = 1, . . . , l, such ǫ→0 ǫ→0 that J(yǫ ) −→ 0 but yǫ (x) −→ 0 for all x = xj , j = 1, . . . , l. Proof. We present a detailed proof for the case of l = 2 labeled points. The generalization of the proof to more labeled points is straightforward. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we assume the ﬁrst labeled point is at x0 = 0 with y(x0 ) = 0 and the second labeled point is at x1 with x1 = 1 and y(x1 ) = 1. In addition, we assume that the ball B1 (0) of radius one centered around the origin is contained in Ω = {x ∈ Rd | p(x) > 0}. We ﬁrst consider the case d > 2. Here, for any ǫ > 0, consider the function x ǫ yǫ (x) = min ,1 which indeed satisﬁes the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1. Then, J(yǫ ) = Bǫ (0) p2 (x) dx ǫ2 pmax ǫ2 dx = p2 Vd ǫd−2 max (13) Bǫ (0) where Vd is the volume of a unit ball in Rd . Hence, the sequence of functions yǫ (x) satisfy the constraints, but for d > 2, inf ǫ J(yǫ ) = 0. For d = 2, a more extreme example is necessary: consider the functions 2 x yǫ (x) = log +ǫ ǫ log 1+ǫ ǫ for x 1 and yǫ (x) = 1 for x > 1. These functions satisfy the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1 and: J(yǫ ) = 4 h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ 4πp2 max h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ x B1 (0) log ( x 1+ǫ ǫ 2 2 +ǫ)2 p2 (x)dx 4p2 h “ max ”i2 1+ǫ log ǫ 4πp2 max ǫ→0 = −→ 0. log 1+ǫ ǫ 4 1 0 r2 (r 2 +ǫ)2 2πrdr The implication of Theorem 2 is that regardless of the values at the labeled points, as u → ∞, the solution of (1) is not well posed. Asymptotically, the solution has the form of an almost everywhere constant function, with highly localized spikes near the labeled points, and so no learning is performed. In particular, an interpretation in terms of a density-based kernel Kp , as in the onedimensional case, is not possible. Our analysis also carries over to a formulation where a loss-based data term replaces the hard label constraints, as in l 1 y = arg min ˆ (y(xj ) − yj )2 + γIn (y) y(x) l j=1 In the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, functions of the form yǫ (x) above have a zero data penalty term (since they exactly match the labels) and also drive the regularization term J(y) to zero. Hence, it is possible to drive the entire objective functional (the data term plus the regularization term) to zero with functions that do not generalize at all to unlabeled points. 4.1 Numerical Example We illustrate the phenomenon detailed by Theorem 2 with a simple example. Consider a density p(x) in R2 , which is a mixture of two unit variance spherical Gaussians, one per class, centered at the origin and at (4, 0). We sample a total of n = 3000 points, and label two points from each of the two components (four total). We then construct a similarity matrix using a Gaussian ﬁlter with σ = 0.4. Figure 1 depicts the predictor y (x) obtained from (1). In fact, two different predictors are shown, ˆ obtained by different numerical methods for solving (1). Both methods are based on the observation that the solution y (x) of (1) satisﬁes: ˆ n y (xi ) = ˆ n Wij y (xj ) / ˆ j=1 Wij on all unlabeled points i = l + 1, . . . , l + u. (14) j=1 Combined with the constraints of (1), we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved by Gaussian elimination (here invoked through MATLAB’s backslash operator). This is the method used in the top panels of Figure 1. Alternatively, (14) can be viewed as an update equation for y (xi ), ˆ which can be solved via the power method, or label propagation [2, 6]: start with zero labels on the unlabeled points and iterate (14), while keeping the known labels on x1 , . . . , xl . This is the method used in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As predicted, y (x) is almost constant for almost all unlabeled points. Although all values are very ˆ close to zero, thresholding at the “right” threshold does actually produce sensible results in terms of the true -1/+1 labels. However, beyond being inappropriate for regression, a very ﬂat predictor is still problematic even from a classiﬁcation perspective. First, it is not possible to obtain a meaningful conﬁdence measure for particular labels. Second, especially if the size of each class is not known apriori, setting the threshold between the positive and negative classes is problematic. In our example, setting the threshold to zero yields a generalization error of 45%. The differences between the two numerical methods for solving (1) also point out to another problem with the ill-posedness of the limit problem: the solution is numerically very un-stable. A more quantitative evaluation, that also validates that the effect in Figure 1 is not a result of choosing a “wrong” bandwidth σ, is given in Figure 2. We again simulated data from a mixture of two Gaussians, one Gaussian per class, this time in 20 dimensions, with one labeled point per class, and an increasing number of unlabeled points. In Figure 2 we plot the squared error, and the classiﬁcation error of the resulting predictor y (x). We plot the classiﬁcation error both when a threshold ˆ of zero is used (i.e. the class is determined by sign(ˆ(x))) and with the ideal threshold minimizing y the test error. For each unlabeled sample size, we choose the bandwidth σ yielding the best test performance (this is a “cheating” approach which provides a lower bound on the error of the best method for selecting the bandwidth). As the number of unlabeled examples increases the squared error approaches 1, indicating a ﬂat predictor. Using a threshold of zero leads to an increase in the classiﬁcation error, possibly due to numerical instability. Interestingly, although the predictors become very ﬂat, the classiﬁcation error using the ideal threshold actually improves slightly.

For each error measure and sample size, the bandwidth minimizing the test error was used, and is plotted. ideal classiﬁcation performance is achieved with a signiﬁcantly larger bandwidth than the bandwidth minimizing the squared loss, i.e. when the predictor is even ﬂatter. 4.2 Probabilistic Interpretation, Exit and Hitting Times As mentioned above, the Laplacian regularization method (1) has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of a random walk on the weighted graph. Let x(t) denote a random walk on the graph with transition matrix M = D−1 W where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij . Then, for the binary classiﬁcation case with yi = ±1 we have [15]: y (xi ) = 2 Pr x(t) hits a point labeled +1 before hitting a point labeled -1 x(0) = xi − 1 ˆ We present an interpretation of our analysis in terms of the limiting properties of this random walk. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the two classes are separated by a low density region. Then, the random walk has two intrinsic quantities of interest. The ﬁrst is the mean exit time from one cluster to the other, and the other is the mean hitting time to the labeled points in that cluster. As the number of unlabeled points increases and σ → 0, the random walk converges to a diffusion process [12]. While the mean exit time then converges to a ﬁnite value corresponding to its diffusion analogue, the hitting time to a labeled point increases to inﬁnity (as these become absorbing boundaries of measure zero). With more and more unlabeled data the random walk will fully mix, forgetting where it started, before it hits any label. Thus, the probability of hitting +1 before −1 will become uniform across the entire graph, independent of the starting location xi , yielding a ﬂat predictor. 5 Keeping σ Finite At this point, a reader may ask whether the problems found in higher dimensions are due to taking the limit σ → 0. One possible objection is that there is an intrinsic characteristic scale for the data σ0 where (with high probability) all points at a distance xi − xj < σ0 have the same label. If this is the case, then it may not necessarily make sense to take values of σ < σ0 in constructing W . However, keeping σ ﬁnite while taking the number of unlabeled points to inﬁnity does not resolve the problem. On the contrary, even the one-dimensional case becomes ill-posed in this case. To see this, consider a function y(x) which is zero everywhere except at the labeled points, where y(xj ) = yj . With a ﬁnite number of labeled points of measure zero, I (σ) (y) = 0 in any dimension 6 50 points 500 points 3500 points 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 −0.5 y 1 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 x Figure 3: Minimizer of (1) for a 1-d problem with a ﬁxed σ = 0.4, two labeled points and an increasing number of unlabeled points. and for any ﬁxed σ > 0. While this limiting function is discontinuous, it is also possible to construct ǫ→0 a sequence of continuous functions yǫ that all satisfy the constraints and for which I (σ) (yǫ ) −→ 0. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3. We generated data from a mixture of two 1-D Gaussians centered at the origin and at x = 4, with one Gaussian labeled −1 and the other +1. We used two labeled points at the centers of the Gaussians and an increasing number of randomly drawn unlabeled points. As predicted, with a ﬁxed σ, although the solution is reasonable when the number of unlabeled points is small, it becomes ﬂatter, with sharp spikes on the labeled points, as u → ∞. 6 Fourier-Eigenvector Based Methods Before we conclude, we discuss a different approach for SSL, also based on the Graph Laplacian, suggested by Belkin and Niyogi [3]. Instead of using the Laplacian as a regularizer, constraining candidate predictors y(x) non-parametrically to those with small In (y) values, here the predictors are constrained to the low-dimensional space spanned by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the Laplacian: The similarity matrix W is computed as before, and the Graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W is considered (recall D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij ). Only predictors p j=1 aj ej y (x) = ˆ (15) spanned by the ﬁrst p eigenvectors e1 , . . . , ep of L (with smallest eigenvalues) are considered. The coefﬁcients aj are chosen by minimizing a loss function on the labeled data, e.g. the squared loss: (ˆ1 , . . . , ap ) = arg min a ˆ l j=1 (yj − y (xj ))2 . ˆ (16) Unlike the Laplacian Regularization method (1), the Laplacian Eigenvector method (15)–(16) is well posed in the limit u → ∞. This follows directly from the convergence of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator [10, 4]. Eigenvector based methods were shown empirically to provide competitive generalization performance on a variety of simulated and real world problems. Belkin and Niyogi [3] motivate the approach by arguing that ‘the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator provide a natural basis for functions on the manifold and the desired classiﬁcation function can be expressed in such a basis’. In our view, the success of the method is actually not due to data lying on a low-dimensional manifold, but rather due to the low density separation assumption, which states that different class labels form high-density clusters separated by low density regions. Indeed, under this assumption and with sufﬁcient separation between the clusters, the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplace-Beltrami operator are approximately piecewise constant in each of the clusters, as in spectral clustering [12, 11], providing a basis for a labeling that is constant within clusters but variable across clusters. In other settings, such as data uniformly distributed on a manifold but without any signiﬁcant cluster structure, the success of eigenvector based methods critically depends on how well can the unknown classiﬁcation function be approximated by a truncated expansion with relatively few eigenvectors. We illustrate this issue with the following three-dimensional example: Let p(x) denote the uniform density in the box [0, 1] × [0, 0.8] × [0, 0.6], where the box lengths are different to prevent eigenvalue multiplicity. Consider learning three different functions, y1 (x) = 1x1 >0.5 , y2 (x) = 1x1 >x2 /0.8 and y3 (x) = 1x2 /0.8>x3 /0.6 . Even though all three functions are relatively simple, all having a linear separating boundary between the classes on the manifold, as shown in the experiment described in Figure 4, the Eigenvector based method (15)–(16) gives markedly different generalization performances on the three targets. This happens both when the number of eigenvectors p is set to p = l/5 as suggested by Belkin and Niyogi, as well as for the optimal (oracle) value of p selected on the test set (i.e. a “cheating” choice representing an upper bound on the generalization error of this method). 7 Prediction Error (%) p = #labeled points/5 40 optimal p 20 labeled points 40 Approx.

All panels use n = 3000 points. Prediction counts the number of sign agreements with the true labels. Rightmost panel: best ﬁt when many (all 3000) points are used, representing the best we can hope for with a few leading eigenvectors. The reason for this behavior is that y2 (x) and even more so y3 (x) cannot be as easily approximated by the very few leading eigenfunctions—even though they seem “simple” and “smooth”, they are signiﬁcantly more complicated than y1 (x) in terms of measure of simplicity implied by the Eigenvector Method. Since the density is uniform, the graph Laplacian converges to the standard Laplacian and its eigenfunctions have the form ψi,j,k (x) = cos(iπx1 ) cos(jπx2 /0.8) cos(kπx3 /0.6), making it hard to represent simple decision boundaries which are not axis-aligned. 7 Discussion Our results show that a popular SSL method, the Laplacian Regularization method (1), is not wellbehaved in the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, despite its empirical success in various SSL tasks. The empirical success might be due to two reasons. First, it is possible that with a large enough number of labeled points relative to the number of unlabeled points, the method is well behaved. This regime, where the number of both labeled and unlabeled points grow while l/u is ﬁxed, has recently been analyzed by Wasserman and Lafferty [9]. However, we do not ﬁnd this regime particularly satisfying as we would expect that having more unlabeled data available should improve performance, rather than require more labeled points or make the problem ill-posed. It also places the user in a delicate situation of choosing the “just right” number of unlabeled points without any theoretical guidance. Second, in our experiments we noticed that although the predictor y (x) becomes extremely ﬂat, in ˆ binary tasks, it is still typically possible to ﬁnd a threshold leading to a good classiﬁcation performance. We do not know of any theoretical explanation for such behavior, nor how to characterize it. Obtaining such an explanation would be very interesting, and in a sense crucial to the theoretical foundation of the Laplacian Regularization method. On a very practical level, such a theoretical understanding might allow us to correct the method so as to avoid the numerical instability associated with ﬂat predictors, and perhaps also make it appropriate for regression. The reason that the Laplacian regularizer (1) is ill-posed in the limit is that the ﬁrst order gradient is not a sufﬁcient penalty in high dimensions. This fact is well known in spline theory, where the Sobolev Embedding Theorem [1] indicates one must control at least d+1 derivatives in Rd . In the 2 context of Laplacian regularization, this can be done using the iterated Laplacian: replacing the d+1 graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W , where D is the diagonal degree matrix, with L 2 (matrix to d+1 the 2 power). In the inﬁnite unlabeled data limit, this corresponds to regularizing all order- d+1 2 (mixed) partial derivatives. In the typical case of a low-dimensional manifold in a high dimensional ambient space, the order of iteration should correspond to the intrinsic, rather then ambient, dimensionality, which poses a practical problem of estimating this usually unknown dimensionality. We are not aware of much practical work using the iterated Laplacian, nor a good understanding of its appropriateness for SSL. A different approach leading to a well-posed solution is to include also an ambient regularization term [5]. However, the properties of the solution and in particular its relation to various assumptions about the “smoothness” of y(x) relative to p(x) remain unclear.

<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.33924875 <a title="213-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Regression_using_Hessian_energy_with_an_application_to_semi-supervised_dimensionality_reduction.html">214 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Regression using Hessian energy with an application to semi-supervised dimensionality reduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kwang I. Kim, Florian Steinke, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised regression based on the graph Laplacian suffers from the fact that the solution is biased towards a constant and the lack of extrapolating power. Based on these observations, we propose to use the second-order Hessian energy for semi-supervised regression which overcomes both these problems. If the data lies on or close to a low-dimensional submanifold in feature space, the Hessian energy prefers functions whose values vary linearly with respect to geodesic distance. We ﬁrst derive the Hessian energy for smooth manifolds and continue to give a stable estimation procedure for the common case where only samples of the underlying manifold are given. The preference of ‘’linear” functions on manifolds renders the Hessian energy particularly suited for the task of semi-supervised dimensionality reduction, where the goal is to ﬁnd a user-deﬁned embedding function given some labeled points which varies smoothly (and ideally linearly) along the manifold. The experimental results suggest superior performance of our method compared with semi-supervised regression using Laplacian regularization or standard supervised regression techniques applied to this task. 1</p><p>6 0.33919322 <a title="213-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-A_Rate_Distortion_Approach_for_Semi-Supervised_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">15 nips-2009-A Rate Distortion Approach for Semi-Supervised Conditional Random Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Briggman, Winfried Denk, Sebastian Seung, Moritz N. Helmstaedter, Srinivas C. Turaga</p><p>Abstract: Images can be segmented by ﬁrst using a classiﬁer to predict an afﬁnity graph that reﬂects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the afﬁnity classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassiﬁcation rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the afﬁnity graph. We present the ﬁrst machine learning algorithm for training a classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classiﬁcation of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of ﬁnding the connected components of the thresholded afﬁnity graph, we are able to train an afﬁnity classiﬁer to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin afﬁnities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity. 1</p><p>2 0.84937745 <a title="213-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Modelling_Relational_Data_using_Bayesian_Clustered_Tensor_Factorization.html">155 nips-2009-Modelling Relational Data using Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning probabilistic models for complex relational structures between various types of objects. A model can help us “understand” a dataset of relational facts in at least two ways, by ﬁnding interpretable structure in the data, and by supporting predictions, or inferences about whether particular unobserved relations are likely to be true. Often there is a tradeoff between these two aims: cluster-based models yield more easily interpretable representations, while factorization-based approaches have given better predictive performance on large data sets. We introduce the Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization (BCTF) model, which embeds a factorized representation of relations in a nonparametric Bayesian clustering framework. Inference is fully Bayesian but scales well to large data sets. The model simultaneously discovers interpretable clusters and yields predictive performance that matches or beats previous probabilistic models for relational data.</p><p>3 0.84371924 <a title="213-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>4 0.84284377 <a title="213-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli_Alignment%3A_A_Generative_Model_for_Multi-Class_Multi-Label_Multi-Instance_Corpora.html">68 nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment: A Generative Model for Multi-Class Multi-Label Multi-Instance Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang-hong Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Bao-gang Hu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predeﬁned classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-deﬁned classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classiﬁcation and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classiﬁcation and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.</p><p>5 0.84115225 <a title="213-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Streaming_Pointwise_Mutual_Information.html">233 nips-2009-Streaming Pointwise Mutual Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin V. Durme, Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has led to the ability to perform space efﬁcient, approximate counting over large vocabularies in a streaming context. Motivated by the existence of data structures of this type, we explore the computation of associativity scores, otherwise known as pointwise mutual information (PMI), in a streaming context. We give theoretical bounds showing the impracticality of perfect online PMI computation, and detail an algorithm with high expected accuracy. Experiments on news articles show our approach gives high accuracy on real world data. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.83276051 <a title="213-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Learning_using_Sparse_Eigenfunction_Bases.html">213 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Learning using Sparse Eigenfunction Bases</a></p>

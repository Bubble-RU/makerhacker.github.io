<p>Author: Lei Wu, Rong Jin, Steven C. Hoi, Jianke Zhu, Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Learning distance functions with side information plays a key role in many machine learning and data mining applications. Conventional approaches often assume a Mahalanobis distance function. These approaches are limited in two aspects: (i) they are computationally expensive (even infeasible) for high dimensional data because the size of the metric is in the square of dimensionality; (ii) they assume a ﬁxed metric for the entire input space and therefore are unable to handle heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that learns nonlinear Bregman distance functions from side information using a nonparametric approach that is similar to support vector machines. The proposed scheme avoids the assumption of ﬁxed metric by implicitly deriving a local distance from the Hessian matrix of a convex function that is used to generate the Bregman distance function. We also present an efﬁcient learning algorithm for the proposed scheme for distance function learning. The extensive experiments with semi-supervised clustering show the proposed technique (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for distance function learning, and (ii) is computationally efﬁcient for high dimensional data. 1</p><p>3 0.18358178 <a title="74-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Data-driven_calibration_of_linear_estimators_with_minimal_penalties.html">64 nips-2009-Data-driven calibration of linear estimators with minimal penalties</a></p>
<p>Author: Sylvain Arlot, Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: This paper tackles the problem of selecting among several linear estimators in non-parametric regression; this includes model selection for linear regression, the choice of a regularization parameter in kernel ridge regression or spline smoothing, and the choice of a kernel in multiple kernel learning. We propose a new algorithm which ﬁrst estimates consistently the variance of the noise, based upon the concept of minimal penalty which was previously introduced in the context of model selection. Then, plugging our variance estimate in Mallows’ CL penalty is proved to lead to an algorithm satisfying an oracle inequality. Simulation experiments with kernel ridge regression and multiple kernel learning show that the proposed algorithm often improves signiﬁcantly existing calibration procedures such as 10-fold cross-validation or generalized cross-validation. 1</p><p>4 0.11475811 <a title="74-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-From_PAC-Bayes_Bounds_to_KL_Regularization.html">98 nips-2009-From PAC-Bayes Bounds to KL Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Pascal Germain, Alexandre Lacasse, Mario Marchand, Sara Shanian, François Laviolette</p><p>Abstract: We show that convex KL-regularized objective functions are obtained from a PAC-Bayes risk bound when using convex loss functions for the stochastic Gibbs classiﬁer that upper-bound the standard zero-one loss used for the weighted majority vote. By restricting ourselves to a class of posteriors, that we call quasi uniform, we propose a simple coordinate descent learning algorithm to minimize the proposed KL-regularized cost function. We show that standard p -regularized objective functions currently used, such as ridge regression and p -regularized boosting, are obtained from a relaxation of the KL divergence between the quasi uniform posterior and the uniform prior. We present numerical experiments where the proposed learning algorithm generally outperforms ridge regression and AdaBoost. 1</p><p>5 0.10560302 <a title="74-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Rank-Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search%3A_Retaining_Meaning_and_Speed_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2009-Rank-Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: Retaining Meaning and Speed in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Parikshit Ram, Dongryeol Lee, Hua Ouyang, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The long-standing problem of efďŹ cient nearest-neighbor (NN) search has ubiquitous applications ranging from astrophysics to MP3 ďŹ ngerprinting to bioinformatics to movie recommendations. As the dimensionality of the dataset increases, exact NN search becomes computationally prohibitive; (1+đ?&oelig;&ndash;) distance-approximate NN search can provide large speedups but risks losing the meaning of NN search present in the ranks (ordering) of the distances. This paper presents a simple, practical algorithm allowing the user to, for the ďŹ rst time, directly control the true accuracy of NN search (in terms of ranks) while still achieving the large speedups over exact NN. Experiments on high-dimensional datasets show that our algorithm often achieves faster and more accurate results than the best-known distance-approximate method, with much more stable behavior. 1</p><p>6 0.096440077 <a title="74-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Regularized_Distance_Metric_Learning%3ATheory_and_Algorithm.html">202 nips-2009-Regularized Distance Metric Learning:Theory and Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Samory Kpotufe</p><p>Abstract: It was recently shown that certain nonparametric regressors can escape the curse of dimensionality when the intrinsic dimension of data is low ([1, 2]). We prove some stronger results in more general settings. In particular, we consider a regressor which, by combining aspects of both tree-based regression and kernel regression, adapts to intrinsic dimension, operates on general metrics, yields a smooth function, and evaluates in time O(log n). We derive a tight convergence rate of the form n−2/(2+d) where d is the Assouad dimension of the input space. 1</p><p>6 0.43939608 <a title="74-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-DUOL%3A_A_Double_Updating_Approach_for_Online_Learning.html">63 nips-2009-DUOL: A Double Updating Approach for Online Learning</a></p>

Gray</p><p>Abstract: Several key computational bottlenecks in machine learning involve pairwise distance computations, including all-nearest-neighbors (ďŹ nding the nearest neighbor(s) for each point, e.g. in manifold learning) and kernel summations (e.g. in kernel density estimation or kernel machines). We consider the general, bichromatic case for these problems, in addition to the scientiďŹ c problem of N-body simulation. In this paper we show for the ďŹ rst time O(đ?&lsquo;  ) worst case runtimes for practical algorithms for these problems based on the cover tree data structure [1]. 1</p><p>4 0.74843621 <a title="74-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_Neural_Implementation_of_the_Kalman_Filter.html">13 nips-2009-A Neural Implementation of the Kalman Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Wilson, Leif Finkel</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests that the brain is capable of approximating Bayesian inference in the face of noisy input stimuli. Despite this progress, the neural underpinnings of this computation are still poorly understood. In this paper we focus on the Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic time series and introduce a novel neural network, derived from a line attractor architecture, whose dynamics map directly onto those of the Kalman ﬁlter in the limit of small prediction error. When the prediction error is large we show that the network responds robustly to changepoints in a way that is qualitatively compatible with the optimal Bayesian model. The model suggests ways in which probability distributions are encoded in the brain and makes a number of testable experimental predictions. 1</p><p>5 0.69017941 <a title="74-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Rank-Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search%3A_Retaining_Meaning_and_Speed_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2009-Rank-Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: Retaining Meaning and Speed in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Parikshit Ram, Dongryeol Lee, Hua Ouyang, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The long-standing problem of efďŹ cient nearest-neighbor (NN) search has ubiquitous applications ranging from astrophysics to MP3 ďŹ ngerprinting to bioinformatics to movie recommendations. As the dimensionality of the dataset increases, exact NN search becomes computationally prohibitive; (1+đ?&oelig;&ndash;) distance-approximate NN search can provide large speedups but risks losing the meaning of NN search present in the ranks (ordering) of the distances. This paper presents a simple, practical algorithm allowing the user to, for the ďŹ rst time, directly control the true accuracy of NN search (in terms of ranks) while still achieving the large speedups over exact NN. Experiments on high-dimensional datasets show that our algorithm often achieves faster and more accurate results than the best-known distance-approximate method, with much more stable behavior. 1</p><p>6 0.68624115 <a title="74-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>

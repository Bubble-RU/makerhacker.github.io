<p>Author: Romain Brasselet, Roland Johansson, Angelo Arleo</p><p>Abstract: We study an encoding/decoding mechanism accounting for the relative spike timing of the signals propagating from peripheral nerve ﬁbers to second-order somatosensory neurons in the cuneate nucleus (CN). The CN is modeled as a population of spiking neurons receiving as inputs the spatiotemporal responses of real mechanoreceptors obtained via microneurography recordings in humans. The efﬁciency of the haptic discrimination process is quantiﬁed by a novel deﬁnition of entropy that takes into full account the metrical properties of the spike train space. This measure proves to be a suitable decoding scheme for generalizing the classical Shannon entropy to spike-based neural codes. It permits an assessment of neurotransmission in the presence of a large output space (i.e. hundreds of spike trains) with 1 ms temporal precision. It is shown that the CN population code performs a complete discrimination of 81 distinct stimuli already within 35 ms of the ﬁrst afferent spike, whereas a partial discrimination (80% of the maximum information transmission) is possible as rapidly as 15 ms. This study suggests that the CN may not constitute a mere synaptic relay along the somatosensory pathway but, rather, it may convey optimal contextual accounts (in terms of fast and reliable information transfer) of peripheral tactile inputs to downstream structures of the central nervous system. 1</p><p>3 0.11591657 <a title="255-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Rethinking_LDA%3A_Why_Priors_Matter.html">205 nips-2009-Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, David M. Mimno, Hanna M. Wallach</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of topic models typically use symmetric Dirichlet priors with ﬁxed concentration parameters, with the implicit assumption that such “smoothing parameters” have little practical effect. In this paper, we explore several classes of structured priors for topic models. We ﬁnd that an asymmetric Dirichlet prior over the document–topic distributions has substantial advantages over a symmetric prior, while an asymmetric prior over the topic–word distributions provides no real beneﬁt. Approximation of this prior structure through simple, efﬁcient hyperparameter optimization steps is sufﬁcient to achieve these performance gains. The prior structure we advocate substantially increases the robustness of topic models to variations in the number of topics and to the highly skewed word frequency distributions common in natural language. Since this prior structure can be implemented using efﬁcient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques, we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling. 1</p><p>4 0.11150059 <a title="255-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Hierarchical_Learning_of_Dimensional_Biases_in_Human_Categorization.html">109 nips-2009-Hierarchical Learning of Dimensional Biases in Human Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Nick Chater, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Existing models of categorization typically represent to-be-classiﬁed items as points in a multidimensional space. While from a mathematical point of view, an inﬁnite number of basis sets can be used to represent points in this space, the choice of basis set is psychologically crucial. People generally choose the same basis dimensions – and have a strong preference to generalize along the axes of these dimensions, but not “diagonally”. What makes some choices of dimension special? We explore the idea that the dimensions used by people echo the natural variation in the environment. Speciﬁcally, we present a rational model that does not assume dimensions, but learns the same type of dimensional generalizations that people display. This bias is shaped by exposing the model to many categories with a structure hypothesized to be like those which children encounter. The learning behaviour of the model captures the developmental shift from roughly “isotropic” for children to the axis-aligned generalization that adults show. 1</p><p>5 0.11039545 <a title="255-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_a_Small_Mixture_of_Trees.html">129 nips-2009-Learning a Small Mixture of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating a given probability distribution using a simpler distribution plays an important role in several areas of machine learning, for example variational inference and classiﬁcation. Within this context, we consider the task of learning a mixture of tree distributions. Although mixtures of trees can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence using an EM algorithm, its success depends heavily on the initialization. We propose an efﬁcient strategy for obtaining a good initial set of trees that attempts to cover the entire observed distribution by minimizing the α-divergence with α = ∞. We formulate the problem using the fractional covering framework and present a convergent sequential algorithm that only relies on solving a convex program at each iteration. Compared to previous methods, our approach results in a signiﬁcantly smaller mixture of trees that provides similar or better accuracies. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by learning pictorial structures for face recognition.</p><p>6 0.10289042 <a title="255-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Spatial_Normalized_Gamma_Processes.html">226 nips-2009-Spatial Normalized Gamma Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian model of document collections that decouples sparsity and smoothness in the component distributions (i.e., the “topics”). In the sparse topic model (sparseTM), each topic is represented by a bank of selector variables that determine which terms appear in the topic. Thus each topic is associated with a subset of the vocabulary, and topic smoothness is modeled on this subset. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for the sparseTM that includes a general-purpose method for sampling from a Dirichlet mixture with a combinatorial number of components. We demonstrate the sparseTM on four real-world datasets. Compared to traditional approaches, the empirical results will show that sparseTMs give better predictive performance with simpler inferred models. 1</p><p>3 0.5378871 <a title="255-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Spatial_Normalized_Gamma_Processes.html">226 nips-2009-Spatial Normalized Gamma Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinayak Rao, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: Dependent Dirichlet processes (DPs) are dependent sets of random measures, each being marginally DP distributed. They are used in Bayesian nonparametric models when the usual exchangeability assumption does not hold. We propose a simple and general framework to construct dependent DPs by marginalizing and normalizing a single gamma process over an extended space. The result is a set of DPs, each associated with a point in a space such that neighbouring DPs are more dependent. We describe Markov chain Monte Carlo inference involving Gibbs sampling and three different Metropolis-Hastings proposals to speed up convergence. We report an empirical study of convergence on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate an application of the model to topic modeling through time. 1</p><p>4 0.50358385 <a title="255-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Rethinking_LDA%3A_Why_Priors_Matter.html">205 nips-2009-Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter</a></p>

<p>Author: Francois Caron, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: Over recent years Dirichlet processes and the associated Chinese restaurant process (CRP) have found many applications in clustering while the Indian buffet process (IBP) is increasingly used to describe latent feature models. These models are attractive because they ensure exchangeability (over samples). We propose here extensions of these models where the dependency between samples is given by a known decomposable graph. These models have appealing properties and can be easily learned using Monte Carlo techniques. 1 Motivation The CRP and IBP have found numerous applications in machine learning over recent years [5, 10]. We consider here the case where the data we are interested in are ‘locally’ dependent; these dependencies being represented by a known graph G where each data point/object is associated to a vertex. These local dependencies can correspond to any conceptual or real (e.g. space, time) metric. For example, in the context of clustering, we might want to propose a prior distribution on partitions enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to be in the same cluster. Similarly, in the context of latent feature models, we might be interested in a prior distribution on features enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to possess similar features. The ‘standard’ CRP and IBP correspond to the case where the graph G is complete; that is it is fully connected. In this paper, we generalize the CRP and IBP to decomposable graphs. The resulting generalized versions of the CRP and IBP enjoy attractive properties. Each clique of the graph follows marginally a CRP or an IBP process and explicit expressions for the joint prior distribution on the graph is available. It makes it easy to learn those models using straightforward generalizations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms proposed to perform inference for the CRP and IBP [5, 10, 14]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the popular Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and the Dirichlet Process (DP) partition distribution. We propose an extension of these two models to decomposable graphical models. In Section 3 we discuss nonparametric latent feature models, reviewing brieﬂy the construction in [5] and extending it to decomposable graphs. We demonstrate these models in Section 4 on two applications: an alternative to the hierarchical DP model [12] and a time-varying matrix factorization problem. 2 Prior distributions for partitions on decomposable graphs Assume we have n observations. When performing clustering, we associate to each of this observation an allocation variable zi ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K}. Let Πn be the partition of [n] = {1, . . . , n} deﬁned by the equivalence relation i ↔ j ⇔ zi = zj . The resulting partition Πn = {A1 , . . . , An(Πn ) } 1 is an unordered collection of disjoint non-empty subsets Aj of [n], j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), where ∪j Aj = [n] and n(Πn ) is the number of subsets for partition Πn . We also denote by Pn be the set of all partitions of [n] and let nj , j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), be the size of the subset Aj . Each allocation variable zi is associated to a vertex/site of an undirected graph G, which is assumed to be known. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we ﬁrst review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on z1:n , equivalently on Πn . We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs; see [2, 8] for an introduction to decomposable graphs. Finally we brieﬂy discuss the directed case. Note that the models proposed here are completely different from the hyper multinomial-Dirichlet in [2] and its recent DP extension [6]. 2.1 Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and DP partition distribution Assume for the time being that K is ﬁnite. When the graph is complete, a popular choice for the allocation variables is to consider a Dirichlet multinomial allocation model [11] θ θ , . . . , ), zi |π ∼ π (1) K K where D is the standard Dirichlet distribution and θ > 0. Integrating out π, we obtain the following Dirichlet multinomial prior distribution π ∼ D( Pr(z1:n ) = K j=1 Γ(θ) Γ(nj + θ K) (2) θ Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )K and then, using the straightforward equality Pr(Πn ) = PK where PK = {Πn ∈ Pn |n(Πn ) ≤ K}, we obtain K! (K−n(Πn ))! Pr(z1:n ) valid for for all Πn ∈ n(Π ) Pr(Πn ) = θ Γ(θ) j=1n Γ(nj + K ) K! . θ (K − n(Πn ))! Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )n(Πn ) (3) DP may be seen as a generalization of the Dirichlet multinomial model when the number of components K → ∞; see for example [10]. In this case the distribution over the partition Πn of [n] is given by [11] n(Π ) θn(Πn ) j=1n Γ(nj ) . (4) Pr(Πn ) = n i=1 (θ + i − 1) Let Π−k = {A1,−k , . . . , An(Π−k ),−k } be the partition induced by removing item k to Πn and nj,−k be the size of cluster j for j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ). It follows from (4) that an item k is assigned to an existing cluster j, j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to nj,−k / (n − 1 + θ) and forms a new cluster with probability θ/ (n − 1 + θ). This property is the basis of the CRP. We now extend the Dirichlet multinomial allocation and the DP partition distribution models to decomposable graphs. 2.2 Markov combination of Dirichlet multinomial and DP partition distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. It can be easily checked that if the marginal distribution of zC for each clique C ∈ C is deﬁned by (2) then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (2) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Dirichlet multinomial distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(zC ) S∈S Pr(zS ) C∈C Pr(z1:n ) = (5) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, we have Pr(zB ) given by (2). It follows that we have for any Πn ∈ PK Γ(θ) K! Pr(Πn ) = (K − n(Πn ))! C∈C Γ(θ) S∈S 2 K j=1 θ Γ(nj,C + K ) θ Γ(θ+nC )Γ( K )K K j=1 θ Γ(nj,S + K ) θ Γ(θ+nS )Γ( K )K (6) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items associated to cluster j, j = 1, . . . , K in B and nB is the total number of items in B. Within each complete set B, the allocation variables deﬁne a partition distributed according to the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We now extend this approach to DP partition distributions; that is we derive a joint distribution over Πn such that the distribution of ΠB over each complete set B of the graph is given by (4) with θ > 0. Such a distribution satisﬁes the consistency condition over the separators as the restriction of any partition distributed according to (4) still follows (4) [7]. G Proposition. Let Pn be the set of partitions Πn ∈ Pn such that for each decomposition A, B, and any (i, j) ∈ A × B, i ↔ j ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that k ↔ i ↔ j. As K → ∞, the prior distribution G over partitions (6) is given for each Πn ∈ Pn by Pr(Πn ) = θn(Πn ) n(ΠC ) Γ(nj,C ) j=1 nC i=1 (θ+i−1) n(ΠS ) Γ(nj,S ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 C∈C S∈S (7) where n(ΠB ) is the number of clusters in the complete set B. Proof. From (6), we have θ n(ΠC ) K(K − 1) . . . (K − n(Πn ) + 1) Pr(Πn ) = K C∈C n(ΠC )− S∈S n(ΠS ) C∈C θ n(ΠS ) S∈S n(ΠC ) θ Γ(nj,C + K ) j=1 nC (θ+i−1) i=1 n(ΠS ) θ Γ(nj,S + K ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 Thus when K → ∞, we obtain (7) if n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) and 0 otherwise. We have n(Πn ) ≤ C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) for any Πn ∈ Pn and the subset of Pn verifying G n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) corresponds to the set Pn . Example. Let the notation i ∼ j (resp. i j) indicates an edge (resp. no edge) between two sites. Let n = 3 and G be the decomposable graph deﬁned by the relations 1 ∼ 2, 2 ∼ 3 and 1 3. G The set P3 is then equal to {{{1, 2, 3}}; {{1, 2}, {3}}; {{1}, {2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}}}. Note that G the partition {{1, 3}, {2}} does not belong to P3 . Indeed, as there is no edge between 1 and 3, they cannot be in the same cluster if 2 is in another cluster. The cliques are C1 = {1, 2} and C2 = {2, 3} Pr(ΠC1 ) Pr(ΠC2 ) hence we can and the separator is S2 = {2}. The distribution is given by Pr(Π3 ) = Pr(ΠS ) 2 check that we obtain Pr({1, 2, 3}) = (θ + 1)−2 , Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = θ(θ + 1)−2 and Pr({1}, {2}, {3}) = θ2 (θ + 1)−2 . Let now deﬁne the full conditional distributions. Based on (7) the conditional assignment of an item k is proportional to the conditional over the cliques divided by the conditional over the separators. G Let denote G−k the undirected graph obtained by removing vertex k from G. Suppose that Πn ∈ Pn . G−k If Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , then do not change the value of item k. Otherwise, item k is assigned to cluster j / where j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ) with probability proportional to {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (8) and to a new cluster with probability proportional to θ, where n−k,j,C is the number of items in the set C \ {k} belonging to cluster j. The updating process is illustrated by the Chinese wedding party process1 in Fig. 1. The results of this section can be extended to the Pitman-Yor process, and more generally to species sampling models. Example (continuing). Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1}, A2 = {3}}, we have −1 Pr( item 2 assigned to A1 = {1}| Π−2 ) = Pr( item 2 assigned to A2 = {3}| Π−2 ) = (θ + 2) −1 and Pr( item 2 assigned to new cluster A3 | Π−2 ) = θ (θ + 2) . Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1, 3}}, item 2 is assigned to A1 with probability 1. 1 Note that this representation describes the full conditionals while the CRP represents the sequential updat- ing. 3 (a) (b) (d) (c) (e) Figure 1: Chinese wedding party. Consider a group of n guests attending a wedding party. Each of the n guests may belong to one or several cliques, i.e. maximal groups of people such that everybody knows everybody. The belonging of each guest to the different cliques is represented by color patches on the ﬁgures, and the graphical representation of the relationship between the guests is represented by the graphical model (e). (a) Suppose that the guests are already seated such that two guests cannot be together at the same table is they are not part of the same clique, or if there does not exist a group of other guests such that they are related (“Any friend of yours is a friend of mine”). (b) The guest number k leaves his table and either (c) joins a table where there are guests from the same clique as him, with probability proportional to the product of the number of guests from each clique over the product of the number of guests belonging to several cliques on that table or (d) he joins a new table with probability proportional to θ. 2.3 Monte Carlo inference 2.3.1 MCMC algorithm Using the full conditionals, a single site Gibbs sampler can easily be designed to approximate the posterior distribution Pr(Πn |z1:n ). Given a partition Πn , an item k is taken out of the partition. If G−k Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , item k keeps the same value. Otherwise, the item will be assigned to a cluster j, / j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to p(z{k}∪Aj,−k ) × p(zAj,−k ) {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (9) and the item will be assigned to a new cluster with probability proportional to p(z{k} ) × θ. Similarly to [3], we can also deﬁne a procedure to sample from p(θ|n(Πn ) = k)). We assume that θ ∼ G(a, b) and use p auxiliary variables x1 , . . . , xp . The procedure is as follows. • For j = 1, . . . , p, sample xj |k, θ ∼ Beta(θ + nSj , nCj − nSj ) • Sample θ|k, x1:p ∼ G(a + k, b − j log xj ) 2.3.2 Sequential Monte Carlo We have so far only treated the case of an undirected decomposable graph G. We can formulate a sequential updating rule for the corresponding perfect directed version D of G. Indeed, let (a1 , . . . a|V | ) be a perfect ordering and pa(ak ) be the set of parents of ak which is by deﬁnition complete. Let Πk−1 = {A1,k−1 , . . . , An(Πk−1 ),k−1 } denote the partition of the ﬁrst k−1 vertices a1:k−1 and let nj,pa(ak ) be the number of elements with value j in the set pa(ak ), j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ). Then the vertex ak joins the set j with probability nj,pa(ak ) / θ + cluster with probability θ/ θ + q q nq,pa(ak ) and creates a new nq,pa(ak ) . One can then design a particle ﬁlter/SMC method in a similar fashion as [4]. Consider a set of (i) (i) (i) (i) N N particles Πk−1 with weights wk−1 ∝ Pr(Πk−1 , z1:k−1 ) ( i=1 wk−1 = 1) that approximate (i) the posterior distribution Pr(Πk−1 |z1:k−1 ). For each particle i, there are n(Πk−1 ) + 1 possible 4 (i,j) allocations for component ak . We denote Πk the partition obtained by associating component ak (i,j) to cluster j. The weight associated to Πk is given by  nj,pa(ak ) (i)  if j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ) θ+ q nq,pa(ak ) (i,j) (i) p(z{ak }∪Aj,k−1 ) wk−1 = wk−1 × (10) (i) θ  θ+ n p(zAj,k−1 ) if j = n(Πk−1 ) + 1 q q,pa(ak ) (i,j) Then we can perform a deterministic resampling step by keeping the N particles Πk with highest (i,j) (i) (i) weights wk−1 . Let Πk be the resampled particles and wk the associated normalized weights. 3 Prior distributions for inﬁnite binary matrices on decomposable graphs Assume we have n objects; each of these objects being associated to the vertex of a graph G. To K each object is associated a K-dimensional binary vector zn = (zn,1 , . . . , zn,K ) ∈ {0, 1} where zn,i = 1 if object n possesses feature i and zn,i = 0 otherwise. These vectors zt form a binary n × K matrix denoted Z1:n . We denote by ξ1:n the associated equivalence class of left-ordered matrices and let EK be the set of left-ordered matrices with at most K features. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on Z1:n , equivalently on ξ1:n : the Beta-Bernoulli model and the IBP [5]. We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs. This can be used for example to deﬁne a time-varying IBP as illustrated in Section 4. 3.1 Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions The Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the allocation Z1:n is K Pr(Z1:n ) = α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) α K Γ(nj j=1 (11) where nj is the number of objects having feature j. It follows that Pr(ξ1:n ) = K K! 2n −1 h=0 α K Γ(nj α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) Kh ! j=1 (12) where Kh is the number of features possessing the history h (see [5] for details). The nonparametric model is obtained by taking the limit when K → ∞ Pr(ξ1:n ) = αK K+ + 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! exp(−αHn ) where K + is the total number of features and Hn = 3.2 (n − nj )!(nj − 1)! n! j=1 n 1 k=1 k . (13) The IBP follows from (13). Markov combination of Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. As in the Dirichlet-multinomial case, it is easily seen that if for each clique C ∈ C, the marginal distribution is deﬁned by (11), then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (11) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(ZC ) S∈S Pr(ZS ) C∈C Pr(Z1:n ) = (14) where Pr(ZB ) given by (11) for each complete set B ⊆ G. The prior over ξ1:n is thus given, for ξ1:n ∈ EK , by Pr(ξ1:n ) = K! 2n −1 h=0 Kh ! α K α Γ(nj,C + K )Γ(nC −nj,C +1) α Γ(nC +1+ K ) α α Γ(nj,S + K )Γ(nS −nj,S +1) K K α j=1 Γ(nS +1+ K ) K j=1 C∈C S∈S 5 (15) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items having feature j, j = 1, . . . , K in the set B and nB is the whole set of objects in set B. Taking the limit when K → ∞, we obtain after a few calculations Pr(ξ1:n ) = α + K[n] exp [−α ( C HnC − 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! HnS )] × C∈C + KC (nC −nj,C )!(nj,C −1)! j=1 nC ! S∈S S + KS (nS −nj,S )!(nj,S −1)! j=1 nS ! + + + + if K[n] = C KC − S KS and 0 otherwise, where KB is the number of different features possessed by objects in B. G Let En be the subset of En such that for each decomposition A, B and any (u, v) ∈ A × B: {u and v possess feature j} ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that {k possesses feature j}. Let ξ−k be the left-ordered + matrix obtained by removing object k from ξn and K−k be the total number of different features in G−k + ξ−k . For each feature j = 1, . . . , K−k , if ξ−k ∈ En−1 then we have   b C∈C nj,C if i = 1 S∈C nj,S Pr(ξk,j = i) = (16)  b C∈C (nC −nj,C ) if i = 0 (nS −nj,S ) S∈C nS where b is the appropriate normalizing constant then the customer k tries Poisson α {S∈S|k∈S} nC {C∈C|k∈C} new dishes. We can easily generalize this construction to a directed version D of G using arguments similar to those presented in Section 2; see Section 4 for an application to time-varying matrix factorization. 4 4.1 Applications Sharing clusters among relative groups: An alternative to HDP Consider that we are given d groups with nj data yi,j in each group, i = 1, . . . , nj , j = 1, . . . , d. We consider latent cluster variables zi,j that deﬁne the partition of the data. We will use alternatively the notation θi,j = Uzi,j in the following. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process [12] (HDP) is a very popular model for sharing clusters among related groups. It is based on a hierarchy of DPs G0 ∼ DP (γ, H), Gj |G0 ∼ DP (α, G0 ) j = 1, . . . d θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj . Under conjugacy assumptions, G0 , Gj and U can be integrated out and we can approximate the marginal posterior of (zi,j ) given y = (yi,j ) with Gibbs sampling using the Chinese restaurant franchise to sample from the full conditional p(zi,j |z−{i,j} , y). Using the graph formulation deﬁned in Section 2, we propose an alternative to HDP. Let θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N be N auxiliary variables belonging to what we call group 0. We deﬁne each clique Cj (j = 1, . . . , d) to be composed of elements from group j and elements from group 0. This deﬁnes a decomposable graphical model whose separator is given by the elements of group 0. We can rewrite the model in a way quite similar to HDP G0 ∼ DP (α, H), θ0,i |G0 ∼ G0 i = 1, ..., N α α Gj |θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N ∼ DP (α + N, α+N H + α+N θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj N i=1 δθ0,i ) j = 1, . . . d, N For any subset A and j = k ∈ {1, . . . , p} we have corr(Gj (A), Gk (A)) = α+N . Again, under conjugacy conditions, we can integrate out G0 , Gj and U and approximate the marginal posterior distribution over the partition using the Chinese wedding party process deﬁned in Section 2. Note that for latent variables zi,j , j = 1, . . . , d, associated to data, this is the usual CRP update. As in HDP, multiple layers can be added to the model. Figures 2 (a) and (b) resp. give the graphical DP alternative to HDP and 2-layer HDP. 6 z0 root z0 root corpora docs z1 z2 z1 z2 z3 z1,1 z1,2 z2,1 z2,2 z2,3 docs (a) Graphical DP alternative to HDP (b) Graphical DP alternative to 2-layer HDP Figure 2: Hierarchical Graphs of dependency with (a) one layer and (b) two layers of hierarchy. If N = 0, then Gj ∼ DP (α, H) for all j and this is equivalent to setting γ → ∞ in HDP. If N → ∞ then Gj = G0 for all j, G0 ∼ DP (α, H). This is equivalent to setting α → ∞ in the HDP. One interesting feature of the model is that, contrary to HDP, the marginal distribution of Gj at any layer of the tree is DP (α, H). As a consequence, the total number of clusters scales logarithmically (as in the usual DP) with the size of each group, whereas it scales doubly logarithmically in HDP. Contrary to HDP, there are at most N clusters shared between different groups. Our model is in that sense reminiscent of [9] where only a limited number of clusters can be shared. Note however that contrary to [9] we have a simple CRP-like process. The proposed methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the inﬁnite HMM [12]. The main issue of the proposed model is the setting of the number N of auxiliary parameters. Another issue is that to achieve high correlation, we need a large number of auxiliary variables. Nonetheless, the computational time used to sample from auxiliary variables is negligible compared to the time used for latent variables associated to data. Moreover, it can be easily parallelized. The model proposed offers a far richer framework and ensures that at each level of the tree, the marginal distribution of the partition is given by a DP partition model. 4.2 Time-varying matrix factorization Let X1:n be an observed matrix of dimension n × D. We want to ﬁnd a representation of this matrix in terms of two latent matrices Z1:n of dimension n × K and Y of dimension K × D. Here Z1:n 2 is a binary matrix whereas Y is a matrix of latent features. By assuming that Y ∼ N 0, σY IK×D and 2 X1:n = Z1:n Y + σX εn where εn ∼ N 0, σX In×D , we obtain p(X1:n |Z1:n ) ∝ −D/2 2 2 + Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn 1:n 1:n + (n−Kn )D σX exp − + Kn D σY 2 2 + where Σ−1 = I − Z+ Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn n 1:n 1:n 1:n −1 1 T −1 2 tr X1:n Σn X1:n 2σX (17) + Z+T , Kn the number of non-zero columns of 1:n + Z1:n and Z+ is the ﬁrst Kn columns of Z1:n . To avoid having to set K, [5, 14] assume that Z1:n 1:n follows an IBP. The resulting posterior distribution p(Z1:n |X1:n ) can be estimated through MCMC [5] or SMC [14]. We consider here a different model where the object Xt is assumed to arrive at time index t and we want a prior distribution on Z1:n ensuring that objects close in time are more likely to possess similar features. To achieve this, we consider the simple directed graphical model D of Fig. 3 where the site numbering corresponds to a time index in that case and a perfect numbering of D is (1, 2, . . .). The set of parents pa(t) is composed of the r preceding sites {{t − r}, . . . , {t − 1}}. The time-varying IBP to sample from p(Z1:n ) associated to this directed graph follows from (16) and proceeds as follows. At time t = 1 + new new • Sample K1 ∼Poisson(α), set z1,i = 1 for i = 1, ..., K1 and set K1 = Knew . At times t = 2, . . . , r n + new ∼Poisson( α ). • For k = 1, . . .

At times t = r + 1, . . . , n n + α new ∼Poisson( r+1 ). • For k = 1, . . . Kt , sample zt,k ∼ Ber( t−r:t−1,k ) and Kt r+1 + Here Kt is the total number of features appearing from time max(1, t − r) to t − 1 and nt−r:t−1,k the restriction of n1:t−1 to the r last customers. Using (17) and the prior distribution of Z1:n which can be sampled using the time-varying IBP described above, we can easily design an SMC method to sample from p(Z1:n |X1:n ). We do not detail it here. Note that contrary to [14], our algorithm does not require inverting a matrix whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the data but only a matrix of dimension r × r. In order to illustrate the model and SMC algorithm, we create 200 6 × 6 images using a ground truth Y consisting of 4 different 6 × 6 latent images. The 200 × 4 binary matrix was generated from Pr(zt,k = 1) = πt,k , where πt = ( .6 .5 0 0 ) if t = 1, . . . , 30, πt = ( .4 .8 .4 0 ) if t = 31, . . . , 50 and πt = ( 0 .3 .6 .6 ) if t = 51, . . . , 200. The order of the model is set to r = 50. The feature occurences Z1:n and true features Y and their estimates are represented in Figure 4. Two spurious features are detected by the model (features 2 and 5 on Fig. 3(c)) but quickly discarded (Fig. 4(d)). The algorithm is able to correctly estimate the varying prior occurences of the features over time.

[1] is a special case of the proposed model when G is given by Fig. 3. The bivariate DP of Walker and Muliere [13] is also a special case when G has only two cliques. In this paper, we have assumed that the structure of the graph was known beforehand and we have shown that many ﬂexible models arise from this framework. It would be interesting in the future to investigate the case where the graphical structure is unknown and must be estimated from the data.

<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: The nested Chinese restaurant process (nCRP) is a powerful nonparametric Bayesian model for learning tree-based hierarchies from data. Since its posterior distribution is intractable, current inference methods have all relied on MCMC sampling. In this paper, we develop an alternative inference technique based on variational methods. To employ variational methods, we derive a tree-based stick-breaking construction of the nCRP mixture model, and a novel variational algorithm that efﬁciently explores a posterior over a large set of combinatorial structures. We demonstrate the use of this approach for text and hand written digits modeling, where we show we can adapt the nCRP to continuous data as well. 1</p><p>2 0.81287473 <a title="255-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Honglak Lee, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classiﬁer. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We ﬁnd that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We ﬁnd that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of “deep” vs. “shallower” representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.80912131 <a title="255-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>4 0.80603373 <a title="255-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a two-layer undirected graphical model, called a “Replicated Softmax”, that can be used to model and automatically extract low-dimensional latent semantic representations from a large unstructured collection of documents. We present efﬁcient learning and inference algorithms for this model, and show how a Monte-Carlo based method, Annealed Importance Sampling, can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the log-probability the model assigns to test data. This allows us to demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generalize much better compared to Latent Dirichlet Allocation in terms of both the log-probability of held-out documents and the retrieval accuracy.</p><p>5 0.80571413 <a title="255-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Markov random ﬁelds (MRF’s), or undirected graphical models, provide a powerful framework for modeling complex dependencies among random variables. Maximum likelihood learning in MRF’s is hard due to the presence of the global normalizing constant. In this paper we consider a class of stochastic approximation algorithms of the Robbins-Monro type that use Markov chain Monte Carlo to do approximate maximum likelihood learning. We show that using MCMC operators based on tempered transitions enables the stochastic approximation algorithm to better explore highly multimodal distributions, which considerably improves parameter estimates in large, densely-connected MRF’s. Our results on MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that we can successfully learn good generative models of high-dimensional, richly structured data that perform well on digit and object recognition tasks.</p><p>6 0.80201638 <a title="255-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Modeling_Social_Annotation_Data_with_Content_Relevance_using_a_Topic_Model.html">153 nips-2009-Modeling Social Annotation Data with Content Relevance using a Topic Model</a></p>

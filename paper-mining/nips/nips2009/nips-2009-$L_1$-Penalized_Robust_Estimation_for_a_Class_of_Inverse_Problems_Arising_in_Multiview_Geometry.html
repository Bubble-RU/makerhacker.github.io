<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, John Lim, Dale Schuurmans, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We develop a convex relaxation of maximum a posteriori estimation of a mixture of regression models. Although our relaxation involves a semideﬁnite matrix variable, we reformulate the problem to eliminate the need for general semideﬁnite programming. In particular, we provide two reformulations that admit fast algorithms. The ﬁrst is a max-min spectral reformulation exploiting quasi-Newton descent. The second is a min-min reformulation consisting of fast alternating steps of closed-form updates. We evaluate the methods against Expectation-Maximization in a real problem of motion segmentation from video data. 1</p><p>3 0.16584493 <a title="1-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Learning_models_of_object_structure.html">133 nips-2009-Learning models of object structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Schlecht, Kobus Barnard</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for learning stochastic geometric models of object categories from single view images. We focus here on models expressible as a spatially contiguous assemblage of blocks. Model topologies are learned across groups of images, and one or more such topologies is linked to an object category (e.g. chairs). Fitting learned topologies to an image can be used to identify the object class, as well as detail its geometry. The latter goes beyond labeling objects, as it provides the geometric structure of particular instances. We learn the models using joint statistical inference over category parameters, camera parameters, and instance parameters. These produce an image likelihood through a statistical imaging model. We use trans-dimensional sampling to explore topology hypotheses, and alternate between Metropolis-Hastings and stochastic dynamics to explore instance parameters. Experiments on images of furniture objects such as tables and chairs suggest that this is an effective approach for learning models that encode simple representations of category geometry and the statistics thereof, and support inferring both category and geometry on held out single view images. 1</p><p>4 0.12449012 <a title="1-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-A_Parameter-free_Hedging_Algorithm.html">14 nips-2009-A Parameter-free Hedging Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Yoav Freund, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of decision-theoretic online learning (DTOL). Motivated by practical applications, we focus on DTOL when the number of actions is very large. Previous algorithms for learning in this framework have a tunable learning rate parameter, and a barrier to using online-learning in practical applications is that it is not understood how to set this parameter optimally, particularly when the number of actions is large. In this paper, we offer a clean solution by proposing a novel and completely parameter-free algorithm for DTOL. We introduce a new notion of regret, which is more natural for applications with a large number of actions. We show that our algorithm achieves good performance with respect to this new notion of regret; in addition, it also achieves performance close to that of the best bounds achieved by previous algorithms with optimally-tuned parameters, according to previous notions of regret. 1</p><p>5 0.11744203 <a title="1-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Thresholding_Procedures_for_High_Dimensional_Variable_Selection_and_Statistical_Estimation.html">245 nips-2009-Thresholding Procedures for High Dimensional Variable Selection and Statistical Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n ≪ p, we show that the multistep thresholding procedure can accurately estimate a sparse vector β ∈ Rp in a linear model, under the restricted eigenvalue conditions (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09). Thus our conditions for model selection consistency are considerably weaker than what has been achieved in previous works. More importantly, this method allows very signiﬁcant values of s, which is the number of non-zero elements in the true parameter. For example, it works for cases where the ordinary Lasso would have failed. Finally, we show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufﬁciently sparse, the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand` se Tao 07) achieves the ℓ2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level, while selecting a sufﬁciently sparse model. 1</p><p>6 0.10465228 <a title="1-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis%3A_Exact_Recovery_of_Corrupted_Low-Rank_Matrices_via_Convex_Optimization.html">208 nips-2009-Robust Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery of Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices via Convex Optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Liang Sun, Jun Liu, Jianhui Chen, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: We consider the reconstruction of sparse signals in the multiple measurement vector (MMV) model, in which the signal, represented as a matrix, consists of a set of jointly sparse vectors. MMV is an extension of the single measurement vector (SMV) model employed in standard compressive sensing (CS). Recent theoretical studies focus on the convex relaxation of the MMV problem based on the (2, 1)-norm minimization, which is an extension of the well-known 1-norm minimization employed in SMV. However, the resulting convex optimization problem in MMV is signiﬁcantly much more difﬁcult to solve than the one in SMV. Existing algorithms reformulate it as a second-order cone programming (SOCP) or semideﬁnite programming (SDP) problem, which is computationally expensive to solve for problems of moderate size. In this paper, we propose a new (dual) reformulation of the convex optimization problem in MMV and develop an efﬁcient algorithm based on the prox-method. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis reveals the close connection between the proposed reformulation and multiple kernel learning. Our simulation studies demonstrate the scalability of the proposed algorithm.</p><p>4 0.5225057 <a title="1-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_MAP_Estimation_via_the_Replica_Method_and_Compressed_Sensing.html">36 nips-2009-Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: The replica method is a non-rigorous but widely-accepted technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems. This paper applies the replica method to non-Gaussian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It is shown that with random linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the asymptotic behavior of the MAP estimate of an n-dimensional vector “decouples” as n scalar MAP estimators. The result is a counterpart to Guo and Verd´ ’s replica analysis of minimum mean-squared error estimation. u The replica MAP analysis can be readily applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, lasso, linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. In the case of lasso estimation the scalar estimator reduces to a soft-thresholding operator, and for zero normregularized estimation it reduces to a hard-threshold. Among other beneﬁts, the replica method provides a computationally-tractable method for exactly computing various performance metrics including mean-squared error and sparsity pattern recovery probability.</p><p>5 0.51925403 <a title="1-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis%3A_Exact_Recovery_of_Corrupted_Low-Rank_Matrices_via_Convex_Optimization.html">208 nips-2009-Robust Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery of Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices via Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: John Wright, Arvind Ganesh, Shankar Rao, Yigang Peng, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis is a fundamental operation in computational data analysis, with myriad applications ranging from web search to bioinformatics to computer vision and image analysis. However, its performance and applicability in real scenarios are limited by a lack of robustness to outlying or corrupted observations. This paper considers the idealized “robust principal component analysis” problem of recovering a low rank matrix A from corrupted observations D = A + E. Here, the corrupted entries E are unknown and the errors can be arbitrarily large (modeling grossly corrupted observations common in visual and bioinformatic data), but are assumed to be sparse. We prove that most matrices A can be efﬁciently and exactly recovered from most error sign-and-support patterns by solving a simple convex program, for which we give a fast and provably convergent algorithm. Our result holds even when the rank of A grows nearly proportionally (up to a logarithmic factor) to the dimensionality of the observation space and the number of errors E grows in proportion to the total number of entries in the matrix. A by-product of our analysis is the ﬁrst proportional growth results for the related problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a small fraction of its entries. Simulations and real-data examples corroborate the theoretical results, and suggest potential applications in computer vision. 1</p><p>6 0.50552642 <a title="1-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Graph_Zeta_Function_in_the_Bethe_Free_Energy_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">103 nips-2009-Graph Zeta Function in the Bethe Free Energy and Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicolas Vayatis, Marine Depecker, Stéphan J. Clémençcon</p><p>Abstract: The purpose of the paper is to explore the connection between multivariate homogeneity tests and AUC optimization. The latter problem has recently received much attention in the statistical learning literature. From the elementary observation that, in the two-sample problem setup, the null assumption corresponds to the situation where the area under the optimal ROC curve is equal to 1/2, we propose a two-stage testing method based on data splitting. A nearly optimal scoring function in the AUC sense is ﬁrst learnt from one of the two half-samples. Data from the remaining half-sample are then projected onto the real line and eventually ranked according to the scoring function computed at the ﬁrst stage. The last step amounts to performing a standard Mann-Whitney Wilcoxon test in the onedimensional framework. We show that the learning step of the procedure does not affect the consistency of the test as well as its properties in terms of power, provided the ranking produced is accurate enough in the AUC sense. The results of a numerical experiment are eventually displayed in order to show the efﬁciency of the method. 1</p><p>2 0.87234432 <a title="1-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-White_Functionals_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">257 nips-2009-White Functionals for Anomaly Detection in Dynamical Systems</a></p>

These methods are based on the inference of functionals whose evaluations on successive states visited by the process are stationary and have low autocorrelations. Deviations from this behavior are used to ﬂag anomalies. The candidate functionals are estimated in a subspace of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the original probability space considered.

<p>Author: Arnak Dalalyan, Renaud Keriven</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to the problem of robust estimation in multiview geometry. Inspired by recent advances in the sparse recovery problem of statistics, we deﬁne our estimator as a Bayesian maximum a posteriori with multivariate Laplace prior on the vector describing the outliers. This leads to an estimator in which the ﬁdelity to the data is measured by the L∞ -norm while the regularization is done by the L1 -norm. The proposed procedure is fairly fast since the outlier removal is done by solving one linear program (LP). An important difference compared to existing algorithms is that for our estimator it is not necessary to specify neither the number nor the proportion of the outliers. We present strong theoretical results assessing the accuracy of our procedure, as well as a numerical example illustrating its efﬁciency on real data. 1</p><p>4 0.80903423 <a title="1-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Time-Varying_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">246 nips-2009-Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Mladen Kolar, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks are a favored formalism for modeling the dependency structures in complex multivariate systems such as those encountered in biology and neural science. When a system is undergoing dynamic transformation, temporally rewiring networks are needed for capturing the dynamic causal inﬂuences between covariates. In this paper, we propose time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) for modeling the structurally varying directed dependency structures underlying non-stationary biological/neural time series. This is a challenging problem due the non-stationarity and sample scarcity of time series data. We present a kernel reweighted 1 -regularized auto-regressive procedure for this problem which enjoys nice properties such as computational efﬁciency and provable asymptotic consistency. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst practical and statistically sound method for structure learning of TVDBNs. We applied TV-DBNs to time series measurements during yeast cell cycle and brain response to visual stimuli. In both cases, TV-DBNs reveal interesting dynamics underlying the respective biological systems. 1</p><p>5 0.80694962 <a title="1-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Kernel_Choice_and_Classifiability_for_RKHS_Embeddings_of_Probability_Distributions.html">118 nips-2009-Kernel Choice and Classifiability for RKHS Embeddings of Probability Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kenji Fukumizu, Arthur Gretton, Gert R. Lanckriet, Bernhard Schölkopf, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: Embeddings of probability measures into reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces have been proposed as a straightforward and practical means of representing and comparing probabilities. In particular, the distance between embeddings (the maximum mean discrepancy, or MMD) has several key advantages over many classical metrics on distributions, namely easy computability, fast convergence and low bias of ﬁnite sample estimates. An important requirement of the embedding RKHS is that it be characteristic: in this case, the MMD between two distributions is zero if and only if the distributions coincide. Three new results on the MMD are introduced in the present study. First, it is established that MMD corresponds to the optimal risk of a kernel classiﬁer, thus forming a natural link between the distance between distributions and their ease of classiﬁcation. An important consequence is that a kernel must be characteristic to guarantee classiﬁability between distributions in the RKHS. Second, the class of characteristic kernels is broadened to incorporate all strictly positive deﬁnite kernels: these include non-translation invariant kernels and kernels on non-compact domains. Third, a generalization of the MMD is proposed for families of kernels, as the supremum over MMDs on a class of kernels (for instance the Gaussian kernels with different bandwidths). This extension is necessary to obtain a single distance measure if a large selection or class of characteristic kernels is potentially appropriate. This generalization is reasonable, given that it corresponds to the problem of learning the kernel by minimizing the risk of the corresponding kernel classiﬁer. The generalized MMD is shown to have consistent ﬁnite sample estimates, and its performance is demonstrated on a homogeneity testing example. 1</p><p>6 0.80472261 <a title="1-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>

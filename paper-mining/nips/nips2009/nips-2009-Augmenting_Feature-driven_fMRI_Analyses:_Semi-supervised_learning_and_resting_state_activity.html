<p>Author: Shuai Huang, Jing Li, Liang Sun, Jun Liu, Teresa Wu, Kewei Chen, Adam Fleisher, Eric Reiman, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques provide great potentials for effective diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Previous studies have shown that AD is closely related to the alternation in the functional brain network, i.e., the functional connectivity among different brain regions. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging, which holds great promise for identifying image-based markers used to distinguish Normal Controls (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with AD. More specifically, we study sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), also known as exploratory Gaussian graphical models, for brain connectivity modeling. In particular, we apply SICE to learn and analyze functional brain connectivity patterns from different subject groups, based on a key property of SICE, called the “monotone property” we established in this paper. Our experimental results on neuroimaging PET data of 42 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects reveal several interesting connectivity patterns consistent with literature findings, and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD. 1 In trod u cti on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. It is the most common form of dementia and currently affects over five million Americans; this number will grow to as many as 14 million by year 2050. The current knowledge about the cause of AD is very limited; clinical diagnosis is imprecise with definite diagnosis only possible by autopsy; also, there is currently no cure for AD, while most drugs only alleviate the symptoms. To tackle these challenging issues, the rapidly advancing neuroimaging techniques provide great potentials. These techniques, such as MRI, PET, and fMRI, produce data (images) of brain structure and function, making it possible to identify the difference between AD and normal brains. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuroimaging data provide more sensitive and consistent measures of AD onset and progression than conventional clinical assessment and neuropsychological tests [1]. Recent studies have found that AD is closely related to the alternation in the functional brain network, i.e., the functional connectivity among different brain regions [ 2]-[3]. Specifically, it has been shown that functional connectivity substantially decreases between the hippocampus and other regions of AD brains [3]-[4]. Also, some studies have found increased connectivity between the regions in the frontal lobe [ 6]-[7]. Learning functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging data holds great promise for identifying image-based markers used to distinguish among AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and normal aging. Note that MCI is a transition stage from normal aging to AD. Understanding and precise diagnosis of MCI have significant clinical value since it can serve as an early warning sign of AD. Despite all these, existing research in functional brain connectivity modeling suffers from limitations. A large body of functional connectivity modeling has been based on correlation analysis [2]-[3], [5]. However, correlation only captures pairwise information and fails to provide a complete account for the interaction of many (more than two) brain regions. Other multivariate statistical methods have also been used, such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [8], PCA-based Scaled Subprofile Model [9], Independent Component Analysis [10]-[11], and Partial Least Squares [12]-[13], which group brain regions into latent components. The brain regions within each component are believed to have strong connectivity, while the connectivity between components is weak. One major drawback of these methods is that the latent components may not correspond to any biological entities, causing difficulty in interpretation. In addition, graphical models have been used to study brain connectivity, such as structural equation models [14]-[15], dynamic causal models [16], and Granger causality. However, most of these approaches are confirmative, rather than exploratory, in the sense that they require a prior model of brain connectivity to begin with. This makes them inadequate for studying AD brain connectivity, because there is little prior knowledge about which regions should be involved and how they are connected. This makes exploratory models highly desirable. In this paper, we study sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), also known as exploratory Gaussian graphical models, for brain connectivity modeling. Inverse covariance matrix has a clear interpretation that the off-diagonal elements correspond to partial correlations, i.e., the correlation between each pair of brain regions given all other regions. This provides a much better model for brain connectivity than simple correlation analysis which models each pair of regions without considering other regions. Also, imposing sparsity on the inverse covariance estimation ensures a reliable brain connectivity to be modeled with limited sample size, which is usually the case in AD studies since clinical samples are difficult to obtain. From a domain perspective, imposing sparsity is also valid because neurological findings have demonstrated that a brain region usually only directly interacts with a few other brain regions in neurological processes [ 2]-[3]. Various algorithms for achieving SICE have been developed in recent year [ 17]-[22]. In addition, SICE has been used in various applications [17], [21], [23]-[26]. In this paper, we apply SICE to learn functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging and analyze the difference among AD, MCI, and NC based on a key property of SICE, called the “monotone property” we established in this paper. Unlike the previous study which is based on a specific level of sparsity [26], the monotone property allows us to study the connectivity pattern using different levels of sparsity and obtain an order for the strength of connection between pairs of brain regions. In addition, we apply bootstrap hypothesis testing to assess the significance of the connection. Our experimental results on PET data of 42 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project reveal several interesting connectivity patterns consistent with literature findings, and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD. 2 S ICE : B ack grou n d an d th e Mon oton e P rop erty An inverse covariance matrix can be represented graphically. If used to represent brain connectivity, the nodes are activated brain regions; existence of an arc between two nodes means that the two brain regions are closely related in the brain's functiona l process. Let be all the brain regions under study. We assume that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance matrix . Let be the inverse covariance matrix. Suppose we have samples (e.g., subjects with AD) for these brain regions. Note that we will only illustrate here the SICE for AD, whereas the SICE for MCI and NC can be achieved in a similar way. We can formulate the SICE into an optimization problem, i.e., (1) where is the sample covariance matrix; , , and denote the determinant, trace, and sum of the absolute values of all elements of a matrix, respectively. The part “ ” in (1) is the log-likelihood, whereas the part “ ” represents the “sparsity” of the inverse covariance matrix . (1) aims to achieve a tradeoff between the likelihood fit of the inverse covariance estimate and the sparsity. The tradeoff is controlled by , called the regularization parameter; larger will result in more sparse estimate for . The formulation in (1) follows the same line of the -norm regularization, which has been introduced into the least squares formulation to achieve model sparsity and the resulting model is called Lasso [27]. We employ the algorithm in [19] in this paper. Next, we show that with going from small to large, the resulting brain connectivity models have a monotone property. Before introducing the monotone property, the following definitions are needed. Definition: In the graphical representation of the inverse covariance, if node to by an arc, then is called a “neighbor” of . If is connected to chain of arcs, then is called a “connectivity component” of . is connected though some Intuitively, being neighbors means that two nodes (i.e., brain regions) are directly connected, whereas being connectivity components means that two brain regions are indirectly connected, i.e., the connection is mediated through other regions. In other words, not being connectivity components (i.e., two nodes completely separated in the graph) means that the two corresponding brain regions are completely independent of each other. Connectivity components have the following monotone property: Monotone property of SICE: Let components of with and and be the sets of all the connectivity , respectively. If , then . Intuitively, if two regions are connected (either directly or indirectly) at one level of sparseness ( ), they will be connected at all lower levels of sparseness ( ). Proof of the monotone property can be found in the supplementary file [29]. This monotone property can be used to identify how strongly connected each node (brain region) to its connectivity components. For example, assuming that and , this means that is more strongly connected to than . Thus, by changing from small to large, we can obtain an order for the strength of connection between pairs of brain regions. As will be shown in Section 3, this order is different among AD, MCI, and NC. 3 3.1 Ap p l i cati on i n B rai n Con n ecti vi ty M od el i n g of AD D a t a a c q u i s i t i o n a n d p re p ro c e s s i n g We apply SICE on FDG-PET images for 49 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects downloaded from the ADNI website. We apply Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) [28] to extract data from each of the 116 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI), and derived average of each AVOI for every subject. The AVOIs represent different regions of the whole brain. 3.2 B r a i n c o n n e c t i v i t y mo d e l i n g b y S I C E 42 AVOIs are selected for brain connectivity modeling, as they are considered to be potentially related to AD. These regions distribute in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Table 1 list of the names of the AVOIs with their corresponding lobes. The number before each AVOI is used to index the node in the connectivity models. We apply the SICE algorithm to learn one connectivity model for AD, one for MCI, and one for NC, for a given . With different ’s, the resulting connectivity models hold a monotone property, which can help obtain an order for the strength of connection between brain regions. To show the order clearly, we develop a tree-like plot in Fig. 1, which is for the AD group. To generate this plot, we start at a very small value (i.e., the right-most of the horizontal axis), which results in a fully-connected connectivity model. A fully-connected connectivity model is one that contains no region disconnected with the rest of the brain. Then, we decrease by small steps and record the order of the regions disconnected with the rest of the brain regions.

As decreases below (but still above ), the rest of the brain further divides into three disconnected clusters, including the cluster of “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L”, the cluster of “Fusiform_R” up to “Hippocampus_L”, and the cluster of the other regions. As continuously decreases, each current cluster will split into smaller clusters; eventually, when reaches a very large value, there will be no arc in the IC model, i.e., each region is now a cluster of itself and the split will stop. The sequence of the splitting gives an order for the strength of connection between brain regions. Specifically, the earlier (i.e., smaller ) a region or a cluster of regions becomes disconnected from the rest of the brain, the weaker it is connected with the rest of the brain. For example, in Fig. 1, it can be known that “Tempora_Sup_L” may be the weakest region in the brain network of AD; the second weakest ones are the cluster of “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L”, and the cluster of “Fusiform_R” up to “Hippocampus_L”. It is very interesting to see that the weakest and second weakest brain regions in the brain network include “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L” as well as regions all in the temporal lobe, all of which have been found to be affected by AD early and severely [3]-[5]. Next, to facilitate the comparison between AD and NC, a tree-like plot is also constructed for NC, as shown in Fig. 2. By comparing the plots for AD and NC, we can observe the following two distinct phenomena: First, in AD, between-lobe connectivity tends to be weaker than within-lobe connectivity. This can be seen from Fig. 1 which shows a clear pattern that the lobes become disconnected with each other before the regions within each lobe become disconnected with each other, as goes from small to large. This pattern does not show in Fig. 2 for NC. Second, the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in AD than in NC. This can be seen from Fig. 2 for NC, in which the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are still connected even at a very large for NC. However, this pattern does not show in Fig. 1 for AD. Furthermore, a tree-like plot is also constructed for MCI (Fig. 3), and compared with the plots for AD and NC. In terms of the two phenomena discussed previously, MCI shows similar patterns to AD, but these patterns are not as distinct from NC as AD. Specifically, in terms of the first phenomenon, MCI also shows weaker between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity, which is similar to AD. However, the degree of weakerness is not as distinctive as AD. For example, a few regions in the temporal lobe of MCI, including “Temporal_Mid_R” and “Temporal_Sup_R”, appear to be more strongly connected with the occipital lobe than with other regions in the temporal lobe. In terms of the second phenomenon, MCI also shows weaker between-hemisphere connectivity in the same brain region than NC. However, the degree of weakerness is not as distinctive as AD. For example, several left-right pairs of the same brain regions are still connected even at a very large , such as “Rectus_R” and “Rectus_L”, “Frontal_Mid_Orb_R” and “Frontal_Mid_Orb _L”, “Parietal_Sup_R” and “Parietal_Sup_L”, as well as “Precuneus_R” and “Precuneus_L”. All above findings are consistent with the knowledge that MCI is a transition stage between normal aging and AD. Large λ λ3 λ2 λ1 Small λ Fig 1: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of AD Large λ Small λ Fig 2: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of NC Fig 3: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of MCI Furthermore, we would like to compare how within-lobe and between-lobe connectivity is different across AD, MCI, and NC. To achieve this, we first learn one connectivity model for AD, one for MCI, and one for NC. We adjust the in the learning of each model such that the three models, corresponding to AD, MCI, and NC, respectively, will have the same total number of arcs. This is to “normalize” the models, so that the comparison will be more focused on how the arcs distribute differently across different models. By selecting different values for the total number of arcs, we can obtain models representing the brain connectivity at different levels of strength. Specifically, given a small value for the total number of arcs, only strong arcs will show up in the resulting connectivity model, so the model is a model of strong brain connectivity; when increasing the total number of arcs, mild arcs will also show up in the resulting connectivity model, so the model is a model of mild and strong brain connectivity. For example, Fig. 4 shows the connectivity models for AD, MCI, and NC with the total number of arcs equal to 50 (Fig. 4(a)), 120 (Fig. 4(b)), and 180 (Fig. 4(c)). In this paper, we use a “matrix” representation for the SICE of a connectivity model. In the matrix, each row represents one node and each column also represents one node. Please see Table 1 for the correspondence between the numbering of the nodes and the brain region each number represents. The matrix contains black and white cells: a black cell at the -th row, -th column of the matrix represents existence of an arc between nodes and in the SICE-based connectivity model, whereas a white cell represents absence of an arc. According to this definition, the total number of black cells in the matrix is equal to twice the total number of arcs in the SICE-based connectivity model. Moreover, on each matrix, four red cubes are used to highlight the brain regions in each of the four lobes; that is, from top-left to bottom-right, the red cubes highlight the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, respectively. The black cells inside each red cube reflect within-lobe connectivity, whereas the black cells outside the cubes reflect between-lobe connectivity. While the connectivity models in Fig. 4 clearly show some connectivity difference between AD, MCI, and NC, it is highly desirable to test if the observed difference is statistically significant. Therefore, we further perform a hypothesis testing and the results are summarized in Table 2. Specifically, a P-value is recorded in the sub-table if it is smaller than 0.1, such a P-value is further highlighted if it is even smaller than 0.05; a “---” indicates that the corresponding test is not significant (P-value>0.1). We can observe from Fig. 4 and Table 2: Within-lobe connectivity: The temporal lobe of AD has significantly less connectivity than NC. This is true across different strength levels (e.g., strong, mild, and weak) of the connectivity; in other words, even the connectivity between some strongly-connected brain regions in the temporal lobe may be disrupted by AD. In particular, it is clearly from Fig. 4(b) that the regions “Hippocampus” and “ParaHippocampal” (numbered by 39-42, located at the right-bottom corner of Fig. 4(b)) are much more separated from other regions in AD than in NC. The decrease in connectivity in the temporal lobe of AD, especially between the Hippocampus and other regions, has been extensively reported in the literature [3]-[5]. Furthermore, the temporal lobe of MCI does not show a significant decrease in connectivity, compared with NC. This may be because MCI does not disrupt the temporal lobe as badly as AD. AD MCI NC Fig 4(a): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 50) AD MCI NC Fig 4(b): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 120) AD MCI NC Fig 4(c): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 180) The frontal lobe of AD has significantly more connectivity than NC, which is true across different strength levels of the connectivity. This has been interpreted as compensatory reallocation or recruitment of cognitive resources [6]-[7]. Because the regions in the frontal lobe are typically affected later in the course of AD (our data are early AD), the increased connectivity in the frontal lobe may help preserve some cognitive functions in AD patients. Furthermore, the frontal lobe of MCI does not show a significant increase in connectivity, compared with NC. This indicates that the compensatory effect in MCI brain may not be as strong as that in AD brains. Table 2: P-values from the statistical significance test of connectivity difference among AD, MCI, and NC (a) Total number of arcs = 50 (b) Total number of arcs = 120 (c) Total number of arcs = 180 There is no significant difference among AD, MCI, and NC in terms of the connectivity within the parietal lobe and within the occipital lobe. Another interesting finding is that all the P-values in the third sub-table of Table 2(a) are insignificant. This implies that distribution of the strong connectivity within and between lobes for MCI is very similar to NC; in other words, MCI has not been able to disrupt the strong connectivity among brain regions (it disrupts some mild and weak connectivity though). Between-lobe connectivity: In general, human brains tend to have less between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity. A majority of the strong connectivity occurs within lobes, but rarely between lobes. These can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 (especially Fig. 4(a)) in which there are much more black cells along the diagonal direction than the off-diagonal direction, regardless of AD, MCI, and NC. The connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes of AD is significantly more than NC which is true especially for mild and weak connectivity. The increased connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes of AD has been previously reported in [3]. It is also interpreted as a compensatory effect in [6]-[7]. Furthermore, MCI also shows increased connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes, compared with NC, but the increase is not as significant as AD. While the connectivity between the frontal and occipital lobes shows little difference between AD and NC, such connectivity for MCI shows a significant decrease especially for mild and weak connectivity. Also, AD may have less temporal-occipital connectivity, less frontal-parietal connectivity, but more parietal-temporal connectivity than NC. Between-hemisphere connectivity: Recall that we have observed from the tree-like plots in Figs. 3 and 4 that the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in AD than in NC. It is desirable to test if this observed difference is statistically significant. To achieve this, we test the statistical significance of the difference among AD, MCI, and NC, in term of the number of connected same-region left-right pairs. Results show that when the total number of arcs in the connectivity models is equal to 120 or 90, none of the tests is significant. However, when the total number of arcs is equal to 50, the P-values of the tests for “AD vs. NC”, “AD vs. MCI”, and “MCI vs. NC” are 0.009, 0.004, and 0.315, respectively. We further perform tests for the total number of arcs equal to 30 and find the P-values to be 0. 0055, 0.053, and 0.158, respectively. These results indicate that AD disrupts the strong connectivity between the same regions of the left and right hemispheres, whereas this disruption is not significant in MCI. 4 Con cl u si on In the paper, we applied SICE to model functional brain connectivity of AD, MCI, and NC based on PET neuroimaging data, and analyze the patterns based on the monotone property of SICE. Our findings were consistent with the previous literature and also showed some new aspects that may suggest further investigation in brain connectivity research in the future.

<p>Author: Barry Chai, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we present a new method for establishing fMRI pattern-based functional connectivity between brain regions by estimating their multivariate mutual information. Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to ﬁnd strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.</p><p>4 0.18906213 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Discriminative_Network_Models_of_Schizophrenia.html">70 nips-2009-Discriminative Network Models of Schizophrenia</a></p>

Cecchi</p><p>Abstract: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that has eluded a characterization in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity, and is hypothesized to affect the collective, “emergent” working of the brain. We propose a novel data-driven approach to capture emergent features using functional brain networks [4] extracted from fMRI data, and demonstrate its advantage over traditional region-of-interest (ROI) and local, task-speciﬁc linear activation analyzes. Our results suggest that schizophrenia is indeed associated with disruption of global brain properties related to its functioning as a network, which cannot be explained by alteration of local activation patterns. Moreover, further exploitation of interactions by sparse Markov Random Field classiﬁers shows clear gain over linear methods, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM, allowing to reach 86% accuracy (over 50% baseline - random guess), which is quite remarkable given that it is based on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task. 1</p><p>5 0.1888914 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Analysis_of_Semi-Supervised_Learning%3A_The_Limit_of_Infinite_Unlabelled_Data.html">229 nips-2009-Statistical Analysis of Semi-Supervised Learning: The Limit of Infinite Unlabelled Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Nathan Srebro, Xueyuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for SemiSupervised Learning at the regime of a ﬁxed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in Rd , d 2, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the “smoothness” assumptions associated with this alternate method. 1 Introduction and Setup In this paper we consider the limit behavior of two popular semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the graph Laplacian: the regularization approach [15] and the spectral approach [3]. We consider the limit when the number of labeled points is ﬁxed and the number of unlabeled points goes to inﬁnity. This is a natural limit for SSL as the basic SSL scenario is one in which unlabeled data is virtually inﬁnite. We can also think of this limit as “perfect” SSL, having full knowledge of the marginal density p(x). The premise of SSL is that the marginal density p(x) is informative about the unknown mapping y(x) we are trying to learn, e.g. since y(x) is expected to be “smooth” in some sense relative to p(x). Studying the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit, where p(x) is fully known, allows us to formulate and understand the underlying smoothness assumptions of a particular SSL method, and judge whether it is well-posed and sensible. Understanding the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit is also a necessary ﬁrst step to studying the convergence of the ﬁnite-labeled-data estimator. We consider the following setup: Let p(x) be an unknown smooth density on a compact domain Ω ⊂ Rd with a smooth boundary. Let y : Ω → Y be the unknown function we wish to estimate. In case of regression Y = R whereas in binary classiﬁcation Y = {−1, 1}. The standard (transductive) semisupervised learning problem is formulated as follows: Given l labeled points, (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ), with yi = y(xi ), and u unlabeled points xl+1 , . . . , xl+u , with all points xi sampled i.i.d. from p(x), the goal is to construct an estimate of y(xl+i ) for any unlabeled point xl+i , utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled points. We denote the total number of points by n = l + u. We are interested in the regime where l is ﬁxed and u → ∞. 1 2 SSL with Graph Laplacian Regularization We ﬁrst consider the following graph-based approach formulated by Zhu et. al. [15]: y (x) = arg min In (y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l y where 1 n2 In (y) = Wi,j (y(xi ) − y(xj ))2 (1) (2) i,j is a Laplacian regularization term enforcing “smoothness” with respect to the n×n similarity matrix W . This formulation has several natural interpretations in terms of, e.g. random walks and electrical circuits [15]. These interpretations, however, refer to a ﬁxed graph, over a ﬁnite set of points with given similarities. In contrast, our focus here is on the more typical scenario where the points xi ∈ Rd are a random sample from a density p(x), and W is constructed based on this sample. We would like to understand the behavior of the method in terms of the density p(x), particularly in the limit where the number of unlabeled points grows. Under what assumptions on the target labeling y(x) and on the density p(x) is the method (1) sensible? The answer, of course, depends on how the matrix W is constructed. We consider the common situation where the similarities are obtained by applying some decay ﬁlter to the distances: xi −xj σ Wi,j = G (3) where G : R+ → R+ is some function with an adequately fast decay. Popular choices are the 2 Gaussian ﬁlter G(z) = e−z /2 or the ǫ-neighborhood graph obtained by the step ﬁlter G(z) = 1z<1 . For simplicity, we focus here on the formulation (1) where the solution is required to satisfy the constraints at the labeled points exactly. In practice, the hard labeling constraints are often replaced with a softer loss-based data term, which is balanced against the smoothness term In (y), e.g. [14, 6]. Our analysis and conclusions apply to such variants as well. Limit of the Laplacian Regularization Term As the number of unlabeled examples grows the regularization term (2) converges to its expectation, where the summation is replaced by integration w.r.t. the density p(x): lim In (y) = I (σ) (y) = n→∞ G Ω Ω x−x′ σ (y(x) − y(x′ ))2 p(x)p(x′ )dxdx′ . (4) In the above limit, the bandwidth σ is held ﬁxed. Typically, one would also drive the bandwidth σ to zero as n → ∞. There are two reasons for this choice. First, from a practical perspective, this makes the similarity matrix W sparse so it can be stored and processed. Second, from a theoretical perspective, this leads to a clear and well deﬁned limit of the smoothness regularization term In (y), at least when σ → 0 slowly enough1 , namely when σ = ω( d log n/n). If σ → 0 as n → ∞, and as long as nσ d / log n → ∞, then after appropriate normalization, the regularizer converges to a density weighted gradient penalty term [7, 8]: d lim d+2 In (y) n→∞ Cσ (σ) d (y) d+2 I σ→0 Cσ = lim ∇y(x) 2 p(x)2 dx = J(y) = (5) Ω where C = Rd z 2 G( z )dz, and assuming 0 < C < ∞ (which is the case for both the Gaussian and the step ﬁlters). This energy functional J(f ) therefore encodes the notion of “smoothness” with respect to p(x) that is the basis of the SSL formulation (1) with the graph constructions speciﬁed by (3). To understand the behavior and appropriateness of (1) we must understand this functional and the associated limit problem: y (x) = arg min J(y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l (6) y p When σ = o( d 1/n) then all non-diagonal weights Wi,j vanish (points no longer have any “close by” p neighbors). We are not aware of an analysis covering the regime where σ decays roughly as d 1/n, but would be surprised if a qualitatively different meaningful limit is reached. 1 2 3 Graph Laplacian Regularization in R1 We begin by considering the solution of (6) for one dimensional data, i.e. d = 1 and x ∈ R. We ﬁrst consider the situation where the support of p(x) is a continuous interval Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R (a and/or b may be inﬁnite). Without loss of generality, we assume the labeled data is sorted in increasing order a x1 < x2 < · · · < xl b. Applying the theory of variational calculus, the solution y (x) ˆ satisﬁes inside each interval (xi , xi+1 ) the Euler-Lagrange equation d dy p2 (x) = 0. dx dx Performing two integrations and enforcing the constraints at the labeled points yields y(x) = yi + x 1/p2 (t)dt xi (yi+1 xi+1 1/p2 (t)dt xi − yi ) for xi x xi+1 (7) with y(x) = x1 for a x x1 and y(x) = xl for xl x b. If the support of p(x) is a union of disjoint intervals, the above analysis and the form of the solution applies in each interval separately. The solution (7) seems reasonable and desirable from the point of view of the “smoothness” assumptions: when p(x) is uniform, the solution interpolates linearly between labeled data points, whereas across low-density regions, where p(x) is close to zero, y(x) can change abruptly. Furthermore, the regularizer J(y) can be interpreted as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) squared semi-norm, giving us additional insight into this choice of regularizer: b 1 Theorem 1. Let p(x) be a smooth density on Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R such that Ap = 4 a 1/p2 (t)dt < ∞. 2 Then, J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm J(f ) = f Kp induced by the kernel x′ ′ Kp (x, x ) = Ap − 1 2 x with a null-space of all constant functions. That is, f the RKHS induced by Kp . 1 p2 (t) dt Kp . (8) is the norm of the projection of f onto If p(x) is supported on several disjoint intervals, Ω = ∪i [ai , bi ], then J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm induced by the kernel 1 bi dt 4 ai p2 (t) ′ Kp (x, x ) = − 1 2 x′ dt x p2 (t) if x, x′ ∈ [ai , bi ] (9) if x ∈ [ai , bi ], x′ ∈ [aj , bj ], i = j 0 with a null-space spanned by indicator functions 1[ai ,bi ] (x) on the connected components of Ω. Proof. For any f (x) = i αi Kp (x, xi ) in the RKHS induced by Kp : df dx J(f ) = 2 p2 (x)dx = αi αj Jij (10) i,j where Jij = d d Kp (x, xi ) Kp (x, xj )p2 (x)dx dx dx When xi and xj are in different connected components of Ω, the gradients of Kp (·, xi ) and Kp (·, xj ) are never non-zero together and Jij = 0 = Kp (xi , xj ). When they are in the same connected component [a, b], and assuming w.l.o.g. a xi xj b: Jij = = xi 1 4 1 4 a b a 1 dt + p2 (t) 1 1 dt − p2 (t) 2 xj xi xj xi −1 dt + p2 (t) xj 1 dt p2 (t) 1 dt = Kp (xi , xj ). p2 (t) Substituting Jij = Kp (xi , xj ) into (10) yields J(f ) = 3 b αi αj Kp (xi , xj ) = f (11) Kp . Combining Theorem 1 with the Representer Theorem [13] establishes that the solution of (6) (or of any variant where the hard constraints are replaced by a data term) is of the form: l y(x) = αj Kp (x, xj ) + βi 1[ai ,bi ] (x), j=1 i where i ranges over the connected components [ai , bi ] of Ω, and we have: l J(y) = αi αj Kp (xi , xj ). (12) i,j=1 Viewing the regularizer as y 2 p suggests understanding (6), and so also its empirical approximaK tion (1), by interpreting Kp (x, x′ ) as a density-based “similarity measure” between x and x′ . This similarity measure indeed seems sensible: for a uniform density it is simply linearly decreasing as a function of the distance. When the density is non-uniform, two points are relatively similar only if they are connected by a region in which 1/p2 (x) is low, i.e. the density is high, but are much less “similar”, i.e. related to each other, when connected by a low-density region. Furthermore, there is no dependence between points in disjoint components separated by zero density regions. 4 Graph Laplacian Regularization in Higher Dimensions The analysis of the previous section seems promising, at it shows that in one dimension, the SSL method (1) is well posed and converges to a sensible limit. Regretfully, in higher dimensions this is not the case anymore. In the following theorem we show that the inﬁmum of the limit problem (6) is zero and can be obtained by a sequence of functions which are certainly not a sensible extrapolation of the labeled points. Theorem 2. Let p(x) be a smooth density over Rd , d 2, bounded from above by some constant pmax , and let (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ) be any (non-repeating) set of labeled examples. There exist continuous functions yǫ (x), for any ǫ > 0, all satisfying the constraints yǫ (xj ) = yj , j = 1, . . . , l, such ǫ→0 ǫ→0 that J(yǫ ) −→ 0 but yǫ (x) −→ 0 for all x = xj , j = 1, . . . , l. Proof. We present a detailed proof for the case of l = 2 labeled points. The generalization of the proof to more labeled points is straightforward. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we assume the ﬁrst labeled point is at x0 = 0 with y(x0 ) = 0 and the second labeled point is at x1 with x1 = 1 and y(x1 ) = 1. In addition, we assume that the ball B1 (0) of radius one centered around the origin is contained in Ω = {x ∈ Rd | p(x) > 0}. We ﬁrst consider the case d > 2. Here, for any ǫ > 0, consider the function x ǫ yǫ (x) = min ,1 which indeed satisﬁes the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1. Then, J(yǫ ) = Bǫ (0) p2 (x) dx ǫ2 pmax ǫ2 dx = p2 Vd ǫd−2 max (13) Bǫ (0) where Vd is the volume of a unit ball in Rd . Hence, the sequence of functions yǫ (x) satisfy the constraints, but for d > 2, inf ǫ J(yǫ ) = 0. For d = 2, a more extreme example is necessary: consider the functions 2 x yǫ (x) = log +ǫ ǫ log 1+ǫ ǫ for x 1 and yǫ (x) = 1 for x > 1. These functions satisfy the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1 and: J(yǫ ) = 4 h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ 4πp2 max h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ x B1 (0) log ( x 1+ǫ ǫ 2 2 +ǫ)2 p2 (x)dx 4p2 h “ max ”i2 1+ǫ log ǫ 4πp2 max ǫ→0 = −→ 0. log 1+ǫ ǫ 4 1 0 r2 (r 2 +ǫ)2 2πrdr The implication of Theorem 2 is that regardless of the values at the labeled points, as u → ∞, the solution of (1) is not well posed. Asymptotically, the solution has the form of an almost everywhere constant function, with highly localized spikes near the labeled points, and so no learning is performed. In particular, an interpretation in terms of a density-based kernel Kp , as in the onedimensional case, is not possible. Our analysis also carries over to a formulation where a loss-based data term replaces the hard label constraints, as in l 1 y = arg min ˆ (y(xj ) − yj )2 + γIn (y) y(x) l j=1 In the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, functions of the form yǫ (x) above have a zero data penalty term (since they exactly match the labels) and also drive the regularization term J(y) to zero. Hence, it is possible to drive the entire objective functional (the data term plus the regularization term) to zero with functions that do not generalize at all to unlabeled points. 4.1 Numerical Example We illustrate the phenomenon detailed by Theorem 2 with a simple example. Consider a density p(x) in R2 , which is a mixture of two unit variance spherical Gaussians, one per class, centered at the origin and at (4, 0). We sample a total of n = 3000 points, and label two points from each of the two components (four total). We then construct a similarity matrix using a Gaussian ﬁlter with σ = 0.4. Figure 1 depicts the predictor y (x) obtained from (1). In fact, two different predictors are shown, ˆ obtained by different numerical methods for solving (1). Both methods are based on the observation that the solution y (x) of (1) satisﬁes: ˆ n y (xi ) = ˆ n Wij y (xj ) / ˆ j=1 Wij on all unlabeled points i = l + 1, . . . , l + u. (14) j=1 Combined with the constraints of (1), we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved by Gaussian elimination (here invoked through MATLAB’s backslash operator). This is the method used in the top panels of Figure 1. Alternatively, (14) can be viewed as an update equation for y (xi ), ˆ which can be solved via the power method, or label propagation [2, 6]: start with zero labels on the unlabeled points and iterate (14), while keeping the known labels on x1 , . . . , xl . This is the method used in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As predicted, y (x) is almost constant for almost all unlabeled points. Although all values are very ˆ close to zero, thresholding at the “right” threshold does actually produce sensible results in terms of the true -1/+1 labels. However, beyond being inappropriate for regression, a very ﬂat predictor is still problematic even from a classiﬁcation perspective. First, it is not possible to obtain a meaningful conﬁdence measure for particular labels. Second, especially if the size of each class is not known apriori, setting the threshold between the positive and negative classes is problematic. In our example, setting the threshold to zero yields a generalization error of 45%. The differences between the two numerical methods for solving (1) also point out to another problem with the ill-posedness of the limit problem: the solution is numerically very un-stable. A more quantitative evaluation, that also validates that the effect in Figure 1 is not a result of choosing a “wrong” bandwidth σ, is given in Figure 2. We again simulated data from a mixture of two Gaussians, one Gaussian per class, this time in 20 dimensions, with one labeled point per class, and an increasing number of unlabeled points. In Figure 2 we plot the squared error, and the classiﬁcation error of the resulting predictor y (x). We plot the classiﬁcation error both when a threshold ˆ of zero is used (i.e. the class is determined by sign(ˆ(x))) and with the ideal threshold minimizing y the test error. For each unlabeled sample size, we choose the bandwidth σ yielding the best test performance (this is a “cheating” approach which provides a lower bound on the error of the best method for selecting the bandwidth). As the number of unlabeled examples increases the squared error approaches 1, indicating a ﬂat predictor. Using a threshold of zero leads to an increase in the classiﬁcation error, possibly due to numerical instability. Interestingly, although the predictors become very ﬂat, the classiﬁcation error using the ideal threshold actually improves slightly.

For each error measure and sample size, the bandwidth minimizing the test error was used, and is plotted. ideal classiﬁcation performance is achieved with a signiﬁcantly larger bandwidth than the bandwidth minimizing the squared loss, i.e. when the predictor is even ﬂatter. 4.2 Probabilistic Interpretation, Exit and Hitting Times As mentioned above, the Laplacian regularization method (1) has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of a random walk on the weighted graph. Let x(t) denote a random walk on the graph with transition matrix M = D−1 W where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij . Then, for the binary classiﬁcation case with yi = ±1 we have [15]: y (xi ) = 2 Pr x(t) hits a point labeled +1 before hitting a point labeled -1 x(0) = xi − 1 ˆ We present an interpretation of our analysis in terms of the limiting properties of this random walk. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the two classes are separated by a low density region. Then, the random walk has two intrinsic quantities of interest. The ﬁrst is the mean exit time from one cluster to the other, and the other is the mean hitting time to the labeled points in that cluster. As the number of unlabeled points increases and σ → 0, the random walk converges to a diffusion process [12]. While the mean exit time then converges to a ﬁnite value corresponding to its diffusion analogue, the hitting time to a labeled point increases to inﬁnity (as these become absorbing boundaries of measure zero). With more and more unlabeled data the random walk will fully mix, forgetting where it started, before it hits any label. Thus, the probability of hitting +1 before −1 will become uniform across the entire graph, independent of the starting location xi , yielding a ﬂat predictor. 5 Keeping σ Finite At this point, a reader may ask whether the problems found in higher dimensions are due to taking the limit σ → 0. One possible objection is that there is an intrinsic characteristic scale for the data σ0 where (with high probability) all points at a distance xi − xj < σ0 have the same label. If this is the case, then it may not necessarily make sense to take values of σ < σ0 in constructing W . However, keeping σ ﬁnite while taking the number of unlabeled points to inﬁnity does not resolve the problem. On the contrary, even the one-dimensional case becomes ill-posed in this case. To see this, consider a function y(x) which is zero everywhere except at the labeled points, where y(xj ) = yj . With a ﬁnite number of labeled points of measure zero, I (σ) (y) = 0 in any dimension 6 50 points 500 points 3500 points 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 −0.5 y 1 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 x Figure 3: Minimizer of (1) for a 1-d problem with a ﬁxed σ = 0.4, two labeled points and an increasing number of unlabeled points. and for any ﬁxed σ > 0. While this limiting function is discontinuous, it is also possible to construct ǫ→0 a sequence of continuous functions yǫ that all satisfy the constraints and for which I (σ) (yǫ ) −→ 0. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3. We generated data from a mixture of two 1-D Gaussians centered at the origin and at x = 4, with one Gaussian labeled −1 and the other +1. We used two labeled points at the centers of the Gaussians and an increasing number of randomly drawn unlabeled points. As predicted, with a ﬁxed σ, although the solution is reasonable when the number of unlabeled points is small, it becomes ﬂatter, with sharp spikes on the labeled points, as u → ∞. 6 Fourier-Eigenvector Based Methods Before we conclude, we discuss a different approach for SSL, also based on the Graph Laplacian, suggested by Belkin and Niyogi [3]. Instead of using the Laplacian as a regularizer, constraining candidate predictors y(x) non-parametrically to those with small In (y) values, here the predictors are constrained to the low-dimensional space spanned by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the Laplacian: The similarity matrix W is computed as before, and the Graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W is considered (recall D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij ). Only predictors p j=1 aj ej y (x) = ˆ (15) spanned by the ﬁrst p eigenvectors e1 , . . . , ep of L (with smallest eigenvalues) are considered. The coefﬁcients aj are chosen by minimizing a loss function on the labeled data, e.g. the squared loss: (ˆ1 , . . . , ap ) = arg min a ˆ l j=1 (yj − y (xj ))2 . ˆ (16) Unlike the Laplacian Regularization method (1), the Laplacian Eigenvector method (15)–(16) is well posed in the limit u → ∞. This follows directly from the convergence of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator [10, 4]. Eigenvector based methods were shown empirically to provide competitive generalization performance on a variety of simulated and real world problems. Belkin and Niyogi [3] motivate the approach by arguing that ‘the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator provide a natural basis for functions on the manifold and the desired classiﬁcation function can be expressed in such a basis’. In our view, the success of the method is actually not due to data lying on a low-dimensional manifold, but rather due to the low density separation assumption, which states that different class labels form high-density clusters separated by low density regions. Indeed, under this assumption and with sufﬁcient separation between the clusters, the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplace-Beltrami operator are approximately piecewise constant in each of the clusters, as in spectral clustering [12, 11], providing a basis for a labeling that is constant within clusters but variable across clusters. In other settings, such as data uniformly distributed on a manifold but without any signiﬁcant cluster structure, the success of eigenvector based methods critically depends on how well can the unknown classiﬁcation function be approximated by a truncated expansion with relatively few eigenvectors. We illustrate this issue with the following three-dimensional example: Let p(x) denote the uniform density in the box [0, 1] × [0, 0.8] × [0, 0.6], where the box lengths are different to prevent eigenvalue multiplicity. Consider learning three different functions, y1 (x) = 1x1 >0.5 , y2 (x) = 1x1 >x2 /0.8 and y3 (x) = 1x2 /0.8>x3 /0.6 . Even though all three functions are relatively simple, all having a linear separating boundary between the classes on the manifold, as shown in the experiment described in Figure 4, the Eigenvector based method (15)–(16) gives markedly different generalization performances on the three targets. This happens both when the number of eigenvectors p is set to p = l/5 as suggested by Belkin and Niyogi, as well as for the optimal (oracle) value of p selected on the test set (i.e. a “cheating” choice representing an upper bound on the generalization error of this method). 7 Prediction Error (%) p = #labeled points/5 40 optimal p 20 labeled points 40 Approx.

All panels use n = 3000 points. Prediction counts the number of sign agreements with the true labels. Rightmost panel: best ﬁt when many (all 3000) points are used, representing the best we can hope for with a few leading eigenvectors. The reason for this behavior is that y2 (x) and even more so y3 (x) cannot be as easily approximated by the very few leading eigenfunctions—even though they seem “simple” and “smooth”, they are signiﬁcantly more complicated than y1 (x) in terms of measure of simplicity implied by the Eigenvector Method. Since the density is uniform, the graph Laplacian converges to the standard Laplacian and its eigenfunctions have the form ψi,j,k (x) = cos(iπx1 ) cos(jπx2 /0.8) cos(kπx3 /0.6), making it hard to represent simple decision boundaries which are not axis-aligned. 7 Discussion Our results show that a popular SSL method, the Laplacian Regularization method (1), is not wellbehaved in the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, despite its empirical success in various SSL tasks. The empirical success might be due to two reasons. First, it is possible that with a large enough number of labeled points relative to the number of unlabeled points, the method is well behaved. This regime, where the number of both labeled and unlabeled points grow while l/u is ﬁxed, has recently been analyzed by Wasserman and Lafferty [9]. However, we do not ﬁnd this regime particularly satisfying as we would expect that having more unlabeled data available should improve performance, rather than require more labeled points or make the problem ill-posed. It also places the user in a delicate situation of choosing the “just right” number of unlabeled points without any theoretical guidance. Second, in our experiments we noticed that although the predictor y (x) becomes extremely ﬂat, in ˆ binary tasks, it is still typically possible to ﬁnd a threshold leading to a good classiﬁcation performance. We do not know of any theoretical explanation for such behavior, nor how to characterize it. Obtaining such an explanation would be very interesting, and in a sense crucial to the theoretical foundation of the Laplacian Regularization method. On a very practical level, such a theoretical understanding might allow us to correct the method so as to avoid the numerical instability associated with ﬂat predictors, and perhaps also make it appropriate for regression. The reason that the Laplacian regularizer (1) is ill-posed in the limit is that the ﬁrst order gradient is not a sufﬁcient penalty in high dimensions. This fact is well known in spline theory, where the Sobolev Embedding Theorem [1] indicates one must control at least d+1 derivatives in Rd . In the 2 context of Laplacian regularization, this can be done using the iterated Laplacian: replacing the d+1 graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W , where D is the diagonal degree matrix, with L 2 (matrix to d+1 the 2 power). In the inﬁnite unlabeled data limit, this corresponds to regularizing all order- d+1 2 (mixed) partial derivatives. In the typical case of a low-dimensional manifold in a high dimensional ambient space, the order of iteration should correspond to the intrinsic, rather then ambient, dimensionality, which poses a practical problem of estimating this usually unknown dimensionality. We are not aware of much practical work using the iterated Laplacian, nor a good understanding of its appropriateness for SSL. A different approach leading to a well-posed solution is to include also an ambient regularization term [5]. However, the properties of the solution and in particular its relation to various assumptions about the “smoothness” of y(x) relative to p(x) remain unclear.

<p>Author: Andreas Bartels, Matthew Blaschko, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Resting state activity is brain activation that arises in the absence of any task, and is usually measured in awake subjects during prolonged fMRI scanning sessions where the only instruction given is to close the eyes and do nothing. It has been recognized in recent years that resting state activity is implicated in a wide variety of brain function. While certain networks of brain areas have different levels of activation at rest and during a task, there is nevertheless signiﬁcant similarity between activations in the two cases. This suggests that recordings of resting state activity can be used as a source of unlabeled data to augment discriminative regression techniques in a semi-supervised setting. We evaluate this setting empirically yielding three main results: (i) regression tends to be improved by the use of Laplacian regularization even when no additional unlabeled data are available, (ii) resting state data seem to have a similar marginal distribution to that recorded during the execution of a visual processing task implying largely similar types of activation, and (iii) this source of information can be broadly exploited to improve the robustness of empirical inference in fMRI studies, an inherently data poor domain. 1</p><p>2 0.82157725 <a title="38-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Learning_Brain_Connectivity_of_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_from_Neuroimaging_Data.html">125 nips-2009-Learning Brain Connectivity of Alzheimer's Disease from Neuroimaging Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuai Huang, Jing Li, Liang Sun, Jun Liu, Teresa Wu, Kewei Chen, Adam Fleisher, Eric Reiman, Jieping Ye</p><p>Abstract: Recent advances in neuroimaging techniques provide great potentials for effective diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Previous studies have shown that AD is closely related to the alternation in the functional brain network, i.e., the functional connectivity among different brain regions. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging, which holds great promise for identifying image-based markers used to distinguish Normal Controls (NC), patients with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), and patients with AD. More specifically, we study sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), also known as exploratory Gaussian graphical models, for brain connectivity modeling. In particular, we apply SICE to learn and analyze functional brain connectivity patterns from different subject groups, based on a key property of SICE, called the “monotone property” we established in this paper. Our experimental results on neuroimaging PET data of 42 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects reveal several interesting connectivity patterns consistent with literature findings, and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD. 1 In trod u cti on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a fatal, neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of memory and other cognitive functions. It is the most common form of dementia and currently affects over five million Americans; this number will grow to as many as 14 million by year 2050. The current knowledge about the cause of AD is very limited; clinical diagnosis is imprecise with definite diagnosis only possible by autopsy; also, there is currently no cure for AD, while most drugs only alleviate the symptoms. To tackle these challenging issues, the rapidly advancing neuroimaging techniques provide great potentials. These techniques, such as MRI, PET, and fMRI, produce data (images) of brain structure and function, making it possible to identify the difference between AD and normal brains. Recent studies have demonstrated that neuroimaging data provide more sensitive and consistent measures of AD onset and progression than conventional clinical assessment and neuropsychological tests [1]. Recent studies have found that AD is closely related to the alternation in the functional brain network, i.e., the functional connectivity among different brain regions [ 2]-[3]. Specifically, it has been shown that functional connectivity substantially decreases between the hippocampus and other regions of AD brains [3]-[4]. Also, some studies have found increased connectivity between the regions in the frontal lobe [ 6]-[7]. Learning functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging data holds great promise for identifying image-based markers used to distinguish among AD, MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), and normal aging. Note that MCI is a transition stage from normal aging to AD. Understanding and precise diagnosis of MCI have significant clinical value since it can serve as an early warning sign of AD. Despite all these, existing research in functional brain connectivity modeling suffers from limitations. A large body of functional connectivity modeling has been based on correlation analysis [2]-[3], [5]. However, correlation only captures pairwise information and fails to provide a complete account for the interaction of many (more than two) brain regions. Other multivariate statistical methods have also been used, such as Principle Component Analysis (PCA) [8], PCA-based Scaled Subprofile Model [9], Independent Component Analysis [10]-[11], and Partial Least Squares [12]-[13], which group brain regions into latent components. The brain regions within each component are believed to have strong connectivity, while the connectivity between components is weak. One major drawback of these methods is that the latent components may not correspond to any biological entities, causing difficulty in interpretation. In addition, graphical models have been used to study brain connectivity, such as structural equation models [14]-[15], dynamic causal models [16], and Granger causality. However, most of these approaches are confirmative, rather than exploratory, in the sense that they require a prior model of brain connectivity to begin with. This makes them inadequate for studying AD brain connectivity, because there is little prior knowledge about which regions should be involved and how they are connected. This makes exploratory models highly desirable. In this paper, we study sparse inverse covariance estimation (SICE), also known as exploratory Gaussian graphical models, for brain connectivity modeling. Inverse covariance matrix has a clear interpretation that the off-diagonal elements correspond to partial correlations, i.e., the correlation between each pair of brain regions given all other regions. This provides a much better model for brain connectivity than simple correlation analysis which models each pair of regions without considering other regions. Also, imposing sparsity on the inverse covariance estimation ensures a reliable brain connectivity to be modeled with limited sample size, which is usually the case in AD studies since clinical samples are difficult to obtain. From a domain perspective, imposing sparsity is also valid because neurological findings have demonstrated that a brain region usually only directly interacts with a few other brain regions in neurological processes [ 2]-[3]. Various algorithms for achieving SICE have been developed in recent year [ 17]-[22]. In addition, SICE has been used in various applications [17], [21], [23]-[26]. In this paper, we apply SICE to learn functional brain connectivity from neuroimaging and analyze the difference among AD, MCI, and NC based on a key property of SICE, called the “monotone property” we established in this paper. Unlike the previous study which is based on a specific level of sparsity [26], the monotone property allows us to study the connectivity pattern using different levels of sparsity and obtain an order for the strength of connection between pairs of brain regions. In addition, we apply bootstrap hypothesis testing to assess the significance of the connection. Our experimental results on PET data of 42 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects enrolled in the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative project reveal several interesting connectivity patterns consistent with literature findings, and also some new patterns that can help the knowledge discovery of AD. 2 S ICE : B ack grou n d an d th e Mon oton e P rop erty An inverse covariance matrix can be represented graphically. If used to represent brain connectivity, the nodes are activated brain regions; existence of an arc between two nodes means that the two brain regions are closely related in the brain's functiona l process. Let be all the brain regions under study. We assume that follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with mean and covariance matrix . Let be the inverse covariance matrix. Suppose we have samples (e.g., subjects with AD) for these brain regions. Note that we will only illustrate here the SICE for AD, whereas the SICE for MCI and NC can be achieved in a similar way. We can formulate the SICE into an optimization problem, i.e., (1) where is the sample covariance matrix; , , and denote the determinant, trace, and sum of the absolute values of all elements of a matrix, respectively. The part “ ” in (1) is the log-likelihood, whereas the part “ ” represents the “sparsity” of the inverse covariance matrix . (1) aims to achieve a tradeoff between the likelihood fit of the inverse covariance estimate and the sparsity. The tradeoff is controlled by , called the regularization parameter; larger will result in more sparse estimate for . The formulation in (1) follows the same line of the -norm regularization, which has been introduced into the least squares formulation to achieve model sparsity and the resulting model is called Lasso [27]. We employ the algorithm in [19] in this paper. Next, we show that with going from small to large, the resulting brain connectivity models have a monotone property. Before introducing the monotone property, the following definitions are needed. Definition: In the graphical representation of the inverse covariance, if node to by an arc, then is called a “neighbor” of . If is connected to chain of arcs, then is called a “connectivity component” of . is connected though some Intuitively, being neighbors means that two nodes (i.e., brain regions) are directly connected, whereas being connectivity components means that two brain regions are indirectly connected, i.e., the connection is mediated through other regions. In other words, not being connectivity components (i.e., two nodes completely separated in the graph) means that the two corresponding brain regions are completely independent of each other. Connectivity components have the following monotone property: Monotone property of SICE: Let components of with and and be the sets of all the connectivity , respectively. If , then . Intuitively, if two regions are connected (either directly or indirectly) at one level of sparseness ( ), they will be connected at all lower levels of sparseness ( ). Proof of the monotone property can be found in the supplementary file [29]. This monotone property can be used to identify how strongly connected each node (brain region) to its connectivity components. For example, assuming that and , this means that is more strongly connected to than . Thus, by changing from small to large, we can obtain an order for the strength of connection between pairs of brain regions. As will be shown in Section 3, this order is different among AD, MCI, and NC. 3 3.1 Ap p l i cati on i n B rai n Con n ecti vi ty M od el i n g of AD D a t a a c q u i s i t i o n a n d p re p ro c e s s i n g We apply SICE on FDG-PET images for 49 AD, 116 MCI, and 67 NC subjects downloaded from the ADNI website. We apply Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL) [28] to extract data from each of the 116 anatomical volumes of interest (AVOI), and derived average of each AVOI for every subject. The AVOIs represent different regions of the whole brain. 3.2 B r a i n c o n n e c t i v i t y mo d e l i n g b y S I C E 42 AVOIs are selected for brain connectivity modeling, as they are considered to be potentially related to AD. These regions distribute in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes. Table 1 list of the names of the AVOIs with their corresponding lobes. The number before each AVOI is used to index the node in the connectivity models. We apply the SICE algorithm to learn one connectivity model for AD, one for MCI, and one for NC, for a given . With different ’s, the resulting connectivity models hold a monotone property, which can help obtain an order for the strength of connection between brain regions. To show the order clearly, we develop a tree-like plot in Fig. 1, which is for the AD group. To generate this plot, we start at a very small value (i.e., the right-most of the horizontal axis), which results in a fully-connected connectivity model. A fully-connected connectivity model is one that contains no region disconnected with the rest of the brain. Then, we decrease by small steps and record the order of the regions disconnected with the rest of the brain regions.

As decreases below (but still above ), the rest of the brain further divides into three disconnected clusters, including the cluster of “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L”, the cluster of “Fusiform_R” up to “Hippocampus_L”, and the cluster of the other regions. As continuously decreases, each current cluster will split into smaller clusters; eventually, when reaches a very large value, there will be no arc in the IC model, i.e., each region is now a cluster of itself and the split will stop. The sequence of the splitting gives an order for the strength of connection between brain regions. Specifically, the earlier (i.e., smaller ) a region or a cluster of regions becomes disconnected from the rest of the brain, the weaker it is connected with the rest of the brain. For example, in Fig. 1, it can be known that “Tempora_Sup_L” may be the weakest region in the brain network of AD; the second weakest ones are the cluster of “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L”, and the cluster of “Fusiform_R” up to “Hippocampus_L”. It is very interesting to see that the weakest and second weakest brain regions in the brain network include “Cingulum_Post_R” and “Cingulum_Post_L” as well as regions all in the temporal lobe, all of which have been found to be affected by AD early and severely [3]-[5]. Next, to facilitate the comparison between AD and NC, a tree-like plot is also constructed for NC, as shown in Fig. 2. By comparing the plots for AD and NC, we can observe the following two distinct phenomena: First, in AD, between-lobe connectivity tends to be weaker than within-lobe connectivity. This can be seen from Fig. 1 which shows a clear pattern that the lobes become disconnected with each other before the regions within each lobe become disconnected with each other, as goes from small to large. This pattern does not show in Fig. 2 for NC. Second, the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in AD than in NC. This can be seen from Fig. 2 for NC, in which the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are still connected even at a very large for NC. However, this pattern does not show in Fig. 1 for AD. Furthermore, a tree-like plot is also constructed for MCI (Fig. 3), and compared with the plots for AD and NC. In terms of the two phenomena discussed previously, MCI shows similar patterns to AD, but these patterns are not as distinct from NC as AD. Specifically, in terms of the first phenomenon, MCI also shows weaker between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity, which is similar to AD. However, the degree of weakerness is not as distinctive as AD. For example, a few regions in the temporal lobe of MCI, including “Temporal_Mid_R” and “Temporal_Sup_R”, appear to be more strongly connected with the occipital lobe than with other regions in the temporal lobe. In terms of the second phenomenon, MCI also shows weaker between-hemisphere connectivity in the same brain region than NC. However, the degree of weakerness is not as distinctive as AD. For example, several left-right pairs of the same brain regions are still connected even at a very large , such as “Rectus_R” and “Rectus_L”, “Frontal_Mid_Orb_R” and “Frontal_Mid_Orb _L”, “Parietal_Sup_R” and “Parietal_Sup_L”, as well as “Precuneus_R” and “Precuneus_L”. All above findings are consistent with the knowledge that MCI is a transition stage between normal aging and AD. Large λ λ3 λ2 λ1 Small λ Fig 1: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of AD Large λ Small λ Fig 2: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of NC Fig 3: Order for the strength of connection between brain regions of MCI Furthermore, we would like to compare how within-lobe and between-lobe connectivity is different across AD, MCI, and NC. To achieve this, we first learn one connectivity model for AD, one for MCI, and one for NC. We adjust the in the learning of each model such that the three models, corresponding to AD, MCI, and NC, respectively, will have the same total number of arcs. This is to “normalize” the models, so that the comparison will be more focused on how the arcs distribute differently across different models. By selecting different values for the total number of arcs, we can obtain models representing the brain connectivity at different levels of strength. Specifically, given a small value for the total number of arcs, only strong arcs will show up in the resulting connectivity model, so the model is a model of strong brain connectivity; when increasing the total number of arcs, mild arcs will also show up in the resulting connectivity model, so the model is a model of mild and strong brain connectivity. For example, Fig. 4 shows the connectivity models for AD, MCI, and NC with the total number of arcs equal to 50 (Fig. 4(a)), 120 (Fig. 4(b)), and 180 (Fig. 4(c)). In this paper, we use a “matrix” representation for the SICE of a connectivity model. In the matrix, each row represents one node and each column also represents one node. Please see Table 1 for the correspondence between the numbering of the nodes and the brain region each number represents. The matrix contains black and white cells: a black cell at the -th row, -th column of the matrix represents existence of an arc between nodes and in the SICE-based connectivity model, whereas a white cell represents absence of an arc. According to this definition, the total number of black cells in the matrix is equal to twice the total number of arcs in the SICE-based connectivity model. Moreover, on each matrix, four red cubes are used to highlight the brain regions in each of the four lobes; that is, from top-left to bottom-right, the red cubes highlight the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes, respectively. The black cells inside each red cube reflect within-lobe connectivity, whereas the black cells outside the cubes reflect between-lobe connectivity. While the connectivity models in Fig. 4 clearly show some connectivity difference between AD, MCI, and NC, it is highly desirable to test if the observed difference is statistically significant. Therefore, we further perform a hypothesis testing and the results are summarized in Table 2. Specifically, a P-value is recorded in the sub-table if it is smaller than 0.1, such a P-value is further highlighted if it is even smaller than 0.05; a “---” indicates that the corresponding test is not significant (P-value>0.1). We can observe from Fig. 4 and Table 2: Within-lobe connectivity: The temporal lobe of AD has significantly less connectivity than NC. This is true across different strength levels (e.g., strong, mild, and weak) of the connectivity; in other words, even the connectivity between some strongly-connected brain regions in the temporal lobe may be disrupted by AD. In particular, it is clearly from Fig. 4(b) that the regions “Hippocampus” and “ParaHippocampal” (numbered by 39-42, located at the right-bottom corner of Fig. 4(b)) are much more separated from other regions in AD than in NC. The decrease in connectivity in the temporal lobe of AD, especially between the Hippocampus and other regions, has been extensively reported in the literature [3]-[5]. Furthermore, the temporal lobe of MCI does not show a significant decrease in connectivity, compared with NC. This may be because MCI does not disrupt the temporal lobe as badly as AD. AD MCI NC Fig 4(a): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 50) AD MCI NC Fig 4(b): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 120) AD MCI NC Fig 4(c): SICE-based brain connectivity models (total number of arcs equal to 180) The frontal lobe of AD has significantly more connectivity than NC, which is true across different strength levels of the connectivity. This has been interpreted as compensatory reallocation or recruitment of cognitive resources [6]-[7]. Because the regions in the frontal lobe are typically affected later in the course of AD (our data are early AD), the increased connectivity in the frontal lobe may help preserve some cognitive functions in AD patients. Furthermore, the frontal lobe of MCI does not show a significant increase in connectivity, compared with NC. This indicates that the compensatory effect in MCI brain may not be as strong as that in AD brains. Table 2: P-values from the statistical significance test of connectivity difference among AD, MCI, and NC (a) Total number of arcs = 50 (b) Total number of arcs = 120 (c) Total number of arcs = 180 There is no significant difference among AD, MCI, and NC in terms of the connectivity within the parietal lobe and within the occipital lobe. Another interesting finding is that all the P-values in the third sub-table of Table 2(a) are insignificant. This implies that distribution of the strong connectivity within and between lobes for MCI is very similar to NC; in other words, MCI has not been able to disrupt the strong connectivity among brain regions (it disrupts some mild and weak connectivity though). Between-lobe connectivity: In general, human brains tend to have less between-lobe connectivity than within-lobe connectivity. A majority of the strong connectivity occurs within lobes, but rarely between lobes. These can be clearly seen from Fig. 4 (especially Fig. 4(a)) in which there are much more black cells along the diagonal direction than the off-diagonal direction, regardless of AD, MCI, and NC. The connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes of AD is significantly more than NC which is true especially for mild and weak connectivity. The increased connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes of AD has been previously reported in [3]. It is also interpreted as a compensatory effect in [6]-[7]. Furthermore, MCI also shows increased connectivity between the parietal and occipital lobes, compared with NC, but the increase is not as significant as AD. While the connectivity between the frontal and occipital lobes shows little difference between AD and NC, such connectivity for MCI shows a significant decrease especially for mild and weak connectivity. Also, AD may have less temporal-occipital connectivity, less frontal-parietal connectivity, but more parietal-temporal connectivity than NC. Between-hemisphere connectivity: Recall that we have observed from the tree-like plots in Figs. 3 and 4 that the same brain regions in the left and right hemisphere are connected much weaker in AD than in NC. It is desirable to test if this observed difference is statistically significant. To achieve this, we test the statistical significance of the difference among AD, MCI, and NC, in term of the number of connected same-region left-right pairs. Results show that when the total number of arcs in the connectivity models is equal to 120 or 90, none of the tests is significant. However, when the total number of arcs is equal to 50, the P-values of the tests for “AD vs. NC”, “AD vs. MCI”, and “MCI vs. NC” are 0.009, 0.004, and 0.315, respectively. We further perform tests for the total number of arcs equal to 30 and find the P-values to be 0. 0055, 0.053, and 0.158, respectively. These results indicate that AD disrupts the strong connectivity between the same regions of the left and right hemispheres, whereas this disruption is not significant in MCI. 4 Con cl u si on In the paper, we applied SICE to model functional brain connectivity of AD, MCI, and NC based on PET neuroimaging data, and analyze the patterns based on the monotone property of SICE. Our findings were consistent with the previous literature and also showed some new aspects that may suggest further investigation in brain connectivity research in the future.

Cecchi</p><p>Abstract: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that has eluded a characterization in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity, and is hypothesized to affect the collective, “emergent” working of the brain. We propose a novel data-driven approach to capture emergent features using functional brain networks [4] extracted from fMRI data, and demonstrate its advantage over traditional region-of-interest (ROI) and local, task-speciﬁc linear activation analyzes. Our results suggest that schizophrenia is indeed associated with disruption of global brain properties related to its functioning as a network, which cannot be explained by alteration of local activation patterns. Moreover, further exploitation of interactions by sparse Markov Random Field classiﬁers shows clear gain over linear methods, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM, allowing to reach 86% accuracy (over 50% baseline - random guess), which is quite remarkable given that it is based on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task. 1</p><p>4 0.69636923 <a title="38-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Exploring_Functional_Connectivities_of_the_Human_Brain_using_Multivariate_Information_Analysis.html">86 nips-2009-Exploring Functional Connectivities of the Human Brain using Multivariate Information Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Barry Chai, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we present a new method for establishing fMRI pattern-based functional connectivity between brain regions by estimating their multivariate mutual information. Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to ﬁnd strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.</p><p>5 0.55799186 <a title="38-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-fMRI-Based_Inter-Subject_Cortical_Alignment_Using_Functional_Connectivity.html">261 nips-2009-fMRI-Based Inter-Subject Cortical Alignment Using Functional Connectivity</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Conroy, Ben Singer, James Haxby, Peter J. Ramadge</p><p>Abstract: The inter-subject alignment of functional MRI (fMRI) data is important for improving the statistical power of fMRI group analyses. In contrast to existing anatomically-based methods, we propose a novel multi-subject algorithm that derives a functional correspondence by aligning spatial patterns of functional connectivity across a set of subjects. We test our method on fMRI data collected during a movie viewing experiment. By cross-validating the results of our algorithm, we show that the correspondence successfully generalizes to a secondary movie dataset not used to derive the alignment. 1</p><p>6 0.55725622 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Boosting_with_Spatial_Regularization.html">47 nips-2009-Boosting with Spatial Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Andreas Bartels, Matthew Blaschko, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Resting state activity is brain activation that arises in the absence of any task, and is usually measured in awake subjects during prolonged fMRI scanning sessions where the only instruction given is to close the eyes and do nothing. It has been recognized in recent years that resting state activity is implicated in a wide variety of brain function. While certain networks of brain areas have different levels of activation at rest and during a task, there is nevertheless signiﬁcant similarity between activations in the two cases. This suggests that recordings of resting state activity can be used as a source of unlabeled data to augment discriminative regression techniques in a semi-supervised setting. We evaluate this setting empirically yielding three main results: (i) regression tends to be improved by the use of Laplacian regularization even when no additional unlabeled data are available, (ii) resting state data seem to have a similar marginal distribution to that recorded during the execution of a visual processing task implying largely similar types of activation, and (iii) this source of information can be broadly exploited to improve the robustness of empirical inference in fMRI studies, an inherently data poor domain. 1</p><p>2 0.74411851 <a title="38-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Kernel_Methods_for_Deep_Learning.html">119 nips-2009-Kernel Methods for Deep Learning</a></p>

We evaluate SVMs and MKMs with these kernel functions on problems designed to illustrate the advantages of deep architectures.

<p>Author: Yusuke Watanabe, Kenji Fukumizu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach to the analysis of Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) by establishing a formula that connects the Hessian of the Bethe free energy with the edge zeta function. The formula has a number of theoretical implications on LBP. It is applied to give a sufﬁcient condition that the Hessian of the Bethe free energy is positive deﬁnite, which shows non-convexity for graphs with multiple cycles. The formula clariﬁes the relation between the local stability of a ﬁxed point of LBP and local minima of the Bethe free energy.

<p>Author: Yang Wang, Gholamreza Haffari, Shaojun Wang, Greg Mori</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel information theoretic approach for semi-supervised learning of conditional random ﬁelds that deﬁnes a training objective to combine the conditional likelihood on labeled data and the mutual information on unlabeled data. In contrast to previous minimum conditional entropy semi-supervised discriminative learning methods, our approach is grounded on a more solid foundation, the rate distortion theory in information theory. We analyze the tractability of the framework for structured prediction and present a convergent variational training algorithm to defy the combinatorial explosion of terms in the sum over label conﬁgurations. Our experimental results show the rate distortion approach outperforms standard l2 regularization, minimum conditional entropy regularization as well as maximum conditional entropy regularization on both multi-class classiﬁcation and sequence labeling problems. 1</p><p>5 0.6316911 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Distribution_Matching_for_Transduction.html">72 nips-2009-Distribution Matching for Transduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, James Petterson, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Many transductive inference algorithms assume that distributions over training and test estimates should be related, e.g. by providing a large margin of separation on both sets. We use this idea to design a transduction algorithm which can be used without modiﬁcation for classiﬁcation, regression, and structured estimation. At its heart we exploit the fact that for a good learner the distributions over the outputs on training and test sets should match. This is a classical two-sample problem which can be solved efﬁciently in its most general form by using distance measures in Hilbert Space. It turns out that a number of existing heuristics can be viewed as special cases of our approach. 1</p><p>6 0.60717636 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_Brain_Connectivity_of_Alzheimer%27s_Disease_from_Neuroimaging_Data.html">125 nips-2009-Learning Brain Connectivity of Alzheimer's Disease from Neuroimaging Data</a></p>

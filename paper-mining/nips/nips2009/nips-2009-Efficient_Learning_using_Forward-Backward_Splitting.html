<p>Author: Le Song, Mladen Kolar, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks are a favored formalism for modeling the dependency structures in complex multivariate systems such as those encountered in biology and neural science. When a system is undergoing dynamic transformation, temporally rewiring networks are needed for capturing the dynamic causal inﬂuences between covariates. In this paper, we propose time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) for modeling the structurally varying directed dependency structures underlying non-stationary biological/neural time series. This is a challenging problem due the non-stationarity and sample scarcity of time series data. We present a kernel reweighted 1 -regularized auto-regressive procedure for this problem which enjoys nice properties such as computational efﬁciency and provable asymptotic consistency. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst practical and statistically sound method for structure learning of TVDBNs. We applied TV-DBNs to time series measurements during yeast cell cycle and brain response to visual stimuli. In both cases, TV-DBNs reveal interesting dynamics underlying the respective biological systems. 1</p><p>4 0.092303507 <a title="76-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Convex_Relaxation_of_Mixture_Regression_with_Efficient_Algorithms.html">61 nips-2009-Convex Relaxation of Mixture Regression with Efficient Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Novi Quadrianto, John Lim, Dale Schuurmans, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We develop a convex relaxation of maximum a posteriori estimation of a mixture of regression models. Although our relaxation involves a semideﬁnite matrix variable, we reformulate the problem to eliminate the need for general semideﬁnite programming. In particular, we provide two reformulations that admit fast algorithms. The ﬁrst is a max-min spectral reformulation exploiting quasi-Newton descent. The second is a min-min reformulation consisting of fast alternating steps of closed-form updates. We evaluate the methods against Expectation-Maximization in a real problem of motion segmentation from video data. 1</p><p>5 0.090230778 <a title="76-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Slow_Learners_are_Fast.html">220 nips-2009-Slow Learners are Fast</a></p>

<p>Author: Lin Xiao</p><p>Abstract: We consider regularized stochastic learning and online optimization problems, where the objective function is the sum of two convex terms: one is the loss function of the learning task, and the other is a simple regularization term such as â&bdquo;&ldquo;1 -norm for promoting sparsity. We develop a new online algorithm, the regularized dual averaging (RDA) method, that can explicitly exploit the regularization structure in an online setting. In particular, at each iteration, the learning variables are adjusted by solving a simple optimization problem that involves the running average of all past subgradients of the loss functions and the whole regularization term, not just its subgradient. Computational experiments show that the RDA method can be very effective for sparse online learning with â&bdquo;&ldquo;1 -regularization. 1</p><p>3 0.66989881 <a title="76-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Slow_Learners_are_Fast.html">220 nips-2009-Slow Learners are Fast</a></p>

<p>Author: Chun-nan Hsu, Yu-ming Chang, Hanshen Huang, Yuh-jye Lee</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that the second-order stochastic gradient descent (2SGD) method can potentially achieve generalization performance as well as empirical optimum in a single pass (i.e., epoch) through the training examples. However, 2SGD requires computing the inverse of the Hessian matrix of the loss function, which is prohibitively expensive. This paper presents Periodic Step-size Adaptation (PSA), which approximates the Jacobian matrix of the mapping function and explores a linear relation between the Jacobian and Hessian to approximate the Hessian periodically and achieve near-optimal results in experiments on a wide variety of models and tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.60259169 <a title="76-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-A_Parameter-free_Hedging_Algorithm.html">14 nips-2009-A Parameter-free Hedging Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Kamalika Chaudhuri, Yoav Freund, Daniel J. Hsu</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of decision-theoretic online learning (DTOL). Motivated by practical applications, we focus on DTOL when the number of actions is very large. Previous algorithms for learning in this framework have a tunable learning rate parameter, and a barrier to using online-learning in practical applications is that it is not understood how to set this parameter optimally, particularly when the number of actions is large. In this paper, we offer a clean solution by proposing a novel and completely parameter-free algorithm for DTOL. We introduce a new notion of regret, which is more natural for applications with a large number of actions. We show that our algorithm achieves good performance with respect to this new notion of regret; in addition, it also achieves performance close to that of the best bounds achieved by previous algorithms with optimally-tuned parameters, according to previous notions of regret. 1</p><p>6 0.52896535 <a title="76-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Probabilistic_Relational_PCA.html">195 nips-2009-Probabilistic Relational PCA</a></p>

<p>Author: Feng Zhou, Fernando Torre</p><p>Abstract: Alignment of time series is an important problem to solve in many scientiﬁc disciplines. In particular, temporal alignment of two or more subjects performing similar activities is a challenging problem due to the large temporal scale difference between human actions as well as the inter/intra subject variability. In this paper we present canonical time warping (CTW), an extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for spatio-temporal alignment of human motion between two subjects. CTW extends previous work on CCA in two ways: (i) it combines CCA with dynamic time warping (DTW), and (ii) it extends CCA by allowing local spatial deformations. We show CTW’s effectiveness in three experiments: alignment of synthetic data, alignment of motion capture data of two subjects performing similar actions, and alignment of similar facial expressions made by two people. Our results demonstrate that CTW provides both visually and qualitatively better alignment than state-of-the-art techniques based on DTW. 1</p><p>2 0.82277966 <a title="76-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Speaker_Comparison_with_Inner_Product_Discriminant_Functions.html">227 nips-2009-Speaker Comparison with Inner Product Discriminant Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.72800463 <a title="76-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Learning_using_Forward-Backward_Splitting.html">76 nips-2009-Efficient Learning using Forward-Backward Splitting</a></p>

<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>5 0.68690509 <a title="76-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Monte_Carlo_Sampling_for_Regret_Minimization_in_Extensive_Games.html">156 nips-2009-Monte Carlo Sampling for Regret Minimization in Extensive Games</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc Lanctot, Kevin Waugh, Martin Zinkevich, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Sequential decision-making with multiple agents and imperfect information is commonly modeled as an extensive game. One efﬁcient method for computing Nash equilibria in large, zero-sum, imperfect information games is counterfactual regret minimization (CFR). In the domain of poker, CFR has proven effective, particularly when using a domain-speciﬁc augmentation involving chance outcome sampling. In this paper, we describe a general family of domain-independent CFR sample-based algorithms called Monte Carlo counterfactual regret minimization (MCCFR) of which the original and poker-speciﬁc versions are special cases. We start by showing that MCCFR performs the same regret updates as CFR on expectation. Then, we introduce two sampling schemes: outcome sampling and external sampling, showing that both have bounded overall regret with high probability. Thus, they can compute an approximate equilibrium using self-play. Finally, we prove a new tighter bound on the regret for the original CFR algorithm and relate this new bound to MCCFR’s bounds. We show empirically that, although the sample-based algorithms require more iterations, their lower cost per iteration can lead to dramatically faster convergence in various games. 1</p><p>6 0.68667966 <a title="76-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Adapting_to_the_Shifting_Intent_of_Search_Queries.html">24 nips-2009-Adapting to the Shifting Intent of Search Queries</a></p>

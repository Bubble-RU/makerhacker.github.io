<p>Author: Le Song, Mladen Kolar, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks are a favored formalism for modeling the dependency structures in complex multivariate systems such as those encountered in biology and neural science. When a system is undergoing dynamic transformation, temporally rewiring networks are needed for capturing the dynamic causal inﬂuences between covariates. In this paper, we propose time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) for modeling the structurally varying directed dependency structures underlying non-stationary biological/neural time series. This is a challenging problem due the non-stationarity and sample scarcity of time series data. We present a kernel reweighted 1 -regularized auto-regressive procedure for this problem which enjoys nice properties such as computational efﬁciency and provable asymptotic consistency. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst practical and statistically sound method for structure learning of TVDBNs. We applied TV-DBNs to time series measurements during yeast cell cycle and brain response to visual stimuli. In both cases, TV-DBNs reveal interesting dynamics underlying the respective biological systems. 1</p><p>3 0.10811478 <a title="168-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Free_energy_score_space.html">97 nips-2009-Free energy score space</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Marco Cristani, Umberto Castellani, Vittorio Murino, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: A score function induced by a generative model of the data can provide a feature vector of a ﬁxed dimension for each data sample. Data samples themselves may be of differing lengths (e.g., speech segments, or other sequence data), but as a score function is based on the properties of the data generation process, it produces a ﬁxed-length vector in a highly informative space, typically referred to as a “score space”. Discriminative classiﬁers have been shown to achieve higher performance in appropriately chosen score spaces than is achievable by either the corresponding generative likelihood-based classiﬁers, or the discriminative classiﬁers using standard feature extractors. In this paper, we present a novel score space that exploits the free energy associated with a generative model. The resulting free energy score space (FESS) takes into account latent structure of the data at various levels, and can be trivially shown to lead to classiﬁcation performance that at least matches the performance of the free energy classiﬁer based on the same generative model, and the same factorization of the posterior. We also show that in several typical vision and computational biology applications the classiﬁers optimized in FESS outperform the corresponding pure generative approaches, as well as a number of previous approaches to combining discriminating and generative models.</p><p>4 0.10408203 <a title="168-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-White_Functionals_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">257 nips-2009-White Functionals for Anomaly Detection in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Jean-philippe Vert, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: We propose new methodologies to detect anomalies in discrete-time processes taking values in a probability space. These methods are based on the inference of functionals whose evaluations on successive states visited by the process are stationary and have low autocorrelations. Deviations from this behavior are used to ﬂag anomalies. The candidate functionals are estimated in a subspace of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the original probability space considered. We provide experimental results on simulated datasets which show that these techniques compare favorably with other algorithms.</p><p>5 0.09177874 <a title="168-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-A_Neural_Implementation_of_the_Kalman_Filter.html">13 nips-2009-A Neural Implementation of the Kalman Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Wilson, Leif Finkel</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests that the brain is capable of approximating Bayesian inference in the face of noisy input stimuli. Despite this progress, the neural underpinnings of this computation are still poorly understood. In this paper we focus on the Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic time series and introduce a novel neural network, derived from a line attractor architecture, whose dynamics map directly onto those of the Kalman ﬁlter in the limit of small prediction error. When the prediction error is large we show that the network responds robustly to changepoints in a way that is qualitatively compatible with the optimal Bayesian model. The model suggests ways in which probability distributions are encoded in the brain and makes a number of testable experimental predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.090945914 <a title="168-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Sharing_Features_among_Dynamical_Systems_with_Beta_Processes.html">217 nips-2009-Sharing Features among Dynamical Systems with Beta Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Baback Moghaddam, Emtiyaz Khan, Kevin P. Murphy, Benjamin M. Marlin</p><p>Abstract: We make several contributions in accelerating approximate Bayesian structural inference for non-decomposable GGMs. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show how to efﬁciently compute a BIC or Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood of non-decomposable graphs using convex methods for precision matrix estimation. This optimization technique can be used as a fast scoring function inside standard Stochastic Local Search (SLS) for generating posterior samples. Our second contribution is a novel framework for efﬁciently generating large sets of high-quality graph topologies without performing local search. This graph proposal method, which we call “Neighborhood Fusion” (NF), samples candidate Markov blankets at each node using sparse regression techniques. Our third contribution is a hybrid method combining the complementary strengths of NF and SLS. Experimental results in structural recovery and prediction tasks demonstrate that NF and hybrid NF/SLS out-perform state-of-the-art local search methods, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, when realistic computational limits are imposed.</p><p>4 0.59813273 <a title="168-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Sparse_Factor_Models_and_DAGs_Inference_and_Comparison.html">42 nips-2009-Bayesian Sparse Factor Models and DAGs Inference and Comparison</a></p>
<p>Author: Ricardo Henao, Ole Winther</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a novel approach to learn directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) and factor models within the same framework while also allowing for model comparison between them. For this purpose, we exploit the connection between factor models and DAGs to propose Bayesian hierarchies based on spike and slab priors to promote sparsity, heavy-tailed priors to ensure identiﬁability and predictive densities to perform the model comparison. We require identiﬁability to be able to produce variable orderings leading to valid DAGs and sparsity to learn the structures. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated through extensive experiments on artiﬁcial and biological data showing that our approach outperform a number of state of the art methods. 1</p><p>5 0.58841658 <a title="168-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-A_Neural_Implementation_of_the_Kalman_Filter.html">13 nips-2009-A Neural Implementation of the Kalman Filter</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Waugh, Nolan Bard, Michael Bowling</p><p>Abstract: Extensive games are often used to model the interactions of multiple agents within an environment. Much recent work has focused on increasing the size of an extensive game that can be feasibly solved. Despite these improvements, many interesting games are still too large for such techniques. A common approach for computing strategies in these large games is to ﬁrst employ an abstraction technique to reduce the original game to an abstract game that is of a manageable size. This abstract game is then solved and the resulting strategy is played in the original game. Most top programs in recent AAAI Computer Poker Competitions use this approach. The trend in this competition has been that strategies found in larger abstract games tend to beat strategies found in smaller abstract games. These larger abstract games have more expressive strategy spaces and therefore contain better strategies. In this paper we present a new method for computing strategies in large games. This method allows us to compute more expressive strategies without increasing the size of abstract games that we are required to solve. We demonstrate the power of the approach experimentally in both small and large games, while also providing a theoretical justiﬁcation for the resulting improvement. 1</p><p>2 0.70662838 <a title="168-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Large-Scale_Distributed_Training_of_Conditional_Maximum_Entropy_Models.html">75 nips-2009-Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Training of Conditional Maximum Entropy Models</a></p>

We examine three common distributed training methods for conditional maxent: a distributed gradient computation method, a majority vote method, and a mixture weight method. We analyze and compare the CPU and network time complexity of each of these methods and present a theoretical analysis of conditional maxent models, including a study of the convergence of the mixture weight method, the most resource-efﬁcient technique. We also report the results of large-scale experiments comparing these three methods which demonstrate the beneﬁts of the mixture weight method: this method consumes less resources, while achieving a performance comparable to that of standard approaches.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.70190126 <a title="168-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Non-stationary_continuous_dynamic_Bayesian_networks.html">168 nips-2009-Non-stationary continuous dynamic Bayesian networks</a></p>

Our empirical studies with data classiﬁcation and face recognition show that the proposed algorithm is (i) effective for distance metric learning when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) efﬁcient and robust for high dimensional data.</p><p>5 0.63559318 <a title="168-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Match_Kernel_between_Sets_of_Features_for_Visual_Recognition.html">77 nips-2009-Efficient Match Kernel between Sets of Features for Visual Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Liefeng Bo, Cristian Sminchisescu</p><p>Abstract: In visual recognition, the images are frequently modeled as unordered collections of local features (bags). We show that bag-of-words representations commonly used in conjunction with linear classiﬁers can be viewed as special match kernels, which count 1 if two local features fall into the same regions partitioned by visual words and 0 otherwise. Despite its simplicity, this quantization is too coarse, motivating research into the design of match kernels that more accurately measure the similarity between local features. However, it is impractical to use such kernels for large datasets due to their signiﬁcant computational cost. To address this problem, we propose efﬁcient match kernels (EMK) that map local features to a low dimensional feature space and average the resulting vectors to form a setlevel feature. The local feature maps are learned so their inner products preserve, to the best possible, the values of the speciﬁed kernel function. Classiﬁers based on EMK are linear both in the number of images and in the number of local features. We demonstrate that EMK are extremely efﬁcient and achieve the current state of the art in three difﬁcult computer vision datasets: Scene-15, Caltech-101 and Caltech-256. 1</p><p>6 0.57520008 <a title="168-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Monte_Carlo_Sampling_for_Regret_Minimization_in_Extensive_Games.html">156 nips-2009-Monte Carlo Sampling for Regret Minimization in Extensive Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenming Zheng, Zhouchen Lin</p><p>Abstract: The method of common spatio-spectral patterns (CSSPs) is an extension of common spatial patterns (CSPs) by utilizing the technique of delay embedding to alleviate the adverse effects of noises and artifacts on the electroencephalogram (EEG) classiﬁcation. Although the CSSPs method has shown to be more powerful than the CSPs method in the EEG classiﬁcation, this method is only suitable for two-class EEG classiﬁcation problems. In this paper, we generalize the two-class CSSPs method to multi-class cases. To this end, we ﬁrst develop a novel theory of multi-class Bayes error estimation and then present the multi-class CSSPs (MCSSPs) method based on this Bayes error theoretical framework. By minimizing the estimated closed-form Bayes error, we obtain the optimal spatio-spectral ﬁlters of MCSSPs. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on the BCI competition 2005 data set. The experimental results show that our method signiﬁcantly outperforms the previous multi-class CSPs (MCSPs) methods in the EEG classiﬁcation.</p><p>3 0.11577985 <a title="237-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Time-Varying_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">246 nips-2009-Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Le Song, Mladen Kolar, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: Directed graphical models such as Bayesian networks are a favored formalism for modeling the dependency structures in complex multivariate systems such as those encountered in biology and neural science. When a system is undergoing dynamic transformation, temporally rewiring networks are needed for capturing the dynamic causal inﬂuences between covariates. In this paper, we propose time-varying dynamic Bayesian networks (TV-DBN) for modeling the structurally varying directed dependency structures underlying non-stationary biological/neural time series. This is a challenging problem due the non-stationarity and sample scarcity of time series data. We present a kernel reweighted 1 -regularized auto-regressive procedure for this problem which enjoys nice properties such as computational efﬁciency and provable asymptotic consistency. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst practical and statistically sound method for structure learning of TVDBNs. We applied TV-DBNs to time series measurements during yeast cell cycle and brain response to visual stimuli. In both cases, TV-DBNs reveal interesting dynamics underlying the respective biological systems. 1</p><p>4 0.11440372 <a title="237-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-A_Biologically_Plausible_Model_for_Rapid_Natural_Scene_Identification.html">6 nips-2009-A Biologically Plausible Model for Rapid Natural Scene Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Sennay Ghebreab, Steven Scholte, Victor Lamme, Arnold Smeulders</p><p>Abstract: Contrast statistics of the majority of natural images conform to a Weibull distribution. This property of natural images may facilitate efficient and very rapid extraction of a scene's visual gist. Here we investigated whether a neural response model based on the Wei bull contrast distribution captures visual information that humans use to rapidly identify natural scenes. In a learning phase, we measured EEG activity of 32 subjects viewing brief flashes of 700 natural scenes. From these neural measurements and the contrast statistics of the natural image stimuli, we derived an across subject Wei bull response model. We used this model to predict the EEG responses to 100 new natural scenes and estimated which scene the subject viewed by finding the best match between the model predictions and the observed EEG responses. In almost 90 percent of the cases our model accurately predicted the observed scene. Moreover, in most failed cases, the scene mistaken for the observed scene was visually similar to the observed scene itself. Similar results were obtained in a separate experiment in which 16 other subjects where presented with artificial occlusion models of natural images. Together, these results suggest that Weibull contrast statistics of natural images contain a considerable amount of visual gist information to warrant rapid image identification.</p><p>5 0.11361974 <a title="237-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Augmenting_Feature-driven_fMRI_Analyses%3A_Semi-supervised_learning_and_resting_state_activity.html">38 nips-2009-Augmenting Feature-driven fMRI Analyses: Semi-supervised learning and resting state activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Andreas Bartels, Matthew Blaschko, Jacquelyn A. Shelton</p><p>Abstract: Resting state activity is brain activation that arises in the absence of any task, and is usually measured in awake subjects during prolonged fMRI scanning sessions where the only instruction given is to close the eyes and do nothing. It has been recognized in recent years that resting state activity is implicated in a wide variety of brain function. While certain networks of brain areas have different levels of activation at rest and during a task, there is nevertheless signiﬁcant similarity between activations in the two cases. This suggests that recordings of resting state activity can be used as a source of unlabeled data to augment discriminative regression techniques in a semi-supervised setting. We evaluate this setting empirically yielding three main results: (i) regression tends to be improved by the use of Laplacian regularization even when no additional unlabeled data are available, (ii) resting state data seem to have a similar marginal distribution to that recorded during the execution of a visual processing task implying largely similar types of activation, and (iii) this source of information can be broadly exploited to improve the robustness of empirical inference in fMRI studies, an inherently data poor domain. 1</p><p>6 0.10603553 <a title="237-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-The_%27tree-dependent_components%27_of_natural_scenes_are_edge_filters.html">241 nips-2009-The 'tree-dependent components' of natural scenes are edge filters</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert Wilson, Leif Finkel</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests that the brain is capable of approximating Bayesian inference in the face of noisy input stimuli. Despite this progress, the neural underpinnings of this computation are still poorly understood. In this paper we focus on the Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic time series and introduce a novel neural network, derived from a line attractor architecture, whose dynamics map directly onto those of the Kalman ﬁlter in the limit of small prediction error. When the prediction error is large we show that the network responds robustly to changepoints in a way that is qualitatively compatible with the optimal Bayesian model. The model suggests ways in which probability distributions are encoded in the brain and makes a number of testable experimental predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.45912877 <a title="237-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Predicting_the_Optimal_Spacing_of_Study%3A_A_Multiscale_Context_Model_of_Memory.html">194 nips-2009-Predicting the Optimal Spacing of Study: A Multiscale Context Model of Memory</a></p>

Our ofﬂine results indicate that BCI-na¨ve ı users could start real-time BCI use with no prior calibration at only a very moderate performance loss.</p><p>2 0.7065931 <a title="237-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Models_for_Unsupervised_Event_Coreference_Resolution.html">171 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Models for Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Cosmin Bejan, Matthew Titsworth, Andrew Hickl, Sanda Harabagiu</p><p>Abstract: We present a sequence of unsupervised, nonparametric Bayesian models for clustering complex linguistic objects. In this approach, we consider a potentially inﬁnite number of features and categorical outcomes. We evaluated these models for the task of within- and cross-document event coreference on two corpora. All the models we investigated show signiﬁcant improvements when compared against an existing baseline for this task.</p><p>3 0.66395491 <a title="237-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Breaking_Boundaries_Between_Induction_Time_and_Diagnosis_Time_Active_Information_Acquisition.html">49 nips-2009-Breaking Boundaries Between Induction Time and Diagnosis Time Active Information Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: To date, the processes employed for active information acquisition during periods of learning and diagnosis have been considered as separate and have been applied in distinct phases of analysis. While active learning centers on the collection of information about training cases in order to build better predictive models, diagnosis uses ﬁxed predictive models for guiding the collection of observations about a speciﬁc test case at hand. We introduce a model and inferential methods that bridge these phases of analysis into a holistic approach to information acquisition that considers simultaneously the extension of the predictive model and the probing of a case at hand. The bridging of active learning and real-time diagnostic feature acquisition leads to a new class of policies for learning and diagnosis. 1</p><p>4 0.62976623 <a title="237-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_General_Projection_Property_for_Distribution_Families.html">11 nips-2009-A General Projection Property for Distribution Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Yao-liang Yu, Yuxi Li, Dale Schuurmans, Csaba Szepesvári</p><p>Abstract: Surjectivity of linear projections between distribution families with ﬁxed mean and covariance (regardless of dimension) is re-derived by a new proof. We further extend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints, such as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classiﬁcation, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes. 1</p><p>5 0.59508181 <a title="237-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-On_Stochastic_and_Worst-case_Models_for_Investing.html">178 nips-2009-On Stochastic and Worst-case Models for Investing</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>6 0.58140343 <a title="237-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>

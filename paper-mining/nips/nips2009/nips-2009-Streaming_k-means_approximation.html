<p>Author: Lei Wu, Rong Jin, Steven C. Hoi, Jianke Zhu, Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Learning distance functions with side information plays a key role in many machine learning and data mining applications. Conventional approaches often assume a Mahalanobis distance function. These approaches are limited in two aspects: (i) they are computationally expensive (even infeasible) for high dimensional data because the size of the metric is in the square of dimensionality; (ii) they assume a ﬁxed metric for the entire input space and therefore are unable to handle heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme that learns nonlinear Bregman distance functions from side information using a nonparametric approach that is similar to support vector machines. The proposed scheme avoids the assumption of ﬁxed metric by implicitly deriving a local distance from the Hessian matrix of a convex function that is used to generate the Bregman distance function. We also present an efﬁcient learning algorithm for the proposed scheme for distance function learning. The extensive experiments with semi-supervised clustering show the proposed technique (i) outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches for distance function learning, and (ii) is computationally efﬁcient for high dimensional data. 1</p><p>3 0.11562246 <a title="234-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-A_Game-Theoretic_Approach_to_Hypergraph_Clustering.html">9 nips-2009-A Game-Theoretic Approach to Hypergraph Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel R. Bulò, Marcello Pelillo</p><p>Abstract: Hypergraph clustering refers to the process of extracting maximally coherent groups from a set of objects using high-order (rather than pairwise) similarities. Traditional approaches to this problem are based on the idea of partitioning the input data into a user-deﬁned number of classes, thereby obtaining the clusters as a by-product of the partitioning process. In this paper, we provide a radically different perspective to the problem. In contrast to the classical approach, we attempt to provide a meaningful formalization of the very notion of a cluster and we show that game theory offers an attractive and unexplored perspective that serves well our purpose. Speciﬁcally, we show that the hypergraph clustering problem can be naturally cast into a non-cooperative multi-player “clustering game”, whereby the notion of a cluster is equivalent to a classical game-theoretic equilibrium concept. From the computational viewpoint, we show that the problem of ﬁnding the equilibria of our clustering game is equivalent to locally optimizing a polynomial function over the standard simplex, and we provide a discrete-time dynamics to perform this optimization. Experiments are presented which show the superiority of our approach over state-of-the-art hypergraph clustering techniques.</p><p>4 0.10131512 <a title="234-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Parallel_Inference_for_Latent_Dirichlet_Allocation_on_Graphics_Processing_Units.html">186 nips-2009-Parallel Inference for Latent Dirichlet Allocation on Graphics Processing Units</a></p>
<p>Author: Feng Yan, Ningyi Xu, Yuan Qi</p><p>Abstract: The recent emergence of Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) as general-purpose parallel computing devices provides us with new opportunities to develop scalable learning methods for massive data. In this work, we consider the problem of parallelizing two inference methods on GPUs for latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) models, collapsed Gibbs sampling (CGS) and collapsed variational Bayesian (CVB). To address limited memory constraints on GPUs, we propose a novel data partitioning scheme that effectively reduces the memory cost. This partitioning scheme also balances the computational cost on each multiprocessor and enables us to easily avoid memory access conﬂicts. We use data streaming to handle extremely large datasets. Extensive experiments showed that our parallel inference methods consistently produced LDA models with the same predictive power as sequential training methods did but with 26x speedup for CGS and 196x speedup for CVB on a GPU with 30 multiprocessors. The proposed partitioning scheme and data streaming make our approach scalable with more multiprocessors. Furthermore, they can be used as general techniques to parallelize other machine learning models. 1</p><p>5 0.081684895 <a title="234-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_Feature_Selection_for_the_%24k%24-means_Clustering_Problem.html">252 nips-2009-Unsupervised Feature Selection for the $k$-means Clustering Problem</a></p>

<p>Author: Jong K. Kim, Seungjin Choi</p><p>Abstract: Most of existing methods for DNA motif discovery consider only a single set of sequences to ﬁnd an over-represented motif. In contrast, we consider multiple sets of sequences where we group sets associated with the same motif into a cluster, assuming that each set involves a single motif. Clustering sets of sequences yields clusters of coherent motifs, improving signal-to-noise ratio or enabling us to identify multiple motifs. We present a probabilistic model for DNA motif discovery where we identify multiple motifs through searching for patterns which are shared across multiple sets of sequences. Our model infers cluster-indicating latent variables and learns motifs simultaneously, where these two tasks interact with each other. We show that our model can handle various motif discovery problems, depending on how to construct multiple sets of sequences. Experiments on three different problems for discovering DNA motifs emphasize the useful behavior and conﬁrm the substantial gains over existing methods where only a single set of sequences is considered.</p><p>5 0.54516059 <a title="234-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Optimal_Scoring_for_Unsupervised_Learning.html">182 nips-2009-Optimal Scoring for Unsupervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhihua Zhang, Guang Dai</p><p>Abstract: We are often interested in casting classiﬁcation and clustering problems as a regression framework, because it is feasible to achieve some statistical properties in this framework by imposing some penalty criteria. In this paper we illustrate optimal scoring, which was originally proposed for performing the Fisher linear discriminant analysis by regression, in the application of unsupervised learning. In particular, we devise a novel clustering algorithm that we call optimal discriminant clustering. We associate our algorithm with the existing unsupervised learning algorithms such as spectral clustering, discriminative clustering and sparse principal component analysis. Experimental results on a collection of benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the optimal discriminant clustering algorithm.</p><p>6 0.53789955 <a title="234-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Modelling_Relational_Data_using_Bayesian_Clustered_Tensor_Factorization.html">155 nips-2009-Modelling Relational Data using Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization</a></p>

<p>Author: Yiming Ying, Colin Campbell, Mark Girolami</p><p>Abstract: The recent introduction of indeﬁnite SVM by Luss and d’Aspremont [15] has effectively demonstrated SVM classiﬁcation with a non-positive semi-deﬁnite kernel (indeﬁnite kernel). This paper studies the properties of the objective function introduced there. In particular, we show that the objective function is continuously differentiable and its gradient can be explicitly computed. Indeed, we further show that its gradient is Lipschitz continuous. The main idea behind our analysis is that the objective function is smoothed by the penalty term, in its saddle (min-max) representation, measuring the distance between the indeﬁnite kernel matrix and the proxy positive semi-deﬁnite one. Our elementary result greatly facilitates the application of gradient-based algorithms. Based on our analysis, we further develop Nesterov’s smooth optimization approach [17, 18] for indeﬁnite SVM which has an optimal convergence rate for smooth problems. Experiments on various benchmark datasets validate our analysis and demonstrate the efﬁciency of our proposed algorithms.</p><p>3 0.60223645 <a title="234-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Manifold_Embeddings_for_Model-Based_Reinforcement_Learning_under_Partial_Observability.html">145 nips-2009-Manifold Embeddings for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning under Partial Observability</a></p>
<p>Author: Keith Bush, Joelle Pineau</p><p>Abstract: Interesting real-world datasets often exhibit nonlinear, noisy, continuous-valued states that are unexplorable, are poorly described by ﬁrst principles, and are only partially observable. If partial observability can be overcome, these constraints suggest the use of model-based reinforcement learning. We experiment with manifold embeddings to reconstruct the observable state-space in the context of offline, model-based reinforcement learning. We demonstrate that the embedding of a system can change as a result of learning, and we argue that the best performing embeddings well-represent the dynamics of both the uncontrolled and adaptively controlled system. We apply this approach to learn a neurostimulation policy that suppresses epileptic seizures on animal brain slices. 1</p><p>4 0.6015135 <a title="234-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Markov random ﬁelds (MRF’s), or undirected graphical models, provide a powerful framework for modeling complex dependencies among random variables. Maximum likelihood learning in MRF’s is hard due to the presence of the global normalizing constant. In this paper we consider a class of stochastic approximation algorithms of the Robbins-Monro type that use Markov chain Monte Carlo to do approximate maximum likelihood learning. We show that using MCMC operators based on tempered transitions enables the stochastic approximation algorithm to better explore highly multimodal distributions, which considerably improves parameter estimates in large, densely-connected MRF’s. Our results on MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that we can successfully learn good generative models of high-dimensional, richly structured data that perform well on digit and object recognition tasks.</p><p>5 0.60037196 <a title="234-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Maximum_likelihood_trajectories_for_continuous-time_Markov_chains.html">150 nips-2009-Maximum likelihood trajectories for continuous-time Markov chains</a></p>
<p>Author: Theodore J. Perkins</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains are used to model systems in which transitions between states as well as the time the system spends in each state are random. Many computational problems related to such chains have been solved, including determining state distributions as a function of time, parameter estimation, and control. However, the problem of inferring most likely trajectories, where a trajectory is a sequence of states as well as the amount of time spent in each state, appears unsolved. We study three versions of this problem: (i) an initial value problem, in which an initial state is given and we seek the most likely trajectory until a given ﬁnal time, (ii) a boundary value problem, in which initial and ﬁnal states and times are given, and we seek the most likely trajectory connecting them, and (iii) trajectory inference under partial observability, analogous to ﬁnding maximum likelihood trajectories for hidden Markov models. We show that maximum likelihood trajectories are not always well-deﬁned, and describe a polynomial time test for well-deﬁnedness. When well-deﬁnedness holds, we show that each of the three problems can be solved in polynomial time, and we develop efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms for doing so. 1</p><p>6 0.59942794 <a title="234-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Fast_subtree_kernels_on_graphs.html">95 nips-2009-Fast subtree kernels on graphs</a></p>

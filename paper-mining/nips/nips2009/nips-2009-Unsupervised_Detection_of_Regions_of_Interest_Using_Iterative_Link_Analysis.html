<p>Author: Bangpeng Yao, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: The human brain can be described as containing a number of functional regions. These regions, as well as the connections between them, play a key role in information processing in the brain. However, most existing multi-voxel pattern analysis approaches either treat multiple regions as one large uniform region or several independent regions, ignoring the connections between them. In this paper we propose to model such connections in an Hidden Conditional Random Field (HCRF) framework, where the classiďŹ er of one region of interest (ROI) makes predictions based on not only its voxels but also the predictions from ROIs that it connects to. Furthermore, we propose a structural learning method in the HCRF framework to automatically uncover the connections between ROIs. We illustrate this approach with fMRI data acquired while human subjects viewed images of different natural scene categories and show that our model can improve the top-level (the classiďŹ er combining information from all ROIs) and ROI-level prediction accuracy, as well as uncover some meaningful connections between ROIs. 1</p><p>3 0.19107401 <a title="251-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Discriminative_Network_Models_of_Schizophrenia.html">70 nips-2009-Discriminative Network Models of Schizophrenia</a></p>

Cecchi</p><p>Abstract: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that has eluded a characterization in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity, and is hypothesized to affect the collective, “emergent” working of the brain. We propose a novel data-driven approach to capture emergent features using functional brain networks [4] extracted from fMRI data, and demonstrate its advantage over traditional region-of-interest (ROI) and local, task-speciﬁc linear activation analyzes. Our results suggest that schizophrenia is indeed associated with disruption of global brain properties related to its functioning as a network, which cannot be explained by alteration of local activation patterns. Moreover, further exploitation of interactions by sparse Markov Random Field classiﬁers shows clear gain over linear methods, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM, allowing to reach 86% accuracy (over 50% baseline - random guess), which is quite remarkable given that it is based on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task. 1</p><p>4 0.17775629 <a title="251-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Exploring_Functional_Connectivities_of_the_Human_Brain_using_Multivariate_Information_Analysis.html">86 nips-2009-Exploring Functional Connectivities of the Human Brain using Multivariate Information Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Barry Chai, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we present a new method for establishing fMRI pattern-based functional connectivity between brain regions by estimating their multivariate mutual information. Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to ﬁnd strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.</p><p>5 0.16085215 <a title="251-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Breaking_Boundaries_Between_Induction_Time_and_Diagnosis_Time_Active_Information_Acquisition.html">49 nips-2009-Breaking Boundaries Between Induction Time and Diagnosis Time Active Information Acquisition</a></p>
<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: To date, the processes employed for active information acquisition during periods of learning and diagnosis have been considered as separate and have been applied in distinct phases of analysis. While active learning centers on the collection of information about training cases in order to build better predictive models, diagnosis uses ﬁxed predictive models for guiding the collection of observations about a speciﬁc test case at hand. We introduce a model and inferential methods that bridge these phases of analysis into a holistic approach to information acquisition that considers simultaneously the extension of the predictive model and the probing of a case at hand. The bridging of active learning and real-time diagnostic feature acquisition leads to a new class of policies for learning and diagnosis. 1</p><p>6 0.12788594 <a title="251-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Segmenting_Scenes_by_Matching_Image_Composites.html">211 nips-2009-Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites</a></p>

<p>Author: Peilin Zhao, Steven C. Hoi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In most online learning algorithms, the weights assigned to the misclassiﬁed examples (or support vectors) remain unchanged during the entire learning process. This is clearly insufﬁcient since when a new misclassiﬁed example is added to the pool of support vectors, we generally expect it to affect the weights for the existing support vectors. In this paper, we propose a new online learning method, termed Double Updating Online Learning, or DUOL for short. Instead of only assigning a ﬁxed weight to the misclassiﬁed example received in current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be signiﬁcantly improved by the proposed online learning method. Encouraging experimental results show that the proposed technique is in general considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7768665 <a title="251-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_Detection_of_Regions_of_Interest_Using_Iterative_Link_Analysis.html">251 nips-2009-Unsupervised Detection of Regions of Interest Using Iterative Link Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Bing Bai, Jason Weston, David Grangier, Ronan Collobert, Kunihiko Sadamasa, Yanjun Qi, Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: We present a class of nonlinear (polynomial) models that are discriminatively trained to directly map from the word content in a query-document or documentdocument pair to a ranking score. Dealing with polynomial models on word features is computationally challenging. We propose a low-rank (but diagonal preserving) representation of our polynomial models to induce feasible memory and computation requirements. We provide an empirical study on retrieval tasks based on Wikipedia documents, where we obtain state-of-the-art performance while providing realistically scalable methods. 1</p><p>4 0.68867862 <a title="251-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Modeling_Social_Annotation_Data_with_Content_Relevance_using_a_Topic_Model.html">153 nips-2009-Modeling Social Annotation Data with Content Relevance using a Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomoharu Iwata, Takeshi Yamada, Naonori Ueda</p><p>Abstract: We propose a probabilistic topic model for analyzing and extracting contentrelated annotations from noisy annotated discrete data such as web pages stored in social bookmarking services. In these services, since users can attach annotations freely, some annotations do not describe the semantics of the content, thus they are noisy, i.e. not content-related. The extraction of content-related annotations can be used as a preprocessing step in machine learning tasks such as text classiﬁcation and image recognition, or can improve information retrieval performance. The proposed model is a generative model for content and annotations, in which the annotations are assumed to originate either from topics that generated the content or from a general distribution unrelated to the content. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using synthetic data and real social annotation data for text and images.</p><p>5 0.68743765 <a title="251-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>6 0.68739808 <a title="251-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>

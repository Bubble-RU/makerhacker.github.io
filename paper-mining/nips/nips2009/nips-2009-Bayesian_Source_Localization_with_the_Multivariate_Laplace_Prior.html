<p>Author: Mikkel Schmidt</p><p>Abstract: We present a general Bayesian approach to probabilistic matrix factorization subject to linear constraints. The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to extract meaningful and interpretable features that are remarkably different from features extracted using existing related matrix factorization techniques.</p><p>3 0.23920563 <a title="41-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-A_Sparse_Non-Parametric_Approach_for_Single_Channel_Separation_of_Known_Sounds.html">17 nips-2009-A Sparse Non-Parametric Approach for Single Channel Separation of Known Sounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Paris Smaragdis, Madhusudana Shashanka, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm for separating mixed sounds from a monophonic recording. Our approach makes use of training data which allows us to learn representations of the types of sounds that compose the mixture. In contrast to popular methods that attempt to extract compact generalizable models for each sound from training data, we employ the training data itself as a representation of the sources in the mixture. We show that mixtures of known sounds can be described as sparse combinations of the training data itself, and in doing so produce signiﬁcantly better separation results as compared to similar systems based on compact statistical models.

<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Peter Spirtes, Robert E. Tillman</p><p>Abstract: The recently proposed additive noise model has advantages over previous directed structure learning approaches since it (i) does not assume linearity or Gaussianity and (ii) can discover a unique DAG rather than its Markov equivalence class. However, for certain distributions, e.g. linear Gaussians, the additive noise model is invertible and thus not useful for structure learning, and it was originally proposed for the two variable case with a multivariate extension which requires enumerating all possible DAGs. We introduce weakly additive noise models, which extends this framework to cases where the additive noise model is invertible and when additive noise is not present. We then provide an algorithm that learns an equivalence class for such models from data, by combining a PC style search using recent advances in kernel measures of conditional dependence with local searches for additive noise models in substructures of the Markov equivalence class. This results in a more computationally eﬃcient approach that is useful for arbitrary distributions even when additive noise models are invertible. 1</p><p>5 0.1558709 <a title="41-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Gaussian_process_regression_with_Student-t_likelihood.html">100 nips-2009-Gaussian process regression with Student-t likelihood</a></p>
<p>Author: Jarno Vanhatalo, Pasi Jylänki, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: In the Gaussian process regression the observation model is commonly assumed to be Gaussian, which is convenient in computational perspective. However, the drawback is that the predictive accuracy of the model can be signiﬁcantly compromised if the observations are contaminated by outliers. A robust observation model, such as the Student-t distribution, reduces the inﬂuence of outlying observations and improves the predictions. The problem, however, is the analytically intractable inference. In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference. We compare our approach to a variational approximation and a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, which utilize the commonly used scale mixture representation of the Student-t distribution. 1</p><p>6 0.13153191 <a title="41-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Augmenting_Feature-driven_fMRI_Analyses%3A_Semi-supervised_learning_and_resting_state_activity.html">38 nips-2009-Augmenting Feature-driven fMRI Analyses: Semi-supervised learning and resting state activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Khashayar Rohanimanesh, Sameer Singh, Andrew McCallum, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Large, relational factor graphs with structure deﬁned by ﬁrst-order logic or other languages give rise to notoriously difﬁcult inference problems. Because unrolling the structure necessary to represent distributions over all hypotheses has exponential blow-up, solutions are often derived from MCMC. However, because of limitations in the design and parameterization of the jump function, these samplingbased methods suffer from local minima—the system must transition through lower-scoring conﬁgurations before arriving at a better MAP solution. This paper presents a new method of explicitly selecting fruitful downward jumps by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than setting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the training data, parameters of the factor graph are treated as a log-linear function approximator and learned with methods of temporal difference (TD); MAP inference is performed by executing the resulting policy on held out test data. Our method allows efﬁcient gradient updates since only factors in the neighborhood of variables affected by an action need to be computed—we bypass the need to compute marginals entirely. Our method yields dramatic empirical success, producing new state-of-the-art results on a complex joint model of ontology alignment, with a 48% reduction in error over state-of-the-art in that domain. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.86968195 <a title="41-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>

<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.86595434 <a title="41-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Positive_Semidefinite_Metric_Learning_with_Boosting.html">191 nips-2009-Positive Semidefinite Metric Learning with Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The learning of appropriate distance metrics is a critical problem in image classiﬁcation and retrieval. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One of the primary difﬁculties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the Mahalanobis matrix remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on a key observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement, does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time. 1</p><p>5 0.86576599 <a title="41-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Texture_Learning_and_Synthesis.html">172 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Texture Learning and Synthesis</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Zhu, Yuanahao Chen, Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for texture learning and synthesis. A texture image is represented by a 2D Hidden Markov Model (2DHMM) where the hidden states correspond to the cluster labeling of textons and the transition matrix encodes their spatial layout (the compatibility between adjacent textons). The 2DHMM is coupled with the Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which allows the number of textons and the complexity of transition matrix grow as the input texture becomes irregular. The HDP makes use of Dirichlet process prior which favors regular textures by penalizing the model complexity. This framework (HDP-2DHMM) learns the texton vocabulary and their spatial layout jointly and automatically. The HDP-2DHMM results in a compact representation of textures which allows fast texture synthesis with comparable rendering quality over the state-of-the-art patch-based rendering methods. We also show that the HDP2DHMM can be applied to perform image segmentation and synthesis. The preliminary results suggest that HDP-2DHMM is generally useful for further applications in low-level vision problems. 1</p><p>6 0.86036843 <a title="41-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Regression_using_Hessian_energy_with_an_application_to_semi-supervised_dimensionality_reduction.html">214 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Regression using Hessian energy with an application to semi-supervised dimensionality reduction</a></p>

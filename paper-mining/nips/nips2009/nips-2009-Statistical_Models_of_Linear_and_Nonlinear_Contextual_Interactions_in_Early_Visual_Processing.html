<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>3 0.20167726 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Extending_Phase_Mechanism_to_Differential_Motion_Opponency_for_Motion_Pop-out.html">88 nips-2009-Extending Phase Mechanism to Differential Motion Opponency for Motion Pop-out</a></p>
<p>Author: Yicong Meng, Bertram E. Shi</p><p>Abstract: We extend the concept of phase tuning, a ubiquitous mechanism among sensory neurons including motion and disparity selective neurons, to the motion contrast detection. We demonstrate that the motion contrast can be detected by phase shifts between motion neuronal responses in different spatial regions. By constructing the differential motion opponency in response to motions in two different spatial regions, varying motion contrasts can be detected, where similar motion is detected by zero phase shifts and differences in motion by non-zero phase shifts. The model can exhibit either enhancement or suppression of responses by either different or similar motion in the surrounding. A primary advantage of the model is that the responses are selective to relative motion instead of absolute motion, which could model neurons found in neurophysiological experiments responsible for motion pop-out detection. 1 In trod u ction Motion discontinuity or motion contrast is an important cue for the pop-out of salient moving objects from contextual backgrounds. Although the neural mechanism underlying the motion pop-out detection is still unknown, the center-surround receptive field (RF) organization is considered as a physiological basis responsible for the pop-out detection. The center-surround RF structure is simple and ubiquitous in cortical cells especially in neurons processing motion and color information. Nakayama and Loomis [1] have predicted the existence of motion selective neurons with antagonistic center-surround receptive field organization in 1974. Recent physiological experiments [2][3] show that neurons with center-surround RFs have been found in both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas related to motion processing. This antagonistic mechanism has been suggested to detect motion segmentation [4], figure/ground segregation [5] and the differentiation of object motion from ego-motion [6]. There are many related works [7]-[12] on motion pop-out detection. Some works [7]-[9] are based on spatio-temporal filtering outputs, but motion neurons are not fully interacted by either only inhibiting similar motion [7] or only enhancing opposite motion [8]. Heeger, et al. [7] proposed a center-surround operator to eliminate the response dependence upon rotational motions. But the Heeger's model only shows a complete center-surround interaction for moving directions. With respect to the surrounding speed effects, the neuronal responses are suppressed by the same speed with the center motion but not enhanced by other speeds. Similar problem existed in [8], which only modeled the suppression of neuronal responses in the classical receptive field (CRF) by similar motions in surrounding regions. Physiological experiments [10][11] show that many neurons in visual cortex are sensitive to the motion contrast rather than depend upon the absolute direction and speed of the object motion. Although pooling over motion neurons tuned to different velocities can eliminate the dependence upon absolute velocities, it is computationally inefficient and still can't give full interactions of both suppression and enhancement by similar and opposite surrounding motions. The model proposed by Dellen, et al. [12] computed differential motion responses directly from complex cells in V1 and didn't utilize responses from direction selective neurons. In this paper, we propose an opponency model which directly responds to differential motions by utilizing the phase shift mechanism. Phase tuning is a ubiquitous mechanism in sensory information processing, including motion, disparity and depth detection. Disparity selective neurons in the visual cortex have been found to detect disparities by adjusting the phase shift between the receptive field organizations in the left and right eyes [13][14]. Motion sensitive cells have been modeled in the similar way as the disparity energy neurons and detect image motions by utilizing the phase shift between the real and imaginary parts of temporal complex valued responses, which are comparable to images to the left and right eyes [15]. Therefore, the differential motion can be modeled by exploring the similarity between images from different spatial regions and from different eyes. The remainder of this paper is organized as following. Section 2 illustrates the phase shift motion energy neurons which estimate image velocities by the phase tuning in the imaginary path of the temporal receptive field responses. In section 3, we extend the concept of phase tuning to the construction of differential motion opponency. The phase difference determines the preferred velocity difference between adjacent areas in retinal images. Section 4 investigates properties of motion pop-out detection by the proposed motion opponency model. Finally, in section 5, we relate our proposed model to the neural mechanism of motion integration and motion segmentation in motion related areas and suggest a possible interpretation for adaptive center-surround interactions observed in biological experiments. 2 Phase Shift Motion Energy Neurons Adelson and Bergen [16] proposed the motion energy model for visual motion perception by measuring spatio-temporal orientations of image sequences in space and time. The motion energy model posits that the responses of direction-selective V1 complex cells can be computed by a combination of two linear spatio-temporal filtering stages, followed by squaring and summation. The motion energy model was extended in [15] to be phase tuned by splitting the complex valued temporal responses into real and imaginary paths and adding a phase shift on the imaginary path. Figure 1(a) demonstrates the schematic diagram of the phase shift motion energy model. Here we assume an input image sequence in two-dimensional space (x, y) and time t. The separable spatio-temporal receptive field ensures the cascade implementation of RF with spatial and temporal filters. Due to the requirement of the causal temporal RF, the phase shift motion energy model didn’t adopt the Gabor filter like the spatial RF. The phase shift spatio-temporal RF is modeled with a complex valued function f ( x, y, t ) = g ( x, y ) ⋅ h ( t , Φ ) , where the spatial and temporal RFs are denoted by g ( x, y ) and h ( t , Φ ) respectively, g ( x, y ) = N ( x, y | 0, C ) exp ( jΩ x x + jΩ y y ) h ( t , Φ ) = hreal ( t ) + exp ( jΦ ) himag ( t ) (1) and C is the covariance matrix of the spatial Gaussian envelope and Φ is the phase tuning of the motion energy neuron. The real and imaginary profiles of the temporal receptive field are Gamma modulated sinusoidal functions with quadrature phases, hreal ( t ) = G ( t | α ,τ ) cos ( Ωt t ) (2) himag ( t ) = G ( t | α ,τ ) sin ( Ωt t ) The envelopes for complex exponentials are functions of Gaussian and Gamma distributions, N ( x, y | 0, C ) = ⎛ x2 y2 exp ⎜ − 2 − 2 ⎜ 2σ x 2σ y 2πσ xσ y ⎝ 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (3) hreal (t ) g ( x, y ) himag (t ) g ( x, y ) (·)2 (·)2 M M M (·)2 (·)2 M M M 2 (·) 2 (·) Vreal V (Φ ) e jΦ Vimag (a) Ev ( Φ max ) (·)2 wc ( x, y ) e jΦmin Ev ( (b) M 0 ) w ( x, y ) c M Ev ( Φ min ) M EΔv ( Θ ) ∫∫∫ K x , y ,Φ e j0 e jΦmin ws ( x, y ) Ks c e ∫∫∫ jΘ ws ( x, y ) e j0 x , y ,Φ ws ( x, y ) wc ( x, y ) M e jΦ max e jΦmax (·)2 M (·)2 M M (·)2 M 2 (·) M M (·)2 (c) Figure 1.

As derived in [15], the motion energy at location (x, y) can be computed by E v ( x, y, Φ ) = S + P cos ( Ψ − Φ ) (5) where S = Vreal 2 + Vimag 2 * P = 2 VrealVimag ( * Ψ = arg VrealVimag (6) ) and complex valued responses in real and imaginary paths are obtained as, Vreal ( x, y, t ) = ∫∫∫ g (ξ , ζ ) h (η ) I ( x − ξ , y − ζ , t − η ) dξ dζ dη real ξ ,ζ ,η Vimag ( x, y, t ) = ∫∫∫ g (ξ , ζ ) h (η ) I ( x − ξ , y − ζ , t − η ) dξ dζ dη ξ ζ η (7) imag , , The superscript * represents the complex conjugation and the phase shift parameter Φ controls the spatio-temporal orientation tuning. To avoid clutter, the spatial location variables x and y for S, P, Ψ, Vreal and Vimag are not explicitly shown in Eq. (5) and (6).

Two types of differential motion opponency constructions of (a) center-surrounding interaction and (b) left-right interaction.

Across regions of different motions, there are clear discontinuities on the estimated velocity map. The motion discontinuities can be detected by edge detectors on the velocity map to segment different motions. However, this algorithm for motion discontinuities detection can’t discriminate between the object motion and uniform motions in contextual backgrounds. Here we propose a phase mechanism to detect differential motions inspired by the disparity energy model and adopt the center-surround inhibition mechanism to pop out the object motion from contextual background motions. The motion differences between different spatial locations can be modeled in the similar way as the disparity model. The motion energies from two neighboring locations are considered as the retinal images to the left and right eyes. Thus, we can construct a differential motion opponency by placing two populations of phase shift motion energy neurons at different spatial locations and the energy EΔv ( Θ ) of the opponency is the squared modulus of the averaged phase shift motion energies over space and phase, E Δv ( Θ ) = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) ⋅ w ( x, y, Φ | Θ ) dxdyd Φ v 2 (8) where w ( x, y, Θ ) is the profile for differential motion opponency and Δv is the velocity difference between the two spatial regions defined by the kernel w ( x, y, Θ ) . Since w ( x, y, Θ ) is intended to implement the functional role of spatial interactions, it is desired to be a separable function in space and phase domain and can be modeled by phase tuned summation of two spatial kernels, w ( x, y, Φ | Θ ) = wc ( x, y ) e jΦ + e jΘ+ jΦ ws ( x, y ) (9) where wc ( x, y ) and ws ( x, y ) are Gaussian kernels of different spatial sizes σ c and σ s , and Θ is the phase difference representing velocity difference between two spatial regions c and s. Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (8), the differential motion energy can be reformulated as EΔv ( Θ ) = K c + e jΘ K s 2 (10) 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 -1 -1 -2 -2 -2 -3 -3 -3 -3 -3 1 Right Velocity Right Velocity 0.98 0.96 0.94 0.92 0 0.9 0.88 -1 0.86 0.84 0.82 -2 -1 0 1 Left Velocity 2 3 -2 -1 0 1 Left Velocity 2 3 0.8 (a) (b) Figure 3. (a) Phase map and (b) peak magnitude map are obtained from stimuli of two patches of random dots moving with different velocities. The two patches of stimuli are statistically independent but share the same spatial properties: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and dot coherence level of 100%. The phase tuned population of motion energy neurons are applied to each patch of random dots with RF parameters: Ωt = 2π/8, Ωt = 2π/16, σx = 5 and τ = 5.5. For each combination of velocities from left and right patches, averaged phase shifts over space and time are computed and so do the magnitudes of peak responses. The unit for velocities is pixels per frame. where Kc = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) exp ( jΦ ) w ( x, y ) dxdyd Φ v,c c x , y ,Φ Ks = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) exp ( jΦ ) w ( x, y ) dxdyd Φ v,s (11) s x, y ,Φ Ev ,c ( x, y, Φ ) and Ev , s ( x, y, Φ ) are phase shift motion energies at location (x, y) and with phase shift Φ. Utilizing the results in Eq. (5) and (6), Eq. (10) and (11) generate similar results, E Δv ( Θ ) = Sopp + Popp cos ( Θopp − Θ ) (12) where Sopp = K c 2 + Ks Popp = 2 K c K s* 2 (13) Θopp = arg ( K c K s* ) According to above derivations, by varying the phase shift Θ between –π and π, the relative motion energy of the differential motion opponency can be modeled as population responses across a population of phase tuned motion opponencies. The response is completely specified by three parameters Sopp , Popp and Θopp . The schematic diagram of this opponency is illustrated in Figure 1(c). The differential motion opponency is constituted by three stages. At the first stage, a population of phase shift motion energy neurons is applied to be selective to different velocities. At the second stage, motion energies from the first stage are weighted by kernels tuned to different spatial locations and phase shifts respectively for both spatial regions and two single differential motion signals in region c and region s are achieved by integrating responses from these two regions over space and phase tuning. Finally, the differential motion energy is computed by the squared modulus of the summation of the integrated motion signal in region c and phase shifted motion signal in region s. The subscripts c and s represent two interacted spatial regions which are not limited to the center and surround regions. The opponency could also be constructed by the neighboring left and right Inhibitive interaction, Θ = π/2 Excitatory interaction, Θ =0 Inhibitory 2 1.6 Responses 1.6 Responses Excitatory 2 1.2 0.8 1.2 0.8 0.4 0.4 0 0 pi/2 pi 3pi/2 Surrouding Direction 0 0 2pi (a) Model by Petkov et al.

The center-surround inhibition models by Petkov, et al. [8] and Heeger, et al. [7] are shown in (c) and (d). Responses above 1 indicate enhancement and responses below 1 indicate suppressions. spatial regions. Figure 2 shows two types of structures for the differential motion opponency. In [17], the authors demonstrates that among cells in area MT with surrounding modulations, 25% of cells are with the antagonistic RF structure as shown in Figure 2(a) and another 50% of cells have the integrative RF structure as shown in Figure 2(b). The velocity difference tuning of the opponency is determined by the phase shift parameter Θ combined with parameters of spatial and temporal frequencies for motion energy neurons. The larger phase shift magnitude prefers the bigger velocity difference. This phase tuning of velocity difference is consistent with the phase tuning of motion energy neurons. Figure 3 shows the phase map obtained by using random dots stimuli with different velocities on two spatial patches (left and right patches with sizes of 128 pixels 128 pixels). Along the diagonal line, velocities from left and right patches are equal to each other and therefore phase estimates are zeros along this line. Deviated from the diagonal line to upper-left and lower-right, the phase magnitudes increase while positive phases indicate larger left velocities and negative phases indicate larger right velocities. The phase tuning can give a good classification of velocity differences. 4 V a l i d a t i o n o f D i f f e r e n t i a l M o t i o n O pp o n e n c y Out derivation and analysis above show that the phase shift between two neighboring spatial regions is a good indicator for motion difference between these two regions. In this section, we validate the proposed differential motion opponency by two sets of experiments, which show effects of both surrounding directions and speeds on the center motion.

The insensitivity of the proposed opponency model to absolute center and surrounding velocities is demonstrated in (a), where responses are enhanced for all center velocities from -2 to 2 pixels per frame. In (b), the model by Heeger, et al. [7] only shows enhancement when the center speed matches the preferred speed of 1.2 pixel per frame. Similarly, responses above 1 indicate enhancement and below 1 indicate suppressions. In both curves, the velocity differences between center and surrounding regions are maintained as a constant of 3 pixels per frame. Physiological experiments [2][3] have demonstrated that the neuronal activities in the classical receptive field are suppressed by responses outside the CRF to stimuli with similar motions including both directions and speeds on the center and surrounding regions. On the contrary, visual stimuli of opposite directions or quite different speeds outside the CRF enhance the responses in the CRF. In their experiments, they used a set of stimuli of random dots moving at different velocities, where there are small patches of moving random dots on the center. We tested the properties of the proposed opponency model for motion difference measurement by using similar random dots stimuli. The random dots on background move with different speeds and in different direction but have the same statistical parameters: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and motion coherence level of 100%. The small random dots patches are placed on the center of background stimuli to stimulate the neurons in the CRF. These small patches share the same statistical parameters with background random dots but move with a constant velocity of 1 pixel per frame. Figure 4 shows results for the enhanced and suppressed responses in the CRF with varying surrounding directions. The phase shift motion energy neurons had the same spatial and temporal frequencies and the same receptive field sizes, and were selective to vertical orientations. The preferred spatial frequency was 2π/16 radian per pixel and the temporal frequency was 2π/16 radian per frame. The sizes of RF in horizontal and vertical directions were respectively 5 pixels and 10 pixels, corresponding to a spatial bandwidth of 1.96 octaves. The time constant τ was 5.5 frames which resulted in a temporal bandwidth of 1.96 octaves. As shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b), the surrounding motion of opposite direction gives the largest response to the motion in the CRF for the inhibitory interaction and the smallest response for the excitatory interaction. Results demonstrated in Figure 4 are consistent with physiological results reported in [3]. In Born’s paper, inhibitory cells show response enhancement and excitatory cells show response suppression when surrounding motions are in opposite directions. The 3-dB bandwidth for the surrounding moving direction is about 135 degrees for the physiological experiments while the bandwidth is about 180 degrees for the simulation results in our proposed model. Models proposed by Petkov, et al. [8] and Heeger, et al. [7] also show clear inhibition between opposite motions. The Petkov’s model achieves the surrounding suppression for each point in ( x, y, t ) space by the subtraction between responses from that point and its surroundings and followed by a half-wave rectification, + % Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) = Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) − α ⋅ Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) (14) where Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the motion energy at location (x,y) and time t for a given preferred speed v and orientation θ, Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the average motion energy in the surrounding of point (x, y, t), % Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the suppressed motion energy and the factor α controls the inhibition strength. The inhibition term is computed by weighted motion energy Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) = Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) ∗ wv ,θ ( x, y, t ) (15) where wv ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the surround weighting function. The Heeger’s model constructs the center-surround motion opponent by computing the weighted sum of responses from motion selective cells, Rv ,θ ( t ) = ∑ β ( x, y ) ⎡ Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) − E− v ,θ ( x, y, t ) ⎤ ⎣ ⎦ (16) x, y where β ( x, y ) is a center-surround weighting function and the motion energy at each point should be normalized across all cells with different tuning properties. As shown in Figure 4 (c) and (d) for results of Petkov’s and Heeger’s models, we replace the conventional frequency tuned motion energy neuron with our proposed phase tuned neuron. The model by Petkov, et al. [8] is generally suppressive and only reproduces less suppression for opposite motions, which is inconsistent with results from [3]. The model by Heeger, et al. [7] has similar properties with our proposed model with respect to both excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed opponency model to velocity differences, we did simulations by using similar stimuli with the above experiment in Figure 4 but maintaining a constant velocity difference of 3 pixels per frame between the center and surrounding random dot patches. As shown in Figure 5, by varying the velocities of random dots on the center region, we found that responses by the proposed model are always enhanced independent upon absolute velocities of center stimuli, but responses by the Heeger’s model achieve the enhancement at a center velocity of 1.2 pixels per frame and maintain suppressed at other speeds. 5 D i s c u s s i on We proposed a new biologically plausible model of the differential motion opponency to model the spatial interaction property of motion energy neurons. The proposed opponency model is motivated by the phase tuning mechanism of disparity energy neurons which infers the disparity information from the phase difference between complex valued responses to left and right retinal images. Hence, the two neighboring spatial areas can be considered as left and right images and the motion difference between these two spatial regions is detected by the phase difference between the complex valued responses at these two regions. Our experimental results demonstrate a consistent conclusion with physiological experiments that motions of opposite directions and different speeds outside the CRF can show both inhibitive and excitatory effects on the CRF responses. The inhibitive interaction helps to segment the moving object from backgrounds when fed back to low-level features such as edges, orientations and color information. Except providing a unifying phase mechanism in understanding neurons with different functional roles at different brain areas, the proposed opponency model could possibly provide a way to understand the motion integration and motion segmentation. Integration and segmentation are two opposite motion perception tasks but co-exist to constitute two fundamental types of motion processing. Segmentation is achieved by discriminating motion signals from different objects, which is thought to be due to the antagonistic interaction between center and surrounding RFs. Integration is obtained by utilizing the enhancing function of surrounding areas to CRF areas. Both types of processing have been found in motion related areas including area MT and MST. Tadin, et al. [18] have found that motion segmentation dominants at high stimulus contrast and gives the way to motion integration at low stimulus contrast. Huang, et al. [19] suggests that the surrounding modulation is adaptive according to the visual stimulus such as contrasts and noise levels. Since our proposed opponency model determines the functional role of neurons by only the phase shift parameter, this makes the proposed model to be an ideal candidate model for the adaptive surrounding modulation with the phase tuning between two spatial regions.

<p>Author: Samuel Gershman, Ed Vul, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: While many perceptual and cognitive phenomena are well described in terms of Bayesian inference, the necessary computations are intractable at the scale of realworld tasks, and it remains unclear how the human mind approximates Bayesian computations algorithmically. We explore the proposal that for some tasks, humans use a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution over hidden variables. As a case study, we show how several phenomena of perceptual multistability can be explained as MCMC inference in simple graphical models for low-level vision. 1</p><p>5 0.1545988 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Non-Parametric_Bayesian_Dictionary_Learning_for_Sparse_Image_Representations.html">167 nips-2009-Non-Parametric Bayesian Dictionary Learning for Sparse Image Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Mingyuan Zhou, Haojun Chen, Lu Ren, Guillermo Sapiro, Lawrence Carin, John W. Paisley</p><p>Abstract: Non-parametric Bayesian techniques are considered for learning dictionaries for sparse image representations, with applications in denoising, inpainting and compressive sensing (CS). The beta process is employed as a prior for learning the dictionary, and this non-parametric method naturally infers an appropriate dictionary size. The Dirichlet process and a probit stick-breaking process are also considered to exploit structure within an image. The proposed method can learn a sparse dictionary in situ; training images may be exploited if available, but they are not required. Further, the noise variance need not be known, and can be nonstationary. Another virtue of the proposed method is that sequential inference can be readily employed, thereby allowing scaling to large images. Several example results are presented, using both Gibbs and variational Bayesian inference, with comparisons to other state-of-the-art approaches. 1</p><p>6 0.15070735 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_estimation_of_orientation_preference_maps.html">43 nips-2009-Bayesian estimation of orientation preference maps</a></p>

<p>Author: Ruben Coen-cagli, Peter Dayan, Odelia Schwartz</p><p>Abstract: A central hypothesis about early visual processing is that it represents inputs in a coordinate system matched to the statistics of natural scenes. Simple versions of this lead to Gabor–like receptive ﬁelds and divisive gain modulation from local surrounds; these have led to inﬂuential neural and psychological models of visual processing. However, these accounts are based on an incomplete view of the visual context surrounding each point. Here, we consider an approximate model of linear and non–linear correlations between the responses of spatially distributed Gaborlike receptive ﬁelds, which, when trained on an ensemble of natural scenes, uniﬁes a range of spatial context effects. The full model accounts for neural surround data in primary visual cortex (V1), provides a statistical foundation for perceptual phenomena associated with Li’s (2002) hypothesis that V1 builds a saliency map, and ﬁts data on the tilt illusion. 1</p><p>2 0.76471907 <a title="231-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Extending_Phase_Mechanism_to_Differential_Motion_Opponency_for_Motion_Pop-out.html">88 nips-2009-Extending Phase Mechanism to Differential Motion Opponency for Motion Pop-out</a></p>
<p>Author: Yicong Meng, Bertram E. Shi</p><p>Abstract: We extend the concept of phase tuning, a ubiquitous mechanism among sensory neurons including motion and disparity selective neurons, to the motion contrast detection. We demonstrate that the motion contrast can be detected by phase shifts between motion neuronal responses in different spatial regions. By constructing the differential motion opponency in response to motions in two different spatial regions, varying motion contrasts can be detected, where similar motion is detected by zero phase shifts and differences in motion by non-zero phase shifts. The model can exhibit either enhancement or suppression of responses by either different or similar motion in the surrounding. A primary advantage of the model is that the responses are selective to relative motion instead of absolute motion, which could model neurons found in neurophysiological experiments responsible for motion pop-out detection. 1 In trod u ction Motion discontinuity or motion contrast is an important cue for the pop-out of salient moving objects from contextual backgrounds. Although the neural mechanism underlying the motion pop-out detection is still unknown, the center-surround receptive field (RF) organization is considered as a physiological basis responsible for the pop-out detection. The center-surround RF structure is simple and ubiquitous in cortical cells especially in neurons processing motion and color information. Nakayama and Loomis [1] have predicted the existence of motion selective neurons with antagonistic center-surround receptive field organization in 1974. Recent physiological experiments [2][3] show that neurons with center-surround RFs have been found in both middle temporal (MT) and medial superior temporal (MST) areas related to motion processing. This antagonistic mechanism has been suggested to detect motion segmentation [4], figure/ground segregation [5] and the differentiation of object motion from ego-motion [6]. There are many related works [7]-[12] on motion pop-out detection. Some works [7]-[9] are based on spatio-temporal filtering outputs, but motion neurons are not fully interacted by either only inhibiting similar motion [7] or only enhancing opposite motion [8]. Heeger, et al. [7] proposed a center-surround operator to eliminate the response dependence upon rotational motions. But the Heeger's model only shows a complete center-surround interaction for moving directions. With respect to the surrounding speed effects, the neuronal responses are suppressed by the same speed with the center motion but not enhanced by other speeds. Similar problem existed in [8], which only modeled the suppression of neuronal responses in the classical receptive field (CRF) by similar motions in surrounding regions. Physiological experiments [10][11] show that many neurons in visual cortex are sensitive to the motion contrast rather than depend upon the absolute direction and speed of the object motion. Although pooling over motion neurons tuned to different velocities can eliminate the dependence upon absolute velocities, it is computationally inefficient and still can't give full interactions of both suppression and enhancement by similar and opposite surrounding motions. The model proposed by Dellen, et al. [12] computed differential motion responses directly from complex cells in V1 and didn't utilize responses from direction selective neurons. In this paper, we propose an opponency model which directly responds to differential motions by utilizing the phase shift mechanism. Phase tuning is a ubiquitous mechanism in sensory information processing, including motion, disparity and depth detection. Disparity selective neurons in the visual cortex have been found to detect disparities by adjusting the phase shift between the receptive field organizations in the left and right eyes [13][14]. Motion sensitive cells have been modeled in the similar way as the disparity energy neurons and detect image motions by utilizing the phase shift between the real and imaginary parts of temporal complex valued responses, which are comparable to images to the left and right eyes [15]. Therefore, the differential motion can be modeled by exploring the similarity between images from different spatial regions and from different eyes. The remainder of this paper is organized as following. Section 2 illustrates the phase shift motion energy neurons which estimate image velocities by the phase tuning in the imaginary path of the temporal receptive field responses. In section 3, we extend the concept of phase tuning to the construction of differential motion opponency. The phase difference determines the preferred velocity difference between adjacent areas in retinal images. Section 4 investigates properties of motion pop-out detection by the proposed motion opponency model. Finally, in section 5, we relate our proposed model to the neural mechanism of motion integration and motion segmentation in motion related areas and suggest a possible interpretation for adaptive center-surround interactions observed in biological experiments. 2 Phase Shift Motion Energy Neurons Adelson and Bergen [16] proposed the motion energy model for visual motion perception by measuring spatio-temporal orientations of image sequences in space and time. The motion energy model posits that the responses of direction-selective V1 complex cells can be computed by a combination of two linear spatio-temporal filtering stages, followed by squaring and summation. The motion energy model was extended in [15] to be phase tuned by splitting the complex valued temporal responses into real and imaginary paths and adding a phase shift on the imaginary path. Figure 1(a) demonstrates the schematic diagram of the phase shift motion energy model. Here we assume an input image sequence in two-dimensional space (x, y) and time t. The separable spatio-temporal receptive field ensures the cascade implementation of RF with spatial and temporal filters. Due to the requirement of the causal temporal RF, the phase shift motion energy model didn’t adopt the Gabor filter like the spatial RF. The phase shift spatio-temporal RF is modeled with a complex valued function f ( x, y, t ) = g ( x, y ) ⋅ h ( t , Φ ) , where the spatial and temporal RFs are denoted by g ( x, y ) and h ( t , Φ ) respectively, g ( x, y ) = N ( x, y | 0, C ) exp ( jΩ x x + jΩ y y ) h ( t , Φ ) = hreal ( t ) + exp ( jΦ ) himag ( t ) (1) and C is the covariance matrix of the spatial Gaussian envelope and Φ is the phase tuning of the motion energy neuron. The real and imaginary profiles of the temporal receptive field are Gamma modulated sinusoidal functions with quadrature phases, hreal ( t ) = G ( t | α ,τ ) cos ( Ωt t ) (2) himag ( t ) = G ( t | α ,τ ) sin ( Ωt t ) The envelopes for complex exponentials are functions of Gaussian and Gamma distributions, N ( x, y | 0, C ) = ⎛ x2 y2 exp ⎜ − 2 − 2 ⎜ 2σ x 2σ y 2πσ xσ y ⎝ 1 ⎞ ⎟ ⎟ ⎠ (3) hreal (t ) g ( x, y ) himag (t ) g ( x, y ) (·)2 (·)2 M M M (·)2 (·)2 M M M 2 (·) 2 (·) Vreal V (Φ ) e jΦ Vimag (a) Ev ( Φ max ) (·)2 wc ( x, y ) e jΦmin Ev ( (b) M 0 ) w ( x, y ) c M Ev ( Φ min ) M EΔv ( Θ ) ∫∫∫ K x , y ,Φ e j0 e jΦmin ws ( x, y ) Ks c e ∫∫∫ jΘ ws ( x, y ) e j0 x , y ,Φ ws ( x, y ) wc ( x, y ) M e jΦ max e jΦmax (·)2 M (·)2 M M (·)2 M 2 (·) M M (·)2 (c) Figure 1.

As derived in [15], the motion energy at location (x, y) can be computed by E v ( x, y, Φ ) = S + P cos ( Ψ − Φ ) (5) where S = Vreal 2 + Vimag 2 * P = 2 VrealVimag ( * Ψ = arg VrealVimag (6) ) and complex valued responses in real and imaginary paths are obtained as, Vreal ( x, y, t ) = ∫∫∫ g (ξ , ζ ) h (η ) I ( x − ξ , y − ζ , t − η ) dξ dζ dη real ξ ,ζ ,η Vimag ( x, y, t ) = ∫∫∫ g (ξ , ζ ) h (η ) I ( x − ξ , y − ζ , t − η ) dξ dζ dη ξ ζ η (7) imag , , The superscript * represents the complex conjugation and the phase shift parameter Φ controls the spatio-temporal orientation tuning.

Two types of differential motion opponency constructions of (a) center-surrounding interaction and (b) left-right interaction.

Across regions of different motions, there are clear discontinuities on the estimated velocity map. The motion discontinuities can be detected by edge detectors on the velocity map to segment different motions. However, this algorithm for motion discontinuities detection can’t discriminate between the object motion and uniform motions in contextual backgrounds. Here we propose a phase mechanism to detect differential motions inspired by the disparity energy model and adopt the center-surround inhibition mechanism to pop out the object motion from contextual background motions. The motion differences between different spatial locations can be modeled in the similar way as the disparity model. The motion energies from two neighboring locations are considered as the retinal images to the left and right eyes. Thus, we can construct a differential motion opponency by placing two populations of phase shift motion energy neurons at different spatial locations and the energy EΔv ( Θ ) of the opponency is the squared modulus of the averaged phase shift motion energies over space and phase, E Δv ( Θ ) = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) ⋅ w ( x, y, Φ | Θ ) dxdyd Φ v 2 (8) where w ( x, y, Θ ) is the profile for differential motion opponency and Δv is the velocity difference between the two spatial regions defined by the kernel w ( x, y, Θ ) . Since w ( x, y, Θ ) is intended to implement the functional role of spatial interactions, it is desired to be a separable function in space and phase domain and can be modeled by phase tuned summation of two spatial kernels, w ( x, y, Φ | Θ ) = wc ( x, y ) e jΦ + e jΘ+ jΦ ws ( x, y ) (9) where wc ( x, y ) and ws ( x, y ) are Gaussian kernels of different spatial sizes σ c and σ s , and Θ is the phase difference representing velocity difference between two spatial regions c and s. Substituting Eq. (9) into Eq. (8), the differential motion energy can be reformulated as EΔv ( Θ ) = K c + e jΘ K s 2 (10) 3 3 3 2 2 2 1 1 1 0 0 -1 -1 -2 -2 -2 -3 -3 -3 -3 -3 1 Right Velocity Right Velocity 0.98 0.96 0.94 0.92 0 0.9 0.88 -1 0.86 0.84 0.82 -2 -1 0 1 Left Velocity 2 3 -2 -1 0 1 Left Velocity 2 3 0.8 (a) (b) Figure 3. (a) Phase map and (b) peak magnitude map are obtained from stimuli of two patches of random dots moving with different velocities. The two patches of stimuli are statistically independent but share the same spatial properties: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and dot coherence level of 100%. The phase tuned population of motion energy neurons are applied to each patch of random dots with RF parameters: Ωt = 2π/8, Ωt = 2π/16, σx = 5 and τ = 5.5. For each combination of velocities from left and right patches, averaged phase shifts over space and time are computed and so do the magnitudes of peak responses. The unit for velocities is pixels per frame. where Kc = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) exp ( jΦ ) w ( x, y ) dxdyd Φ v,c c x , y ,Φ Ks = ∫∫∫ E ( x, y, Φ ) exp ( jΦ ) w ( x, y ) dxdyd Φ v,s (11) s x, y ,Φ Ev ,c ( x, y, Φ ) and Ev , s ( x, y, Φ ) are phase shift motion energies at location (x, y) and with phase shift Φ. Utilizing the results in Eq. (5) and (6), Eq. (10) and (11) generate similar results, E Δv ( Θ ) = Sopp + Popp cos ( Θopp − Θ ) (12) where Sopp = K c 2 + Ks Popp = 2 K c K s* 2 (13) Θopp = arg ( K c K s* ) According to above derivations, by varying the phase shift Θ between –π and π, the relative motion energy of the differential motion opponency can be modeled as population responses across a population of phase tuned motion opponencies. The response is completely specified by three parameters Sopp , Popp and Θopp . The schematic diagram of this opponency is illustrated in Figure 1(c). The differential motion opponency is constituted by three stages. At the first stage, a population of phase shift motion energy neurons is applied to be selective to different velocities. At the second stage, motion energies from the first stage are weighted by kernels tuned to different spatial locations and phase shifts respectively for both spatial regions and two single differential motion signals in region c and region s are achieved by integrating responses from these two regions over space and phase tuning. Finally, the differential motion energy is computed by the squared modulus of the summation of the integrated motion signal in region c and phase shifted motion signal in region s. The subscripts c and s represent two interacted spatial regions which are not limited to the center and surround regions. The opponency could also be constructed by the neighboring left and right Inhibitive interaction, Θ = π/2 Excitatory interaction, Θ =0 Inhibitory 2 1.6 Responses 1.6 Responses Excitatory 2 1.2 0.8 1.2 0.8 0.4 0.4 0 0 pi/2 pi 3pi/2 Surrouding Direction 0 0 2pi (a) Model by Petkov et al.

Responses above 1 indicate enhancement and responses below 1 indicate suppressions. spatial regions. Figure 2 shows two types of structures for the differential motion opponency. In [17], the authors demonstrates that among cells in area MT with surrounding modulations, 25% of cells are with the antagonistic RF structure as shown in Figure 2(a) and another 50% of cells have the integrative RF structure as shown in Figure 2(b). The velocity difference tuning of the opponency is determined by the phase shift parameter Θ combined with parameters of spatial and temporal frequencies for motion energy neurons. The larger phase shift magnitude prefers the bigger velocity difference. This phase tuning of velocity difference is consistent with the phase tuning of motion energy neurons. Figure 3 shows the phase map obtained by using random dots stimuli with different velocities on two spatial patches (left and right patches with sizes of 128 pixels 128 pixels). Along the diagonal line, velocities from left and right patches are equal to each other and therefore phase estimates are zeros along this line. Deviated from the diagonal line to upper-left and lower-right, the phase magnitudes increase while positive phases indicate larger left velocities and negative phases indicate larger right velocities. The phase tuning can give a good classification of velocity differences. 4 V a l i d a t i o n o f D i f f e r e n t i a l M o t i o n O pp o n e n c y Out derivation and analysis above show that the phase shift between two neighboring spatial regions is a good indicator for motion difference between these two regions. In this section, we validate the proposed differential motion opponency by two sets of experiments, which show effects of both surrounding directions and speeds on the center motion.

The insensitivity of the proposed opponency model to absolute center and surrounding velocities is demonstrated in (a), where responses are enhanced for all center velocities from -2 to 2 pixels per frame. In (b), the model by Heeger, et al. [7] only shows enhancement when the center speed matches the preferred speed of 1.2 pixel per frame. Similarly, responses above 1 indicate enhancement and below 1 indicate suppressions. In both curves, the velocity differences between center and surrounding regions are maintained as a constant of 3 pixels per frame. Physiological experiments [2][3] have demonstrated that the neuronal activities in the classical receptive field are suppressed by responses outside the CRF to stimuli with similar motions including both directions and speeds on the center and surrounding regions. On the contrary, visual stimuli of opposite directions or quite different speeds outside the CRF enhance the responses in the CRF. In their experiments, they used a set of stimuli of random dots moving at different velocities, where there are small patches of moving random dots on the center. We tested the properties of the proposed opponency model for motion difference measurement by using similar random dots stimuli. The random dots on background move with different speeds and in different direction but have the same statistical parameters: dot size of 2 pixels, dot density of 10% and motion coherence level of 100%. The small random dots patches are placed on the center of background stimuli to stimulate the neurons in the CRF. These small patches share the same statistical parameters with background random dots but move with a constant velocity of 1 pixel per frame. Figure 4 shows results for the enhanced and suppressed responses in the CRF with varying surrounding directions. The phase shift motion energy neurons had the same spatial and temporal frequencies and the same receptive field sizes, and were selective to vertical orientations. The preferred spatial frequency was 2π/16 radian per pixel and the temporal frequency was 2π/16 radian per frame. The sizes of RF in horizontal and vertical directions were respectively 5 pixels and 10 pixels, corresponding to a spatial bandwidth of 1.96 octaves. The time constant τ was 5.5 frames which resulted in a temporal bandwidth of 1.96 octaves. As shown in Figure 4 (a) and (b), the surrounding motion of opposite direction gives the largest response to the motion in the CRF for the inhibitory interaction and the smallest response for the excitatory interaction. Results demonstrated in Figure 4 are consistent with physiological results reported in [3]. In Born’s paper, inhibitory cells show response enhancement and excitatory cells show response suppression when surrounding motions are in opposite directions. The 3-dB bandwidth for the surrounding moving direction is about 135 degrees for the physiological experiments while the bandwidth is about 180 degrees for the simulation results in our proposed model. Models proposed by Petkov, et al. [8] and Heeger, et al. [7] also show clear inhibition between opposite motions. The Petkov’s model achieves the surrounding suppression for each point in ( x, y, t ) space by the subtraction between responses from that point and its surroundings and followed by a half-wave rectification, + % Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) = Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) − α ⋅ Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) (14) where Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the motion energy at location (x,y) and time t for a given preferred speed v and orientation θ, Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the average motion energy in the surrounding of point (x, y, t), % Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the suppressed motion energy and the factor α controls the inhibition strength. The inhibition term is computed by weighted motion energy Sv ,θ ( x, y, t ) = Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) ∗ wv ,θ ( x, y, t ) (15) where wv ,θ ( x, y, t ) is the surround weighting function. The Heeger’s model constructs the center-surround motion opponent by computing the weighted sum of responses from motion selective cells, Rv ,θ ( t ) = ∑ β ( x, y ) ⎡ Ev ,θ ( x, y, t ) − E− v ,θ ( x, y, t ) ⎤ ⎣ ⎦ (16) x, y where β ( x, y ) is a center-surround weighting function and the motion energy at each point should be normalized across all cells with different tuning properties. As shown in Figure 4 (c) and (d) for results of Petkov’s and Heeger’s models, we replace the conventional frequency tuned motion energy neuron with our proposed phase tuned neuron. The model by Petkov, et al. [8] is generally suppressive and only reproduces less suppression for opposite motions, which is inconsistent with results from [3]. The model by Heeger, et al. [7] has similar properties with our proposed model with respect to both excitatory and inhibitory interactions. To evaluate the sensitivity of the proposed opponency model to velocity differences, we did simulations by using similar stimuli with the above experiment in Figure 4 but maintaining a constant velocity difference of 3 pixels per frame between the center and surrounding random dot patches. As shown in Figure 5, by varying the velocities of random dots on the center region, we found that responses by the proposed model are always enhanced independent upon absolute velocities of center stimuli, but responses by the Heeger’s model achieve the enhancement at a center velocity of 1.2 pixels per frame and maintain suppressed at other speeds. 5 D i s c u s s i on We proposed a new biologically plausible model of the differential motion opponency to model the spatial interaction property of motion energy neurons. The proposed opponency model is motivated by the phase tuning mechanism of disparity energy neurons which infers the disparity information from the phase difference between complex valued responses to left and right retinal images. Hence, the two neighboring spatial areas can be considered as left and right images and the motion difference between these two spatial regions is detected by the phase difference between the complex valued responses at these two regions. Our experimental results demonstrate a consistent conclusion with physiological experiments that motions of opposite directions and different speeds outside the CRF can show both inhibitive and excitatory effects on the CRF responses. The inhibitive interaction helps to segment the moving object from backgrounds when fed back to low-level features such as edges, orientations and color information. Except providing a unifying phase mechanism in understanding neurons with different functional roles at different brain areas, the proposed opponency model could possibly provide a way to understand the motion integration and motion segmentation. Integration and segmentation are two opposite motion perception tasks but co-exist to constitute two fundamental types of motion processing. Segmentation is achieved by discriminating motion signals from different objects, which is thought to be due to the antagonistic interaction between center and surrounding RFs. Integration is obtained by utilizing the enhancing function of surrounding areas to CRF areas. Both types of processing have been found in motion related areas including area MT and MST. Tadin, et al. [18] have found that motion segmentation dominants at high stimulus contrast and gives the way to motion integration at low stimulus contrast. Huang, et al. [19] suggests that the surrounding modulation is adaptive according to the visual stimulus such as contrasts and noise levels. Since our proposed opponency model determines the functional role of neurons by only the phase shift parameter, this makes the proposed model to be an ideal candidate model for the adaptive surrounding modulation with the phase tuning between two spatial regions.

<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>4 0.56355661 <a title="231-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Perceptual_Multistability_as_Markov_Chain_Monte_Carlo_Inference.html">188 nips-2009-Perceptual Multistability as Markov Chain Monte Carlo Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Samuel Gershman, Ed Vul, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: While many perceptual and cognitive phenomena are well described in terms of Bayesian inference, the necessary computations are intractable at the scale of realworld tasks, and it remains unclear how the human mind approximates Bayesian computations algorithmically. We explore the proposal that for some tasks, humans use a form of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to approximate the posterior distribution over hidden variables. As a case study, we show how several phenomena of perceptual multistability can be explained as MCMC inference in simple graphical models for low-level vision. 1</p><p>5 0.55912846 <a title="231-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Neural_Implementation_of_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Inference_by_Importance_Sampling.html">162 nips-2009-Neural Implementation of Hierarchical Bayesian Inference by Importance Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The goal of perception is to infer the hidden states in the hierarchical process by which sensory data are generated. Human behavior is consistent with the optimal statistical solution to this problem in many tasks, including cue combination and orientation detection. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior is of particular importance, since probabilistic computations are notoriously challenging. Here we propose a simple mechanism for Bayesian inference which involves averaging over a few feature detection neurons which ﬁre at a rate determined by their similarity to a sensory stimulus. This mechanism is based on a Monte Carlo method known as importance sampling, commonly used in computer science and statistics. Moreover, a simple extension to recursive importance sampling can be used to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference. We identify a scheme for implementing importance sampling with spiking neurons, and show that this scheme can account for human behavior in cue combination and the oblique effect. 1</p><p>6 0.54869318 <a title="231-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Structural_inference_affects_depth_perception_in_the_context_of_potential_occlusion.html">235 nips-2009-Structural inference affects depth perception in the context of potential occlusion</a></p>

<p>Author: Nino Shervashidze, Karsten M. Borgwardt</p><p>Abstract: In this article, we propose fast subtree kernels on graphs. On graphs with n nodes and m edges and maximum degree d, these kernels comparing subtrees of height h can be computed in O(mh), whereas the classic subtree kernel by Ramon & G¨ rtner scales as O(n2 4d h). Key to this efﬁciency is the observation that the a Weisfeiler-Lehman test of isomorphism from graph theory elegantly computes a subtree kernel as a byproduct. Our fast subtree kernels can deal with labeled graphs, scale up easily to large graphs and outperform state-of-the-art graph kernels on several classiﬁcation benchmark datasets in terms of accuracy and runtime. 1</p><p>2 0.84120309 <a title="231-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Inter-domain_Gaussian_Processes_for_Sparse_Inference_using_Inducing_Features.html">117 nips-2009-Inter-domain Gaussian Processes for Sparse Inference using Inducing Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Anibal Figueiras-vidal, Miguel Lázaro-gredilla</p><p>Abstract: We present a general inference framework for inter-domain Gaussian Processes (GPs) and focus on its usefulness to build sparse GP models. The state-of-the-art sparse GP model introduced by Snelson and Ghahramani in [1] relies on ﬁnding a small, representative pseudo data set of m elements (from the same domain as the n available data elements) which is able to explain existing data well, and then uses it to perform inference. This reduces inference and model selection computation time from O(n3 ) to O(m2 n), where m n. Inter-domain GPs can be used to ﬁnd a (possibly more compact) representative set of features lying in a different domain, at the same computational cost. Being able to specify a different domain for the representative features allows to incorporate prior knowledge about relevant characteristics of data and detaches the functional form of the covariance and basis functions. We will show how previously existing models ﬁt into this framework and will use it to develop two new sparse GP models. Tests on large, representative regression data sets suggest that signiﬁcant improvement can be achieved, while retaining computational efﬁciency. 1 Introduction and previous work Along the past decade there has been a growing interest in the application of Gaussian Processes (GPs) to machine learning tasks. GPs are probabilistic non-parametric Bayesian models that combine a number of attractive characteristics: They achieve state-of-the-art performance on supervised learning tasks, provide probabilistic predictions, have a simple and well-founded model selection scheme, present no overﬁtting (since parameters are integrated out), etc. Unfortunately, the direct application of GPs to regression problems (with which we will be concerned here) is limited due to their training time being O(n3 ). To overcome this limitation, several sparse approximations have been proposed [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In most of them, sparsity is achieved by projecting all available data onto a smaller subset of size m n (the active set), which is selected according to some speciﬁc criterion. This reduces computation time to O(m2 n). However, active set selection interferes with hyperparameter learning, due to its non-smooth nature (see [1, 3]). These proposals have been superseded by the Sparse Pseudo-inputs GP (SPGP) model, introduced in [1]. In this model, the constraint that the samples of the active set (which are called pseudoinputs) must be selected among training data is relaxed, allowing them to lie anywhere in the input space. This allows both pseudo-inputs and hyperparameters to be selected in a joint continuous optimisation and increases ﬂexibility, resulting in much superior performance. In this work we introduce Inter-Domain GPs (IDGPs) as a general tool to perform inference across domains. This allows to remove the constraint that the pseudo-inputs must remain within the same domain as input data. This added ﬂexibility results in an increased performance and allows to encode prior knowledge about other domains where data can be represented more compactly. 1 2 Review of GPs for regression We will brieﬂy state here the main deﬁnitions and results for regression with GPs. See [7] for a comprehensive review. Assume we are given a training set with n samples D ≡ {xj , yj }n , where each D-dimensional j=1 input xj is associated to a scalar output yj . The regression task goal is, given a new input x∗ , predict the corresponding output y∗ based on D. The GP regression model assumes that the outputs can be expressed as some noiseless latent function plus independent noise, y = f (x)+ε, and then sets a zero-mean1 GP prior on f (x), with covariance k(x, x ), and a zero-mean Gaussian prior on ε, with variance σ 2 (the noise power hyperparameter). The covariance function encodes prior knowledge about the smoothness of f (x). The most common choice for it is the Automatic Relevance Determination Squared Exponential (ARD SE): 2 k(x, x ) = σ0 exp − 1 2 D d=1 (xd − xd )2 2 d , (1) 2 with hyperparameters σ0 (the latent function power) and { d }D (the length-scales, deﬁning how d=1 rapidly the covariance decays along each dimension). It is referred to as ARD SE because, when coupled with a model selection method, non-informative input dimensions can be removed automatically by growing the corresponding length-scale. The set of hyperparameters that deﬁne the GP are 2 θ = {σ 2 , σ0 , { d }D }. We will omit the dependence on θ for the sake of clarity. d=1 If we evaluate the latent function at X = {xj }n , we obtain a set of latent variables following a j=1 joint Gaussian distribution p(f |X) = N (f |0, Kﬀ ), where [Kﬀ ]ij = k(xi , xj ). Using this model it is possible to express the joint distribution of training and test cases and then condition on the observed outputs to obtain the predictive distribution for any test case pGP (y∗ |x∗ , D) = N (y∗ |kf ∗ (Kﬀ + σ 2 In )−1 y, σ 2 + k∗∗ − kf ∗ (Kﬀ + σ 2 In )−1 kf ∗ ), (2) where y = [y1 , . . . , yn ] , kf ∗ = [k(x1 , x∗ ), . . . , k(xn , x∗ )] , and k∗∗ = k(x∗ , x∗ ). In is used to denote the identity matrix of size n. The O(n3 ) cost of these equations arises from the inversion of the n × n covariance matrix. Predictive distributions for additional test cases take O(n2 ) time each. These costs make standard GPs impractical for large data sets. To select hyperparameters θ, Type-II Maximum Likelihood (ML-II) is commonly used. This amounts to selecting the hyperparameters that correspond to a (possibly local) maximum of the log-marginal likelihood, also called log-evidence. 3 Inter-domain GPs In this section we will introduce Inter-Domain GPs (IDGPs) and show how they can be used as a framework for computationally efﬁcient inference. Then we will use this framework to express two previous relevant models and develop two new ones. 3.1 Deﬁnition Consider a real-valued GP f (x) with x ∈ RD and some deterministic real function g(x, z), with z ∈ RH . We deﬁne the following transformation: u(z) = f (x)g(x, z)dx. (3) RD There are many examples of transformations that take on this form, the Fourier transform being one of the best known. We will discuss possible choices for g(x, z) in Section 3.3; for the moment we will deal with the general form. Since u(z) is obtained by a linear transformation of GP f (x), 1 We follow the common approach of subtracting the sample mean from the outputs and then assume a zero-mean model. 2 it is also a GP. This new GP may lie in a different domain of possibly different dimension. This transformation is not invertible in general, its properties being deﬁned by g(x, z). IDGPs arise when we jointly consider f (x) and u(z) as a single, “extended” GP. The mean and covariance function of this extended GP are overloaded to accept arguments from both the input and transformed domains and treat them accordingly. We refer to each version of an overloaded function as an instance, which will accept a different type of arguments. If the distribution of the original GP is f (x) ∼ GP(m(x), k(x, x )), then it is possible to compute the remaining instances that deﬁne the distribution of the extended GP over both domains. The transformed-domain instance of the mean is m(z) = E[u(z)] = E[f (x)]g(x, z)dx = m(x)g(x, z)dx. RD RD The inter-domain and transformed-domain instances of the covariance function are: k(x, z ) = E[f (x)u(z )] = E f (x) f (x )g(x , z )dx = RD k(z, z ) = E[u(z)u(z )] = E f (x)g(x, z)dx RD = k(x, x )g(x , z )dx f (x )g(x , z )dx RD k(x, x )g(x, z)g(x , z )dxdx . RD (4) RD (5) RD Mean m(·) and covariance function k(·, ·) are therefore deﬁned both by the values and domains of their arguments. This can be seen as if each argument had an additional domain indicator used to select the instance. Apart from that, they deﬁne a regular GP, and all standard properties hold. In particular k(a, b) = k(b, a). This approach is related to [8], but here the latent space is deﬁned as a transformation of the input space, and not the other way around. This allows to pre-specify the desired input-domain covariance. The transformation is also more general: Any g(x, z) can be used. We can sample an IDGP at n input-domain points f = [f1 , f2 , . . . , fn ] (with fj = f (xj )) and m transformed-domain points u = [u1 , u2 , . . . , um ] (with ui = u(zi )). With the usual assumption of f (x) being a zero mean GP and deﬁning Z = {zi }m , the joint distribution of these samples is: i=1 Kﬀ Kfu f f 0, X, Z = N p , (6) u u Kfu Kuu with [Kﬀ ]pq = k(xp , xq ), [Kfu ]pq = k(xp , zq ), [Kuu ]pq = k(zp , zq ), which allows to perform inference across domains. We will only be concerned with one input domain and one transformed domain, but IDGPs can be deﬁned for any number of domains. 3.2 Sparse regression using inducing features In the standard regression setting, we are asked to perform inference about the latent function f (x) from a data set D lying in the input domain. Using IDGPs, we can use data from any domain to perform inference in the input domain. Some latent functions might be better deﬁned by a set of data lying in some transformed space rather than in the input space. This idea is used for sparse inference. Following [1] we introduce a pseudo data set, but here we place it in the transformed domain: D = {Z, u}. The following derivation is analogous to that of SPGP. We will refer to Z as the inducing features and u as the inducing variables. The key approximation leading to sparsity is to set m n and assume that f (x) is well-described by the pseudo data set D, so that any two samples (either from the training or test set) fp and fq with p = q will be independent given xp , xq and D. With this simplifying assumption2 , the prior over f can be factorised as a product of marginals: n p(f |X, Z, u) ≈ p(fj |xj , Z, u). (7) j=1 2 Alternatively, (7) can be obtained by proposing a generic factorised form for the approximate conn ditional p(f |X, Z, u) ≈ q(f |X, Z, u) = q (f |xj , Z, u) and then choosing the set of funcj=1 j j tions {qj (·)}n so as to minimise the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence from the exact joint prior j=1 KL(p(f |X, Z, u)p(u|Z)||q(f |X, Z, u)p(u|Z)), as noted in [9], Section 2.3.6. 3 Marginals are in turn obtained from (6): p(fj |xj , Z, u) = N (fj |kj K−1 u, λj ), where kj is the j-th uu row of Kfu and λj is the j-th element of the diagonal of matrix Λf = diag(Kf f − Kfu K−1 Kuf ). uu Operator diag(·) sets all off-diagonal elements to zero, so that Λf is a diagonal matrix. Since p(u|Z) is readily available and also Gaussian, the inducing variables can be integrated out from (7), yielding a new, approximate prior over f (x): n p(f |X, Z) = p(fj |xj , Z, u)p(u|Z)du = N (f |0, Kfu K−1 Kuf + Λf ) uu p(f , u|X, Z)du ≈ j=1 Using this approximate prior, the posterior distribution for a test case is: pIDGP (y∗ |x∗ , D, Z) = N (y∗ |ku∗ Q−1 Kfu Λ−1 y, σ 2 + k∗∗ + ku∗ (Q−1 − K−1 )ku∗ ), y uu (8) Kfu Λ−1 Kfu y where we have deﬁned Q = Kuu + and Λy = Λf + σ 2 In . The distribution (2) is approximated by (8) with the information available in the pseudo data set. After O(m2 n) time precomputations, predictive means and variances can be computed in O(m) and O(m2 ) time per test case, respectively. This model is, in general, non-stationary, even when it is approximating a stationary input-domain covariance and can be interpreted as a degenerate GP plus heteroscedastic white noise. The log-marginal likelihood (or log-evidence) of the model, explicitly including the conditioning on kernel hyperparameters θ can be expressed as 1 log p(y|X, Z, θ) = − [y Λ−1 y−y Λ−1 Kfu Q−1 Kfu Λ−1 y+log(|Q||Λy |/|Kuu |)+n log(2π)] y y y 2 which is also computable in O(m2 n) time. Model selection will be performed by jointly optimising the evidence with respect to the hyperparameters and the inducing features. If analytical derivatives of the covariance function are available, conjugate gradient optimisation can be used with O(m2 n) cost per step. 3.3 On the choice of g(x, z) The feature extraction function g(x, z) deﬁnes the transformed domain in which the pseudo data set lies. According to (3), the inducing variables can be seen as projections of the target function f (x) on the feature extraction function over the whole input space. Therefore, each of them summarises information about the behaviour of f (x) everywhere. The inducing features Z deﬁne the concrete set of functions over which the target function will be projected. It is desirable that this set captures the most signiﬁcant characteristics of the function. This can be achieved either using prior knowledge about data to select {g(x, zi )}m or using a very general family of functions and letting model i=1 selection automatically choose the appropriate set. Another way to choose g(x, z) relies on the form of the posterior. The posterior mean of a GP is often thought of as a linear combination of “basis functions”. For full GPs and other approximations such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], basis functions must have the form of the input-domain covariance function. When using IDGPs, basis functions have the form of the inter-domain instance of the covariance function, and can therefore be adjusted by choosing g(x, z), independently of the input-domain covariance function. If two feature extraction functions g(·, ·) and h(·, ·) can be related by g(x, z) = h(x, z)r(z) for any function r(·), then both yield the same sparse GP model. This property can be used to simplify the expressions of the instances of the covariance function. In this work we use the same functional form for every feature, i.e. our function set is {g(x, zi )}m , i=1 but it is also possible to use sets with different functional forms for each inducing feature, i.e. {gi (x, zi )}m where each zi may even have a different size (dimension). In the sections below i=1 we will discuss different possible choices for g(x, z). 3.3.1 Relation with Sparse GPs using pseudo-inputs The sparse GP using pseudo-inputs (SPGP) was introduced in [1] and was later renamed to Fully Independent Training Conditional (FITC) model to ﬁt in the systematic framework of [10]. Since 4 the sparse model introduced in Section 3.2 also uses a fully independent training conditional, we will stick to the ﬁrst name to avoid possible confusion. IDGP innovation with respect to SPGP consists in letting the pseudo data set lie in a different domain. If we set gSPGP (x, z) ≡ δ(x − z) where δ(·) is a Dirac delta, we force the pseudo data set to lie in the input domain. Thus there is no longer a transformed space and the original SPGP model is retrieved. In this setting, the inducing features of IDGP play the role of SPGP’s pseudo-inputs. 3.3.2 Relation with Sparse Multiscale GPs Sparse Multiscale GPs (SMGPs) are presented in [11]. Seeking to generalise the SPGP model with ARD SE covariance function, they propose to use a different set of length-scales for each basis function. The resulting model presents a defective variance that is healed by adding heteroscedastic white noise. SMGPs, including the variance improvement, can be derived in a principled way as IDGPs: D 1 gSMGP (x, z) ≡ D d=1 2π(c2 d D kSMGP (x, z ) = exp − d=1 D kSMGP (z, z ) = exp − d=1 − 2) d exp − d=1 (xd − µd )2 2cd2 D µ c with z = 2 d cd2 d=1 (µd − µd )2 2(c2 + cd2 − 2 ) d d (xd − µd )2 2(c2 − 2 ) d d (9) (10) D c2 + d d=1 2 d cd2 − 2. d (11) With this approximation, each basis function has its own centre µ = [µ1 , µ2 , . . . , µd ] and its own length-scales c = [c1 , c2 , . . . , cd ] , whereas global length-scales { d }D are shared by all d=1 inducing features. Equations (10) and (11) are derived from (4) and (5) using (1) and (9). The integrals deﬁning kSMGP (·, ·) converge if and only if c2 ≥ 2 , ∀d , which suggests that other values, d d even if permitted in [11], should be avoided for the model to remain well deﬁned. 3.3.3 Frequency Inducing Features GP If the target function can be described more compactly in the frequency domain than in the input domain, it can be advantageous to let the pseudo data set lie in the former domain. We will pursue that possibility for the case where the input domain covariance is the ARD SE. We will call the resulting sparse model Frequency Inducing Features GP (FIFGP). Directly applying the Fourier transform is not possible because the target function is not square 2 integrable (it has constant power σ0 everywhere, so (5) does not converge). We will workaround this by windowing the target function in the region of interest. It is possible to use a square window, but this results in the covariance being deﬁned in terms of the complex error function, which is very slow to evaluate. Instead, we will use a Gaussian window3 . Since multiplying by a Gaussian in the input domain is equivalent to convolving with a Gaussian in the frequency domain, we will be working with a blurred version of the frequency space. This model is deﬁned by: gFIF (x, z) ≡ D 1 D d=1 2πc2 d D kFIF (x, z ) = exp − d=1 D kFIF (z, z ) = exp − d=1 exp − d=1 x2 d cos ω0 + 2c2 d x2 + c2 ωd2 d d cos ω0 + 2(c2 + 2 ) d d D d=1 exp − d=1 D + exp 3 c4 (ωd + ωd )2 d − 2(2c2 + 2 ) d d d=1 x d ωd with z = ω D 2 d d=1 c2 + d 2 d (13) c4 (ωd − ωd )2 d cos(ω0 − ω0 ) 2(2c2 + 2 ) d d D cos(ω0 + ω0 ) d=1 2 d 2c2 + d 2. d A mixture of m Gaussians could also be used as window without increasing the complexity order. 5 (12) d=1 c2 ωd xd d c2 + 2 d d D 2 c2 (ωd + ωd2 ) d 2(2c2 + 2 ) d d D (14) The inducing features are ω = [ω0 , ω1 , . . . , ωd ] , where ω0 is the phase and the remaining components are frequencies along each dimension. In this model, both global length-scales { d }D and d=1 window length-scales {cd }D are shared, thus cd = cd . Instances (13) and (14) are induced by (12) d=1 using (4) and (5). 3.3.4 Time-Frequency Inducing Features GP Instead of using a single window to select the region of interest, it is possible to use a different window for each feature. We will use windows of the same size but different centres. The resulting model combines SPGP and FIFGP, so we will call it Time-Frequency Inducing Features GP (TFIFGP). It is deﬁned by gTFIF (x, z) ≡ gFIF (x − µ, ω), with z = [µ ω ] . The implied inter-domain and transformed-domain instances of the covariance function are: D kTFIF (x, z ) = kFIF (x − µ , ω ) , kTFIF (z, z ) = kFIF (z, z ) exp − d=1 (µd − µd )2 2(2c2 + 2 ) d d FIFGP is trivially obtained by setting every centre to zero {µi = 0}m , whereas SPGP is obtained i=1 by setting window length-scales c, frequencies and phases {ω i }m to zero. If the window lengthi=1 scales were individually adjusted, SMGP would be obtained. While FIFGP has the modelling power of both FIFGP and SPGP, it might perform worse in practice due to it having roughly twice as many hyperparameters, thus making the optimisation problem harder. The same problem also exists in SMGP. A possible workaround is to initialise the hyperparameters using a simpler model, as done in [11] for SMGP, though we will not do this here. 4 Experiments In this section we will compare the proposed approximations FIFGP and TFIFGP with the current state of the art, SPGP on some large data sets, for the same number of inducing features/inputs and therefore, roughly equal computational cost. Additionally, we provide results using a full GP, which is expected to provide top performance (though requiring an impractically big amount of computation). In all cases, the (input-domain) covariance function is the ARD SE (1). We use four large data sets: Kin-40k, Pumadyn-32nm4 (describing the dynamics of a robot arm, used with SPGP in [1]), Elevators and Pole Telecomm5 (related to the control of the elevators of an F16 aircraft and a telecommunications problem, and used in [12, 13, 14]). Input dimensions that remained constant throughout the training set were removed. Input data was additionally centred for use with FIFGP (the remaining methods are translation invariant). Pole Telecomm outputs actually take discrete values in the 0-100 range, in multiples of 10. This was taken into account by using the corresponding quantization noise variance (102 /12) as lower bound for the noise hyperparameter6 . n 1 2 2 2 Hyperparameters are initialised as follows: σ0 = n j=1 yj , σ 2 = σ0 /4, { d }D to one half of d=1 the range spanned by training data along each dimension. For SPGP, pseudo-inputs are initialised to a random subset of the training data, for FIFGP window size c is initialised to the standard deviation of input data, frequencies are randomly chosen from a zero-mean −2 -variance Gaussian d distribution, and phases are obtained from a uniform distribution in [0 . . . 2π). TFIFGP uses the same initialisation as FIFGP, with window centres set to zero. Final values are selected by evidence maximisation. Denoting the output average over the training set as y and the predictive mean and variance for test sample y∗l as µ∗l and σ∗l respectively, we deﬁne the following quality measures: Normalized Mean Square Error (NMSE) (y∗l − µ∗l )2 / (y∗l − y)2 and Mean Negative Log-Probability (MNLP) 1 2 2 2 2 (y∗l − µ∗l ) /σ∗l + log σ∗l + log 2π , where · averages over the test set. 4 Kin-40k: 8 input dimensions, 10000/30000 samples for train/test, Pumadyn-32nm: 32 input dimensions, 7168/1024 samples for train/test, using exactly the same preprocessing and train/test splits as [1, 3]. Note that their error measure is actually one half of the Normalized Mean Square Error deﬁned here. 5 Pole Telecomm: 26 non-constant input dimensions, 10000/5000 samples for train/test. Elevators: 17 non-constant input dimensions, 8752/7847 samples for train/test. Both have been downloaded from http://www.liaad.up.pt/∼ltorgo/Regression/datasets.html 6 If unconstrained, similar plots are obtained; in particular, no overﬁtting is observed. 6 For Kin-40k (Fig. 1, top), all three sparse methods perform similarly, though for high sparseness (the most useful case) FIFGP and TFIFGP are slightly superior. In Pumadyn-32nm (Fig. 1, bottom), only 4 out the 32 input dimensions are relevant to the regression task, so it can be used as an ARD capabilities test. We follow [1] and use a full GP on a small subset of the training data (1024 data points) to obtain the initial length-scales. This allows better minima to be found during optimisation. Though all methods are able to properly ﬁnd a good solution, FIFGP and especially TFIFGP are better in the sparser regime. Roughly the same considerations can be made about Pole Telecomm and Elevators (Fig. 2), but in these data sets the superiority of FIFGP and TFIFGP is more dramatic. Though not shown here, we have additionally tested these models on smaller, overﬁtting-prone data sets, and have found no noticeable overﬁtting even using m > n, despite the relatively high number of parameters being adjusted. This is in line with the results and discussion of [1].

This provides a general framework for sparse models, which are deﬁned by a feature extraction function. Using this framework, SMGPs can be reinterpreted as fully principled models using a transformed space of local features, without any need for post-hoc variance improvements. Furthermore, it is possible to develop new sparse models of practical use, such as the proposed FIFGP and TFIFGP, which are able to outperform the state-of-the-art SPGP on some large data sets, especially for high sparsity regimes. 7 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 10 25 50 100 250 Mean Negative Log−Probability Normalized Mean Squared Error −3.8 SPGP FIFGP TFIFGP Full GP on 8752 data points SPGP FIFGP TFIFGP Full GP on 8752 data points −4 −4.2 −4.4 −4.6 −4.8 500 750 1000 10 Inducing features / pseudo−inputs (a) Elevators NMSE (log-log plot) 25 50 100 250 500 750 1000 Inducing features / pseudo−inputs (b) Elevators MNLP (semilog plot) 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.01 10 25 50 100 250 500 Mean Negative Log−Probability Normalized Mean Squared Error 5.5 SPGP FIFGP TFIFGP Full GP on 10000 data points 4.5 4 3.5 3 2.5 1000 SPGP FIFGP TFIFGP Full GP on 10000 data points 5 10 25 50 100 250 500 1000 Inducing features / pseudo−inputs (d) Pole Telecomm MNLP (semilog plot) Inducing features / pseudo−inputs (c) Pole Telecomm NMSE (log-log plot) Figure 2: Performance of the compared methods on Elevators and Pole Telecomm. Choosing a transformed space for the inducing features enables to use domains where the target function can be expressed more compactly, or where the evidence (which is a function of the features) is easier to optimise. This added ﬂexibility translates as a detaching of the functional form of the input-domain covariance and the set of basis functions used to express the posterior mean. IDGPs approximate full GPs optimally in the KL sense noted in Section 3.2, for a given set of inducing features. Using ML-II to select the inducing features means that models providing a good ﬁt to data are given preference over models that might approximate the full GP more closely. This, though rarely, might lead to harmful overﬁtting. To more faithfully approximate the full GP and avoid overﬁtting altogether, our proposal can be combined with the variational approach from [15], in which the inducing features would be regarded as variational parameters. This would result in more constrained models, which would be closer to the full GP but might show reduced performance. We have explored the case of regression with Gaussian noise, which is analytically tractable, but it is straightforward to apply the same model to other tasks such as robust regression or classiﬁcation, using approximate inference (see [16]). Also, IDGPs as a general tool can be used for other purposes, such as modelling noise in the frequency domain, aggregating data from different domains or even imposing constraints on the target function.

<p>Author: Ruben Coen-cagli, Peter Dayan, Odelia Schwartz</p><p>Abstract: A central hypothesis about early visual processing is that it represents inputs in a coordinate system matched to the statistics of natural scenes. Simple versions of this lead to Gabor–like receptive ﬁelds and divisive gain modulation from local surrounds; these have led to inﬂuential neural and psychological models of visual processing. However, these accounts are based on an incomplete view of the visual context surrounding each point. Here, we consider an approximate model of linear and non–linear correlations between the responses of spatially distributed Gaborlike receptive ﬁelds, which, when trained on an ensemble of natural scenes, uniﬁes a range of spatial context effects. The full model accounts for neural surround data in primary visual cortex (V1), provides a statistical foundation for perceptual phenomena associated with Li’s (2002) hypothesis that V1 builds a saliency map, and ﬁts data on the tilt illusion. 1</p><p>4 0.73151511 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Slow_Learners_are_Fast.html">220 nips-2009-Slow Learners are Fast</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Zinkevich, John Langford, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: Online learning algorithms have impressive convergence properties when it comes to risk minimization and convex games on very large problems. However, they are inherently sequential in their design which prevents them from taking advantage of modern multi-core architectures. In this paper we prove that online learning with delayed updates converges well, thereby facilitating parallel online learning. 1</p><p>5 0.73052835 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Hierarchical_Modeling_of_Local_Image_Features_through_%24L_p%24-Nested_Symmetric_Distributions.html">111 nips-2009-Hierarchical Modeling of Local Image Features through $L p$-Nested Symmetric Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Bethge, Eero P. Simoncelli, Fabian H. Sinz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new family of distributions, called Lp -nested symmetric distributions, whose densities are expressed in terms of a hierarchical cascade of Lp norms. This class generalizes the family of spherically and Lp -spherically symmetric distributions which have recently been successfully used for natural image modeling. Similar to those distributions it allows for a nonlinear mechanism to reduce the dependencies between its variables. With suitable choices of the parameters and norms, this family includes the Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) model as a special case, which has been proposed as a means of deriving ﬁlters that mimic complex cells found in mammalian primary visual cortex. Lp -nested distributions are relatively easy to estimate and allow us to explore the variety of models between ISA and the Lp -spherically symmetric models. By ﬁtting the generalized Lp -nested model to 8 × 8 image patches, we show that the subspaces obtained from ISA are in fact more dependent than the individual ﬁlter coefﬁcients within a subspace. When ﬁrst applying contrast gain control as preprocessing, however, there are no dependencies left that could be exploited by ISA. This suggests that complex cell modeling can only be useful for redundancy reduction in larger image patches. 1</p><p>6 0.72946626 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_models_of_object_structure.html">133 nips-2009-Learning models of object structure</a></p>

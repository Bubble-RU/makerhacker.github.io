<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: High-dimensional statistical inference deals with models in which the the number of parameters p is comparable to or larger than the sample size n. Since it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless p/n → 0, a line of recent work has studied models with various types of structure (e.g., sparse vectors; block-structured matrices; low-rank matrices; Markov assumptions). In such settings, a general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized convex program (known as a regularized M -estimator) which combines a loss function (measuring how well the model ﬁts the data) with some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. The goal of this paper is to provide a uniﬁed framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates for such regularized M estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive several existing results, and also to obtain several new results on consistency and convergence rates. Our analysis also identiﬁes two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure the corresponding regularized M -estimators have fast convergence rates. 1</p><p>3 0.19009215 <a title="144-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Boosting_with_Spatial_Regularization.html">47 nips-2009-Boosting with Spatial Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yongxin Xi, Uri Hasson, Peter J. Ramadge, Zhen J. Xiang</p><p>Abstract: By adding a spatial regularization kernel to a standard loss function formulation of the boosting problem, we develop a framework for spatially informed boosting. From this regularized loss framework we derive an efﬁcient boosting algorithm that uses additional weights/priors on the base classiﬁers. We prove that the proposed algorithm exhibits a “grouping effect”, which encourages the selection of all spatially local, discriminative base classiﬁers. The algorithm’s primary advantage is in applications where the trained classiﬁer is used to identify the spatial pattern of discriminative information, e.g. the voxel selection problem in fMRI. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance on various data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.18094511 <a title="144-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Large-Scale_Distributed_Training_of_Conditional_Maximum_Entropy_Models.html">75 nips-2009-Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Training of Conditional Maximum Entropy Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Mcdonald, Mehryar Mohri, Nathan Silberman, Dan Walker, Gideon S. Mann</p><p>Abstract: Training conditional maximum entropy models on massive data sets requires signiﬁcant computational resources. We examine three common distributed training methods for conditional maxent: a distributed gradient computation method, a majority vote method, and a mixture weight method. We analyze and compare the CPU and network time complexity of each of these methods and present a theoretical analysis of conditional maxent models, including a study of the convergence of the mixture weight method, the most resource-efﬁcient technique. We also report the results of large-scale experiments comparing these three methods which demonstrate the beneﬁts of the mixture weight method: this method consumes less resources, while achieving a performance comparable to that of standard approaches.</p><p>5 0.17178093 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_on_the_oracle_complexity_of_convex_optimization.html">116 nips-2009-Information-theoretic lower bounds on the oracle complexity of convex optimization</a></p>

<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n ≪ p, we show that the multistep thresholding procedure can accurately estimate a sparse vector β ∈ Rp in a linear model, under the restricted eigenvalue conditions (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09). Thus our conditions for model selection consistency are considerably weaker than what has been achieved in previous works. More importantly, this method allows very signiﬁcant values of s, which is the number of non-zero elements in the true parameter. For example, it works for cases where the ordinary Lasso would have failed. Finally, we show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufﬁciently sparse, the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand` se Tao 07) achieves the ℓ2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level, while selecting a sufﬁciently sparse model. 1</p><p>5 0.61407524 <a title="144-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-A_General_Projection_Property_for_Distribution_Families.html">11 nips-2009-A General Projection Property for Distribution Families</a></p>

We further extend this property to distribution families that respect additional constraints, such as symmetry, unimodality and log-concavity. By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classiﬁcation, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes. 1</p><p>6 0.59272885 <a title="144-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Efficient_Large-Scale_Distributed_Training_of_Conditional_Maximum_Entropy_Models.html">75 nips-2009-Efficient Large-Scale Distributed Training of Conditional Maximum Entropy Models</a></p>

More precisely, our goal is to estimate a function f ∗ : Rp → R that has an additive decomposition of the form ∗ ∗ f ∗ (X1 , . . . , Xp ) = j∈S hj (Xj ), where each component function hj lies in some class H of “smooth” functions, and S ⊂ {1, . . . , p} is an unknown subset with cardinality s = |S|. Given n i.i.d. observations of f ∗ (X) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise where the covariate vectors (X1 , X2 , X3 , ..., Xp ) are drawn with i.i.d. components from some distribution P, we determine lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the regression function with respect to squared-L2 (P) error. Our main result is a lower bound on the minimax rate that scales as max s log(p/s) , s ǫ2 (H) . The ﬁrst term reﬂects the sample size required for n n performing subset selection, and is independent of the function class H. The second term s ǫ2 (H) is an s-dimensional estimation term corresponding to the sample size required for n estimating a sum of s univariate functions, each chosen from the function class H. It depends linearly on the sparsity index s but is independent of the global dimension p. As a special case, if H corresponds to functions that are m-times differentiable (an mth -order Sobolev space), then the s-dimensional estimation term takes the form sǫ2 (H) ≍ s n−2m/(2m+1) . Either of n the two terms may be dominant in different regimes, depending on the relation between the sparsity and smoothness of the additive decomposition.</p><p>2 0.99867821 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Neurometric_function_analysis_of_population_codes.html">163 nips-2009-Neurometric function analysis of population codes</a></p>
<p>Author: Philipp Berens, Sebastian Gerwinn, Alexander Ecker, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: The relative merits of different population coding schemes have mostly been analyzed in the framework of stimulus reconstruction using Fisher Information. Here, we consider the case of stimulus discrimination in a two alternative forced choice paradigm and compute neurometric functions in terms of the minimal discrimination error and the Jensen-Shannon information to study neural population codes. We ﬁrst explore the relationship between minimum discrimination error, JensenShannon Information and Fisher Information and show that the discrimination framework is more informative about the coding accuracy than Fisher Information as it deﬁnes an error for any pair of possible stimuli. In particular, it includes Fisher Information as a special case. Second, we use the framework to study population codes of angular variables. Speciﬁcally, we assess the impact of different noise correlations structures on coding accuracy in long versus short decoding time windows. That is, for long time window we use the common Gaussian noise approximation. To address the case of short time windows we analyze the Ising model with identical noise correlation structure. In this way, we provide a new rigorous framework for assessing the functional consequences of noise correlation structures for the representational accuracy of neural population codes that is in particular applicable to short-time population coding. 1</p><p>3 0.99839205 <a title="144-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_MAP_Estimation_via_the_Replica_Method_and_Compressed_Sensing.html">36 nips-2009-Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: The replica method is a non-rigorous but widely-accepted technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems. This paper applies the replica method to non-Gaussian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It is shown that with random linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the asymptotic behavior of the MAP estimate of an n-dimensional vector “decouples” as n scalar MAP estimators. The result is a counterpart to Guo and Verd´ ’s replica analysis of minimum mean-squared error estimation. u The replica MAP analysis can be readily applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, lasso, linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. In the case of lasso estimation the scalar estimator reduces to a soft-thresholding operator, and for zero normregularized estimation it reduces to a hard-threshold. Among other beneﬁts, the replica method provides a computationally-tractable method for exactly computing various performance metrics including mean-squared error and sparsity pattern recovery probability.</p><p>4 0.99627966 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Explaining_human_multiple_object_tracking_as_resource-constrained_approximate_inference_in_a_dynamic_probabilistic_model.html">85 nips-2009-Explaining human multiple object tracking as resource-constrained approximate inference in a dynamic probabilistic model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ed Vul, George Alvarez, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Multiple object tracking is a task commonly used to investigate the architecture of human visual attention. Human participants show a distinctive pattern of successes and failures in tracking experiments that is often attributed to limits on an object system, a tracking module, or other specialized cognitive structures. Here we use a computational analysis of the task of object tracking to ask which human failures arise from cognitive limitations and which are consequences of inevitable perceptual uncertainty in the tracking task. We ﬁnd that many human performance phenomena, measured through novel behavioral experiments, are naturally produced by the operation of our ideal observer model (a Rao-Blackwelized particle ﬁlter). The tradeoff between the speed and number of objects being tracked, however, can only arise from the allocation of a ﬂexible cognitive resource, which can be formalized as either memory or attention. 1</p><p>5 0.99579573 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_a_Small_Mixture_of_Trees.html">129 nips-2009-Learning a Small Mixture of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating a given probability distribution using a simpler distribution plays an important role in several areas of machine learning, for example variational inference and classiﬁcation. Within this context, we consider the task of learning a mixture of tree distributions. Although mixtures of trees can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence using an EM algorithm, its success depends heavily on the initialization. We propose an efﬁcient strategy for obtaining a good initial set of trees that attempts to cover the entire observed distribution by minimizing the α-divergence with α = ∞. We formulate the problem using the fractional covering framework and present a convergent sequential algorithm that only relies on solving a convex program at each iteration. Compared to previous methods, our approach results in a signiﬁcantly smaller mixture of trees that provides similar or better accuracies. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by learning pictorial structures for face recognition.</p><p>6 0.99566376 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Region-based_Segmentation_and_Object_Detection.html">201 nips-2009-Region-based Segmentation and Object Detection</a></p>

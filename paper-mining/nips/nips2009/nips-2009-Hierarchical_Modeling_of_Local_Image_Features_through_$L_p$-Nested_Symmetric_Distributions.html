<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ.

<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>4 0.13536762 <a title="111-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>5 0.086745448 <a title="111-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Which_graphical_models_are_difficult_to_learn%3F.html">256 nips-2009-Which graphical models are difficult to learn?</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Montanari, Jose A. Pereira</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning the structure of Ising models (pairwise binary Markov random ﬁelds) from i.i.d. samples. While several methods have been proposed to accomplish this task, their relative merits and limitations remain somewhat obscure. By analyzing a number of concrete examples, we show that low-complexity algorithms systematically fail when the Markov random ﬁeld develops long-range correlations. More precisely, this phenomenon appears to be related to the Ising model phase transition (although it does not coincide with it). 1 Introduction and main results Given a graph G = (V = [p], E), and a positive parameter θ > 0 the ferromagnetic Ising model on G is the pairwise Markov random ﬁeld µG,θ (x) = 1 ZG,θ eθxi xj (1) (i,j)∈E over binary variables x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xp ). Apart from being one of the most studied models in statistical mechanics, the Ising model is a prototypical undirected graphical model, with applications in computer vision, clustering and spatial statistics. Its obvious generalization to edge-dependent parameters θij , (i, j) ∈ E is of interest as well, and will be introduced in Section 1.2.2. (Let us stress that we follow the statistical mechanics convention of calling (1) an Ising model for any graph G.) In this paper we study the following structural learning problem: Given n i.i.d. samples x(1) , x(2) ,. . . , x(n) with distribution µG,θ ( · ), reconstruct the graph G. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the parameter θ is known, and that G has no double edges (it is a ‘simple’ graph). The graph learning problem is solvable with unbounded sample complexity, and computational resources [1]. The question we address is: for which classes of graphs and values of the parameter θ is the problem solvable under appropriate complexity constraints? More precisely, given an algorithm Alg, a graph G, a value θ of the model parameter, and a small δ > 0, the sample complexity is deﬁned as nAlg (G, θ) ≡ inf n ∈ N : Pn,G,θ {Alg(x(1) , . . . , x(n) ) = G} ≥ 1 − δ , (2) where Pn,G,θ denotes probability with respect to n i.i.d. samples with distribution µG,θ . Further, we let χAlg (G, θ) denote the number of operations of the algorithm Alg, when run on nAlg (G, θ) samples.1 1 For the algorithms analyzed in this paper, the behavior of nAlg and χAlg does not change signiﬁcantly if we require only ‘approximate’ reconstruction (e.g. in graph distance). 1 The general problem is therefore to characterize the functions nAlg (G, θ) and χAlg (G, θ), in particular for an optimal choice of the algorithm. General bounds on nAlg (G, θ) have been given in [2, 3], under the assumption of unbounded computational resources. A general charactrization of how well low complexity algorithms can perform is therefore lacking. Although we cannot prove such a general characterization, in this paper we estimate nAlg and χAlg for a number of graph models, as a function of θ, and unveil a fascinating universal pattern: when the model (1) develops long range correlations, low-complexity algorithms fail. Under the Ising model, the variables {xi }i∈V become strongly correlated for θ large. For a large class of graphs with degree bounded by ∆, this phenomenon corresponds to a phase transition beyond some critical value of θ uniformly bounded in p, with typically θcrit ≤ const./∆. In the examples discussed below, the failure of low-complexity algorithms appears to be related to this phase transition (although it does not coincide with it). 1.1 A toy example: the thresholding algorithm In order to illustrate the interplay between graph structure, sample complexity and interaction strength θ, it is instructive to consider a warmup example. The thresholding algorithm reconstructs G by thresholding the empirical correlations Cij ≡ 1 n n (ℓ) (ℓ) xi xj for i, j ∈ V . ℓ=1 (3) T HRESHOLDING( samples {x(ℓ) }, threshold τ ) 1: Compute the empirical correlations {Cij }(i,j)∈V ×V ; 2: For each (i, j) ∈ V × V 3: If Cij ≥ τ , set (i, j) ∈ E; We will denote this algorithm by Thr(τ ). Notice that its complexity is dominated by the computation of the empirical correlations, i.e. χThr(τ ) = O(p2 n). The sample complexity nThr(τ ) can be bounded for speciﬁc classes of graphs as follows (the proofs are straightforward and omitted from this paper). Theorem 1.1. If G has maximum degree ∆ > 1 and if θ < atanh(1/(2∆)) then there exists τ = τ (θ) such that 2p 8 log nThr(τ ) (G, θ) ≤ . (4) 1 δ (tanh θ − 2∆ )2 Further, the choice τ (θ) = (tanh θ + (1/2∆))/2 achieves this bound. Theorem 1.2. There exists a numerical constant K such that the following is true. If ∆ > 3 and θ > K/∆, there are graphs of bounded degree ∆ such that for any τ , nThr(τ ) = ∞, i.e. the thresholding algorithm always fails with high probability. These results conﬁrm the idea that the failure of low-complexity algorithms is related to long-range correlations in the underlying graphical model. If the graph G is a tree, then correlations between far apart variables xi , xj decay exponentially with the distance between vertices i, j. The same happens on bounded-degree graphs if θ ≤ const./∆. However, for θ > const./∆, there exists families of bounded degree graphs with long-range correlations. 1.2 More sophisticated algorithms In this section we characterize χAlg (G, θ) and nAlg (G, θ) for more advanced algorithms. We again obtain very distinct behaviors of these algorithms depending on long range correlations. Due to space limitations, we focus on two type of algorithms and only outline the proof of our most challenging result, namely Theorem 1.6. In the following we denote by ∂i the neighborhood of a node i ∈ G (i ∈ ∂i), and assume the degree / to be bounded: |∂i| ≤ ∆. 1.2.1 Local Independence Test A recurring approach to structural learning consists in exploiting the conditional independence structure encoded by the graph [1, 4, 5, 6]. 2 Let us consider, to be deﬁnite, the approach of [4], specializing it to the model (1). Fix a vertex r, whose neighborhood we want to reconstruct, and consider the conditional distribution of xr given its neighbors2 : µG,θ (xr |x∂r ). Any change of xi , i ∈ ∂r, produces a change in this distribution which is bounded away from 0. Let U be a candidate neighborhood, and assume U ⊆ ∂r. Then changing the value of xj , j ∈ U will produce a noticeable change in the marginal of Xr , even if we condition on the remaining values in U and in any W , |W | ≤ ∆. On the other hand, if U ∂r, then it is possible to ﬁnd W (with |W | ≤ ∆) and a node i ∈ U such that, changing its value after ﬁxing all other values in U ∪ W will produce no noticeable change in the conditional marginal. (Just choose i ∈ U \∂r and W = ∂r\U ). This procedure allows us to distinguish subsets of ∂r from other sets of vertices, thus motivating the following algorithm. L OCAL I NDEPENDENCE T EST( samples {x(ℓ) }, thresholds (ǫ, γ) ) 1: Select a node r ∈ V ; 2: Set as its neighborhood the largest candidate neighbor U of size at most ∆ for which the score function S CORE(U ) > ǫ/2; 3: Repeat for all nodes r ∈ V ; The score function S CORE( · ) depends on ({x(ℓ) }, ∆, γ) and is deﬁned as follows, min max W,j xi ,xW ,xU ,xj |Pn,G,θ {Xi = xi |X W = xW , X U = xU }− Pn,G,θ {Xi = xi |X W = xW , X U \j = xU \j , Xj = xj }| . (5) In the minimum, |W | ≤ ∆ and j ∈ U . In the maximum, the values must be such that Pn,G,θ {X W = xW , X U = xU } > γ/2, Pn,G,θ {X W = xW , X U \j = xU \j , Xj = xj } > γ/2 Pn,G,θ is the empirical distribution calculated from the samples {x(ℓ) }. We denote this algorithm by Ind(ǫ, γ). The search over candidate neighbors U , the search for minima and maxima in the computation of the S CORE(U ) and the computation of Pn,G,θ all contribute for χInd (G, θ). Both theorems that follow are consequences of the analysis of [4]. Theorem 1.3. Let G be a graph of bounded degree ∆ ≥ 1. For every θ there exists (ǫ, γ), and a numerical constant K, such that 2p 100∆ , χInd(ǫ,γ) (G, θ) ≤ K (2p)2∆+1 log p . nInd(ǫ,γ) (G, θ) ≤ 2 4 log ǫ γ δ More speciﬁcally, one can take ǫ = 1 4 sinh(2θ), γ = e−4∆θ 2−2∆ . This ﬁrst result implies in particular that G can be reconstructed with polynomial complexity for any bounded ∆. However, the degree of such polynomial is pretty high and non-uniform in ∆. This makes the above approach impractical. A way out was proposed in [4]. The idea is to identify a set of ‘potential neighbors’ of vertex r via thresholding: B(r) = {i ∈ V : Cri > κ/2} , (6) For each node r ∈ V , we evaluate S CORE(U ) by restricting the minimum in Eq. (5) over W ⊆ B(r), and search only over U ⊆ B(r). We call this algorithm IndD(ǫ, γ, κ). The basic intuition here is that Cri decreases rapidly with the graph distance between vertices r and i. As mentioned above, this is true at small θ. Theorem 1.4. Let G be a graph of bounded degree ∆ ≥ 1. Assume that θ < K/∆ for some small enough constant K. Then there exists ǫ, γ, κ such that nIndD(ǫ,γ,κ) (G, θ) ≤ 8(κ2 + 8∆ ) log 4p , δ χIndD(ǫ,γ,κ) (G, θ) ≤ K ′ p∆∆ More speciﬁcally, we can take κ = tanh θ, ǫ = 1 4 log(4/κ) α + K ′ ∆p2 log p . sinh(2θ) and γ = e−4∆θ 2−2∆ . 2 If a is a vector and R is a set of indices then we denote by aR the vector formed by the components of a with index in R. 3 1.2.2 Regularized Pseudo-Likelihoods A different approach to the learning problem consists in maximizing an appropriate empirical likelihood function [7, 8, 9, 10, 13]. To control the ﬂuctuations caused by the limited number of samples, and select sparse graphs a regularization term is often added [7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]. As a speciﬁc low complexity implementation of this idea, we consider the ℓ1 -regularized pseudolikelihood method of [7]. For each node r, the following likelihood function is considered L(θ; {x(ℓ) }) = − 1 n n (ℓ) ℓ=1 log Pn,G,θ (x(ℓ) |x\r ) r (7) where x\r = xV \r = {xi : i ∈ V \ r} is the vector of all variables except xr and Pn,G,θ is deﬁned from the following extension of (1), µG,θ (x) = 1 ZG,θ eθij xi xj (8) i,j∈V / where θ = {θij }i,j∈V is a vector of real parameters. Model (1) corresponds to θij = 0, ∀(i, j) ∈ E and θij = θ, ∀(i, j) ∈ E. The function L(θ; {x(ℓ) }) depends only on θr,· = {θrj , j ∈ ∂r} and is used to estimate the neighborhood of each node by the following algorithm, Rlr(λ), R EGULARIZED L OGISTIC R EGRESSION( samples {x(ℓ) }, regularization (λ)) 1: Select a node r ∈ V ; 2: Calculate ˆr,· = arg min {L(θr,· ; {x(ℓ) }) + λ||θr,· ||1 }; θ θ r,· ∈Rp−1 3: ˆ If θrj > 0, set (r, j) ∈ E; Our ﬁrst result shows that Rlr(λ) indeed reconstructs G if θ is sufﬁciently small. Theorem 1.5. There exists numerical constants K1 , K2 , K3 , such that the following is true. Let G be a graph with degree bounded by ∆ ≥ 3. If θ ≤ K1 /∆, then there exist λ such that nRlr(λ) (G, θ) ≤ K2 θ−2 ∆ log 8p2 . δ (9) Further, the above holds with λ = K3 θ ∆−1/2 . This theorem is proved by noting that for θ ≤ K1 /∆ correlations decay exponentially, which makes all conditions in Theorem 1 of [7] (denoted there by A1 and A2) hold, and then computing the probability of success as a function of n, while strenghtening the error bounds of [7]. In order to prove a converse to the above result, we need to make some assumptions on λ. Given θ > 0, we say that λ is ‘reasonable for that value of θ if the following conditions old: (i) Rlr(λ) is successful with probability larger than 1/2 on any star graph (a graph composed by a vertex r connected to ∆ neighbors, plus isolated vertices); (ii) λ ≤ δ(n) for some sequence δ(n) ↓ 0. Theorem 1.6. There exists a numerical constant K such that the following happens. If ∆ > 3, θ > K/∆, then there exists graphs G of degree bounded by ∆ such that for all reasonable λ, nRlr(λ) (G) = ∞, i.e. regularized logistic regression fails with high probability. The graphs for which regularized logistic regression fails are not contrived examples. Indeed we will prove that the claim in the last theorem holds with high probability when G is a uniformly random graph of regular degree ∆. The proof Theorem 1.6 is based on showing that an appropriate incoherence condition is necessary for Rlr to successfully reconstruct G. The analogous result was proven in [14] for model selection using the Lasso. In this paper we show that such a condition is also necessary when the underlying model is an Ising model. Notice that, given the graph G, checking the incoherence condition is NP-hard for general (non-ferromagnetic) Ising model, and requires signiﬁcant computational effort 4 1 0.9 0.8 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 20 15 λ0 10 5 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.2 1 0.8 0.6 Psucc 0.4 0.2 1 θ 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 θ θcrit 0.8 1 Figure 1: Learning random subgraphs of a 7 × 7 (p = 49) two-dimensional grid from n = 4500 Ising models samples, using regularized logistic regression. Left: success probability as a function of the model parameter θ and of the regularization parameter λ0 (darker corresponds to highest probability). Right: the same data plotted for several choices of λ versus θ. The vertical line corresponds to the model critical temperature. The thick line is an envelope of the curves obtained for different λ, and should correspond to optimal regularization. even in the ferromagnetic case. Hence the incoherence condition does not provide, by itself, a clear picture of which graph structure are difﬁcult to learn. We will instead show how to evaluate it on speciﬁc graph families. Under the restriction λ → 0 the solutions given by Rlr converge to θ∗ with n [7]. Thus, for large n we can expand L around θ∗ to second order in (θ − θ∗ ). When we add the regularization term to L we obtain a quadratic model analogous the Lasso plus the error term due to the quadratic approximation. It is thus not surprising that, when λ → 0 the incoherence condition introduced for the Lasso in [14] is also relevant for the Ising model. 2 Numerical experiments In order to explore the practical relevance of the above results, we carried out extensive numerical simulations using the regularized logistic regression algorithm Rlr(λ). Among other learning algorithms, Rlr(λ) strikes a good balance of complexity and performance. Samples from the Ising model (1) where generated using Gibbs sampling (a.k.a. Glauber dynamics). Mixing time can be very large for θ ≥ θcrit , and was estimated using the time required for the overall bias to change sign (this is a quite conservative estimate at low temperature). Generating the samples {x(ℓ) } was indeed the bulk of our computational effort and took about 50 days CPU time on Pentium Dual Core processors (we show here only part of these data). Notice that Rlr(λ) had been tested in [7] only on tree graphs G, or in the weakly coupled regime θ < θcrit . In these cases sampling from the Ising model is easy, but structural learning is also intrinsically easier. Figure reports the success probability of Rlr(λ) when applied to random subgraphs of a 7 × 7 two-dimensional grid. Each such graphs was obtained by removing each edge independently with probability ρ = 0.3. Success probability was estimated by applying Rlr(λ) to each vertex of 8 graphs (thus averaging over 392 runs of Rlr(λ)), using n = 4500 samples. We scaled the regularization parameter as λ = 2λ0 θ(log p/n)1/2 (this choice is motivated by the algorithm analysis and is empirically the most satisfactory), and searched over λ0 . The data clearly illustrate the phenomenon discussed. Despite the large number of samples n ≫ log p, when θ crosses a threshold, the algorithm starts performing poorly irrespective of λ. Intriguingly, this threshold is not far from the critical point of the Ising model on a randomly diluted grid θcrit (ρ = 0.3) ≈ 0.7 [15, 16]. 5 1.2 1.2 θ = 0.35, 0.40 1 1 θ = 0.25 θ = 0.20 0.8 0.8 θ = 0.45 θ = 0.10 0.6 0.6 Psucc Psucc 0.4 0.4 θ = 0.50 0.2 0.2 θthr θ = 0.65, 0.60, 0.55 0 0 0 2000 4000 6000 8000 10000 0 0.1 0.2 n 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 θ Figure 2: Learning uniformly random graphs of degree 4 from Ising models samples, using Rlr. Left: success probability as a function of the number of samples n for several values of θ. Right: the same data plotted for several choices of λ versus θ as in Fig. 1, right panel. Figure 2 presents similar data when G is a uniformly random graph of degree ∆ = 4, over p = 50 vertices. The evolution of the success probability with n clearly shows a dichotomy. When θ is below a threshold, a small number of samples is sufﬁcient to reconstruct G with high probability. Above the threshold even n = 104 samples are to few. In this case we can predict the threshold analytically, cf. Lemma 3.3 below, and get θthr (∆ = 4) ≈ 0.4203, which compares favorably with the data. 3 Proofs In order to prove Theorem 1.6, we need a few auxiliary results. It is convenient to introduce some notations. If M is a matrix and R, P are index sets then MR P denotes the submatrix with row indices in R and column indices in P . As above, we let r be the vertex whose neighborhood we are trying to reconstruct and deﬁne S = ∂r, S c = V \ ∂r ∪ r. Since the cost function L(θ; {x(ℓ) }) + λ||θ||1 only depend on θ through its components θr,· = {θrj }, we will hereafter neglect all the other parameters and write θ as a shorthand of θr,· . Let z ∗ be a subgradient of ||θ||1 evaluated at the true parameters values, θ∗ = {θrj : θij = 0, ∀j ∈ ˆ / ˆn be the parameter estimate returned by Rlr(λ) when the number ∂r, θrj = θ, ∀j ∈ ∂r}. Let θ of samples is n. Note that, since we assumed θ∗ ≥ 0, zS = ½. Deﬁne Qn (θ, ; {x(ℓ) }) to be the ˆ∗ (ℓ) (ℓ) n Hessian of L(θ; {x }) and Q(θ) = limn→∞ Q (θ, ; {x }). By the law of large numbers Q(θ) is the Hessian of EG,θ log PG,θ (Xr |X\r ) where EG,θ is the expectation with respect to (8) and X is a random variable distributed according to (8). We will denote the maximum and minimum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix M by σmax (M ) and σmin (M ) respectively. We will omit arguments whenever clear from the context. Any quantity evaluated at the true parameter values will be represented with a ∗ , e.g. Q∗ = Q(θ∗ ). Quantities under a ∧ depend on n. Throughout this section G is a graph of maximum degree ∆. 3.1 Proof of Theorem 1.6 Our ﬁrst auxiliary results establishes that, if λ is small, then ||Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ||∞ > 1 is a sufﬁcient ˆ∗ S SS condition for the failure of Rlr(λ). Lemma 3.1. Assume [Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ]i ≥ 1 + ǫ for some ǫ > 0 and some row i ∈ V , σmin (Q∗ ) ≥ ˆ∗ S SS SS 3 ǫ/29 ∆4 . Then the success probability of Rlr(λ) is upper bounded as Cmin > 0, and λ < Cmin 2 2 2 δB Psucc ≤ 4∆2 e−nδA + 2∆ e−nλ 2 where δA = (Cmin /100∆2 )ǫ and δB = (Cmin /8∆)ǫ. 6 (10) The next Lemma implies that, for λ to be ‘reasonable’ (in the sense introduced in Section 1.2.2), nλ2 must be unbounded. Lemma 3.2. There exist M = M (K, θ) > 0 for θ > 0 such that the following is true: If G is the graph with only one edge between nodes r and i and nλ2 ≤ K, then Psucc ≤ e−M (K,θ)p + e−n(1−tanh θ) 2 /32 . (11) Finally, our key result shows that the condition ||Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ||∞ ≤ 1 is violated with high ˆ∗ S SS probability for large random graphs. The proof of this result relies on a local weak convergence result for ferromagnetic Ising models on random graphs proved in [17]. Lemma 3.3. Let G be a uniformly random regular graph of degree ∆ > 3, and ǫ > 0 be sufﬁciently small. Then, there exists θthr (∆, ǫ) such that, for θ > θthr (∆, ǫ), ||Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ||∞ ≥ 1 + ǫ with ˆ∗ S SS probability converging to 1 as p → ∞. ˜ ˜ ˜ Furthermore, for large ∆, θthr (∆, 0+) = θ ∆−1 (1 + o(1)). The constant θ is given by θ = ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ ¯ tanh h)/h and h is the unique positive solution of h tanh h = (1 − tanh2 h)2 . Finally, there exist Cmin > 0 dependent only on ∆ and θ such that σmin (Q∗ ) ≥ Cmin with probability converging to SS 1 as p → ∞. The proofs of Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3 are sketched in the next subsection. Lemma 3.2 is more straightforward and we omit its proof for space reasons. Proof. (Theorem 1.6) Fix ∆ > 3, θ > K/∆ (where K is a large enough constant independent of ∆), and ǫ, Cmin > 0 and both small enough. By Lemma 3.3, for any p large enough we can choose a ∆-regular graph Gp = (V = [p], Ep ) and a vertex r ∈ V such that |Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 ½S |i > 1 + ǫ for S SS some i ∈ V \ r. By Theorem 1 in [4] we can assume, without loss of generality n > K ′ ∆ log p for some small constant K ′ . Further by Lemma 3.2, nλ2 ≥ F (p) for some F (p) ↑ ∞ as p → ∞ and the condition of Lemma 3.1 on λ is satisﬁed since by the ”reasonable” assumption λ → 0 with n. Using these results in Eq. (10) of Lemma 3.1 we get the following upper bound on the success probability 2 Psucc (Gp ) ≤ 4∆2 p−δA K In particular Psucc (Gp ) → 0 as p → ∞. 3.2 ′ ∆ 2 + 2∆ e−nF (p)δB . (12) Proofs of auxiliary lemmas θ θ Proof. (Lemma 3.1) We will show that under the assumptions of the lemma and if ˆ = (ˆS , ˆS C ) = θ (ˆS , 0) then the probability that the i component of any subgradient of L(θ; {x(ℓ) })+λ||θ||1 vanishes θ for any ˆS > 0 (component wise) is upper bounded as in Eq. (10). To simplify notation we will omit θ {x(ℓ) } in all the expression derived from L. θ θ) z Let z be a subgradient of ||θ|| at ˆ and assume ∇L(ˆ + λˆ = 0. An application of the mean value ˆ theorem yields ∇2 L(θ∗ )[ˆ − θ∗ ] = W n − λˆ + Rn , θ z (13) ∗ n n 2 ¯(j) ) − ∇2 L(θ∗ )]T (ˆ − θ∗ ) with ¯(j) a point in the line where W = −∇L(θ ) and [R ]j = [∇ L(θ θ j θ ˆ to θ∗ . Notice that by deﬁnition ∇2 L(θ∗ ) = Qn ∗ = Qn (θ∗ ). To simplify notation we will from θ omit the ∗ in all Qn ∗ . All Qn in this proof are thus evaluated at θ∗ . Breaking this expression into its S and S c components and since ˆS C = θ∗ C = 0 we can eliminate θ S ˆ − θ∗ from the two expressions obtained and write θS S n n n n ˆ z [WS C − RS C ] − Qn C S (Qn )−1 [WS − RS ] + λQn C S (Qn )−1 zS = λˆS C . SS SS S S Now notice that Qn C S (Qn )−1 = T1 + T2 + T3 + T4 where SS S T1 = Q∗ C S [(Qn )−1 − (Q∗ )−1 ] , SS SS S T3 = [Qn C S − Q∗ C S ][(Qn )−1 − (Q∗ )−1 ] , SS SS S S 7 T2 = [Qn C S − Q∗ C S ]Q∗ −1 , SS S S T4 = Q∗ C S Q∗ −1 . SS S (14) We will assume that the samples {x(ℓ) } are such that the following event holds n E ≡ {||Qn − Q∗ ||∞ < ξA , ||Qn C S − Q∗ C S ||∞ < ξB , ||WS /λ||∞ < ξC } , (15) SS SS S S √ 2 n where ξA ≡ Cmin ǫ/(16∆), ξB ≡ Cmin ǫ/(8 ∆) and ξC ≡ Cmin ǫ/(8∆). Since EG,θ (Q ) = Q∗ and EG,θ (W n ) = 0 and noticing that both Qn and W n are sums of bounded i.i.d. random variables, a simple application of Azuma-Hoeffding inequality upper bounds the probability of E as in (10). From E it follows that σmin (Qn ) > σmin (Q∗ ) − Cmin /2 > Cmin /2. We can therefore lower SS SS bound the absolute value of the ith component of zS C by ˆ n n ∆ Rn WS RS Wn + |[Q∗ C S Q∗ −1 ½S ]i |−||T1,i ||∞ −||T2,i ||∞ −||T3,i ||∞ − i − i − SS S λ λ Cmin λ ∞ λ ∞ where the subscript i denotes the i-th row of a matrix. The proof is completed by showing that the event E and the assumptions of the theorem imply that n each of last 7 terms in this expression is smaller than ǫ/8. Since |[Q∗ C S Q∗ −1 ]T zS | ≥ 1 + ǫ by i ˆ SS S assumption, this implies |ˆi | ≥ 1 + ǫ/8 > 1 which cannot be since any subgradient of the 1-norm z has components of magnitude at most 1. The last condition on E immediately bounds all terms involving W by ǫ/8. Some straightforward manipulations imply (See Lemma 7 from [7]) √ ∆ ∆ n ∗ ||T2,i ||∞ ≤ ||[Qn C S − Q∗ C S ]i ||∞ , ||T1,i ||∞ ≤ 2 ||QSS − QSS ||∞ , S S Cmin Cmin 2∆ ||T3,i ||∞ ≤ 2 ||Qn − Q∗ ||∞ ||[Qn C S − Q∗ C S ]i ||∞ , SS SS S S Cmin and thus all will be bounded by ǫ/8 when E holds. The upper bound of Rn follows along similar lines via an mean value theorem, and is deferred to a longer version of this paper. Proof. (Lemma 3.3.) Let us state explicitly the local weak convergence result mentioned in Sec. 3.1. For t ∈ N, let T(t) = (VT , ET ) be the regular rooted tree of t generations and deﬁne the associated Ising measure as ∗ 1 eθxi xj (16) eh xi . µ+ (x) = T,θ ZT,θ (i,j)∈ET i∈∂T(t) Here ∂T(t) is the set of leaves of T(t) and h∗ is the unique positive solution of h = (∆ − 1) atanh {tanh θ tanh h}. It can be proved using [17] and uniform continuity with respect to the ‘external ﬁeld’ that non-trivial local expectations with respect to µG,θ (x) converge to local expectations with respect to µ+ (x), as p → ∞. T,θ More precisely, let Br (t) denote a ball of radius t around node r ∈ G (the node whose neighborhood we are trying to reconstruct). For any ﬁxed t, the probability that Br (t) is not isomorphic to T(t) goes to 0 as p → ∞. Let g(xBr (t) ) be any function of the variables in Br (t) such that g(xBr (t) ) = g(−xBr (t) ). Then almost surely over graph sequences Gp of uniformly random regular graphs with p nodes (expectations here are taken with respect to the measures (1) and (16)) lim EG,θ {g(X Br (t) )} = ET(t),θ,+ {g(X T(t) )} . (17) p→∞ The proof consists in considering [Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ]i for t = dist(r, i) ﬁnite. We then write ˆ∗ S SS (Q∗ )lk = E{gl,k (X Br (t) )} and (Q∗ c S )il = E{gi,l (X Br (t) )} for some functions g·,· (X Br (t) ) and S SS apply the weak convergence result (17) to these expectations. We thus reduced the calculation of [Q∗ c S Q∗ −1 zS ]i to the calculation of expectations with respect to the tree measure (16). The latter ˆ∗ S SS can be implemented explicitly through a recursive procedure, with simpliﬁcations arising thanks to the tree symmetry and by taking t ≫ 1. The actual calculations consist in a (very) long exercise in calculus and we omit them from this outline. The lower bound on σmin (Q∗ ) is proved by a similar calculation.

<p>Author: Matthias Bethge, Eero P. Simoncelli, Fabian H. Sinz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new family of distributions, called Lp -nested symmetric distributions, whose densities are expressed in terms of a hierarchical cascade of Lp norms. This class generalizes the family of spherically and Lp -spherically symmetric distributions which have recently been successfully used for natural image modeling. Similar to those distributions it allows for a nonlinear mechanism to reduce the dependencies between its variables. With suitable choices of the parameters and norms, this family includes the Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) model as a special case, which has been proposed as a means of deriving ﬁlters that mimic complex cells found in mammalian primary visual cortex. Lp -nested distributions are relatively easy to estimate and allow us to explore the variety of models between ISA and the Lp -spherically symmetric models. By ﬁtting the generalized Lp -nested model to 8 × 8 image patches, we show that the subspaces obtained from ISA are in fact more dependent than the individual ﬁlter coefﬁcients within a subspace. When ﬁrst applying contrast gain control as preprocessing, however, there are no dependencies left that could be exploited by ISA. This suggests that complex cell modeling can only be useful for redundancy reduction in larger image patches. 1</p><p>2 0.71419948 <a title="111-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-An_LP_View_of_the_M-best_MAP_problem.html">31 nips-2009-An LP View of the M-best MAP problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ.

<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>4 0.36212575 <a title="111-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Learning_a_Small_Mixture_of_Trees.html">129 nips-2009-Learning a Small Mixture of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating a given probability distribution using a simpler distribution plays an important role in several areas of machine learning, for example variational inference and classiﬁcation. Within this context, we consider the task of learning a mixture of tree distributions. Although mixtures of trees can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence using an EM algorithm, its success depends heavily on the initialization. We propose an efﬁcient strategy for obtaining a good initial set of trees that attempts to cover the entire observed distribution by minimizing the α-divergence with α = ∞. We formulate the problem using the fractional covering framework and present a convergent sequential algorithm that only relies on solving a convex program at each iteration. Compared to previous methods, our approach results in a signiﬁcantly smaller mixture of trees that provides similar or better accuracies. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by learning pictorial structures for face recognition.</p><p>5 0.35444888 <a title="111-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Models_of_Linear_and_Nonlinear_Contextual_Interactions_in_Early_Visual_Processing.html">231 nips-2009-Statistical Models of Linear and Nonlinear Contextual Interactions in Early Visual Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Ruben Coen-cagli, Peter Dayan, Odelia Schwartz</p><p>Abstract: A central hypothesis about early visual processing is that it represents inputs in a coordinate system matched to the statistics of natural scenes. Simple versions of this lead to Gabor–like receptive ﬁelds and divisive gain modulation from local surrounds; these have led to inﬂuential neural and psychological models of visual processing. However, these accounts are based on an incomplete view of the visual context surrounding each point. Here, we consider an approximate model of linear and non–linear correlations between the responses of spatially distributed Gaborlike receptive ﬁelds, which, when trained on an ensemble of natural scenes, uniﬁes a range of spatial context effects. The full model accounts for neural surround data in primary visual cortex (V1), provides a statistical foundation for perceptual phenomena associated with Li’s (2002) hypothesis that V1 builds a saliency map, and ﬁts data on the tilt illusion. 1</p><p>6 0.35436273 <a title="111-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Predicting_the_Optimal_Spacing_of_Study%3A_A_Multiscale_Context_Model_of_Memory.html">194 nips-2009-Predicting the Optimal Spacing of Study: A Multiscale Context Model of Memory</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Bethge, Eero P. Simoncelli, Fabian H. Sinz</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new family of distributions, called Lp -nested symmetric distributions, whose densities are expressed in terms of a hierarchical cascade of Lp norms. This class generalizes the family of spherically and Lp -spherically symmetric distributions which have recently been successfully used for natural image modeling. Similar to those distributions it allows for a nonlinear mechanism to reduce the dependencies between its variables. With suitable choices of the parameters and norms, this family includes the Independent Subspace Analysis (ISA) model as a special case, which has been proposed as a means of deriving ﬁlters that mimic complex cells found in mammalian primary visual cortex. Lp -nested distributions are relatively easy to estimate and allow us to explore the variety of models between ISA and the Lp -spherically symmetric models. By ﬁtting the generalized Lp -nested model to 8 × 8 image patches, we show that the subspaces obtained from ISA are in fact more dependent than the individual ﬁlter coefﬁcients within a subspace. When ﬁrst applying contrast gain control as preprocessing, however, there are no dependencies left that could be exploited by ISA. This suggests that complex cell modeling can only be useful for redundancy reduction in larger image patches. 1</p><p>2 0.77934283 <a title="111-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.76511592 <a title="111-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Bootstrapping_from_Game_Tree_Search.html">48 nips-2009-Bootstrapping from Game Tree Search</a></p>
<p>Author: Joel Veness, David Silver, Alan Blair, William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new algorithm for updating the parameters of a heuristic evaluation function, by updating the heuristic towards the values computed by an alpha-beta search. Our algorithm differs from previous approaches to learning from search, such as Samuel’s checkers player and the TD-Leaf algorithm, in two key ways. First, we update all nodes in the search tree, rather than a single node. Second, we use the outcome of a deep search, instead of the outcome of a subsequent search, as the training signal for the evaluation function. We implemented our algorithm in a chess program Meep, using a linear heuristic function. After initialising its weight vector to small random values, Meep was able to learn high quality weights from self-play alone. When tested online against human opponents, Meep played at a master level, the best performance of any chess program with a heuristic learned entirely from self-play. 1</p><p>4 0.76279849 <a title="111-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Online_Learning_of_Assignments.html">181 nips-2009-Online Learning of Assignments</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew Streeter, Daniel Golovin, Andreas Krause</p><p>Abstract: Which ads should we display in sponsored search in order to maximize our revenue? How should we dynamically rank information sources to maximize the value of the ranking? These applications exhibit strong diminishing returns: Redundancy decreases the marginal utility of each ad or information source. We show that these and other problems can be formalized as repeatedly selecting an assignment of items to positions to maximize a sequence of monotone submodular functions that arrive one by one. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for this general problem and analyze it in the no-regret model. Our algorithm possesses strong theoretical guarantees, such as a performance ratio that converges to the optimal constant of 1 − 1/e. We empirically evaluate our algorithm on two real-world online optimization problems on the web: ad allocation with submodular utilities, and dynamically ranking blogs to detect information cascades. 1</p><p>5 0.76141816 <a title="111-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Beyond_Convexity%3A_Online_Submodular_Minimization.html">45 nips-2009-Beyond Convexity: Online Submodular Minimization</a></p>

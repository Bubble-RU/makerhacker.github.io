<p>Author: Chong Wang, David M. Blei</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric hierarchical Bayesian model of document collections that decouples sparsity and smoothness in the component distributions (i.e., the “topics”). In the sparse topic model (sparseTM), each topic is represented by a bank of selector variables that determine which terms appear in the topic. Thus each topic is associated with a subset of the vocabulary, and topic smoothness is modeled on this subset. We develop an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for the sparseTM that includes a general-purpose method for sampling from a Dirichlet mixture with a combinatorial number of components. We demonstrate the sparseTM on four real-world datasets. Compared to traditional approaches, the empirical results will show that sparseTMs give better predictive performance with simpler inferred models. 1</p><p>3 0.09302602 <a title="30-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Sensitivity_analysis_in_HMMs_with_application_to_likelihood_maximization.html">215 nips-2009-Sensitivity analysis in HMMs with application to likelihood maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a sensitivity analysis in Hidden Markov Models with continuous state and observation spaces. We propose an Inﬁnitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) on the ﬁltering distribution with respect to some parameters of the model. We describe a methodology for using any algorithm that estimates the ﬁltering density, such as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, to design an algorithm that estimates its gradient. The resulting IPA estimator is proven to be asymptotically unbiased, consistent and has computational complexity linear in the number of particles. We consider an application of this analysis to the problem of identifying unknown parameters of the model given a sequence of observations. We derive an IPA estimator for the gradient of the log-likelihood, which may be used in a gradient method for the purpose of likelihood maximization. We illustrate the method with several numerical experiments.</p><p>4 0.085501403 <a title="30-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Free_energy_score_space.html">97 nips-2009-Free energy score space</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Marco Cristani, Umberto Castellani, Vittorio Murino, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: A score function induced by a generative model of the data can provide a feature vector of a ﬁxed dimension for each data sample. Data samples themselves may be of differing lengths (e.g., speech segments, or other sequence data), but as a score function is based on the properties of the data generation process, it produces a ﬁxed-length vector in a highly informative space, typically referred to as a “score space”. Discriminative classiﬁers have been shown to achieve higher performance in appropriately chosen score spaces than is achievable by either the corresponding generative likelihood-based classiﬁers, or the discriminative classiﬁers using standard feature extractors. In this paper, we present a novel score space that exploits the free energy associated with a generative model. The resulting free energy score space (FESS) takes into account latent structure of the data at various levels, and can be trivially shown to lead to classiﬁcation performance that at least matches the performance of the free energy classiﬁer based on the same generative model, and the same factorization of the posterior. We also show that in several typical vision and computational biology applications the classiﬁers optimized in FESS outperform the corresponding pure generative approaches, as well as a number of previous approaches to combining discriminating and generative models.</p><p>5 0.080783784 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Constructing_Topological_Maps_using_Markov_Random_Fields_and_Loop-Closure_Detection.html">58 nips-2009-Constructing Topological Maps using Markov Random Fields and Loop-Closure Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Roy Anati, Kostas Daniilidis</p><p>Abstract: We present a system which constructs a topological map of an environment given a sequence of images. This system includes a novel image similarity score which uses dynamic programming to match images using both the appearance and relative positions of local features simultaneously. Additionally, an MRF is constructed to model the probability of loop-closures. A locally optimal labeling is found using Loopy-BP. Finally we outline a method to generate a topological map from loop closure data. Results, presented on four urban sequences and one indoor sequence, outperform the state of the art. 1</p><p>6 0.080014646 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-On_the_Convergence_of_the_Concave-Convex_Procedure.html">180 nips-2009-On the Convergence of the Concave-Convex Procedure</a></p>

<p>Author: Gert R. Lanckriet, Bharath K. Sriperumbudur</p><p>Abstract: The concave-convex procedure (CCCP) is a majorization-minimization algorithm that solves d.c. (difference of convex functions) programs as a sequence of convex programs. In machine learning, CCCP is extensively used in many learning algorithms like sparse support vector machines (SVMs), transductive SVMs, sparse principal component analysis, etc. Though widely used in many applications, the convergence behavior of CCCP has not gotten a lot of speciﬁc attention. Yuille and Rangarajan analyzed its convergence in their original paper, however, we believe the analysis is not complete. Although the convergence of CCCP can be derived from the convergence of the d.c. algorithm (DCA), its proof is more specialized and technical than actually required for the speciﬁc case of CCCP. In this paper, we follow a different reasoning and show how Zangwill’s global convergence theory of iterative algorithms provides a natural framework to prove the convergence of CCCP, allowing a more elegant and simple proof. This underlines Zangwill’s theory as a powerful and general framework to deal with the convergence issues of iterative algorithms, after also being used to prove the convergence of algorithms like expectation-maximization, generalized alternating minimization, etc. In this paper, we provide a rigorous analysis of the convergence of CCCP by addressing these questions: (i) When does CCCP ﬁnd a local minimum or a stationary point of the d.c. program under consideration? (ii) When does the sequence generated by CCCP converge? We also present an open problem on the issue of local convergence of CCCP.</p><p>3 0.54402739 <a title="30-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-A_Gaussian_Tree_Approximation_for_Integer_Least-Squares.html">10 nips-2009-A Gaussian Tree Approximation for Integer Least-Squares</a></p>
<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Amir Leshem</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm for the linear least squares problem where the unknown variables are constrained to be in a ﬁnite set. The factor graph that corresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence, applying the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. The algorithm described here is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian density of the unconstrained linear system. It is shown that even though the approximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the BP algorithm to the modiﬁed factor graph outperforms current methods in terms of both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO detection.</p><p>4 0.5112372 <a title="30-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Particle-based_Variational_Inference_for_Continuous_Systems.html">187 nips-2009-Particle-based Variational Inference for Continuous Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Frank, Padhraic Smyth, Alexander T. Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Since the development of loopy belief propagation, there has been considerable work on advancing the state of the art for approximate inference over distributions deﬁned on discrete random variables. Improvements include guarantees of convergence, approximations that are provably more accurate, and bounds on the results of exact inference. However, extending these methods to continuous-valued systems has lagged behind. While several methods have been developed to use belief propagation on systems with continuous values, recent advances for discrete variables have not as yet been incorporated. In this context we extend a recently proposed particle-based belief propagation algorithm to provide a general framework for adapting discrete message-passing algorithms to inference in continuous systems. The resulting algorithms behave similarly to their purely discrete counterparts, extending the beneﬁts of these more advanced inference techniques to the continuous domain. 1</p><p>5 0.45161533 <a title="30-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Accelerating_Bayesian_Structural_Inference_for_Non-Decomposable_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">23 nips-2009-Accelerating Bayesian Structural Inference for Non-Decomposable Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Baback Moghaddam, Emtiyaz Khan, Kevin P. Murphy, Benjamin M. Marlin</p><p>Abstract: We make several contributions in accelerating approximate Bayesian structural inference for non-decomposable GGMs. Our ﬁrst contribution is to show how to efﬁciently compute a BIC or Laplace approximation to the marginal likelihood of non-decomposable graphs using convex methods for precision matrix estimation. This optimization technique can be used as a fast scoring function inside standard Stochastic Local Search (SLS) for generating posterior samples. Our second contribution is a novel framework for efﬁciently generating large sets of high-quality graph topologies without performing local search. This graph proposal method, which we call “Neighborhood Fusion” (NF), samples candidate Markov blankets at each node using sparse regression techniques. Our third contribution is a hybrid method combining the complementary strengths of NF and SLS. Experimental results in structural recovery and prediction tasks demonstrate that NF and hybrid NF/SLS out-perform state-of-the-art local search methods, on both synthetic and real-world datasets, when realistic computational limits are imposed.</p><p>6 0.43509442 <a title="30-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Analysis_of_SVM_with_Indefinite_Kernels.html">33 nips-2009-Analysis of SVM with Indefinite Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Stephen Gould, Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Object detection and multi-class image segmentation are two closely related tasks that can be greatly improved when solved jointly by feeding information from one task to the other [10, 11]. However, current state-of-the-art models use a separate representation for each task making joint inference clumsy and leaving the classiﬁcation of many parts of the scene ambiguous. In this work, we propose a hierarchical region-based approach to joint object detection and image segmentation. Our approach simultaneously reasons about pixels, regions and objects in a coherent probabilistic model. Pixel appearance features allow us to perform well on classifying amorphous background classes, while the explicit representation of regions facilitate the computation of more sophisticated features necessary for object detection. Importantly, our model gives a single uniﬁed description of the scene—we explain every pixel in the image and enforce global consistency between all random variables in our model. We run experiments on the challenging Street Scene dataset [2] and show signiﬁcant improvement over state-of-the-art results for object detection accuracy. 1</p><p>2 0.99927789 <a title="30-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Explaining_human_multiple_object_tracking_as_resource-constrained_approximate_inference_in_a_dynamic_probabilistic_model.html">85 nips-2009-Explaining human multiple object tracking as resource-constrained approximate inference in a dynamic probabilistic model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ed Vul, George Alvarez, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Multiple object tracking is a task commonly used to investigate the architecture of human visual attention. Human participants show a distinctive pattern of successes and failures in tracking experiments that is often attributed to limits on an object system, a tracking module, or other specialized cognitive structures. Here we use a computational analysis of the task of object tracking to ask which human failures arise from cognitive limitations and which are consequences of inevitable perceptual uncertainty in the tracking task. We ﬁnd that many human performance phenomena, measured through novel behavioral experiments, are naturally produced by the operation of our ideal observer model (a Rao-Blackwelized particle ﬁlter). The tradeoff between the speed and number of objects being tracked, however, can only arise from the allocation of a ﬂexible cognitive resource, which can be formalized as either memory or attention. 1</p><p>3 0.99911052 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_MAP_Estimation_via_the_Replica_Method_and_Compressed_Sensing.html">36 nips-2009-Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Vivek Goyal, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: The replica method is a non-rigorous but widely-accepted technique from statistical physics used in the asymptotic analysis of large, random, nonlinear problems. This paper applies the replica method to non-Gaussian maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation. It is shown that with random linear measurements and Gaussian noise, the asymptotic behavior of the MAP estimate of an n-dimensional vector “decouples” as n scalar MAP estimators. The result is a counterpart to Guo and Verd´ ’s replica analysis of minimum mean-squared error estimation. u The replica MAP analysis can be readily applied to many estimators used in compressed sensing, including basis pursuit, lasso, linear estimation with thresholding, and zero norm-regularized estimation. In the case of lasso estimation the scalar estimator reduces to a soft-thresholding operator, and for zero normregularized estimation it reduces to a hard-threshold. Among other beneﬁts, the replica method provides a computationally-tractable method for exactly computing various performance metrics including mean-squared error and sparsity pattern recovery probability.</p><p>4 0.99877894 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Hierarchical_Learning_of_Dimensional_Biases_in_Human_Categorization.html">109 nips-2009-Hierarchical Learning of Dimensional Biases in Human Categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Sanborn, Nick Chater, Katherine A. Heller</p><p>Abstract: Existing models of categorization typically represent to-be-classiﬁed items as points in a multidimensional space. While from a mathematical point of view, an inﬁnite number of basis sets can be used to represent points in this space, the choice of basis set is psychologically crucial. People generally choose the same basis dimensions – and have a strong preference to generalize along the axes of these dimensions, but not “diagonally”. What makes some choices of dimension special? We explore the idea that the dimensions used by people echo the natural variation in the environment. Speciﬁcally, we present a rational model that does not assume dimensions, but learns the same type of dimensional generalizations that people display. This bias is shaped by exposing the model to many categories with a structure hypothesized to be like those which children encounter. The learning behaviour of the model captures the developmental shift from roughly “isotropic” for children to the axis-aligned generalization that adults show. 1</p><p>5 0.99845129 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Neurometric_function_analysis_of_population_codes.html">163 nips-2009-Neurometric function analysis of population codes</a></p>
<p>Author: Philipp Berens, Sebastian Gerwinn, Alexander Ecker, Matthias Bethge</p><p>Abstract: The relative merits of different population coding schemes have mostly been analyzed in the framework of stimulus reconstruction using Fisher Information. Here, we consider the case of stimulus discrimination in a two alternative forced choice paradigm and compute neurometric functions in terms of the minimal discrimination error and the Jensen-Shannon information to study neural population codes. We ﬁrst explore the relationship between minimum discrimination error, JensenShannon Information and Fisher Information and show that the discrimination framework is more informative about the coding accuracy than Fisher Information as it deﬁnes an error for any pair of possible stimuli. In particular, it includes Fisher Information as a special case. Second, we use the framework to study population codes of angular variables. Speciﬁcally, we assess the impact of different noise correlations structures on coding accuracy in long versus short decoding time windows. That is, for long time window we use the common Gaussian noise approximation. To address the case of short time windows we analyze the Ising model with identical noise correlation structure. In this way, we provide a new rigorous framework for assessing the functional consequences of noise correlation structures for the representational accuracy of neural population codes that is in particular applicable to short-time population coding. 1</p><p>6 0.99831241 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Lower_bounds_on_minimax_rates_for_nonparametric_regression_with_additive_sparsity_and_smoothness.html">144 nips-2009-Lower bounds on minimax rates for nonparametric regression with additive sparsity and smoothness</a></p>

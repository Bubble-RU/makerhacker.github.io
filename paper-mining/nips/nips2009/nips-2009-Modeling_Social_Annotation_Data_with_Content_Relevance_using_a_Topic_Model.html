<p>Author: Lan Du, Lu Ren, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A non-parametric Bayesian model is proposed for processing multiple images. The analysis employs image features and, when present, the words associated with accompanying annotations. The model clusters the images into classes, and each image is segmented into a set of objects, also allowing the opportunity to assign a word to each object (localized labeling). Each object is assumed to be represented as a heterogeneous mix of components, with this realized via mixture models linking image features to object types. The number of image classes, number of object types, and the characteristics of the object-feature mixture models are inferred nonparametrically. To constitute spatially contiguous objects, a new logistic stick-breaking process is developed. Inference is performed efﬁciently via variational Bayesian analysis, with example results presented on two image databases.</p><p>3 0.14834812 <a title="153-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Filtering_Abstract_Senses_From_Image_Search_Results.html">96 nips-2009-Filtering Abstract Senses From Image Search Results</a></p>
<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method that, given a word, automatically selects non-abstract senses of that word from an online ontology and generates images depicting the corresponding entities. When faced with the task of learning a visual model based only on the name of an object, a common approach is to ﬁnd images on the web that are associated with the object name and train a visual classiﬁer from the search result. As words are generally polysemous, this approach can lead to relatively noisy models if many examples due to outlier senses are added to the model. We argue that images associated with an abstract word sense should be excluded when training a visual classiﬁer to learn a model of a physical object. While image clustering can group together visually coherent sets of returned images, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish whether an image cluster relates to a desired object or to an abstract sense of the word. We propose a method that uses both image features and the text associated with the images to relate latent topics to particular senses. Our model does not require any human supervision, and takes as input only the name of an object category. We show results of retrieving concrete-sense images in two available multimodal, multi-sense databases, as well as experiment with object classiﬁers trained on concrete-sense images returned by our method for a set of ten common ofﬁce objects. 1</p><p>4 0.11952695 <a title="153-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Rethinking_LDA%3A_Why_Priors_Matter.html">205 nips-2009-Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, David M. Mimno, Hanna M. Wallach</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of topic models typically use symmetric Dirichlet priors with ﬁxed concentration parameters, with the implicit assumption that such “smoothing parameters” have little practical effect. In this paper, we explore several classes of structured priors for topic models. We ﬁnd that an asymmetric Dirichlet prior over the document–topic distributions has substantial advantages over a symmetric prior, while an asymmetric prior over the topic–word distributions provides no real beneﬁt. Approximation of this prior structure through simple, efﬁcient hyperparameter optimization steps is sufﬁcient to achieve these performance gains. The prior structure we advocate substantially increases the robustness of topic models to variations in the number of topics and to the highly skewed word frequency distributions common in natural language. Since this prior structure can be implemented using efﬁcient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques, we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling. 1</p><p>5 0.11105853 <a title="153-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>

We present efﬁcient learning and inference algorithms for this model, and show how a Monte-Carlo based method, Annealed Importance Sampling, can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the log-probability the model assigns to test data.

<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning probabilistic models for complex relational structures between various types of objects. A model can help us “understand” a dataset of relational facts in at least two ways, by ﬁnding interpretable structure in the data, and by supporting predictions, or inferences about whether particular unobserved relations are likely to be true. Often there is a tradeoff between these two aims: cluster-based models yield more easily interpretable representations, while factorization-based approaches have given better predictive performance on large data sets. We introduce the Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization (BCTF) model, which embeds a factorized representation of relations in a nonparametric Bayesian clustering framework. Inference is fully Bayesian but scales well to large data sets. The model simultaneously discovers interpretable clusters and yields predictive performance that matches or beats previous probabilistic models for relational data.</p><p>3 0.72142005 <a title="153-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Maximin_affinity_learning_of_image_segmentation.html">149 nips-2009-Maximin affinity learning of image segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Briggman, Winfried Denk, Sebastian Seung, Moritz N. Helmstaedter, Srinivas C. Turaga</p><p>Abstract: Images can be segmented by ﬁrst using a classiﬁer to predict an afﬁnity graph that reﬂects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the afﬁnity classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassiﬁcation rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the afﬁnity graph. We present the ﬁrst machine learning algorithm for training a classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classiﬁcation of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of ﬁnding the connected components of the thresholded afﬁnity graph, we are able to train an afﬁnity classiﬁer to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin afﬁnities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity. 1</p><p>4 0.71545517 <a title="153-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli_Alignment%3A_A_Generative_Model_for_Multi-Class_Multi-Label_Multi-Instance_Corpora.html">68 nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment: A Generative Model for Multi-Class Multi-Label Multi-Instance Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang-hong Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Bao-gang Hu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predeﬁned classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-deﬁned classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classiﬁcation and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classiﬁcation and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.</p><p>5 0.70533282 <a title="153-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Streaming_Pointwise_Mutual_Information.html">233 nips-2009-Streaming Pointwise Mutual Information</a></p>
<p>Author: Benjamin V. Durme, Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has led to the ability to perform space efﬁcient, approximate counting over large vocabularies in a streaming context. Motivated by the existence of data structures of this type, we explore the computation of associativity scores, otherwise known as pointwise mutual information (PMI), in a streaming context. We give theoretical bounds showing the impracticality of perfect online PMI computation, and detail an algorithm with high expected accuracy. Experiments on news articles show our approach gives high accuracy on real world data. 1</p><p>6 0.70008224 <a title="153-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Individuation%2C_Identification_and_Object_Discovery.html">115 nips-2009-Individuation, Identification and Object Discovery</a></p>

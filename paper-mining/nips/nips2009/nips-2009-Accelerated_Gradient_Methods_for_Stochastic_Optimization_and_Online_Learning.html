<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a sensitivity analysis in Hidden Markov Models with continuous state and observation spaces. We propose an Inﬁnitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) on the ﬁltering distribution with respect to some parameters of the model. We describe a methodology for using any algorithm that estimates the ﬁltering density, such as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, to design an algorithm that estimates its gradient. The resulting IPA estimator is proven to be asymptotically unbiased, consistent and has computational complexity linear in the number of particles. We consider an application of this analysis to the problem of identifying unknown parameters of the model given a sequence of observations. We derive an IPA estimator for the gradient of the log-likelihood, which may be used in a gradient method for the purpose of likelihood maximization. We illustrate the method with several numerical experiments.</p><p>4 0.24696356 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-On_Learning_Rotations.html">177 nips-2009-On Learning Rotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Raman Arora</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for online learning of rotations. The proposed algorithm involves matrix exponentiated gradient updates and is motivated by the von Neumann divergence. The multiplicative updates are exponentiated skew-symmetric matrices which comprise the Lie algebra of the rotation group. The orthonormality and unit determinant of the matrix parameter are preserved using matrix logarithms and exponentials and the algorithm lends itself to intuitive interpretation in terms of the differential geometry of the manifold associated with the rotation group. A complexity reduction result is presented that exploits the eigenstructure of the matrix updates to simplify matrix exponentiation to a quadratic form. 1</p><p>5 0.22246712 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Sharing_Features_among_Dynamical_Systems_with_Beta_Processes.html">217 nips-2009-Sharing Features among Dynamical Systems with Beta Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan, Emily B. Fox</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to the problem of modeling related time series. Using a beta process prior, our approach is based on the discovery of a set of latent dynamical behaviors that are shared among multiple time series. The size of the set and the sharing pattern are both inferred from data. We develop an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference method that is based on the Indian buffet process representation of the predictive distribution of the beta process. In particular, our approach uses the sum-product algorithm to efﬁciently compute Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities, and explores new dynamical behaviors via birth/death proposals. We validate our sampling algorithm using several synthetic datasets, and also demonstrate promising results on unsupervised segmentation of visual motion capture data.</p><p>6 0.20214753 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Regularized_Distance_Metric_Learning%3ATheory_and_Algorithm.html">202 nips-2009-Regularized Distance Metric Learning:Theory and Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: We present AROW, a new online learning algorithm that combines several useful properties: large margin training, conﬁdence weighting, and the capacity to handle non-separable data. AROW performs adaptive regularization of the prediction function upon seeing each new instance, allowing it to perform especially well in the presence of label noise. We derive a mistake bound, similar in form to the second order perceptron bound, that does not assume separability. We also relate our algorithm to recent conﬁdence-weighted online learning techniques and show empirically that AROW achieves state-of-the-art performance and notable robustness in the case of non-separable data. 1</p><p>4 0.62529558 <a title="22-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-On_Learning_Rotations.html">177 nips-2009-On Learning Rotations</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Guillory, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate methods for selecting sets of labeled vertices for use in predicting the labels of vertices on a graph. We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate. We show improved performance over baseline methods on several real world data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.46539506 <a title="22-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Sparse_and_Locally_Constant_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">224 nips-2009-Sparse and Locally Constant Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Honorio, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios, Rita Goldstein, Luis E. Ortiz</p><p>Abstract: Locality information is crucial in datasets where each variable corresponds to a measurement in a manifold (silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images). Although these datasets are typically under-sampled and high-dimensional, they often need to be represented with low-complexity statistical models, which are comprised of only the important probabilistic dependencies in the datasets. Most methods attempt to reduce model complexity by enforcing structure sparseness. However, sparseness cannot describe inherent regularities in the structure. Hence, in this paper we ﬁrst propose a new class of Gaussian graphical models which, together with sparseness, imposes local constancy through 1 -norm penalization. Second, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm which decomposes the strictly convex maximum likelihood estimation into a sequence of problems with closed form solutions. Through synthetic experiments, we evaluate the closeness of the recovered models to the ground truth. We also test the generalization performance of our method in a wide range of complex real-world datasets and demonstrate that it captures useful structures such as the rotation and shrinking of a beating heart, motion correlations between body parts during walking and functional interactions of brain regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art structure learning techniques for Gaussian graphical models both for small and large datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.45987481 <a title="22-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Help_or_Hinder%3A_Bayesian_Models_of_Social_Goal_Inference.html">107 nips-2009-Help or Hinder: Bayesian Models of Social Goal Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomer Ullman, Chris Baker, Owen Macindoe, Owain Evans, Noah Goodman, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Everyday social interactions are heavily inﬂuenced by our snap judgments about others’ goals. Even young infants can infer the goals of intentional agents from observing how they interact with objects and other agents in their environment: e.g., that one agent is ‘helping’ or ‘hindering’ another’s attempt to get up a hill or open a box. We propose a model for how people can infer these social goals from actions, based on inverse planning in multiagent Markov decision problems (MDPs). The model infers the goal most likely to be driving an agent’s behavior by assuming the agent acts approximately rationally given environmental constraints and its model of other agents present. We also present behavioral evidence in support of this model over a simpler, perceptual cue-based alternative. 1</p><p>5 0.42538995 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.41665232 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-On_Learning_Rotations.html">177 nips-2009-On Learning Rotations</a></p>

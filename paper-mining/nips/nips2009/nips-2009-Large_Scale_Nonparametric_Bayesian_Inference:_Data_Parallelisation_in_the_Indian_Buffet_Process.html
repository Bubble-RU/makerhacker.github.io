<p>Author: Douglas Eck, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron C. Courville</p><p>Abstract: The Indian Buffet Process is a Bayesian nonparametric approach that models objects as arising from an inﬁnite number of latent factors. Here we extend the latent factor model framework to two or more unbounded layers of latent factors. From a generative perspective, each layer deﬁnes a conditional factorial prior distribution over the binary latent variables of the layer below via a noisy-or mechanism. We explore the properties of the model with two empirical studies, one digit recognition task and one music tag data experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.2077561 <a title="123-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Sharing_Features_among_Dynamical_Systems_with_Beta_Processes.html">217 nips-2009-Sharing Features among Dynamical Systems with Beta Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan S. Willsky, Erik B. Sudderth, Michael I. Jordan, Emily B. Fox</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Bayesian nonparametric approach to the problem of modeling related time series. Using a beta process prior, our approach is based on the discovery of a set of latent dynamical behaviors that are shared among multiple time series. The size of the set and the sharing pattern are both inferred from data. We develop an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference method that is based on the Indian buffet process representation of the predictive distribution of the beta process. In particular, our approach uses the sum-product algorithm to efﬁciently compute Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities, and explores new dynamical behaviors via birth/death proposals. We validate our sampling algorithm using several synthetic datasets, and also demonstrate promising results on unsupervised segmentation of visual motion capture data.</p><p>4 0.19648044 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Latent_Feature_Models_for_Link_Prediction.html">174 nips-2009-Nonparametric Latent Feature Models for Link Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kurt Miller, Michael I. Jordan, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: As the availability and importance of relational data—such as the friendships summarized on a social networking website—increases, it becomes increasingly important to have good models for such data. The kinds of latent structure that have been considered for use in predicting links in such networks have been relatively limited. In particular, the machine learning community has focused on latent class models, adapting Bayesian nonparametric methods to jointly infer how many latent classes there are while learning which entities belong to each class. We pursue a similar approach with a richer kind of latent variable—latent features—using a Bayesian nonparametric approach to simultaneously infer the number of features at the same time we learn which entities have each feature. Our model combines these inferred features with known covariates in order to perform link prediction. We demonstrate that the greater expressiveness of this approach allows us to improve performance on three datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.18319017 <a title="123-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Indian_Buffet_Processes_with_Power-law_Behavior.html">114 nips-2009-Indian Buffet Processes with Power-law Behavior</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Dilan Gorur</p><p>Abstract: The Indian buffet process (IBP) is an exchangeable distribution over binary matrices used in Bayesian nonparametric featural models. In this paper we propose a three-parameter generalization of the IBP exhibiting power-law behavior. We achieve this by generalizing the beta process (the de Finetti measure of the IBP) to the stable-beta process and deriving the IBP corresponding to it. We ﬁnd interesting relationships between the stable-beta process and the Pitman-Yor process (another stochastic process used in Bayesian nonparametric models with interesting power-law properties). We derive a stick-breaking construction for the stable-beta process, and ﬁnd that our power-law IBP is a good model for word occurrences in document corpora. 1</p><p>6 0.15678562 <a title="123-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models_on_Decomposable_Graphs.html">40 nips-2009-Bayesian Nonparametric Models on Decomposable Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Parikshit Ram, Dongryeol Lee, Hua Ouyang, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The long-standing problem of efďŹ cient nearest-neighbor (NN) search has ubiquitous applications ranging from astrophysics to MP3 ďŹ ngerprinting to bioinformatics to movie recommendations. As the dimensionality of the dataset increases, exact NN search becomes computationally prohibitive; (1+đ?&oelig;&ndash;) distance-approximate NN search can provide large speedups but risks losing the meaning of NN search present in the ranks (ordering) of the distances. This paper presents a simple, practical algorithm allowing the user to, for the ďŹ rst time, directly control the true accuracy of NN search (in terms of ranks) while still achieving the large speedups over exact NN. Experiments on high-dimensional datasets show that our algorithm often achieves faster and more accurate results than the best-known distance-approximate method, with much more stable behavior. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.84023947 <a title="123-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>

<p>Author: James Petterson, Jin Yu, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for learning max-weight matching predictors in bipartite graphs. The method consists of performing maximum a posteriori estimation in exponential families with sufﬁcient statistics that encode permutations and data features. Although inference is in general hard, we show that for one very relevant application–document ranking–exact inference is efﬁcient. For general model instances, an appropriate sampler is readily available. Contrary to existing max-margin matching models, our approach is statistically consistent and, in addition, experiments with increasing sample sizes indicate superior improvement over such models. We apply the method to graph matching in computer vision as well as to a standard benchmark dataset for learning document ranking, in which we obtain state-of-the-art results, in particular improving on max-margin variants. The drawback of this method with respect to max-margin alternatives is its runtime for large graphs, which is comparatively high. 1</p><p>4 0.79307419 <a title="123-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Honglak Lee, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classiﬁer. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We ﬁnd that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We ﬁnd that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of “deep” vs. “shallower” representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.79134792 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Learning_using_Sparse_Eigenfunction_Bases.html">213 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Learning using Sparse Eigenfunction Bases</a></p>
<p>Author: Kaushik Sinha, Mikhail Belkin</p><p>Abstract: We present a new framework for semi-supervised learning with sparse eigenfunction bases of kernel matrices. It turns out that when the data has clustered, that is, when the high density regions are sufﬁciently separated by low density valleys, each high density area corresponds to a unique representative eigenvector. Linear combination of such eigenvectors (or, more precisely, of their Nystrom extensions) provide good candidates for good classiﬁcation functions when the cluster assumption holds. By ﬁrst choosing an appropriate basis of these eigenvectors from unlabeled data and then using labeled data with Lasso to select a classiﬁer in the span of these eigenvectors, we obtain a classiﬁer, which has a very sparse representation in this basis. Importantly, the sparsity corresponds naturally to the cluster assumption. Experimental results on a number of real-world data-sets show that our method is competitive with the state of the art semi-supervised learning algorithms and outperforms the natural base-line algorithm (Lasso in the Kernel PCA basis). 1</p><p>6 0.79124743 <a title="123-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Time-Varying_Dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">246 nips-2009-Time-Varying Dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>

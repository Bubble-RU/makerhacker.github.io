<p>Author: Piyush Rai, Hal Daume</p><p>Abstract: Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) is a useful technique for modeling dependencies between two (or more) sets of variables. Building upon the recently suggested probabilistic interpretation of CCA, we propose a nonparametric, fully Bayesian framework that can automatically select the number of correlation components, and effectively capture the sparsity underlying the projections. In addition, given (partially) labeled data, our algorithm can also be used as a (semi)supervised dimensionality reduction technique, and can be applied to learn useful predictive features in the context of learning a set of related tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed approach for both CCA as a stand-alone problem, and when applied to multi-label prediction. 1</p><p>3 0.232177 <a title="83-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Exploring_Functional_Connectivities_of_the_Human_Brain_using_Multivariate_Information_Analysis.html">86 nips-2009-Exploring Functional Connectivities of the Human Brain using Multivariate Information Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Barry Chai, Dirk Walther, Diane Beck, Li Fei-fei</p><p>Abstract: In this study, we present a new method for establishing fMRI pattern-based functional connectivity between brain regions by estimating their multivariate mutual information. Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to ﬁnd strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.</p><p>4 0.18460672 <a title="83-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Boosting_with_Spatial_Regularization.html">47 nips-2009-Boosting with Spatial Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Yongxin Xi, Uri Hasson, Peter J. Ramadge, Zhen J. Xiang</p><p>Abstract: By adding a spatial regularization kernel to a standard loss function formulation of the boosting problem, we develop a framework for spatially informed boosting. From this regularized loss framework we derive an efﬁcient boosting algorithm that uses additional weights/priors on the base classiﬁers. We prove that the proposed algorithm exhibits a “grouping effect”, which encourages the selection of all spatially local, discriminative base classiﬁers. The algorithm’s primary advantage is in applications where the trained classiﬁer is used to identify the spatial pattern of discriminative information, e.g. the voxel selection problem in fMRI. We demonstrate the algorithm’s performance on various data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.16733128 <a title="83-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Discriminative_Network_Models_of_Schizophrenia.html">70 nips-2009-Discriminative Network Models of Schizophrenia</a></p>

Cecchi</p><p>Abstract: Schizophrenia is a complex psychiatric disorder that has eluded a characterization in terms of local abnormalities of brain activity, and is hypothesized to affect the collective, “emergent” working of the brain. We propose a novel data-driven approach to capture emergent features using functional brain networks [4] extracted from fMRI data, and demonstrate its advantage over traditional region-of-interest (ROI) and local, task-speciﬁc linear activation analyzes. Our results suggest that schizophrenia is indeed associated with disruption of global brain properties related to its functioning as a network, which cannot be explained by alteration of local activation patterns. Moreover, further exploitation of interactions by sparse Markov Random Field classiﬁers shows clear gain over linear methods, such as Gaussian Naive Bayes and SVM, allowing to reach 86% accuracy (over 50% baseline - random guess), which is quite remarkable given that it is based on a single fMRI experiment using a simple auditory task. 1</p><p>6 0.14965594 <a title="83-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Augmenting_Feature-driven_fMRI_Analyses%3A_Semi-supervised_learning_and_resting_state_activity.html">38 nips-2009-Augmenting Feature-driven fMRI Analyses: Semi-supervised learning and resting state activity</a></p>

<p>Author: Feng Zhou, Fernando Torre</p><p>Abstract: Alignment of time series is an important problem to solve in many scientiﬁc disciplines. In particular, temporal alignment of two or more subjects performing similar activities is a challenging problem due to the large temporal scale difference between human actions as well as the inter/intra subject variability. In this paper we present canonical time warping (CTW), an extension of canonical correlation analysis (CCA) for spatio-temporal alignment of human motion between two subjects. CTW extends previous work on CCA in two ways: (i) it combines CCA with dynamic time warping (DTW), and (ii) it extends CCA by allowing local spatial deformations. We show CTW’s effectiveness in three experiments: alignment of synthetic data, alignment of motion capture data of two subjects performing similar actions, and alignment of similar facial expressions made by two people. Our results demonstrate that CTW provides both visually and qualitatively better alignment than state-of-the-art techniques based on DTW. 1</p><p>4 0.50497872 <a title="83-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Exploring_Functional_Connectivities_of_the_Human_Brain_using_Multivariate_Information_Analysis.html">86 nips-2009-Exploring Functional Connectivities of the Human Brain using Multivariate Information Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Jie Luo, Barbara Caputo, Vittorio Ferrari</p><p>Abstract: Given a corpus of news items consisting of images accompanied by text captions, we want to ﬁnd out “who’s doing what”, i.e. associate names and action verbs in the captions to the face and body pose of the persons in the images. We present a joint model for simultaneously solving the image-caption correspondences and learning visual appearance models for the face and pose classes occurring in the corpus. These models can then be used to recognize people and actions in novel images without captions. We demonstrate experimentally that our joint ‘face and pose’ model solves the correspondence problem better than earlier models covering only the face, and that it can perform recognition of new uncaptioned images. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.56207633 <a title="83-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Estimating_image_bases_for_visual_image_reconstruction_from_human_brain_activity.html">83 nips-2009-Estimating image bases for visual image reconstruction from human brain activity</a></p>

We propose a simple and general framework to construct dependent DPs by marginalizing and normalizing a single gamma process over an extended space. The result is a set of DPs, each associated with a point in a space such that neighbouring DPs are more dependent. We describe Markov chain Monte Carlo inference involving Gibbs sampling and three different Metropolis-Hastings proposals to speed up convergence. We report an empirical study of convergence on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate an application of the model to topic modeling through time. 1</p><p>4 0.52886969 <a title="83-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-The_Infinite_Partially_Observable_Markov_Decision_Process.html">242 nips-2009-The Infinite Partially Observable Markov Decision Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez</p><p>Abstract: The Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) framework has proven useful in planning domains where agents must balance actions that provide knowledge and actions that provide reward. Unfortunately, most POMDPs are complex structures with a large number of parameters. In many real-world problems, both the structure and the parameters are difﬁcult to specify from domain knowledge alone. Recent work in Bayesian reinforcement learning has made headway in learning POMDP models; however, this work has largely focused on learning the parameters of the POMDP model. We deﬁne an inﬁnite POMDP (iPOMDP) model that does not require knowledge of the size of the state space; instead, it assumes that the number of visited states will grow as the agent explores its world and only models visited states explicitly. We demonstrate the iPOMDP on several standard problems. 1</p><p>5 0.42906213 <a title="83-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_to_Explore_and_Exploit_in_POMDPs.html">134 nips-2009-Learning to Explore and Exploit in POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenghui Cai, Xuejun Liao, Lawrence Carin</p><p>Abstract: A fundamental objective in reinforcement learning is the maintenance of a proper balance between exploration and exploitation. This problem becomes more challenging when the agent can only partially observe the states of its environment. In this paper we propose a dual-policy method for jointly learning the agent behavior and the balance between exploration exploitation, in partially observable environments. The method subsumes traditional exploration, in which the agent takes actions to gather information about the environment, and active learning, in which the agent queries an oracle for optimal actions (with an associated cost for employing the oracle). The form of the employed exploration is dictated by the speciﬁc problem. Theoretical guarantees are provided concerning the optimality of the balancing of exploration and exploitation. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by experimental results on benchmark problems.</p><p>6 0.41869602 <a title="83-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Source_Localization_with_the_Multivariate_Laplace_Prior.html">41 nips-2009-Bayesian Source Localization with the Multivariate Laplace Prior</a></p>

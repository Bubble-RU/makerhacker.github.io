In contrast to recent work in semantic alignment of scenes, we allow an input image to be explained by partial matches of similar scenes. This allows for a better explanation of the input scenes. We perform MRF-based segmentation that optimizes over matches, while respecting boundary information. The recovered segments are then used to re-query a large database of images to retrieve better matches for the target regions. We show improved performance in detecting the principal occluding and contact boundaries for the scene over previous methods on data gathered from the LabelMe database.</p><p>3 0.10272932 <a title="172-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Filtering_Abstract_Senses_From_Image_Search_Results.html">96 nips-2009-Filtering Abstract Senses From Image Search Results</a></p>
<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method that, given a word, automatically selects non-abstract senses of that word from an online ontology and generates images depicting the corresponding entities. When faced with the task of learning a visual model based only on the name of an object, a common approach is to ﬁnd images on the web that are associated with the object name and train a visual classiﬁer from the search result. As words are generally polysemous, this approach can lead to relatively noisy models if many examples due to outlier senses are added to the model. We argue that images associated with an abstract word sense should be excluded when training a visual classiﬁer to learn a model of a physical object. While image clustering can group together visually coherent sets of returned images, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish whether an image cluster relates to a desired object or to an abstract sense of the word. We propose a method that uses both image features and the text associated with the images to relate latent topics to particular senses. Our model does not require any human supervision, and takes as input only the name of an object category. We show results of retrieving concrete-sense images in two available multimodal, multi-sense databases, as well as experiment with object classiﬁers trained on concrete-sense images returned by our method for a set of ten common ofﬁce objects. 1</p><p>4 0.086559579 <a title="172-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-The_%27tree-dependent_components%27_of_natural_scenes_are_edge_filters.html">241 nips-2009-The 'tree-dependent components' of natural scenes are edge filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>5 0.07779979 <a title="172-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Sharing_Features_among_Dynamical_Systems_with_Beta_Processes.html">217 nips-2009-Sharing Features among Dynamical Systems with Beta Processes</a></p>

Using a beta process prior, our approach is based on the discovery of a set of latent dynamical behaviors that are shared among multiple time series. The size of the set and the sharing pattern are both inferred from data. We develop an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference method that is based on the Indian buffet process representation of the predictive distribution of the beta process. In particular, our approach uses the sum-product algorithm to efﬁciently compute Metropolis-Hastings acceptance probabilities, and explores new dynamical behaviors via birth/death proposals.

<p>Author: Long Zhu, Yuanahao Chen, Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for texture learning and synthesis. A texture image is represented by a 2D Hidden Markov Model (2DHMM) where the hidden states correspond to the cluster labeling of textons and the transition matrix encodes their spatial layout (the compatibility between adjacent textons). The 2DHMM is coupled with the Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which allows the number of textons and the complexity of transition matrix grow as the input texture becomes irregular. The HDP makes use of Dirichlet process prior which favors regular textures by penalizing the model complexity. This framework (HDP-2DHMM) learns the texton vocabulary and their spatial layout jointly and automatically. The HDP-2DHMM results in a compact representation of textures which allows fast texture synthesis with comparable rendering quality over the state-of-the-art patch-based rendering methods. We also show that the HDP2DHMM can be applied to perform image segmentation and synthesis. The preliminary results suggest that HDP-2DHMM is generally useful for further applications in low-level vision problems. 1</p><p>2 0.60896301 <a title="172-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-An_Additive_Latent_Feature_Model_for_Transparent_Object_Recognition.html">28 nips-2009-An Additive Latent Feature Model for Transparent Object Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mario Fritz, Gary Bradski, Sergey Karayev, Trevor Darrell, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Existing methods for visual recognition based on quantized local features can perform poorly when local features exist on transparent surfaces, such as glass or plastic objects. There are characteristic patterns to the local appearance of transparent objects, but they may not be well captured by distances to individual examples or by a local pattern codebook obtained by vector quantization. The appearance of a transparent patch is determined in part by the refraction of a background pattern through a transparent medium: the energy from the background usually dominates the patch appearance. We model transparent local patch appearance using an additive model of latent factors: background factors due to scene content, and factors which capture a local edge energy distribution characteristic of the refraction. We implement our method using a novel LDA-SIFT formulation which performs LDA prior to any vector quantization step; we discover latent topics which are characteristic of particular transparent patches and quantize the SIFT space into transparent visual words according to the latent topic dimensions. No knowledge of the background scene is required at test time; we show examples recognizing transparent glasses in a domestic environment. 1</p><p>3 0.55095625 <a title="172-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Filtering_Abstract_Senses_From_Image_Search_Results.html">96 nips-2009-Filtering Abstract Senses From Image Search Results</a></p>
<p>Author: Kate Saenko, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised method that, given a word, automatically selects non-abstract senses of that word from an online ontology and generates images depicting the corresponding entities. When faced with the task of learning a visual model based only on the name of an object, a common approach is to ﬁnd images on the web that are associated with the object name and train a visual classiﬁer from the search result. As words are generally polysemous, this approach can lead to relatively noisy models if many examples due to outlier senses are added to the model. We argue that images associated with an abstract word sense should be excluded when training a visual classiﬁer to learn a model of a physical object. While image clustering can group together visually coherent sets of returned images, it can be difﬁcult to distinguish whether an image cluster relates to a desired object or to an abstract sense of the word. We propose a method that uses both image features and the text associated with the images to relate latent topics to particular senses. Our model does not require any human supervision, and takes as input only the name of an object category. We show results of retrieving concrete-sense images in two available multimodal, multi-sense databases, as well as experiment with object classiﬁers trained on concrete-sense images returned by our method for a set of ten common ofﬁce objects. 1</p><p>4 0.54238379 <a title="172-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-The_%27tree-dependent_components%27_of_natural_scenes_are_edge_filters.html">241 nips-2009-The 'tree-dependent components' of natural scenes are edge filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>5 0.52156019 <a title="172-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Constructing_Topological_Maps_using_Markov_Random_Fields_and_Loop-Closure_Detection.html">58 nips-2009-Constructing Topological Maps using Markov Random Fields and Loop-Closure Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Zhu, Yuanahao Chen, Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for texture learning and synthesis. A texture image is represented by a 2D Hidden Markov Model (2DHMM) where the hidden states correspond to the cluster labeling of textons and the transition matrix encodes their spatial layout (the compatibility between adjacent textons). The 2DHMM is coupled with the Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which allows the number of textons and the complexity of transition matrix grow as the input texture becomes irregular. The HDP makes use of Dirichlet process prior which favors regular textures by penalizing the model complexity. This framework (HDP-2DHMM) learns the texton vocabulary and their spatial layout jointly and automatically. The HDP-2DHMM results in a compact representation of textures which allows fast texture synthesis with comparable rendering quality over the state-of-the-art patch-based rendering methods. We also show that the HDP2DHMM can be applied to perform image segmentation and synthesis. The preliminary results suggest that HDP-2DHMM is generally useful for further applications in low-level vision problems. 1</p><p>2 0.86249381 <a title="172-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Training_Factor_Graphs_with_Reinforcement_Learning_for_Efficient_MAP_Inference.html">250 nips-2009-Training Factor Graphs with Reinforcement Learning for Efficient MAP Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Khashayar Rohanimanesh, Sameer Singh, Andrew McCallum, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Large, relational factor graphs with structure deﬁned by ﬁrst-order logic or other languages give rise to notoriously difﬁcult inference problems. Because unrolling the structure necessary to represent distributions over all hypotheses has exponential blow-up, solutions are often derived from MCMC. However, because of limitations in the design and parameterization of the jump function, these samplingbased methods suffer from local minima—the system must transition through lower-scoring conﬁgurations before arriving at a better MAP solution. This paper presents a new method of explicitly selecting fruitful downward jumps by leveraging reinforcement learning (RL). Rather than setting parameters to maximize the likelihood of the training data, parameters of the factor graph are treated as a log-linear function approximator and learned with methods of temporal difference (TD); MAP inference is performed by executing the resulting policy on held out test data. Our method allows efﬁcient gradient updates since only factors in the neighborhood of variables affected by an action need to be computed—we bypass the need to compute marginals entirely. Our method yields dramatic empirical success, producing new state-of-the-art results on a complex joint model of ontology alignment, with a 48% reduction in error over state-of-the-art in that domain. 1</p><p>3 0.83194381 <a title="172-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_model_complexity_with_the_prior_predictive.html">152 nips-2009-Measuring model complexity with the prior predictive</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolf Vanpaemel</p><p>Abstract: In the last few decades, model complexity has received a lot of press. While many methods have been proposed that jointly measure a model’s descriptive adequacy and its complexity, few measures exist that measure complexity in itself. Moreover, existing measures ignore the parameter prior, which is an inherent part of the model and affects the complexity. This paper presents a stand alone measure for model complexity, that takes the number of parameters, the functional form, the range of the parameters and the parameter prior into account. This Prior Predictive Complexity (PPC) is an intuitive and easy to compute measure. It starts from the observation that model complexity is the property of the model that enables it to ﬁt a wide range of outcomes. The PPC then measures how wide this range exactly is. keywords: Model Selection & Structure Learning; Model Comparison Methods; Perception The recent revolution in model selection methods in the cognitive sciences was driven to a large extent by the observation that computational models can differ in their complexity. Differences in complexity put models on unequal footing when their ability to approximate empirical data is assessed. Therefore, models should be penalized for their complexity when their adequacy is measured. The balance between descriptive adequacy and complexity has been termed generalizability [1, 2]. Much attention has been devoted to developing, advocating, and comparing different measures of generalizability (for a recent overview, see [3]). In contrast, measures of complexity have received relatively little attention. The aim of the current paper is to propose and illustrate a stand alone measure of model complexity, called the Prior Predictive Complexity (PPC). The PPC is based on the intuitive idea that a complex model can predict many outcomes and a simple model can predict a few outcomes only. First, I discuss existing approaches to measuring model complexity and note some of their limitations. In particular, I argue that currently existing measures ignore one important aspect of a model: the prior distribution it assumes over the parameters. I then introduce the PPC, which, unlike the existing measures, is sensitive to the parameter prior. Next, the PPC is illustrated by calculating the complexities of two popular models of information integration. 1 Previous approaches to measuring model complexity A ﬁrst approach to assess the (relative) complexity of models relies on simulated data. Simulationbased methods differ in how these artiﬁcial data are generated. A ﬁrst, atheoretical approach uses random data [4, 5]. In the semi-theoretical approach, the data are generated from some theoretically ∗ I am grateful to Michael Lee and Liz Bonawitz. 1 interesting functions, such as the exponential or the logistic function [4]. Using these approaches, the models under consideration are equally complex if each model provides the best optimal ﬁt to roughly the same number of data sets. A ﬁnal approach to generating artiﬁcial data is a theoretical one, in which the data are generated from the models of interest themselves [6, 7]. The parameter sets used in the generation can either be hand-picked by the researcher, estimated from empirical data or drawn from a previously speciﬁed distribution. If the models under consideration are equally complex, each model should provide the best optimal ﬁt to self-generated data more often than the other models under consideration do. One problem with this simulation-based approach is that it is very labor intensive. It requires generating a large amount of artiﬁcial data sets, and ﬁtting the models to all these data sets. Further, it relies on choices that are often made in an arbitrary fashion that nonetheless bias the results. For example, in the semi-theoretical approach, a crucial choice is which functions to use. Similarly, in the theoretical approach, results are heavily inﬂuenced by the parameter values used in generating the data. If they are ﬁxed, on what basis? If they are estimated from empirical data, from which data? If they are drawn randomly, from which distribution? Further, a simulation study only gives a rough idea of complexity differences but provides no direct measure reﬂecting the complexity. A number of proposals have been made to measure model complexity more directly. Consider a model M with k parameters, summarized in the parameter vector θ = (θ1 , θ2 , . . . , θk , ) which has a range indicated by Ω. Let d denote the data and p(d|θ, M ) the likelihood. The most straightforward measure of model complexity is the parametric complexity (PC), which simply counts the number of parameters: PC = k. (1) PC is attractive as a measure of model complexity since it is very easy to calculate. Further, it has a direct and well understood relation toward complexity: the more parameters, the more complex the model. It is included as the complexity term of several generalizability measures such as AIC [8] and BIC [9], and it is at the heart of the Likelihood Ratio Test. Despite this intuitive appeal, PC is not free from problems. One problem with PC is that it reﬂects only a single aspect of complexity. Also the parameter range and the functional form (the way the parameters are combined in the model equation) inﬂuence a model’s complexity, but these dimensions of complexity are ignored in PC [2, 6]. A complexity measure that takes these three dimensions into account is provided by the geometric complexity (GC) measure, which is inspired by differential geometry [10]. In GC, complexity is conceptualized as the number of distinguishable probability distributions a model can generate. It is deﬁned by GC = k n ln + ln 2 2π det I(θ|M )dθ, (2) Ω where n indicates the size of the data sample and I(θ) is the Fisher Information Matrix: Iij (θ|M ) = −Eθ ∂ 2 ln p(d|θ, M ) . ∂θi ∂θj (3) Note that I(θ|M ) is determined by the likelihood function p(d|θ, M ), which is in turn determined by the model equation. Hence GC is sensitive to the number of parameters (through k), the functional form (through I), and the range (through Ω). Quite surprisingly, GC turns out to be equal to the complexity term used in one version of Minimum Description Length (MDL), a measure of generalizability developed within the domain of information theory [2, 11, 12, 13]. GC contrasts favorably with PC, in the sense that it takes three dimensions of complexity into account rather than a single one. A major drawback of GC is that, unlike PC, it requires considerable technical sophistication to be computed, as it relies on the second derivative of the likelihood. A more important limitation of both PC and GC is that these measures are insensitive to yet another important dimension contributing to model complexity: the prior distribution over the model parameters. The relation between the parameter prior distribution and model complexity is discussed next. 2 2 Model complexity and the parameter prior The growing popularity of Bayesian methods in psychology has not only raised awareness that model complexity should be taken into account when testing models [6], it has also drawn attention to the fact that in many occasions, relevant prior information is available [14]. In Bayesian methods, there is room to incorporate this information in two different ﬂavors: as a prior distribution over the models, or as a prior distribution over the parameters. Specifying a model prior is a daunting task, so almost invariably, the model prior is taken to be uniform (but see [15] for an exception). In contrast, information regarding the parameter is much easier to include, although still challenging (e.g., [16]). There are two ways to formalize prior information about a model’s parameters: using the parameter prior range (often referred to as simply the range) and using the parameter prior distribution (often referred to as simply the prior). The prior range indicates which parameter values are allowed and which are forbidden. The prior distribution indicates which parameter values are likely and which are unlikely. Models that share the same equation and the same range but differ in the prior distribution can be considered different models (or at least different model versions), just like models that share the same equation but differ in range are different model versions. Like the parameter prior range, the parameter prior distribution inﬂuences the model complexity. In general, a model with a vague parameter prior distribution is more complex than a model with a sharply peaked parameter prior distribution, much as a model with a broad-ranged parameter is more complex than the same model where the parameter is heavily restricted. To drive home the point that the parameter prior should be considered when model complexity is assessed, consider the following “fair coin” model Mf and a “biased coin” model Mb . There is a clear intuitive complexity difference between these models: Mb is more complex than Mf . The most straightforward way to formalize these models is as follows, where ph denotes the probability of observing heads: ph = 1/2, (4) ph = θ 0≤θ≤1 p(θ) = 1, (5) for model Mf and the triplet of equations jointly deﬁne model Mb . The range forbids values smaller than 0 or greater than 1 because ph is a proportion. As Mf and Mb have a different number of parameters, both PC and GC, being sensitive to the number of parameters, pick up the difference in model complexity between the models. Alternatively, model Mf could be deﬁned as follows: ph = θ 0≤θ≤1 1 p(θ) = δ(θ − ), 2 (6) where δ(x) is the Dirac delta. Note that the model formalized in Equation 6 is exactly identical the model formalized in Equation 4. However, relying on the formulation of model Mf in Equation 6, PC and GC now judge Mf and Mb to be equally complex: both models share the same model equation (which implies they have the same number of parameters and the same functional form) and the same range for the parameter. Hence, PC and GC make an incorrect judgement of the complexity difference between both models. This misjudgement is a direct result of the insensitivity of these measures to the parameter prior. As models Mf and Mb have different prior distributions over their parameter, a measure sensitive to the prior would pick up the complexity difference between these models. Such a measure is introduced next. 3 The Prior Predictive Complexity Model complexity refers to the property of the model that enables it to predict a wide range of data patterns [2]. The idea of the PPC is to measure how wide this range exactly is. A complex model 3 can predict many outcomes, and a simple model can predict a few outcomes only. Model simplicity, then, refers to the property of placing restrictions on the possible outcomes: the greater restrictions, the greater the simplicity. To understand how model complexity is measured in the PPC, it is useful to think about the universal interval (UI) and the predicted interval (PI). The universal interval is the range of outcomes that could potentially be observed, irrespective of any model. For example, in an experiment with n binomial trials, it is impossible to observe less that zero successes, or more than n successes, so the range of possible outcomes is [0, n] . Similarly, the universal interval for a proportion is [0, 1]. The predicted interval is the interval containing all outcomes the model predicts. An intuitive way to gauge model complexity is then the cardinality of the predicted interval, relative to the cardinality of the universal interval, averaged over all m conditions or stimuli: PPC = 1 m m i=1 |PIi | . |UIi | (7) A key aspect of the PPC is deriving the predicted interval. For a parameterized likelihood-based model, prediction takes the form of a distribution over all possible outcomes for some future, yet-tobe-observed data d under some model M . This distribution is called the prior predictive distribution (ppd) and can be calculated using the law of total probability: p(d|M ) = p(d|θ, M )p(θ|M )dθ. (8) Ω Predicting the probability of unseen future data d arising under the assumption that model M is true involves integrating the probability of the data for each of the possible parameter values, p(d|θ, M ), as weighted by the prior probability of each of these values, p(θ|M ). Note that the ppd relies on the number of parameters (through the number of integrals and the likelihood), the model equation (through the likelihood), and the parameter range (through Ω). Therefore, as GC, the PPC is sensitive to all these aspects. In contrast to GC, however, the ppd, and hence the PPC, also relies on the parameter prior. Since predictions are made probabilistically, virtually all outcomes will be assigned some prior weight. This implies that, in principle, the predicted interval equals the universal interval. However, for some outcomes the assigned weight will be extremely small. Therefore, it seems reasonable to restrict the predicted interval to the smallest interval that includes some predetermined amount of the prior mass. For example, the 95% predictive interval is deﬁned by those outcomes with the highest prior mass that together make up 95% of the prior mass. Analytical solutions to the integral deﬁning the ppd are rarely available. Instead, one should rely on approximations to the ppd by drawing samples from it. In the current study, sampling was performed using WinBUGS [17, 18], a highly versatile, user friendly, and freely available software package. It contains sophisticated and relatively general-purpose Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to sample from any distribution of interest. 4 An application example The PPC is illustrated by comparing the complexity of two popular models of information integration, which attempt to account for how people merge potentially ambiguous or conﬂicting information from various sensorial sources to create subjective experience. These models either assume that the sources of information are combined additively (the Linear Integration Model; LIM; [19]) or multiplicatively (the Fuzzy Logical Model of Perception; FLMP; [20, 21]). 4.1 Information integration tasks A typical information integration task exposes participants simultaneously to different sources of information and requires this combined experience to be identiﬁed in a forced-choice identiﬁcation task. The presented stimuli are generated from a factorial manipulation of the sources of information by systematically varying the ambiguity of each of the sources. The relevant empirical data consist 4 of, for each of the presented stimuli, the counts km of the number of times the mth stimulus was identiﬁed as one of the response alternatives, out of the tm trials on which it was presented. For example, an experiment in phonemic identiﬁcation could involve two phonemes to be identiﬁed, /ba/ and /da/ and two sources of information, auditory and visual. Stimuli are created by crossing different levels of audible speech, varying between /ba/ and /da/, with different levels of visible speech, also varying between these alternatives. The resulting set of stimuli spans a continuum between the two syllables. The participant is then asked to listen and to watch the speaker, and based on this combined audiovisual experience, to identify the syllable as being either /ba/ or /da/. In the so-called expanded factorial design, not only bimodal stimuli (containing both auditory and visual information) but also unimodal stimuli (providing only a single source of information) are presented. 4.2 Information integration models In what follows, the formal description of the LIM and the FLMP is outlined for a design with two response alternatives (/da/ or /ba/) and two sources (auditory and visual), with I and J levels, respectively. In such a two-choice identiﬁcation task, the counts km follow a Binomial distribution: km ∼ Binomial(pm , tm ), (9) where pm indicates the probability that the mth stimulus is identiﬁed as /da/. 4.2.1 Model equation The probability for the stimulus constructed with the ith level of the ﬁrst source and the jth level of the second being identiﬁed as /da/ is computed according to the choice rule: pij = s (ij, /da/) , s (ij, /da/) + s (ij, /ba/) (10) where s (ij, /da/) represents the overall degree of support for the stimulus to be /da/. The sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently, implying that different parameters are used for the different modalities. In the present example, the degree of auditory support for /da/ is denoted by ai (i = 1, . . . , I) and the degree of visual support for /da/ by bj (j = 1, . . . , J). When a unimodal stimulus is presented, the overall degree of support for each alternative is given by s (i∗, /da/) = ai and s (∗j, /da/) = bj , where the asterisk (*) indicates the absence of information, implying that Equation 10 reduces to pi∗ = ai and p∗j = bj . (11) When a bimodal stimulus is presented, the overall degree of support for each alternative is based on the integration or blending of both these sources. Hence, for bimodal stimuli, s (ij, /da/) = ai bj , where the operator denotes the combination of both sources. Hence, Equation 10 reduces to ai bj . (12) pij = ai bj + (1 − ai ) (1 − bj ) = +, so Equation 12 becomes The LIM assumes an additive combination, i.e., pij = ai + bj . 2 (13) The FLMP, in contrast, assumes a multiplicative combination, i.e., = ×, so Equation 12 becomes ai bj . ai bj + (1 − ai )(1 − bj ) (14) pij = 5 4.2.2 Parameter prior range and distribution Each level of auditory and visual support for /da/ (i.e., ai and bj , respectively) is associated with a free parameter, which implies that the FLMP and the LIM have an equal number of free parameters, I + J. Each of these parameters is constrained to satisfy 0 ≤ ai , bj ≤ 1. The original formulations of the LIM and FLMP unfortunately left the parameter priors unspeciﬁed. However, an implicit assumption that has been commonly used is a uniform prior for each of the parameters. This assumption implicitly underlies classical and widely adopted methods for model evaluation using accounted percentage of variance or maximum likelihood. ai ∼ Uniform(0, 1) and bi ∼ Uniform(0, 1) for i = 1, . . . , I; j = 1, . . . , J. (15) The models relying on this set of uniform priors will be referred to as LIMu and FLMPu . Note that LIMu and FLMPu treat the different parameters as independent. This approach misses important information. In particular, the experimental design is such that the amount of support for each level i + 1 is always higher than for level i. Because parameter ai (or bi ) corresponds to the degree of auditory (or visual) support for a unimodal stimulus at the ith level, it seems reasonable to expect the following orderings among the parameters to hold (see also [6]): aj > ai and bj > bi for j > i. (16) The models relying on this set of ordered priors will be referred to as LIMo and FLMPo . 4.3 Complexity and experimental design It is tempting to consider model complexity as an inherent characteristic of a model. For some models and for some measures of complexity this is clearly the case. Consider, for example, model Mb . In any experimental design (i.e., a number of coin tosses), PCMb = 1. However, more generally, this is not the case. Focusing on the FLMP and the LIM, it is clear that even a simple measure as PC depends crucially on (some aspects of) the experimental design. In particular, every level corresponds to a new parameter, so PC = I + J . Similarly, GC is dependent on design choices. The PPC is not different in this respect. The design sensitivity implies that one can only make sensible conclusions about differences in model complexity by using different designs. In an information integration task, the design decisions include the type of design (expanded or not), the number of sources, the number of response alternatives, the number of levels for each source, and the number of observations for each stimulus (sample size). The present study focuses on the expanded factorial designs with two sources and two response alternatives. The additional design features were varied: both a 5 × 5 and a 8 × 2 design were considered, using three different sample sizes (20, 60 and 150, following [2]). 4.4 Results Figure 1 shows the 99% predicted interval in the 8×2 design with n = 150. Each panel corresponds to a different model. In each panel, each of the 26 stimuli is displayed on the x-axis. The ﬁrst eight stimuli correspond to the stimuli with the lowest level of visual support, and are ordered in increasing order of auditory support. The next eight stimuli correspond to the stimuli with the highest level of visual support. The next eight stimuli correspond to the unimodal stimuli where only auditory information is provided (again ranked in increasing order). The ﬁnal two stimuli are the unimodal visual stimuli. Panel A shows that the predicted interval of LIMu nearly equals the universal interval, ranging between 0 and 1. This indicates that almost all outcomes are given a non-negligible prior mass by LIMu , making it almost maximally complex. FLMPu is even more complex. The predicted interval, shown in Panel B, virtually equals the universal interval, indicating that the model predicts virtually every possible outcome. Panels C and D show the dramatic effect of incorporating relevant prior information in the models. The predicted intervals of both LIMo and FLMPo are much smaller than their counterparts using the uniform priors. Focusing on the comparison between LIM and FLMP, the PPC indicates that the latter is more complex than the former. This observation holds irrespective of the model version (assuming uniform 6 0.9 0.8 0.8 Proportion of /da/ responses 1 0.9 Proportion of /da/ responses 1 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 11 21 A 1* 0 *1 11 21 B 1* *1 1* *1 0.8 Proportion of /da/ responses 0.9 0.8 21 1 0.9 Proportion of /da/ responses 1 11 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 0.7 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 11 21 C 1* 0 *1 D Figure 1: The 99% predicted interval for each of the 26 stimuli (x-axis) according to LIMu (Panel A), FLMPu (Panel B), LIMo (Panel C), and FLMPo (Panel D).

The smaller complexity of LIM is in line with previous attempts to measure the relative complexities of LIM and FLMP, such as the atheoretical simulation-based approach ([4] but see [5]), the semi-theoretical simulation-based approach [4], the theoretical simulation-based approach [2, 6, 22], and a direct computation of the GC [2]. The PPC’s for all six designs considered are displayed in Table 1. It shows that the observations made for the 8 × 2, n = 150 design holds across the ﬁve remaining designs as well: LIM is simpler than FLMP; and models assuming ordered priors are simpler than models assuming uniform priors. Note that these conclusions would not have been possible based on PC or GC. For PC, all four models have the same complexity. GC, in contrast, would detect complexity differences between LIM and FLMP (i.e., the ﬁrst conclusion), but due to its insensitivity to the parameter prior, the complexity differences between LIMu and LIMo on the one hand, and FLMPu and FLMPo on the other hand (i.e., the second conclusion) would have gone unnoticed. 5 Discussion A theorist deﬁning a model should clearly and explicitly specify at least the three following pieces of information: the model equation, the parameter prior range, and the parameter prior distribution. If any of these pieces is missing, the model should be regarded as incomplete, and therefore untestable. Consequently, any measure of generalizability should be sensitive to all three aspects of the model deﬁnition. Many currently popular generalizability measures do not satisfy this criterion, including AIC, BIC and MDL. A measure of generalizability that does take these three aspects of a model into account is the marginal likelihood [6, 7, 14, 23]. Often, the marginal likelihood is criticized exactly for its sensitivity to the prior range and distribution (e.g., [24]). However, in the light of the fact that the prior is a part of the model deﬁnition, I see the sensitivity of the marginal likelihood to the prior as an asset rather than a nuisance. It is precisely the measures of generalizability that are insensitive to the prior that miss an important aspect of the model. Similarly, any stand alone measure of model complexity should be sensitive to all three aspects of the model deﬁnition, as all three aspects contribute to the model’s complexity (with the model equation contributing two factors: the number of parameters and the functional form). Existing measures of complexity do not satisfy this requirement and are therefore incomplete. PC takes only part of the model equation into account, whereas GC takes only the model equation and the range into account. In contrast, the PPC currently proposed is sensitive to all these three aspects. It assesses model complexity using the predicted interval which contains all possible outcomes a model can generate. A narrow predicted interval (relative to the universal interval) indicates a simple model; a complex model is characterized by a wide predicted interval. There is a tight coupling between the notions of information, knowledge and uncertainty, and the notion of model complexity. As parameters correspond to unknown variables, having more information available leads to fewer parameters and hence to a simpler model. Similarly, the more information there is available, the sharper the parameter prior, implying a simpler model. To put it differently, the less uncertainty present in a model, the narrower its predicted interval, and the simpler the model. For example, in model Mb , there is maximal uncertainty. Nothing but the range is known about θ, so all values of θ are equally likely. In contrast, in model Mf , there is minimal uncertainty. In fact, ph is known for sure, so only a single value of θ is possible. This difference in uncertainty is translated in a difference in complexity. The same is true for the information integration models. Incorporating the order constraints in the priors reduces the uncertainty compared to the models without these constraints (it tells you, for example, that parameter a1 is smaller than a2 ). This reduction in uncertainty is reﬂected by a smaller complexity. There are many different sources of prior information that can be translated in a range or distribution. The illustration using the information integration models highlighted that prior information can reﬂect meaningful information in the design. Alternatively, priors can be informed by previous applications of similar models in similar settings. Probably the purest form of priors are those that translate theoretical assumptions made by a model (see [16]). The fact that it is often difﬁcult to formalize this prior information may not be used as an excuse to leave the prior unspeciﬁed. Sure it is a challenging task, but so is translating theoretical assumptions into the model equation. Formalizing theory, intuitions, and information is what model building is all about. 8 References [1] Myung, I. J. (2000) The importance of complexity in model selection.

<p>Author: Kyomin Jung, Pushmeet Kohli, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of computing Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in an arbitrary pair-wise Markov Random Field (MRF). We present a randomized iterative algorithm based on simple local updates. The algorithm, starting with an arbitrary initial assignment, updates it in each iteration by ﬁrst, picking a random node, then selecting an (appropriately chosen) random local neighborhood and optimizing over this local neighborhood. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this algorithm ﬁnds a near optimal assignment within n log 2 n iterations with high probability for any n node pair-wise MRF with geometry (i.e. MRF graph with polynomial growth) with the approximation error depending on (in a reasonable manner) the geometric growth rate of the graph and the average radius of the local neighborhood – this allows for a graceful tradeoff between the complexity of the algorithm and the approximation error. Through extensive simulations, we show that our algorithm ﬁnds extremely good approximate solutions for various kinds of MRFs with geometry.</p><p>5 0.82649595 <a title="172-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Positive_Semidefinite_Metric_Learning_with_Boosting.html">191 nips-2009-Positive Semidefinite Metric Learning with Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Chunhua Shen, Junae Kim, Lei Wang, Anton Hengel</p><p>Abstract: The learning of appropriate distance metrics is a critical problem in image classiﬁcation and retrieval. In this work, we propose a boosting-based technique, termed B OOST M ETRIC, for learning a Mahalanobis distance metric. One of the primary difﬁculties in learning such a metric is to ensure that the Mahalanobis matrix remains positive semideﬁnite. Semideﬁnite programming is sometimes used to enforce this constraint, but does not scale well. B OOST M ETRIC is instead based on a key observation that any positive semideﬁnite matrix can be decomposed into a linear positive combination of trace-one rank-one matrices. B OOST M ETRIC thus uses rank-one positive semideﬁnite matrices as weak learners within an efﬁcient and scalable boosting-based learning process. The resulting method is easy to implement, does not require tuning, and can accommodate various types of constraints. Experiments on various datasets show that the proposed algorithm compares favorably to those state-of-the-art methods in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy and running time. 1</p><p>6 0.8170048 <a title="172-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Semi-supervised_Regression_using_Hessian_energy_with_an_application_to_semi-supervised_dimensionality_reduction.html">214 nips-2009-Semi-supervised Regression using Hessian energy with an application to semi-supervised dimensionality reduction</a></p>

</p><p>8 The effect of a spike from a presynaptic neuron on its postsynaptic partner depends on the history of the activity of both pre- and postsynaptic neurons, and thus the efﬁcacy of a synapse undergoes perpetual modiﬁcation. [sent-21, score-0.921]
</p><p>9 Short-term plasticity typically only depends on the ﬁring pattern 1  of the presynaptic cell [1]; short term depression gradually diminishes the postsynaptic effects of presynaptic spikes that arrive in quick succession (Fig. [sent-23, score-1.29]
</p><p>10 Given the prominence and ubiquity of synaptic depression in cortical (and subcortical) synapses [2], it is pressing to identify its computational role(s). [sent-25, score-0.633]
</p><p>11 Here, we propose a theory according which synaptic depression solves a computational problem that is faced by any neural population in which neurons represent and compute with analog quantities, but communicate with discrete spikes. [sent-28, score-0.578]
</p><p>12 For convenience, we assume this analog quantity to be the membrane potential, but, via a non-linear transformation [7], it could equally well be an analog ﬁring rate. [sent-29, score-0.728]
</p><p>13 That is, we assume that network computations require the evolution of the membrane potential of a neuron to be a function of the membrane potentials of its presynaptic partners. [sent-30, score-1.903]
</p><p>14 However, such a neuron does not have (at least not directly, see [8] for an example of indirect interaction) access to these membrane potentials, but rather only to the spikes to which they lead, and so it faces a key estimation problem. [sent-31, score-0.881]
</p><p>15 It is in the indispensable ﬁrst estimation step that we suggest synaptic depression to be involved. [sent-36, score-0.554]
</p><p>16 In Section 2 we formalise the problem of estimating presynaptic membrane potentials as an instance of Bayesian inference, and derive an online recursive estimator for it. [sent-37, score-1.191]
</p><p>17 Given suitable assumptions about presynaptic membrane potential dynamics and spike generation, this optimal estimator can be written in closed form exactly [9, 10]. [sent-38, score-1.535]
</p><p>18 In Section 3, we introduce a canonical model of postsynaptic membrane potential and synaptic depression dynamics, and show how it relates to the optimal estimator derived earlier. [sent-39, score-1.612]
</p><p>19 In Section 4, we present results from numerical simulations showing the quality with which synaptic depression can approximate the performance of the optimal estimator, and how much is gained relative to a static synapse without synaptic depression. [sent-40, score-1.021]
</p><p>20 2  Bayesian estimation of presynaptic membrane potentials  The Bayesian estimation problem that needs to be solved by a synapse involves inferring the posterior distribution p (ut |s1. [sent-43, score-1.276]
</p><p>21 t ) over the presynaptic membrane potential ut at time step t (for discretized time), given the spikes seen from the presynaptic cell up to that time step, s1. [sent-45, score-1.869]
</p><p>22 We ﬁrst deﬁne a statistical (generative) model of presynaptic membrane potential ﬂuctuations and spiking, and then derive the estimator that is appropriate for it. [sent-48, score-1.244]
</p><p>23 First we assume that presynaptic membrane potential dynamics are Markovian p(ut |u1. [sent-51, score-1.239]
</p><p>24 t−1 ) = p(ut |ut−1 )  (1)  In particular, we assume that the presynaptic membrane potential evolves as an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, given (again, in discretized time) by √ ut = ut−1 − θ(ut−1 − ur )∆t + Wt ∆t, 2  iid  2 Wt ∼ N (Wt ; 0, σW )  (2)  A  C 4 3  u [mV]  2  B .

</p><p>26 Graphical model of the process generating presynaptic subthreshold membrane potential ﬂuctuations, u, and spikes, s. [sent-63, score-1.19]
</p><p>27 The membrane potential evolves according to a ﬁrst-order Markov process, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process (Eqs. [sent-64, score-0.85]
</p><p>28 The probability of generating a spike at time t (st = 1) depends only on the current membrane potential, ut , and is determined by a non-linear Poisson (NP) model (Eqs. [sent-66, score-1.004]
</p><p>29 Sample membrane potential trace (red line) and spike timings (vertical black dotted lines) 2 generated by the OU-NP process; with ur = 0 mV, θ−1 = 100 ms, σW = 0. [sent-69, score-1.092]
</p><p>30 where 1/θ is the time constant with which the membrane potential decays back to its resting value, ur , and ∆t is the size of the discretized time bins. [sent-71, score-1.055]
</p><p>31 Because both θ and σW are assumed to be 2 2 constant, the variance of the presynaptic membrane potential, σOU = σW /2θ, is stationary. [sent-72, score-1.0]
</p><p>32 The second assumption is that spiking activity at any time only depends on the membrane potential at that time: p(st |u1. [sent-73, score-0.952]
</p><p>33 if the membrane potential, u, is bigger than zero, the neuron emits a spike, and if u < 0, the neuron does not ﬁre. [sent-80, score-0.824]
</p><p>34 Estimating on-line the membrane potential of the presynaptic cell from its spiking history amounts to computing the posterior probability distribution, p (ut |s1. [sent-81, score-1.336]
</p><p>35 3  Performing recursive inference (ﬁltering), as described by equation 6, under the generative model described by equations 1-5 results in a posterior distribution that is Gaussian, ut |s1. [sent-98, score-0.244]
</p><p>36 The mean and variance of this Gaussian evolve (in continuous time, by taking the limit ∆t → 0) as: µ = ˙ σ ˙  2  −θ(µ − ur ) + βσ 2 (S(t) − γ) 2  = −2θ σ −  2 σOU  2 4  − γβ σ  (7) (8)  with the normalisation factor given by γ = g0 exp(βu)  ut |s1. [sent-101, score-0.336]
</p><p>37 t  = g0 exp βµ +  β 2 σ2 2  (9)  where S(t) is the spike train of the presynaptic cell (represented as a sum of Dirac delta functions). [sent-103, score-0.515]
</p><p>38 Equation 7 indicates that each time a spike is observed, the estimated membrane potential should increase proportionally to the uncertainty (variance) about the current estimate. [sent-105, score-0.972]
</p><p>39 2A shows, the higher the presynaptic membrane potential is, the more spikes are emitted (because the instantaneous ﬁring rate is a monotonic function of membrane potential, see Eq. [sent-109, score-1.889]
</p><p>40 Therefore the estimation error is smaller for higher membrane potential (see Fig. [sent-111, score-0.862]
</p><p>41 Conversely, in the absence of spikes, the estimated membrane potential decreases while the variance increases back to its asymptotic value. [sent-113, score-0.88]
</p><p>42 2C shows that the representation of uncertainty about the membrane potential by σ 2 is self-consistent because it is predictive of the error of the mean estimator, µ. [sent-115, score-0.822]
</p><p>43 s of equation 7 comes from the prior knowledge about the membrane potential dynamics. [sent-118, score-0.803]
</p><p>44 Then the dynamics of µ becomes driven only by the prior mean membrane potential ur :  µ ˙  −θ (µ − ur )  (10)  and so the asymptotic estimated membrane potential will tend to the prior mean membrane potential. [sent-128, score-2.576]
</p><p>45 This is reasonable since in the small noise limit, the true membrane potential ut will effectively be very close to ur . [sent-129, score-1.07]
</p><p>46 Furthermore the convergence time constant of the estimated membrane potential should be matched to the time constant θ−1 of the OU process and this is indeed the case in Eq. [sent-130, score-0.933]
</p><p>47 2  Slow dynamics limit  A second interesting limit is where the time constant of the OU process becomes small, i. [sent-133, score-0.267]
</p><p>48 We can therefore write: √ γ µ S(t) − γ ˙ (11) σW Because the time constant θ−1 of the OU process is slow, the driving force that pulls the membrane potential back to its mean value ur is weak. [sent-145, score-1.014]
</p><p>49 Therefore the membrane potential estimation dynamics should rely on the observed spikes rather than on the prior information ur . [sent-146, score-1.168]
</p><p>50 Furthermore, the time constant τ = γ/ /σW0 is not ﬁxed but is a function of the mean estimated membrane potential µ. [sent-149, score-0.854]
</p><p>51 Red line: presynaptic membrane potential, u, as a function of time, vertical dotted lines: spikes emitted. [sent-156, score-1.125]
</p><p>52 Estimation error (µ − u)2 as a function of the membrane potential u of the OU process. [sent-161, score-0.822]
</p><p>53 Black dots: estimation error and true membrane potential in individual time steps, red line: third order polynomial ﬁt. [sent-162, score-0.912]
</p><p>54 As µ gets closer to the true membrane potential, the time constant increases, leading to an appropriately accurate estimate of the membrane potential. [sent-170, score-1.343]
</p><p>55 This dynamical time constant therefore helps the estimation avoid the traditional speed vs accuracy trade-off (short time constant are fast but give a noisy estimation; longer time constant are slow but yield a more accurate estimation), by combining the best of the two worlds. [sent-171, score-0.244]
</p><p>56 3  Depressing synapses as estimators of presynaptic membrane potential  In section 2 we have shown that presynaptic spikes have a varying, context-dependent effect on the optimal on-line estimator of presynaptic membrane potential. [sent-172, score-2.833]
</p><p>57 In this section we will show that the variability that synaptic depression introduces in postsynaptic responses closely resembles the variability of the optimal estimator. [sent-173, score-0.673]
</p><p>58 A simple way to study the similarity between the optimal estimator and short-term plasticity is to consider their steady state ﬁltering properties. [sent-174, score-0.259]
</p><p>59 As we saw above, according to the optimal estimator, the higher the input ﬁring rate is, the smaller the posterior variance becomes, and therefore the increment due to subsequent spikes should decrease. [sent-175, score-0.258]
</p><p>60 This is consistent with depressing synapses for which the amount of excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) decreases when the stimulation frequency is increased (see Fig. [sent-176, score-0.4]
</p><p>61 Steady-state spiking increment βσ 2 of the optimal estimator as a function of r = S (Eq. [sent-184, score-0.31]
</p><p>62 Synaptic depression in the climbing ﬁbre to Purkinje cell synapse: average (±s. [sent-187, score-0.271]
</p><p>63 Importantly, the similarity between the optimal membrane potential estimator and short-term plasticity is not limited to stationary properties. [sent-192, score-1.043]
</p><p>64 Indeed, the actual dynamics of the optimal estimator (Eqs. [sent-193, score-0.269]
</p><p>65 7-9) can be well approximated by the dynamics of synaptic depression. [sent-194, score-0.409]
</p><p>66 In a canonical model of short-term depression [14], the postsynaptic membrane potential, v, changes as v − v0 1−x v=− ˙ + J Y x S(t), with x= ˙ − Y x S(t) (12) τ τD where J and Y are constants (synaptic weight and utilisation fraction), and x is a time varying ‘resource’ variable (e. [sent-195, score-1.033]
</p><p>67 the fraction of presynaptic vesicles ready to fuse to the membrane). [sent-197, score-0.322]
</p><p>68 Thus, v is increased by each presynaptic spike, and in the absence of spikes it decays to its resting value, v0 , with membrane time constant τ . [sent-198, score-1.174]
</p><p>69 However, the effect of each spike on v is scaled by x which itself is decreased after each spike and increases between spikes back towards one with time constant τD . [sent-199, score-0.493]
</p><p>70 Thus, the postsynaptic potential, v, behaves much like the posterior mean of the optimal estimator, µ, while the dynamics of the synaptic resource variable, x, closely resemble that of the posterior variance of the optimal estimator, σ 2 . [sent-200, score-0.762]
</p><p>71 Indeed, the capacity of a depressing synapse (with appropriate parameters) to estimate the presynaptic membrane potential can be nearly as good as that of the optimal estimator (Fig. [sent-202, score-1.555]
</p><p>72 Interestingly, although 2 the scaled variance σ 2 /σ∞ does not follow the resource variable dynamics x perfectly just after a spike, these two quantities are virtually identical at the time of the next spike, i. [sent-204, score-0.227]
</p><p>73 when they are used by the membrane potential estimators (Fig. [sent-206, score-0.829]
</p><p>74 The second estimator we consider includes synaptic depression, i. [sent-212, score-0.414]
</p><p>75 Once the parameters of presynaptic membrane potential dynamics (σW , θ, ur ) and spiking (β, g0 ) are ﬁxed, the optimal estimator is entirely determined. [sent-220, score-1.608]
</p><p>76 For a wide range of parameter values, the depressing synapse performs almost as well as the optimal estimator, and both perform better than the static synapse. [sent-224, score-0.352]

</p><p>81 We interpreted short-term synaptic depression, a key feature of synaptic dynamics, as solving the fundamental computational task of estimating the analog membrane potential of the presynaptic cell from observed spikes. [sent-254, score-1.825]
</p><p>82 Steady-state and dynamical properties of a Bayes-optimal estimator are well-matched by a canonical model of depression; using a ﬁxed synaptic efﬁcacy instead leads to a highly suboptimal estimator. [sent-255, score-0.46]
</p><p>83 Our theory is readily testable, since it suggests a precise relationship between quantities that have been subject to extensive, separate, empirical study — namely the statistics of a neuron’s membrane potential dynamics (captured by the parameters of Eq. [sent-256, score-0.917]
</p><p>84 (5)), and the synaptic depression it expresses in its efferent synapses. [sent-258, score-0.556]
</p><p>85 Accounting for the observation that different efferent synapses of the same cell can express different forms of short-term synaptic plasticity [15] remains a challenge; one obvious possibility is that different synapses are estimating different aspects or functions of the membrane potential. [sent-259, score-1.392]
</p><p>86 For that model, the spike generation mechanism of the presynaptic neuron was modiﬁed such that even a simple read-out mechanism with ﬁxed efﬁcacies could correctly decode the analogue quantity encoded presynaptically. [sent-261, score-0.557]
</p><p>87 By contrast, we considered a standard model of spiking [17], and thereby derived an explanation for the evident fact that synapses are not in fact ﬁxed. [sent-262, score-0.24]

[sent-286, score-1.718]
</p><p>93 We present some preliminary derivations in the supplementary material that seem to yield at least the right ball-park values for optimal synaptic dynamics. [sent-287, score-0.362]
</p><p>94 This should also enable us to explore the particular parameter regimes in which depressing synapses have the most (or least) advantage over static synapses in terms of estimation performance, as in Fig. [sent-288, score-0.459]

<p>Author: Jean-pascal Pfister, Peter Dayan, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Synapses exhibit an extraordinary degree of short-term malleability, with release probabilities and effective synaptic strengths changing markedly over multiple timescales. From the perspective of a ﬁxed computational operation in a network, this seems like a most unacceptable degree of added variability. We suggest an alternative theory according to which short-term synaptic plasticity plays a normatively-justiﬁable role. This theory starts from the commonplace observation that the spiking of a neuron is an incomplete, digital, report of the analog quantity that contains all the critical information, namely its membrane potential. We suggest that a synapse solves the inverse problem of estimating the pre-synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives, acting as a recursive ﬁlter. We show that the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression closely resemble those required for optimal ﬁltering, and that they indeed support high quality estimation. Under this account, the local postsynaptic potential and the level of synaptic resources track the (scaled) mean and variance of the estimated presynaptic membrane potential. We make experimentally testable predictions for how the statistics of subthreshold membrane potential ﬂuctuations and the form of spiking non-linearity should be related to the properties of short-term plasticity in any particular cell type. 1</p><p>2 0.29780984 <a title="121-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2009-Reconstruction_of_Sparse_Circuits_Using_Multi-neuronal_Excitation_%28RESCUME%29.html">200 nips-2009-Reconstruction of Sparse Circuits Using Multi-neuronal Excitation (RESCUME)</a></p>

Synapses onto a neuron can be probed by sequentially stimulating potentially pre-synaptic neurons while monitoring the membrane voltage of the post-synaptic neuron. Reconstructing a large neural circuit using such a “brute force” approach is rather time-consuming and inefficient because the connectivity in neural circuits is sparse. Instead, we propose to measure a post-synaptic neuron’s voltage while stimulating sequentially random subsets of multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons. To reconstruct these synaptic connections from the recorded voltage we apply a decoding algorithm recently developed for compressive sensing. Compared to the brute force approach, our method promises significant time savings that grow with the size of the circuit. We use computer simulations to find optimal stimulation parameters and explore the feasibility of our reconstruction method under realistic experimental conditions including noise and non-linear synaptic integration. Multineuronal stimulation allows reconstructing synaptic connectivity just from the spiking activity of post-synaptic neurons, even when sub-threshold voltage is unavailable. By using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes, or multi-electrode arrays one could monitor activity of multiple postsynaptic neurons simultaneously, thus mapping their synaptic inputs in parallel, potentially reconstructing a complete neural circuit. 1 In tro d uc tio n Understanding information processing in neural circuits requires systematic characterization of synaptic connectivity [1, 2]. The most direct way to measure synapses between a pair of neurons is to stimulate potentially pre-synaptic neuron while recording intra-cellularly from the potentially post-synaptic neuron [3-8]. This method can be scaled to reconstruct multiple synaptic connections onto one neuron by combining intracellular recordings from the postsynaptic neuron with photo-activation of pre-synaptic neurons using glutamate uncaging [913] or channelrhodopsin [14, 15], or with multi-electrode arrays [16, 17]. Neurons are sequentially stimulated to fire action potentials by scanning a laser beam (or electrode voltage) over a brain slice, while synaptic weights are measured by recording post-synaptic voltage. Although sequential excitation of single potentially pre-synaptic neurons could reveal connectivity, such a “brute force” approach is inefficient because the connectivity among neurons is sparse. Even among nearby neurons in the cerebral cortex, the probability of connection is only about ten percent [3-8]. Connection probability decays rapidly with the 1 distance between neurons and falls below one percent on the scale of a cortical column [3, 8]. Thus, most single-neuron stimulation trials would result in zero response making the brute force approach slow, especially for larger circuits. Another drawback of the brute force approach is that single-neuron stimulation cannot be combined efficiently with methods allowing parallel recording of neural activity, such as calcium imaging [18-22], voltage-sensitive dyes [23-25] or multi-electrode arrays [17, 26]. As these techniques do not reliably measure sub-threshold potential but report only spiking activity, they would reveal only the strongest connections that can drive a neuron to fire [2730]. Therefore, such combination would reveal only a small fraction of the circuit. We propose to circumvent the above limitations of the brute force approach by stimulating multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons simultaneously and reconstructing individual connections by using a recently developed method called compressive sensing (CS) [31-35]. In each trial, we stimulate F neurons randomly chosen out of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons and measure post-synaptic activity. Although each measurement yields only a combined response to stimulated neurons, if synaptic inputs sum linearly in a post-synaptic neuron, one can reconstruct the weights of individual connections by using an optimization algorithm. Moreover, if the synaptic connections are sparse, i.e. only K << N potentially pre-synaptic neurons make synaptic connections onto a post-synaptic neuron, the required number of trials M ~ K log(N/K), which is much less than N [31-35]. The proposed method can be used even if only spiking activity is available. Because multiple neurons are driven to fire simultaneously, if several of them synapse on the post-synaptic neuron, they can induce one or more spikes in that neuron. As quantized spike counts carry less information than analog sub-threshold voltage recordings, reconstruction requires a larger number of trials. Yet, the method can be used to reconstruct a complete feedforward circuit from spike recordings. Reconstructing neural circuit with multi-neuronal excitation may be compared with mapping retinal ganglion cell receptive fields. Typically, photoreceptors are stimulated by white-noise checkerboard stimulus and the receptive field is obtained by Reverse Correlation (RC) in case of sub-threshold measurements or Spike-Triggered Average (STA) of the stimulus [36, 37]. Although CS may use the same stimulation protocol, for a limited number of trials, the reconstruction quality is superior to RC or STA. 2 Ma pp i ng sy na pti c inp ut s o nto o n e ne uro n We start by formalizing the problem of mapping synaptic connections from a population of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons onto a single neuron, as exemplified by granule cells synapsing onto a Purkinje cell (Figure 1a). Our experimental protocol can be illustrated using linear algebra formalism, Figure 1b. We represent synaptic weights as components of a column vector x, where zeros represent non-existing connections. Each row in the stimulation matrix A represents a trial, ones indicating neurons driven to spike once and zeros indicating non-spiking neurons. The number of rows in the stimulation matrix A is equal to the number of trials M. The column vector y represents M measurements of membrane voltage obtained by an intra-cellular recording from the post-synaptic neuron: y = Ax. (1) In order to recover individual synaptic weights, Eq. (1) must be solved for x. RC (or STA) solution to this problem is x = (ATA)-1AT y, which minimizes (y-Ax)2 if M>N. In the case M << N for a sparse circuit. In this section we search computationally for the minimum number of trials required for exact reconstruction as a function of the number of non-zero synaptic weights K out of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons. First, note that the number of trials depends on the number of stimulated neurons F. If F = 1 we revert to the brute force approach and the number of measurements is N, while for F = N, the measurements are redundant and no finite number suffices. As the minimum number of measurements is expected to scale as K logN, there must be an optimal F which makes each measurement most informative about x. To determine the optimal number of stimulated neurons F for given K and N, we search for the minimum number of trials M, which allows a perfect reconstruction of the synaptic connectivity x. For each F, we generate 50 synaptic weight vectors and attempt reconstruction from sequentially increasing numbers of trials. The value of M, at which all 50 recoveries are successful (up to computer round-off error), estimates the number of trial needed for reconstruction with probability higher than 98%. By repeating this procedure 50 times for each F, we estimate the mean and standard deviation of M. We find that, for given N and K, the minimum number of trials, M, as a function of the number of stimulated neurons, F, has a shallow minimum. As K decreases, the minimum shifts towards larger F because more neurons should be stimulated simultaneously for sparser x. For the explored range of simulation parameters, the minimum is located close to 0.1N. Next, we set F = 0.1N and explore how the minimum number of measurements required for exact reconstruction depends on K and N. Results of the simulations following the recipe described above are shown in Figure 3a. As expected, when x is sparse, M grows approximately linearly with K (Figure 3b), and logarithmically with N (Figure 3c).

Such noise detrimentally affects reconstructions because each row of A is multiplied by a different instantiation of vector x. 2) Stimulation of neurons may be imprecise exciting a slightly different subset of neurons than intended and/or firing intended neurons multiple times. We call this effect stimulation noise. Such noise detrimentally affects reconstructions because, in its presence, the actual measurement matrix A is different from the one used for recovery. 3) A synapse may fail to release neurotransmitter with some probability. Naturally, in the presence of noise, reconstructions cannot be exact. We quantify the 4 reconstruction x − xr l2 = error ∑ N i =1 by the normalized x − xr l2–error l2 / xl , where 2 ( xi − xri ) 2 . We plot normalized reconstruction error in brute force approach (M = N = 500 trials) as a function of noise, as well as CS and RC reconstruction errors (M = 200, 600 trials), Figure 4. 2 0.9 Normalized reconstruction error ||x-x|| /||x|| 1 r 2 For each noise source, the reconstruction error of the brute force approach can be achieved with 60% fewer trials by CS method for the above parameters (Figure 4). For the same number of trials, RC method performs worse. Naturally, the reconstruction error decreases with the number of trials. The reconstruction error is most sensitive to stimulation noise and least sensitive to synaptic noise. 1 (a) 1 (b) 0.9 0.8 (c) 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0 0.7 RC: M=200 RC: M=600 Brute force method: M=500 CS: M=200 CS: M=600 0.6 0.5 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 Synaptic noise level 0.2 0.25 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 Stimulation noise level 0.2 0.25 0 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Synaptic failure probability Figure 4: Impact of noise on the reconstruction quality for N = 500, K = 30, F = 50. a) Recovery error due to trial-to-trial variation in synaptic weight. The response y is calculated using the synaptic connectivity x perturbed by an additive Gaussian noise. The noise level is given by the coefficient of variation of synaptic weight. b) Recovery error due to stimulation noise. The matrix A used for recovery is obtained from the binary matrix used to calculate the measurement vector y by shifting, in each row, a fraction of ones specified by the noise level to random positions. c) Recovery error due to synaptic failures. The detrimental effect of the stimulation noise on the reconstruction can be eliminated by monitoring spiking activity of potentially pre-synaptic neurons. By using calcium imaging [18-22], voltage-sensitive dyes [23] or multi-electrode arrays [17, 26] one could record the actual stimulation matrix. Because most random matrices satisfy the reconstruction requirements [31, 34, 35], the actual stimulation matrix can be used for a successful recovery instead of the intended one. If neuronal activity can be monitored reliably, experiments can be done in a different mode altogether. Instead of stimulating designated neurons with high fidelity by using highly localized and intense light, one could stimulate all neurons with low probability. Random firing events can be detected and used in the recovery process. The light intensity can be tuned to stimulate the optimal number of neurons per trial. Next, we explore the sensitivity of the proposed reconstruction method to the violation of simplifying assumptions. First, whereas our simulation assumes that the actual number of connections, K, is known, in reality, connectivity sparseness is known a priori only approximately. Will this affect reconstruction results? In principle, CS does not require prior knowledge of K for reconstruction [31, 34, 35]. For the CoSaMP algorithm, however, it is important to provide value K larger than the actual value (Figure 5a). Then, the algorithm will find all the actual synaptic weights plus some extra non-zero weights, negligibly small when compared to actual ones. Thus, one can provide the algorithm with the value of K safely larger than the actual one and then threshold the reconstruction result according to the synaptic noise level. Second, whereas we assumed a linear summation of inputs [53], synaptic integration may be 2 non-linear [54]. We model non-linearity by setting y = yl + α yl , where yl represents linearly summed synaptic inputs. Results of simulations (Figure 5b) show that although nonlinearity can significantly degrade CS reconstruction quality, it still performs better than RC. 5 (b) 0.45 0.4 Actual K = 30 0.35 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Normalized reconstruction error ||x-x||2/||x|| r 2 Normalized reconstrcution error ||x-x||2/||x|| r 2 (a) 0.9 0.8 0.7 CS RC 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 -0.15-0.12-0.09-0.06-0.03 0 0.03 0.06 0.09 0.12 0.15 Relative strength of the non-linear term α × mean(y ) K fed to CoSaMP l Figure 5: Sensitivity of reconstruction error to the violation of simplifying assumptions for N = 500, K = 30, M = 200, F = 50. a) The quality of the reconstruction is not affected if the CoSaMP algorithm is fed with the value of K larger than actual. b) Reconstruction error computed in 100 realizations for each value of the quadratic term relative to the linear term. 5 Ma pp i ng sy na pti c inp ut s o nto a n e uro na l po pu la tio n Until now, we considered reconstruction of synaptic inputs onto one neuron using subthreshold measurements of its membrane potential. In this section, we apply CS to reconstructing synaptic connections onto a population of potentially post-synaptic neurons. Because in CS the choice of stimulated neurons is non-adaptive, by recording from all potentially post-synaptic neurons in response to one sequence of trials one can reconstruct a complete feedforward network (Figure 6).

Although attractive, such parallelization raises several issues. First, patching a large number of neurons is unrealistic and, therefore, monitoring membrane potential requires using different methods, such as calcium imaging [18-22], voltage sensitive dyes [23-25] or multielectrode arrays [17, 26]. As these methods can report reliably only spiking activity, the measurement is not analog but discrete. Depending on the strength of summed synaptic inputs compared to the firing threshold, the postsynaptic neuron may be silent, fire once or multiple times. As a result, the measured response y is quantized by the integer number of spikes. Such quantized measurements are less informative than analog measurements of the sub-threshold membrane potential. In the extreme case of only two quantization levels, spike or no spike, each measurement contains only 1 bit of information. Therefore, to achieve reasonable reconstruction quality using quantized measurements, a larger number of trials M>>N is required. We simulate circuit reconstruction from spike recordings in silico as follows. First, we draw synaptic weights from an experimentally motivated distribution. Second, we generate a 6 random stimulation matrix and calculate the product Ax. Third, we linear half-wave rectify this product and use the result as the instantaneous firing rate for the Poisson spike generator (Figure 6c). We used a rectifying threshold that results in 10% of spiking trials as typically observed in experiments. Fourth, we reconstruct synaptic weights using STA and CS and compare the results with the generated weights. We calculated mean error over 100 realizations of the simulation protocol (Figure 6d). Due to the non-linear spike generating procedure, x can be recovered only up to a scaling factor. We propose to calibrate x with a few brute-force measurements of synaptic weights. Thus, in calculating the reconstruction error using l2 norm, we normalize both the generated and recovered synaptic weights. Such definition is equivalent to the angular error, which is often used to evaluate the performance of STA in mapping receptive field [37, 55]. Why is CS superior to STA for a given number of trials (Figure 6d)? Note that spikeless trials, which typically constitute a majority, also carry information about connectivity. While STA discards these trials, CS takes them into account. In particular, CoSaMP starts with the STA solution as zeroth iteration and improves on it by using the results of all trials and the sparseness prior. 6 D i s c uss ion We have demonstrated that sparse feedforward networks can be reconstructed by stimulating multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons simultaneously and monitoring either subthreshold or spiking response of potentially post-synaptic neurons. When sub-threshold voltage is recorded, significantly fewer measurements are required than in the brute force approach. Although our method is sensitive to noise (with stimulation noise worse than synapse noise), it is no less robust than the brute force approach or RC. The proposed reconstruction method can also recover inputs onto a neuron from spike counts, albeit with more trials than from sub-threshold potential measurements. This is particularly useful when intra-cellular recordings are not feasible and only spiking can be detected reliably, for example, when mapping synaptic inputs onto multiple neurons in parallel. For a given number of trials, our method yields smaller error than STA. The proposed reconstruction method assumes linear summation of synaptic inputs (both excitatory and inhibitory) and is sensitive to non-linearity of synaptic integration. Therefore, it is most useful for studying connections onto neurons, in which synaptic integration is close to linear. On the other hand, multi-neuron stimulation is closer than single-neuron stimulation to the intrinsic activity in the live brain and can be used to study synaptic integration under realistic conditions. In contrast to circuit reconstruction using intrinsic neuronal activity [56, 57], our method relies on extrinsic stimulation of neurons. Can our method use intrinsic neuronal activity instead? We see two major drawbacks of such approach. First, activity of non-monitored presynaptic neurons may significantly distort reconstruction results. Thus, successful reconstruction would require monitoring all active pre-synaptic neurons, which is rather challenging. Second, reliable reconstruction is possible only when the activity of presynaptic neurons is uncorrelated. Yet, their activity may be correlated, for example, due to common input.

<p>Author: Henning Sprekeler, Guillaume Hennequin, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Although it is widely believed that reinforcement learning is a suitable tool for describing behavioral learning, the mechanisms by which it can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons are not fully understood. Here, we show that different learning rules emerge from a policy gradient approach depending on which features of the spike trains are assumed to inﬂuence the reward signals, i.e., depending on which neural code is in effect. We use the framework of Williams (1992) to derive learning rules for arbitrary neural codes. For illustration, we present policy-gradient rules for three different example codes - a spike count code, a spike timing code and the most general “full spike train” code - and test them on simple model problems. In addition to classical synaptic learning, we derive learning rules for intrinsic parameters that control the excitability of the neuron. The spike count learning rule has structural similarities with established Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rules. If the distribution of the relevant spike train features belongs to the natural exponential family, the learning rules have a characteristic shape that raises interesting prediction problems. 1</p><p>4 0.13010165 <a title="121-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Optimal_context_separation_of_spiking_haptic_signals_by_second-order_somatosensory_neurons.html">183 nips-2009-Optimal context separation of spiking haptic signals by second-order somatosensory neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Romain Brasselet, Roland Johansson, Angelo Arleo</p><p>Abstract: We study an encoding/decoding mechanism accounting for the relative spike timing of the signals propagating from peripheral nerve ﬁbers to second-order somatosensory neurons in the cuneate nucleus (CN). The CN is modeled as a population of spiking neurons receiving as inputs the spatiotemporal responses of real mechanoreceptors obtained via microneurography recordings in humans. The efﬁciency of the haptic discrimination process is quantiﬁed by a novel deﬁnition of entropy that takes into full account the metrical properties of the spike train space. This measure proves to be a suitable decoding scheme for generalizing the classical Shannon entropy to spike-based neural codes. It permits an assessment of neurotransmission in the presence of a large output space (i.e. hundreds of spike trains) with 1 ms temporal precision. It is shown that the CN population code performs a complete discrimination of 81 distinct stimuli already within 35 ms of the ﬁrst afferent spike, whereas a partial discrimination (80% of the maximum information transmission) is possible as rapidly as 15 ms. This study suggests that the CN may not constitute a mere synaptic relay along the somatosensory pathway but, rather, it may convey optimal contextual accounts (in terms of fast and reliable information transfer) of peripheral tactile inputs to downstream structures of the central nervous system. 1</p><p>5 0.12834914 <a title="121-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-A_Neural_Implementation_of_the_Kalman_Filter.html">13 nips-2009-A Neural Implementation of the Kalman Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Robert Wilson, Leif Finkel</p><p>Abstract: Recent experimental evidence suggests that the brain is capable of approximating Bayesian inference in the face of noisy input stimuli. Despite this progress, the neural underpinnings of this computation are still poorly understood. In this paper we focus on the Bayesian ﬁltering of stochastic time series and introduce a novel neural network, derived from a line attractor architecture, whose dynamics map directly onto those of the Kalman ﬁlter in the limit of small prediction error. When the prediction error is large we show that the network responds robustly to changepoints in a way that is qualitatively compatible with the optimal Bayesian model. The model suggests ways in which probability distributions are encoded in the brain and makes a number of testable experimental predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.11752254 <a title="121-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Neural_Implementation_of_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Inference_by_Importance_Sampling.html">162 nips-2009-Neural Implementation of Hierarchical Bayesian Inference by Importance Sampling</a></p>

<p>Author: Jean-pascal Pfister, Peter Dayan, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Synapses exhibit an extraordinary degree of short-term malleability, with release probabilities and effective synaptic strengths changing markedly over multiple timescales. From the perspective of a ﬁxed computational operation in a network, this seems like a most unacceptable degree of added variability. We suggest an alternative theory according to which short-term synaptic plasticity plays a normatively-justiﬁable role. This theory starts from the commonplace observation that the spiking of a neuron is an incomplete, digital, report of the analog quantity that contains all the critical information, namely its membrane potential. We suggest that a synapse solves the inverse problem of estimating the pre-synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives, acting as a recursive ﬁlter. We show that the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression closely resemble those required for optimal ﬁltering, and that they indeed support high quality estimation. Under this account, the local postsynaptic potential and the level of synaptic resources track the (scaled) mean and variance of the estimated presynaptic membrane potential. We make experimentally testable predictions for how the statistics of subthreshold membrane potential ﬂuctuations and the form of spiking non-linearity should be related to the properties of short-term plasticity in any particular cell type. 1</p><p>2 0.8351866 <a title="121-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Reconstruction_of_Sparse_Circuits_Using_Multi-neuronal_Excitation_%28RESCUME%29.html">200 nips-2009-Reconstruction of Sparse Circuits Using Multi-neuronal Excitation (RESCUME)</a></p>
<p>Author: Tao Hu, Anthony Leonardo, Dmitri B. Chklovskii</p><p>Abstract: One of the central problems in neuroscience is reconstructing synaptic connectivity in neural circuits. Synapses onto a neuron can be probed by sequentially stimulating potentially pre-synaptic neurons while monitoring the membrane voltage of the post-synaptic neuron. Reconstructing a large neural circuit using such a “brute force” approach is rather time-consuming and inefficient because the connectivity in neural circuits is sparse. Instead, we propose to measure a post-synaptic neuron’s voltage while stimulating sequentially random subsets of multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons. To reconstruct these synaptic connections from the recorded voltage we apply a decoding algorithm recently developed for compressive sensing. Compared to the brute force approach, our method promises significant time savings that grow with the size of the circuit. We use computer simulations to find optimal stimulation parameters and explore the feasibility of our reconstruction method under realistic experimental conditions including noise and non-linear synaptic integration. Multineuronal stimulation allows reconstructing synaptic connectivity just from the spiking activity of post-synaptic neurons, even when sub-threshold voltage is unavailable. By using calcium indicators, voltage-sensitive dyes, or multi-electrode arrays one could monitor activity of multiple postsynaptic neurons simultaneously, thus mapping their synaptic inputs in parallel, potentially reconstructing a complete neural circuit. 1 In tro d uc tio n Understanding information processing in neural circuits requires systematic characterization of synaptic connectivity [1, 2]. The most direct way to measure synapses between a pair of neurons is to stimulate potentially pre-synaptic neuron while recording intra-cellularly from the potentially post-synaptic neuron [3-8]. This method can be scaled to reconstruct multiple synaptic connections onto one neuron by combining intracellular recordings from the postsynaptic neuron with photo-activation of pre-synaptic neurons using glutamate uncaging [913] or channelrhodopsin [14, 15], or with multi-electrode arrays [16, 17]. Neurons are sequentially stimulated to fire action potentials by scanning a laser beam (or electrode voltage) over a brain slice, while synaptic weights are measured by recording post-synaptic voltage. Although sequential excitation of single potentially pre-synaptic neurons could reveal connectivity, such a “brute force” approach is inefficient because the connectivity among neurons is sparse. Even among nearby neurons in the cerebral cortex, the probability of connection is only about ten percent [3-8]. Connection probability decays rapidly with the 1 distance between neurons and falls below one percent on the scale of a cortical column [3, 8]. Thus, most single-neuron stimulation trials would result in zero response making the brute force approach slow, especially for larger circuits. Another drawback of the brute force approach is that single-neuron stimulation cannot be combined efficiently with methods allowing parallel recording of neural activity, such as calcium imaging [18-22], voltage-sensitive dyes [23-25] or multi-electrode arrays [17, 26]. As these techniques do not reliably measure sub-threshold potential but report only spiking activity, they would reveal only the strongest connections that can drive a neuron to fire [2730]. Therefore, such combination would reveal only a small fraction of the circuit. We propose to circumvent the above limitations of the brute force approach by stimulating multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons simultaneously and reconstructing individual connections by using a recently developed method called compressive sensing (CS) [31-35]. In each trial, we stimulate F neurons randomly chosen out of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons and measure post-synaptic activity. Although each measurement yields only a combined response to stimulated neurons, if synaptic inputs sum linearly in a post-synaptic neuron, one can reconstruct the weights of individual connections by using an optimization algorithm. Moreover, if the synaptic connections are sparse, i.e. only K << N potentially pre-synaptic neurons make synaptic connections onto a post-synaptic neuron, the required number of trials M ~ K log(N/K), which is much less than N [31-35]. The proposed method can be used even if only spiking activity is available. Because multiple neurons are driven to fire simultaneously, if several of them synapse on the post-synaptic neuron, they can induce one or more spikes in that neuron. As quantized spike counts carry less information than analog sub-threshold voltage recordings, reconstruction requires a larger number of trials. Yet, the method can be used to reconstruct a complete feedforward circuit from spike recordings. Reconstructing neural circuit with multi-neuronal excitation may be compared with mapping retinal ganglion cell receptive fields. Typically, photoreceptors are stimulated by white-noise checkerboard stimulus and the receptive field is obtained by Reverse Correlation (RC) in case of sub-threshold measurements or Spike-Triggered Average (STA) of the stimulus [36, 37]. Although CS may use the same stimulation protocol, for a limited number of trials, the reconstruction quality is superior to RC or STA. 2 Ma pp i ng sy na pti c inp ut s o nto o n e ne uro n We start by formalizing the problem of mapping synaptic connections from a population of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons onto a single neuron, as exemplified by granule cells synapsing onto a Purkinje cell (Figure 1a). Our experimental protocol can be illustrated using linear algebra formalism, Figure 1b. We represent synaptic weights as components of a column vector x, where zeros represent non-existing connections. Each row in the stimulation matrix A represents a trial, ones indicating neurons driven to spike once and zeros indicating non-spiking neurons. The number of rows in the stimulation matrix A is equal to the number of trials M. The column vector y represents M measurements of membrane voltage obtained by an intra-cellular recording from the post-synaptic neuron: y = Ax. (1) In order to recover individual synaptic weights, Eq. (1) must be solved for x. RC (or STA) solution to this problem is x = (ATA)-1AT y, which minimizes (y-Ax)2 if M>N. In the case M << N for a sparse circuit. In this section we search computationally for the minimum number of trials required for exact reconstruction as a function of the number of non-zero synaptic weights K out of N potentially pre-synaptic neurons. First, note that the number of trials depends on the number of stimulated neurons F. If F = 1 we revert to the brute force approach and the number of measurements is N, while for F = N, the measurements are redundant and no finite number suffices. As the minimum number of measurements is expected to scale as K logN, there must be an optimal F which makes each measurement most informative about x. To determine the optimal number of stimulated neurons F for given K and N, we search for the minimum number of trials M, which allows a perfect reconstruction of the synaptic connectivity x. For each F, we generate 50 synaptic weight vectors and attempt reconstruction from sequentially increasing numbers of trials. The value of M, at which all 50 recoveries are successful (up to computer round-off error), estimates the number of trial needed for reconstruction with probability higher than 98%. By repeating this procedure 50 times for each F, we estimate the mean and standard deviation of M. We find that, for given N and K, the minimum number of trials, M, as a function of the number of stimulated neurons, F, has a shallow minimum. As K decreases, the minimum shifts towards larger F because more neurons should be stimulated simultaneously for sparser x. For the explored range of simulation parameters, the minimum is located close to 0.1N. Next, we set F = 0.1N and explore how the minimum number of measurements required for exact reconstruction depends on K and N. Results of the simulations following the recipe described above are shown in Figure 3a. As expected, when x is sparse, M grows approximately linearly with K (Figure 3b), and logarithmically with N (Figure 3c).

Such noise detrimentally affects reconstructions because each row of A is multiplied by a different instantiation of vector x. 2) Stimulation of neurons may be imprecise exciting a slightly different subset of neurons than intended and/or firing intended neurons multiple times. We call this effect stimulation noise. Such noise detrimentally affects reconstructions because, in its presence, the actual measurement matrix A is different from the one used for recovery. 3) A synapse may fail to release neurotransmitter with some probability. Naturally, in the presence of noise, reconstructions cannot be exact. We quantify the 4 reconstruction x − xr l2 = error ∑ N i =1 by the normalized x − xr l2–error l2 / xl , where 2 ( xi − xri ) 2 . We plot normalized reconstruction error in brute force approach (M = N = 500 trials) as a function of noise, as well as CS and RC reconstruction errors (M = 200, 600 trials), Figure 4. 2 0.9 Normalized reconstruction error ||x-x|| /||x|| 1 r 2 For each noise source, the reconstruction error of the brute force approach can be achieved with 60% fewer trials by CS method for the above parameters (Figure 4). For the same number of trials, RC method performs worse. Naturally, the reconstruction error decreases with the number of trials. The reconstruction error is most sensitive to stimulation noise and least sensitive to synaptic noise. 1 (a) 1 (b) 0.9 0.8 (c) 0.9 0.8 0.8 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.6 0.5 0.5 0.4 0.4 0.4 0.3 0.3 0.3 0.2 0.2 0.2 0.1 0.1 0.1 0 0 0.7 RC: M=200 RC: M=600 Brute force method: M=500 CS: M=200 CS: M=600 0.6 0.5 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 Synaptic noise level 0.2 0.25 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 Stimulation noise level 0.2 0.25 0 0 0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 Synaptic failure probability Figure 4: Impact of noise on the reconstruction quality for N = 500, K = 30, F = 50. a) Recovery error due to trial-to-trial variation in synaptic weight. The response y is calculated using the synaptic connectivity x perturbed by an additive Gaussian noise. The noise level is given by the coefficient of variation of synaptic weight. b) Recovery error due to stimulation noise. The matrix A used for recovery is obtained from the binary matrix used to calculate the measurement vector y by shifting, in each row, a fraction of ones specified by the noise level to random positions. c) Recovery error due to synaptic failures. The detrimental effect of the stimulation noise on the reconstruction can be eliminated by monitoring spiking activity of potentially pre-synaptic neurons. By using calcium imaging [18-22], voltage-sensitive dyes [23] or multi-electrode arrays [17, 26] one could record the actual stimulation matrix. Because most random matrices satisfy the reconstruction requirements [31, 34, 35], the actual stimulation matrix can be used for a successful recovery instead of the intended one. If neuronal activity can be monitored reliably, experiments can be done in a different mode altogether. Instead of stimulating designated neurons with high fidelity by using highly localized and intense light, one could stimulate all neurons with low probability. Random firing events can be detected and used in the recovery process. The light intensity can be tuned to stimulate the optimal number of neurons per trial. Next, we explore the sensitivity of the proposed reconstruction method to the violation of simplifying assumptions. First, whereas our simulation assumes that the actual number of connections, K, is known, in reality, connectivity sparseness is known a priori only approximately. Will this affect reconstruction results? In principle, CS does not require prior knowledge of K for reconstruction [31, 34, 35]. For the CoSaMP algorithm, however, it is important to provide value K larger than the actual value (Figure 5a). Then, the algorithm will find all the actual synaptic weights plus some extra non-zero weights, negligibly small when compared to actual ones. Thus, one can provide the algorithm with the value of K safely larger than the actual one and then threshold the reconstruction result according to the synaptic noise level. Second, whereas we assumed a linear summation of inputs [53], synaptic integration may be 2 non-linear [54]. We model non-linearity by setting y = yl + α yl , where yl represents linearly summed synaptic inputs. Results of simulations (Figure 5b) show that although nonlinearity can significantly degrade CS reconstruction quality, it still performs better than RC. 5 (b) 0.45 0.4 Actual K = 30 0.35 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 0.05 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Normalized reconstruction error ||x-x||2/||x|| r 2 Normalized reconstrcution error ||x-x||2/||x|| r 2 (a) 0.9 0.8 0.7 CS RC 0.6 0.5 0.4 0.3 0.2 0.1 0 -0.15-0.12-0.09-0.06-0.03 0 0.03 0.06 0.09 0.12 0.15 Relative strength of the non-linear term α × mean(y ) K fed to CoSaMP l Figure 5: Sensitivity of reconstruction error to the violation of simplifying assumptions for N = 500, K = 30, M = 200, F = 50. a) The quality of the reconstruction is not affected if the CoSaMP algorithm is fed with the value of K larger than actual. b) Reconstruction error computed in 100 realizations for each value of the quadratic term relative to the linear term. 5 Ma pp i ng sy na pti c inp ut s o nto a n e uro na l po pu la tio n Until now, we considered reconstruction of synaptic inputs onto one neuron using subthreshold measurements of its membrane potential. In this section, we apply CS to reconstructing synaptic connections onto a population of potentially post-synaptic neurons. Because in CS the choice of stimulated neurons is non-adaptive, by recording from all potentially post-synaptic neurons in response to one sequence of trials one can reconstruct a complete feedforward network (Figure 6).

Although attractive, such parallelization raises several issues. First, patching a large number of neurons is unrealistic and, therefore, monitoring membrane potential requires using different methods, such as calcium imaging [18-22], voltage sensitive dyes [23-25] or multielectrode arrays [17, 26]. As these methods can report reliably only spiking activity, the measurement is not analog but discrete. Depending on the strength of summed synaptic inputs compared to the firing threshold, the postsynaptic neuron may be silent, fire once or multiple times. As a result, the measured response y is quantized by the integer number of spikes. Such quantized measurements are less informative than analog measurements of the sub-threshold membrane potential. In the extreme case of only two quantization levels, spike or no spike, each measurement contains only 1 bit of information. Therefore, to achieve reasonable reconstruction quality using quantized measurements, a larger number of trials M>>N is required. We simulate circuit reconstruction from spike recordings in silico as follows. First, we draw synaptic weights from an experimentally motivated distribution. Second, we generate a 6 random stimulation matrix and calculate the product Ax. Third, we linear half-wave rectify this product and use the result as the instantaneous firing rate for the Poisson spike generator (Figure 6c). We used a rectifying threshold that results in 10% of spiking trials as typically observed in experiments. Fourth, we reconstruct synaptic weights using STA and CS and compare the results with the generated weights. We calculated mean error over 100 realizations of the simulation protocol (Figure 6d). Due to the non-linear spike generating procedure, x can be recovered only up to a scaling factor. We propose to calibrate x with a few brute-force measurements of synaptic weights. Thus, in calculating the reconstruction error using l2 norm, we normalize both the generated and recovered synaptic weights. Such definition is equivalent to the angular error, which is often used to evaluate the performance of STA in mapping receptive field [37, 55]. Why is CS superior to STA for a given number of trials (Figure 6d)? Note that spikeless trials, which typically constitute a majority, also carry information about connectivity. While STA discards these trials, CS takes them into account. In particular, CoSaMP starts with the STA solution as zeroth iteration and improves on it by using the results of all trials and the sparseness prior. 6 D i s c uss ion We have demonstrated that sparse feedforward networks can be reconstructed by stimulating multiple potentially pre-synaptic neurons simultaneously and monitoring either subthreshold or spiking response of potentially post-synaptic neurons. When sub-threshold voltage is recorded, significantly fewer measurements are required than in the brute force approach. Although our method is sensitive to noise (with stimulation noise worse than synapse noise), it is no less robust than the brute force approach or RC. The proposed reconstruction method can also recover inputs onto a neuron from spike counts, albeit with more trials than from sub-threshold potential measurements. This is particularly useful when intra-cellular recordings are not feasible and only spiking can be detected reliably, for example, when mapping synaptic inputs onto multiple neurons in parallel. For a given number of trials, our method yields smaller error than STA. The proposed reconstruction method assumes linear summation of synaptic inputs (both excitatory and inhibitory) and is sensitive to non-linearity of synaptic integration. Therefore, it is most useful for studying connections onto neurons, in which synaptic integration is close to linear. On the other hand, multi-neuron stimulation is closer than single-neuron stimulation to the intrinsic activity in the live brain and can be used to study synaptic integration under realistic conditions. In contrast to circuit reconstruction using intrinsic neuronal activity [56, 57], our method relies on extrinsic stimulation of neurons. Can our method use intrinsic neuronal activity instead? We see two major drawbacks of such approach. First, activity of non-monitored presynaptic neurons may significantly distort reconstruction results. Thus, successful reconstruction would require monitoring all active pre-synaptic neurons, which is rather challenging. Second, reliable reconstruction is possible only when the activity of presynaptic neurons is uncorrelated. Yet, their activity may be correlated, for example, due to common input.

<p>Author: Henning Sprekeler, Guillaume Hennequin, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Although it is widely believed that reinforcement learning is a suitable tool for describing behavioral learning, the mechanisms by which it can be implemented in networks of spiking neurons are not fully understood. Here, we show that different learning rules emerge from a policy gradient approach depending on which features of the spike trains are assumed to inﬂuence the reward signals, i.e., depending on which neural code is in effect. We use the framework of Williams (1992) to derive learning rules for arbitrary neural codes. For illustration, we present policy-gradient rules for three different example codes - a spike count code, a spike timing code and the most general “full spike train” code - and test them on simple model problems. In addition to classical synaptic learning, we derive learning rules for intrinsic parameters that control the excitability of the neuron. The spike count learning rule has structural similarities with established Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro rules. If the distribution of the relevant spike train features belongs to the natural exponential family, the learning rules have a characteristic shape that raises interesting prediction problems. 1</p><p>4 0.67699951 <a title="121-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Functional_network_reorganization_in_motor_cortex_can_be_explained_by_reward-modulated_Hebbian_learning.html">99 nips-2009-Functional network reorganization in motor cortex can be explained by reward-modulated Hebbian learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Steven Chase, Andrew Schwartz, Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: The control of neuroprosthetic devices from the activity of motor cortex neurons beneﬁts from learning effects where the function of these neurons is adapted to the control task. It was recently shown that tuning properties of neurons in monkey motor cortex are adapted selectively in order to compensate for an erroneous interpretation of their activity. In particular, it was shown that the tuning curves of those neurons whose preferred directions had been misinterpreted changed more than those of other neurons. In this article, we show that the experimentally observed self-tuning properties of the system can be explained on the basis of a simple learning rule. This learning rule utilizes neuronal noise for exploration and performs Hebbian weight updates that are modulated by a global reward signal. In contrast to most previously proposed reward-modulated Hebbian learning rules, this rule does not require extraneous knowledge about what is noise and what is signal. The learning rule is able to optimize the performance of the model system within biologically realistic periods of time and under high noise levels. When the neuronal noise is ﬁtted to experimental data, the model produces learning effects similar to those found in monkey experiments.</p><p>5 0.65298218 <a title="121-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Noise_Characterization%2C_Modeling%2C_and_Reduction_for_In_Vivo_Neural_Recording.html">165 nips-2009-Noise Characterization, Modeling, and Reduction for In Vivo Neural Recording</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhi Yang, Qi Zhao, Edward Keefer, Wentai Liu</p><p>Abstract: Studying signal and noise properties of recorded neural data is critical in developing more efﬁcient algorithms to recover the encoded information. Important issues exist in this research including the variant spectrum spans of neural spikes that make it difﬁcult to choose a globally optimal bandpass ﬁlter. Also, multiple sources produce aggregated noise that deviates from the conventional white Gaussian noise. In this work, the spectrum variability of spikes is addressed, based on which the concept of adaptive bandpass ﬁlter that ﬁts the spectrum of individual spikes is proposed. Multiple noise sources have been studied through analytical models as well as empirical measurements. The dominant noise source is identiﬁed as neuron noise followed by interface noise of the electrode. This suggests that major efforts to reduce noise from electronics are not well spent. The measured noise from in vivo experiments shows a family of 1/f x spectrum that can be reduced using noise shaping techniques. In summary, the methods of adaptive bandpass ﬁltering and noise shaping together result in several dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) enhancement.</p><p>6 0.60442299 <a title="121-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-STDP_enables_spiking_neurons_to_detect_hidden_causes_of_their_inputs.html">210 nips-2009-STDP enables spiking neurons to detect hidden causes of their inputs</a></p>

<p>Author: Jean-pascal Pfister, Peter Dayan, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Synapses exhibit an extraordinary degree of short-term malleability, with release probabilities and effective synaptic strengths changing markedly over multiple timescales. From the perspective of a ﬁxed computational operation in a network, this seems like a most unacceptable degree of added variability. We suggest an alternative theory according to which short-term synaptic plasticity plays a normatively-justiﬁable role. This theory starts from the commonplace observation that the spiking of a neuron is an incomplete, digital, report of the analog quantity that contains all the critical information, namely its membrane potential. We suggest that a synapse solves the inverse problem of estimating the pre-synaptic membrane potential from the spikes it receives, acting as a recursive ﬁlter. We show that the dynamics of short-term synaptic depression closely resemble those required for optimal ﬁltering, and that they indeed support high quality estimation. Under this account, the local postsynaptic potential and the level of synaptic resources track the (scaled) mean and variance of the estimated presynaptic membrane potential. We make experimentally testable predictions for how the statistics of subthreshold membrane potential ﬂuctuations and the form of spiking non-linearity should be related to the properties of short-term plasticity in any particular cell type. 1</p><p>2 0.73249644 <a title="121-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Exploring_Functional_Connectivities_of_the_Human_Brain_using_Multivariate_Information_Analysis.html">86 nips-2009-Exploring Functional Connectivities of the Human Brain using Multivariate Information Analysis</a></p>

Recent advances in the numerical approximation of highdimensional probability distributions allow us to successfully estimate mutual information from scarce fMRI data. We also show that selecting voxels based on the multivariate mutual information of local activity patterns with respect to ground truth labels leads to higher decoding accuracy than established voxel selection methods. We validate our approach with a 6-way scene categorization fMRI experiment. Multivariate information analysis is able to ﬁnd strong information sharing between PPA and RSC, consistent with existing neuroscience studies on scenes. Furthermore, an exploratory whole-brain analysis uncovered other brain regions that share information with the PPA-RSC scene network.</p><p>3 0.69956768 <a title="121-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Beyond_Categories%3A_The_Visual_Memex_Model_for_Reasoning_About_Object_Relationships.html">44 nips-2009-Beyond Categories: The Visual Memex Model for Reasoning About Object Relationships</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomasz Malisiewicz, Alyosha Efros</p><p>Abstract: The use of context is critical for scene understanding in computer vision, where the recognition of an object is driven by both local appearance and the object’s relationship to other elements of the scene (context). Most current approaches rely on modeling the relationships between object categories as a source of context. In this paper we seek to move beyond categories to provide a richer appearancebased model of context. We present an exemplar-based model of objects and their relationships, the Visual Memex, that encodes both local appearance and 2D spatial context between object instances. We evaluate our model on Torralba’s proposed Context Challenge against a baseline category-based system. Our experiments suggest that moving beyond categories for context modeling appears to be quite beneﬁcial, and may be the critical missing ingredient in scene understanding systems. 1</p><p>4 0.58620852 <a title="121-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Regularized_Distance_Metric_Learning%3ATheory_and_Algorithm.html">202 nips-2009-Regularized Distance Metric Learning:Theory and Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Rong Jin, Shijun Wang, Yang Zhou</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we examine the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning. We show that with appropriate constraints, the generalization error of regularized distance metric learning could be independent from the dimensionality, making it suitable for handling high dimensional data. In addition, we present an efﬁcient online learning algorithm for regularized distance metric learning. Our empirical studies with data classiﬁcation and face recognition show that the proposed algorithm is (i) effective for distance metric learning when compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and (ii) efﬁcient and robust for high dimensional data.</p><p>5 0.5686186 <a title="121-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Linearly_constrained_Bayesian_matrix_factorization_for_blind_source_separation.html">140 nips-2009-Linearly constrained Bayesian matrix factorization for blind source separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikkel Schmidt</p><p>Abstract: We present a general Bayesian approach to probabilistic matrix factorization subject to linear constraints. The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem. We demonstrate that our algorithm can be used to extract meaningful and interpretable features that are remarkably different from features extracted using existing related matrix factorization techniques.</p><p>6 0.55434632 <a title="121-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Discriminative_Network_Models_of_Schizophrenia.html">70 nips-2009-Discriminative Network Models of Schizophrenia</a></p>

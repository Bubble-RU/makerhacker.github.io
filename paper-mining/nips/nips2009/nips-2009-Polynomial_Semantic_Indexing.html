<p>Author: James Petterson, Jin Yu, Julian J. Mcauley, Tibério S. Caetano</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for learning max-weight matching predictors in bipartite graphs. The method consists of performing maximum a posteriori estimation in exponential families with sufﬁcient statistics that encode permutations and data features. Although inference is in general hard, we show that for one very relevant application–document ranking–exact inference is efﬁcient. For general model instances, an appropriate sampler is readily available. Contrary to existing max-margin matching models, our approach is statistically consistent and, in addition, experiments with increasing sample sizes indicate superior improvement over such models. We apply the method to graph matching in computer vision as well as to a standard benchmark dataset for learning document ranking, in which we obtain state-of-the-art results, in particular improving on max-margin variants. The drawback of this method with respect to max-margin alternatives is its runtime for large graphs, which is comparatively high. 1</p><p>3 0.20641498 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Learning_to_Rank_by_Optimizing_NDCG_Measure.html">136 nips-2009-Learning to Rank by Optimizing NDCG Measure</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin, Ruofei Zhang, Jianchang Mao</p><p>Abstract: Learning to rank is a relatively new ﬁeld of study, aiming to learn a ranking function from a set of training data with relevancy labels. The ranking algorithms are often evaluated using information retrieval measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [1] and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2]. Until recently, most learning to rank algorithms were not using a loss function related to the above mentioned evaluation measures. The main difﬁculty in direct optimization of these measures is that they depend on the ranks of documents, not the numerical values output by the ranking function. We propose a probabilistic framework that addresses this challenge by optimizing the expectation of NDCG over all the possible permutations of documents. A relaxation strategy is used to approximate the average of NDCG over the space of permutation, and a bound optimization approach is proposed to make the computation efﬁcient. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms on several benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.17213966 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Geoffrey E. Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a two-layer undirected graphical model, called a “Replicated Softmax”, that can be used to model and automatically extract low-dimensional latent semantic representations from a large unstructured collection of documents. We present efﬁcient learning and inference algorithms for this model, and show how a Monte-Carlo based method, Annealed Importance Sampling, can be used to produce an accurate estimate of the log-probability the model assigns to test data. This allows us to demonstrate that the proposed model is able to generalize much better compared to Latent Dirichlet Allocation in terms of both the log-probability of held-out documents and the retrieval accuracy.</p><p>5 0.1719785 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Ranking_Measures_and_Loss_Functions_in_Learning_to_Rank.html">199 nips-2009-Ranking Measures and Loss Functions in Learning to Rank</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Chen, Tie-yan Liu, Yanyan Lan, Zhi-ming Ma, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: Learning to rank has become an important research topic in machine learning. While most learning-to-rank methods learn the ranking functions by minimizing loss functions, it is the ranking measures (such as NDCG and MAP) that are used to evaluate the performance of the learned ranking functions. In this work, we reveal the relationship between ranking measures and loss functions in learningto-rank methods, such as Ranking SVM, RankBoost, RankNet, and ListMLE. We show that the loss functions of these methods are upper bounds of the measurebased ranking errors. As a result, the minimization of these loss functions will lead to the maximization of the ranking measures. The key to obtaining this result is to model ranking as a sequence of classiﬁcation tasks, and deﬁne a so-called essential loss for ranking as the weighted sum of the classiﬁcation errors of individual tasks in the sequence. We have proved that the essential loss is both an upper bound of the measure-based ranking errors, and a lower bound of the loss functions in the aforementioned methods. Our proof technique also suggests a way to modify existing loss functions to make them tighter bounds of the measure-based ranking errors. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the modiﬁcations can lead to better ranking performances, demonstrating the correctness of our theoretical analysis. 1</p><p>6 0.156231 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Filtering_Abstract_Senses_From_Image_Search_Results.html">96 nips-2009-Filtering Abstract Senses From Image Search Results</a></p>

<p>Author: Shuang-hong Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Bao-gang Hu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predeﬁned classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-deﬁned classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classiﬁcation and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classiﬁcation and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.</p><p>5 0.5653246 <a title="190-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Rank-Approximate_Nearest_Neighbor_Search%3A_Retaining_Meaning_and_Speed_in_High_Dimensions.html">198 nips-2009-Rank-Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search: Retaining Meaning and Speed in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Parikshit Ram, Dongryeol Lee, Hua Ouyang, Alexander G. Gray</p><p>Abstract: The long-standing problem of efďŹ cient nearest-neighbor (NN) search has ubiquitous applications ranging from astrophysics to MP3 ďŹ ngerprinting to bioinformatics to movie recommendations. As the dimensionality of the dataset increases, exact NN search becomes computationally prohibitive; (1+đ?&oelig;&ndash;) distance-approximate NN search can provide large speedups but risks losing the meaning of NN search present in the ranks (ordering) of the distances. This paper presents a simple, practical algorithm allowing the user to, for the ďŹ rst time, directly control the true accuracy of NN search (in terms of ranks) while still achieving the large speedups over exact NN. Experiments on high-dimensional datasets show that our algorithm often achieves faster and more accurate results than the best-known distance-approximate method, with much more stable behavior. 1</p><p>6 0.56324279 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Peilin Zhao, Steven C. Hoi, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: In most online learning algorithms, the weights assigned to the misclassiﬁed examples (or support vectors) remain unchanged during the entire learning process. This is clearly insufﬁcient since when a new misclassiﬁed example is added to the pool of support vectors, we generally expect it to affect the weights for the existing support vectors. In this paper, we propose a new online learning method, termed Double Updating Online Learning, or DUOL for short. Instead of only assigning a ﬁxed weight to the misclassiﬁed example received in current trial, the proposed online learning algorithm also tries to update the weight for one of the existing support vectors. We show that the mistake bound can be signiﬁcantly improved by the proposed online learning method. Encouraging experimental results show that the proposed technique is in general considerably more effective than the state-of-the-art online learning algorithms. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.70295823 <a title="190-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Polynomial_Semantic_Indexing.html">190 nips-2009-Polynomial Semantic Indexing</a></p>

<p>Author: Gunhee Kim, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a fast and scalable alternating optimization technique to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in cluttered Web images without labels. The proposed approach discovers highly probable regions of object instances by iteratively repeating the following two functions: (1) choose the exemplar set (i.e. a small number of highly ranked reference ROIs) across the dataset and (2) reﬁne the ROIs of each image with respect to the exemplar set. These two subproblems are formulated as ranking in two different similarity networks of ROI hypotheses by link analysis. The experiments with the PASCAL 06 dataset show that our unsupervised localization performance is better than one of state-of-the-art techniques and comparable to supervised methods. Also, we test the scalability of our approach with ﬁve objects in Flickr dataset consisting of more than 200K images. 1</p><p>4 0.62521219 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Adaptive_Regularization_for_Transductive_Support_Vector_Machine.html">26 nips-2009-Adaptive Regularization for Transductive Support Vector Machine</a></p>
<p>Author: Zenglin Xu, Rong Jin, Jianke Zhu, Irwin King, Michael Lyu, Zhirong Yang</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the framework of Transductive Support Vector Machine (TSVM) from the perspective of the regularization strength induced by the unlabeled data. In this framework, SVM and TSVM can be regarded as a learning machine without regularization and one with full regularization from the unlabeled data, respectively. Therefore, to supplement this framework of the regularization strength, it is necessary to introduce data-dependant partial regularization. To this end, we reformulate TSVM into a form with controllable regularization strength, which includes SVM and TSVM as special cases. Furthermore, we introduce a method of adaptive regularization that is data dependant and is based on the smoothness assumption. Experiments on a set of benchmark data sets indicate the promising results of the proposed work compared with state-of-the-art TSVM algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.59124732 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Rob Fergus, Yair Weiss, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: With the advent of the Internet it is now possible to collect hundreds of millions of images. These images come with varying degrees of label information. “Clean labels” can be manually obtained on a small fraction, “noisy labels” may be extracted automatically from surrounding text, while for most images there are no labels at all. Semi-supervised learning is a principled framework for combining these different label sources. However, it scales polynomially with the number of images, making it impractical for use on gigantic collections with hundreds of millions of images and thousands of classes. In this paper we show how to utilize recent results in machine learning to obtain highly efﬁcient approximations for semi-supervised learning that are linear in the number of images. Speciﬁcally, we use the convergence of the eigenvectors of the normalized graph Laplacian to eigenfunctions of weighted Laplace-Beltrami operators. Our algorithm enables us to apply semi-supervised learning to a database of 80 million images gathered from the Internet. 1</p><p>6 0.58951718 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Bootstrapping_from_Game_Tree_Search.html">48 nips-2009-Bootstrapping from Game Tree Search</a></p>

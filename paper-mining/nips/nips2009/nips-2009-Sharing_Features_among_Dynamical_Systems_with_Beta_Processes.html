</p><p>4 We validate our sampling algorithm using several synthetic datasets, and also demonstrate promising results on unsupervised segmentation of visual motion capture data. [sent-16, score-0.173]
</p><p>5 1 Introduction In many applications, one would like to discover and model dynamical behaviors which are shared among several related time series. [sent-17, score-0.58]
</p><p>6 For example, consider video or motion capture data depicting multiple people performing a number of related tasks. [sent-18, score-0.173]
</p><p>7 We speciﬁcally focus on time series where behaviors can be individually modeled via temporally independent or linear dynamical systems, and where transitions between behaviors are approximately Markovian. [sent-20, score-0.802]
</p><p>8 Examples of such Markov jump processes include the hidden Markov model (HMM), switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process, and switching linear dynamical system (SLDS). [sent-21, score-0.622]
</p><p>9 Our approach envisions a large library of behaviors, and each time series or object exhibits a subset of these behaviors. [sent-23, score-0.181]
</p><p>10 We then seek a framework for discovering the set of dynamic behaviors that each object exhibits. [sent-24, score-0.444]
</p><p>11 One can represent the set of behaviors an object exhibits via an associated list of features. [sent-26, score-0.404]
</p><p>12 Setting fik = 1 implies that object i exhibits feature k. [sent-28, score-0.593]
</p><p>13 Our desiderata motivate a Bayesian nonparametric approach based on the beta process [10, 22], allowing for inﬁnitely many 1  potential features. [sent-29, score-0.326]
</p><p>14 Integrating over the latent beta process induces a predictive distribution on features known as the Indian buffet process (IBP) [9]. [sent-30, score-0.561]
</p><p>15 These models are quite different from our framework: the HDP-HMM does not select a subset of behaviors for a given time series, but assumes that all time series share the same set of behaviors and switch among them in exactly the same manner. [sent-33, score-0.593]
</p><p>16 Our work focuses on modeling multiple time series and on capturing dynamical modes that are shared among the series. [sent-35, score-0.362]
</p><p>17 In particular, we exploit the ﬁnite dynamical system induced by a ﬁxed set of features to efﬁciently compute acceptance probabilities, and reversible jump birth and death proposals to explore new features. [sent-37, score-0.708]
</p><p>18 We validate our sampling algorithm using several synthetic datasets, and also demonstrate promising unsupervised segmentation of data from the CMU motion capture database [23]. [sent-38, score-0.173]
</p><p>19 2 Binary Features and Beta Processes The beta process is a completely random measure [12]: draws are discrete with probability one, and realizations on disjoint sets are independent random variables. [sent-39, score-0.291]
</p><p>20 (1) Here, c > 0 is a concentration parameter; we denote such a beta process by BP(c, B0 ). [sent-42, score-0.291]
</p><p>21 The beta process is conjugate to a class of Bernoulli processes [22], denoted by BeP(B), which provide our sought-for featural representation. [sent-48, score-0.379]
</p><p>22 A realization Xi ∼ BeP(B), with B an atomic measure, is a collection of unit mass atoms on Θ located at some subset of the atoms in B. [sent-49, score-0.154]
</p><p>23 In particular, fik ∼ Bernoulli(ωk ) is sampled independently for each atom θk in Eq. [sent-50, score-0.395]
</p><p>24 A Bernoulli process realization Xi then determines the subset of features allocated to object i: B | B0 , c ∼ BP(c, B0 ) Xi | B ∼ BeP(B), i = 1, . [sent-53, score-0.224]
</p><p>25 (3) Because beta process priors are conjugate to the Bernoulli process [22], the posterior distribution given N samples Xi ∼ BeP(B) is a beta process with updated parameters: B | X1 , . [sent-57, score-0.749]
</p><p>26 c+N k  (4)  Here, mk denotes the number of objects Xi which select the k th feature θk . [sent-61, score-0.18]
</p><p>27 For simplicity, we have reordered the feature indices to list the K+ features used by at least one object ﬁrst. [sent-62, score-0.212]
</p><p>28 Computationally, Bernoulli process realizations Xi are often summarized by an inﬁnite vector of binary indicator variables fi = [fi1 , fi2 , . [sent-63, score-0.256]
</p><p>29 ], where fik = 1 if and only if object i exhibits feature k. [sent-66, score-0.593]
</p><p>30 As shown by Thibaux and Jordan [22], marginalizing over the beta process measure B, and taking c = 1, provides a predictive distribution on indicators known as the Indian buffet process (IBP) Grifﬁths and Ghahramani [9]. [sent-67, score-0.492]
</p><p>31 The Indian buffet consists of an inﬁnitely long buffet line of dishes, or features. [sent-69, score-0.17]
</p><p>32 2  3 Describing Multiple Time Series with Beta Processes Assume we have a set of N objects, each of whose dynamics is described by a switching vector autoregressive (VAR) process, with switches occurring according to a discrete-time Markov process. [sent-72, score-0.188]
</p><p>33 Let yt represent the observation vector of the ith object at time t, and zt the latent dynamical mode. [sent-74, score-0.73]
</p><p>34 Assuming an order r switching VAR process, denoted by VAR(r), we have (i)  zt ∼ π  (i)  (5)  (i)  zt−1  r (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  (6)  t  t  j=1  (i)  ˜ Az(i) yt + et (zt ),  Aj,z(i) yt−j + et (zt )  yt =  (i)T  (i)T T  (i) (i) ˜ where et (k) ∼ N (0, Σk ), Ak = [A1,k . [sent-75, score-0.69]
</p><p>35 We refer to these VAR processes, with parameters θk = {Ak , Σk }, as behaviors, and use a beta process prior to couple the dynamic behaviors exhibited by different objects or sequences. [sent-83, score-0.705]
</p><p>36 2, let fi be a vector of binary indicator variables, where fik denotes whether object i exhibits behavior k for some t ∈ {1, . [sent-85, score-0.705]
</p><p>37 Given fi , we deﬁne a feature-constrained transition (i) distribution π (i) = {πk }, which governs the ith object’s Markov transitions among its set of dynamic behaviors. [sent-89, score-0.334]
</p><p>38 We denote this collection of transition variables by η (i) , and use them to deﬁne object-speciﬁc, feature-constrained transition distributions: (i)  (i)  πj =  ηj1  (i)  ηj2  . [sent-91, score-0.222]
</p><p>39 This construction deﬁnes πj over the full set of positive integers, but assigns positive mass only at indices k where fik = 1. [sent-96, score-0.437]
</p><p>40 (i)  The preceding generative process can be equivalently represented via a sample πj ˜ Dirichlet distribution of dimension Ki =  k  fik , containing the non-zero entries of  (i)  πj | fi , γ, κ ∼ Dir([γ, . [sent-97, score-0.611]
</p><p>41 ˜  from a ﬁnite  (i) πj :  (9)  (i)  The κ hyperparameter places extra expected mass on the component of πj corresponding to a self˜ (i)  transition πjj , analogously to the sticky hyperparameter of Fox et al. [sent-104, score-0.231]
</p><p>42 4 MCMC Methods for Posterior Inference We have developed an MCMC method which alternates between resampling binary feature assignments given observations and dynamical parameters, and dynamical parameters given observations and features. [sent-108, score-0.642]
</p><p>43 We leverage the fact that ﬁxed feature assignments instantiate a set of ﬁnite AR-HMMs, for which dynamic programming can be used to efﬁciently compute marginal likelihoods. [sent-110, score-0.151]
</p><p>44 1 Sampling binary feature assignments −i Let F −ik denote the set of all binary feature indicators excluding fik , and K+ be the number of behaviors currently instantiated by objects other than i. [sent-113, score-0.974]
</p><p>45 The beta process distributed measure B | B0 ∼ BP(1, B0 ) is represented by its masses ωk and locations θk , as in Eq. [sent-121, score-0.291]
</p><p>46 The features are then conditionally independent draws fik | ωk ∼ Bernoulli(ωk ), and are used to deﬁne feature-constrained transition distributions (i) πj | fi , γ, κ ∼ Dir([γ, . [sent-123, score-0.703]
</p><p>47 Given the ith object’s observation sequence y1:Ti , (i)  transition variables η (i) = η1:K −i ,1:K −i , and shared dynamic parameters θ1:K −i , feature indicators +  +  +  −i fik for currently used features k ∈ {1, . [sent-136, score-0.817]
</p><p>48 , K+ } have the following posterior distribution: (i)  (i)  p(fik | F −ik, y1:Ti , η (i), θ1:K −i , α) ∝ p(fik | F −ik, α)p(y1:Ti | fi , η(i), θ1:K −i ). [sent-139, score-0.187]
</p><p>49 +  +  (10)  −i Here, the IBP prior implies that p(fik = 1 | F −ik, α) = mk /N , where m−i denotes the number of k objects other than object i that exhibit behavior k. [sent-140, score-0.201]
</p><p>50 In evaluating this expression, we have exploited the exchangeability of the IBP [9], which follows directly from the beta process construction [22]. [sent-141, score-0.291]
</p><p>51 To update fik given F −ik, we thus use the posterior ¯ of Eq. [sent-143, score-0.444]
</p><p>52 (10) to evaluate a MH proposal which ﬂips fik to the complement f of its current value f : ¯ ¯ ¯ fik ∼ ρ(f | f )δ(fik , f ) + (1 − ρ(f | f ))δ(fik , f ) (i)  ¯ ρ(f | f ) = min  ¯ p(fik = f | F −ik, y1:Ti , η (i), θ1:K −i , α) +  (i)  p(fik = f | F −ik, y1:Ti , η (i), θ1:K −i , α)  ,1 . [sent-144, score-0.835]
</p><p>53 (11)  +  To compute likelihoods, we combine fi and η (i) to construct feature-constrained transition distribu(i) tions πj as in Eq. [sent-145, score-0.249]
</p><p>54 An alternative approach is needed to resample the Poisson(α/N ) “unique” features associated only −i with object i. [sent-147, score-0.146]
</p><p>55 Let K+ = K+ + ni , where ni is the number of features unique to object i, and deﬁne f−i = fi,1:K −i and f+i = fi,K −i +1:K+ . [sent-148, score-0.396]
</p><p>56 The posterior distribution over ni is then given by +  p(ni |  +  (i) fi , y1:Ti , η (i), θ1:K −i , α) + α  ( α )ni e− N ∝ N ni ! [sent-149, score-0.397]
</p><p>57 (i)  p(y1:Ti | f−i , f+i = 1, η(i), η + , θ1:K −i , θ+ ) dB0 (θ + )dH(η + ), +  (12)  where H is the gamma prior on transition variables, θ + = θK −i +1:K+ are the parameters of unique +  (i)  −i features, and η + are transition parameters ηjk to or from unique features j, k ∈ {K+ + 1 : K+ }. [sent-150, score-0.467]
</p><p>58 [15] instead consider independent Metropolis proposals which replace the existing unique features by n′ ∼ Poisson(α/N ) new features, with corresponding parameters i θ′ drawn from the prior. [sent-154, score-0.185]
</p><p>59 For high-dimensional models like that considered in this paper, however, + moves proposing large numbers of unique features have low acceptance rates. [sent-155, score-0.17]
</p><p>60 Thus, mixing rates are greatly affected by the beta process hyperparameter α. [sent-156, score-0.33]
</p><p>61 We instead develop a “birth and death” reversible jump MCMC (RJMCMC) sampler [8], which proposes to either add a single new feature, 4  or eliminate one of the existing features in f+i . [sent-157, score-0.192]
</p><p>62 The feature proposal qf (· | ·) encodes the probabilities of birth and death moves: a new feature is created with probability 0. [sent-161, score-0.433]
</p><p>63 5, and each of the ni existing features is deleted with probability 0. [sent-162, score-0.164]
</p><p>64 For parameters, we deﬁne our proposal using the generative model: n  i ′ ′ b0 (θ+,ni +1 ) k=1 δθ+k (θ+k ), ′ δθ+k (θ+k ), k=ℓ  ′ qθ (θ′ | f+i , f+i , θ+ ) = +  birth of feature ni + 1; death of feature ℓ,  (14)  where b0 is the density associated with α−1 B0 . [sent-164, score-0.469]
</p><p>65 The distribution qη (· | ·) is deﬁned similarly, but using the gamma prior on transition variables of Eq. [sent-165, score-0.217]
</p><p>66 Because our birth and death proposals do not modify the values of existing i parameters, the Jacobian term normally arising in RJMCMC algorithms simply equals one. [sent-169, score-0.273]
</p><p>67 2 Sampling dynamic parameters and transition variables  Posterior updates to transition variables η (i) and shared dynamic parameters θk are greatly simpli(i) ﬁed if we instantiate the mode sequences z1:Ti for each object i. [sent-171, score-0.645]
</p><p>68 We treat these mode sequences as auxiliary variables: they are sampled given the current MCMC state, conditioned on when resampling model parameters, and then discarded for subsequent updates of feature assignments fi . [sent-172, score-0.353]
</p><p>69 ˜  zt−1  t  (17)  t  (i)  (i)  Because Dirichlet priors are conjugate to multinomial observations z1:T , the posterior of πj is (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  (i)  πj | fi , z1:T , γ, κ ∼ Dir([γ + nj1 , . [sent-174, score-0.263]
</p><p>70 Since the mode sequence z1:T is (i)  generated from feature-constrained transition distributions, njk is zero for any k such that fik = 0. [sent-182, score-0.614]
</p><p>71 5  (a) (b) Figure 2: (a) Observation sequences for each of 5 switching AR(1) time series colored by true mode sequence, and offset for clarity. [sent-202, score-0.279]
</p><p>72 (b) True feature matrix (top) of the ﬁve objects and estimated feature matrix (bottom) averaged over 10,000 MCMC samples taken from 100 trials every 10th sample. [sent-203, score-0.189]
</p><p>73 The estimated feature matrices are produced from mode sequences mapped to the ground truth labels according to the minimum Hamming distance metric, and selecting modes with more than 2% of the object’s observations. [sent-205, score-0.21]
</p><p>74 3 Sampling the beta process and Dirichlet transition hyperparameters We additionally place priors on the Dirichlet hyperparameters γ and κ, as well as the beta process parameter α. [sent-207, score-0.693]
</p><p>75 Each sub-step uses a gamma proposal distribution q(· | ·) with 2 2 ﬁxed variance σγ or σκ , and mean equal to the current hyperparameter value. [sent-214, score-0.19]
</p><p>76 5 Synthetic Experiments To test the ability of BP-AR-HMM to discover shared dynamics, we generated ﬁve time series that switched between AR(1) models (i) (i) (i) (i) (22) yt = az(i) yt−1 + et (zt ) t  with ak ∈ {−0. [sent-218, score-0.443]
</p><p>77 Comparing to the true feature matrix, we see that our model is indeed able to discover most of the underlying latent structure of the time series despite the challenging setting deﬁned by the close AR coefﬁcients. [sent-233, score-0.199]
</p><p>78 One might propose, as an alternative to the BP-AR-HMM, using an architecture based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process of [21]; speciﬁcally we could use the HDP-AR-HMMs of [5] tied together with a shared set of transition and dynamic parameters. [sent-234, score-0.337]

</p><p>82 These results reiterate that the feature model emphasizes choosing behaviors rather than assuming all objects are performing minor variations of the same dynamics. [sent-264, score-0.395]
</p><p>83 The gamma proposals used σγ = 1 and σκ = 100 while the MNIW prior was given M = 0, K = 0. [sent-266, score-0.192]
</p><p>84 At initialization, each time series was segmented into ﬁve contiguous blocks, with feature labels unique to that sequence. [sent-269, score-0.155]
</p><p>85 6 Motion Capture Experiments The linear dynamical system is a common model for describing simple human motion [11], and the more complicated SLDS has been successfully applied to the problem of human motion synthesis, classiﬁcation, and visual tracking [17, 18]. [sent-270, score-0.475]
</p><p>86 Other approaches develop non-linear dynamical models using Gaussian processes [25] or based on a collection of binary latent features [20]. [sent-271, score-0.404]
</p><p>87 However, there has been little effort in jointly segmenting and identifying common dynamic behaviors amongst a set of multiple motion capture (MoCap) recordings of people performing various tasks. [sent-272, score-0.53]

</p><p>89 Each of these routines used some combination of the following motion categories: running in place, jumping jacks, arm circles, side twists, knee raises, squats, punching, up and down, two variants of toe touches, arch over, and a reach out stretch. [sent-286, score-0.17]
</p><p>90 Although some behaviors are merged or split, the overall performance shows a clear ability to ﬁnd common motions. [sent-295, score-0.272]

<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin, Ruofei Zhang, Jianchang Mao</p><p>Abstract: Learning to rank is a relatively new ﬁeld of study, aiming to learn a ranking function from a set of training data with relevancy labels. The ranking algorithms are often evaluated using information retrieval measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [1] and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2]. Until recently, most learning to rank algorithms were not using a loss function related to the above mentioned evaluation measures. The main difﬁculty in direct optimization of these measures is that they depend on the ranks of documents, not the numerical values output by the ranking function. We propose a probabilistic framework that addresses this challenge by optimizing the expectation of NDCG over all the possible permutations of documents. A relaxation strategy is used to approximate the average of NDCG over the space of permutation, and a bound optimization approach is proposed to make the computation efﬁcient. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms on several benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.19367459 <a title="217-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Accelerated_Gradient_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization_and_Online_Learning.html">22 nips-2009-Accelerated Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization and Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chonghai Hu, Weike Pan, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Regularized risk minimization often involves non-smooth optimization, either because of the loss function (e.g., hinge loss) or the regularizer (e.g., ℓ1 -regularizer). Gradient methods, though highly scalable and easy to implement, are known to converge slowly. In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated gradient method for stochastic optimization while still preserving their computational simplicity and scalability. The proposed algorithm, called SAGE (Stochastic Accelerated GradiEnt), exhibits fast convergence rates on stochastic composite optimization with convex or strongly convex objectives. Experimental results show that SAGE is faster than recent (sub)gradient methods including FOLOS, SMIDAS and SCD. Moreover, SAGE can also be extended for online learning, resulting in a simple algorithm but with the best regret bounds currently known for these problems. 1</p><p>4 0.17466025 <a title="217-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Indian_Buffet_Processes_with_Power-law_Behavior.html">114 nips-2009-Indian Buffet Processes with Power-law Behavior</a></p>
<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Dilan Gorur</p><p>Abstract: The Indian buffet process (IBP) is an exchangeable distribution over binary matrices used in Bayesian nonparametric featural models. In this paper we propose a three-parameter generalization of the IBP exhibiting power-law behavior. We achieve this by generalizing the beta process (the de Finetti measure of the IBP) to the stable-beta process and deriving the IBP corresponding to it. We ﬁnd interesting relationships between the stable-beta process and the Pitman-Yor process (another stochastic process used in Bayesian nonparametric models with interesting power-law properties). We derive a stick-breaking construction for the stable-beta process, and ﬁnd that our power-law IBP is a good model for word occurrences in document corpora. 1</p><p>5 0.16417883 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>

Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features.

<p>Author: Vinayak Rao, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: Dependent Dirichlet processes (DPs) are dependent sets of random measures, each being marginally DP distributed. They are used in Bayesian nonparametric models when the usual exchangeability assumption does not hold. We propose a simple and general framework to construct dependent DPs by marginalizing and normalizing a single gamma process over an extended space. The result is a set of DPs, each associated with a point in a space such that neighbouring DPs are more dependent. We describe Markov chain Monte Carlo inference involving Gibbs sampling and three different Metropolis-Hastings proposals to speed up convergence. We report an empirical study of convergence on a synthetic dataset and demonstrate an application of the model to topic modeling through time. 1</p><p>6 0.49138558 <a title="217-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models_on_Decomposable_Graphs.html">40 nips-2009-Bayesian Nonparametric Models on Decomposable Graphs</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrew Frank, Padhraic Smyth, Alexander T. Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Since the development of loopy belief propagation, there has been considerable work on advancing the state of the art for approximate inference over distributions deﬁned on discrete random variables. Improvements include guarantees of convergence, approximations that are provably more accurate, and bounds on the results of exact inference. However, extending these methods to continuous-valued systems has lagged behind. While several methods have been developed to use belief propagation on systems with continuous values, recent advances for discrete variables have not as yet been incorporated. In this context we extend a recently proposed particle-based belief propagation algorithm to provide a general framework for adapting discrete message-passing algorithms to inference in continuous systems. The resulting algorithms behave similarly to their purely discrete counterparts, extending the beneﬁts of these more advanced inference techniques to the continuous domain. 1</p><p>4 0.72589499 <a title="217-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Neural_Implementation_of_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Inference_by_Importance_Sampling.html">162 nips-2009-Neural Implementation of Hierarchical Bayesian Inference by Importance Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The goal of perception is to infer the hidden states in the hierarchical process by which sensory data are generated. Human behavior is consistent with the optimal statistical solution to this problem in many tasks, including cue combination and orientation detection. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior is of particular importance, since probabilistic computations are notoriously challenging. Here we propose a simple mechanism for Bayesian inference which involves averaging over a few feature detection neurons which ﬁre at a rate determined by their similarity to a sensory stimulus. This mechanism is based on a Monte Carlo method known as importance sampling, commonly used in computer science and statistics. Moreover, a simple extension to recursive importance sampling can be used to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference. We identify a scheme for implementing importance sampling with spiking neurons, and show that this scheme can account for human behavior in cue combination and the oblique effect. 1</p><p>5 0.72275651 <a title="217-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models_on_Decomposable_Graphs.html">40 nips-2009-Bayesian Nonparametric Models on Decomposable Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Francois Caron, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: Over recent years Dirichlet processes and the associated Chinese restaurant process (CRP) have found many applications in clustering while the Indian buffet process (IBP) is increasingly used to describe latent feature models. These models are attractive because they ensure exchangeability (over samples). We propose here extensions of these models where the dependency between samples is given by a known decomposable graph. These models have appealing properties and can be easily learned using Monte Carlo techniques. 1 Motivation The CRP and IBP have found numerous applications in machine learning over recent years [5, 10]. We consider here the case where the data we are interested in are ‘locally’ dependent; these dependencies being represented by a known graph G where each data point/object is associated to a vertex. These local dependencies can correspond to any conceptual or real (e.g. space, time) metric. For example, in the context of clustering, we might want to propose a prior distribution on partitions enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to be in the same cluster. Similarly, in the context of latent feature models, we might be interested in a prior distribution on features enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to possess similar features. The ‘standard’ CRP and IBP correspond to the case where the graph G is complete; that is it is fully connected. In this paper, we generalize the CRP and IBP to decomposable graphs. The resulting generalized versions of the CRP and IBP enjoy attractive properties. Each clique of the graph follows marginally a CRP or an IBP process and explicit expressions for the joint prior distribution on the graph is available. It makes it easy to learn those models using straightforward generalizations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms proposed to perform inference for the CRP and IBP [5, 10, 14]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the popular Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and the Dirichlet Process (DP) partition distribution. We propose an extension of these two models to decomposable graphical models. In Section 3 we discuss nonparametric latent feature models, reviewing brieﬂy the construction in [5] and extending it to decomposable graphs. We demonstrate these models in Section 4 on two applications: an alternative to the hierarchical DP model [12] and a time-varying matrix factorization problem. 2 Prior distributions for partitions on decomposable graphs Assume we have n observations. When performing clustering, we associate to each of this observation an allocation variable zi ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K}. Let Πn be the partition of [n] = {1, . . . , n} deﬁned by the equivalence relation i ↔ j ⇔ zi = zj . The resulting partition Πn = {A1 , . . . , An(Πn ) } 1 is an unordered collection of disjoint non-empty subsets Aj of [n], j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), where ∪j Aj = [n] and n(Πn ) is the number of subsets for partition Πn . We also denote by Pn be the set of all partitions of [n] and let nj , j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), be the size of the subset Aj . Each allocation variable zi is associated to a vertex/site of an undirected graph G, which is assumed to be known. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we ﬁrst review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on z1:n , equivalently on Πn . We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs; see [2, 8] for an introduction to decomposable graphs. Finally we brieﬂy discuss the directed case. Note that the models proposed here are completely different from the hyper multinomial-Dirichlet in [2] and its recent DP extension [6]. 2.1 Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and DP partition distribution Assume for the time being that K is ﬁnite. When the graph is complete, a popular choice for the allocation variables is to consider a Dirichlet multinomial allocation model [11] θ θ , . . . , ), zi |π ∼ π (1) K K where D is the standard Dirichlet distribution and θ > 0. Integrating out π, we obtain the following Dirichlet multinomial prior distribution π ∼ D( Pr(z1:n ) = K j=1 Γ(θ) Γ(nj + θ K) (2) θ Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )K and then, using the straightforward equality Pr(Πn ) = PK where PK = {Πn ∈ Pn |n(Πn ) ≤ K}, we obtain K! (K−n(Πn ))! Pr(z1:n ) valid for for all Πn ∈ n(Π ) Pr(Πn ) = θ Γ(θ) j=1n Γ(nj + K ) K! . θ (K − n(Πn ))! Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )n(Πn ) (3) DP may be seen as a generalization of the Dirichlet multinomial model when the number of components K → ∞; see for example [10]. In this case the distribution over the partition Πn of [n] is given by [11] n(Π ) θn(Πn ) j=1n Γ(nj ) . (4) Pr(Πn ) = n i=1 (θ + i − 1) Let Π−k = {A1,−k , . . . , An(Π−k ),−k } be the partition induced by removing item k to Πn and nj,−k be the size of cluster j for j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ). It follows from (4) that an item k is assigned to an existing cluster j, j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to nj,−k / (n − 1 + θ) and forms a new cluster with probability θ/ (n − 1 + θ). This property is the basis of the CRP. We now extend the Dirichlet multinomial allocation and the DP partition distribution models to decomposable graphs. 2.2 Markov combination of Dirichlet multinomial and DP partition distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. It can be easily checked that if the marginal distribution of zC for each clique C ∈ C is deﬁned by (2) then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (2) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Dirichlet multinomial distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(zC ) S∈S Pr(zS ) C∈C Pr(z1:n ) = (5) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, we have Pr(zB ) given by (2). It follows that we have for any Πn ∈ PK Γ(θ) K! Pr(Πn ) = (K − n(Πn ))! C∈C Γ(θ) S∈S 2 K j=1 θ Γ(nj,C + K ) θ Γ(θ+nC )Γ( K )K K j=1 θ Γ(nj,S + K ) θ Γ(θ+nS )Γ( K )K (6) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items associated to cluster j, j = 1, . . . , K in B and nB is the total number of items in B. Within each complete set B, the allocation variables deﬁne a partition distributed according to the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We now extend this approach to DP partition distributions; that is we derive a joint distribution over Πn such that the distribution of ΠB over each complete set B of the graph is given by (4) with θ > 0. Such a distribution satisﬁes the consistency condition over the separators as the restriction of any partition distributed according to (4) still follows (4) [7]. G Proposition. Let Pn be the set of partitions Πn ∈ Pn such that for each decomposition A, B, and any (i, j) ∈ A × B, i ↔ j ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that k ↔ i ↔ j. As K → ∞, the prior distribution G over partitions (6) is given for each Πn ∈ Pn by Pr(Πn ) = θn(Πn ) n(ΠC ) Γ(nj,C ) j=1 nC i=1 (θ+i−1) n(ΠS ) Γ(nj,S ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 C∈C S∈S (7) where n(ΠB ) is the number of clusters in the complete set B. Proof. From (6), we have θ n(ΠC ) K(K − 1) . . . (K − n(Πn ) + 1) Pr(Πn ) = K C∈C n(ΠC )− S∈S n(ΠS ) C∈C θ n(ΠS ) S∈S n(ΠC ) θ Γ(nj,C + K ) j=1 nC (θ+i−1) i=1 n(ΠS ) θ Γ(nj,S + K ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 Thus when K → ∞, we obtain (7) if n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) and 0 otherwise. We have n(Πn ) ≤ C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) for any Πn ∈ Pn and the subset of Pn verifying G n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) corresponds to the set Pn . Example. Let the notation i ∼ j (resp. i j) indicates an edge (resp. no edge) between two sites. Let n = 3 and G be the decomposable graph deﬁned by the relations 1 ∼ 2, 2 ∼ 3 and 1 3. G The set P3 is then equal to {{{1, 2, 3}}; {{1, 2}, {3}}; {{1}, {2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}}}. Note that G the partition {{1, 3}, {2}} does not belong to P3 . Indeed, as there is no edge between 1 and 3, they cannot be in the same cluster if 2 is in another cluster. The cliques are C1 = {1, 2} and C2 = {2, 3} Pr(ΠC1 ) Pr(ΠC2 ) hence we can and the separator is S2 = {2}. The distribution is given by Pr(Π3 ) = Pr(ΠS ) 2 check that we obtain Pr({1, 2, 3}) = (θ + 1)−2 , Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = θ(θ + 1)−2 and Pr({1}, {2}, {3}) = θ2 (θ + 1)−2 . Let now deﬁne the full conditional distributions. Based on (7) the conditional assignment of an item k is proportional to the conditional over the cliques divided by the conditional over the separators. G Let denote G−k the undirected graph obtained by removing vertex k from G. Suppose that Πn ∈ Pn . G−k If Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , then do not change the value of item k. Otherwise, item k is assigned to cluster j / where j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ) with probability proportional to {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (8) and to a new cluster with probability proportional to θ, where n−k,j,C is the number of items in the set C \ {k} belonging to cluster j. The updating process is illustrated by the Chinese wedding party process1 in Fig. 1. The results of this section can be extended to the Pitman-Yor process, and more generally to species sampling models. Example (continuing). Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1}, A2 = {3}}, we have −1 Pr( item 2 assigned to A1 = {1}| Π−2 ) = Pr( item 2 assigned to A2 = {3}| Π−2 ) = (θ + 2) −1 and Pr( item 2 assigned to new cluster A3 | Π−2 ) = θ (θ + 2) . Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1, 3}}, item 2 is assigned to A1 with probability 1. 1 Note that this representation describes the full conditionals while the CRP represents the sequential updat- ing. 3 (a) (b) (d) (c) (e) Figure 1: Chinese wedding party. Consider a group of n guests attending a wedding party. Each of the n guests may belong to one or several cliques, i.e. maximal groups of people such that everybody knows everybody. The belonging of each guest to the different cliques is represented by color patches on the ﬁgures, and the graphical representation of the relationship between the guests is represented by the graphical model (e). (a) Suppose that the guests are already seated such that two guests cannot be together at the same table is they are not part of the same clique, or if there does not exist a group of other guests such that they are related (“Any friend of yours is a friend of mine”). (b) The guest number k leaves his table and either (c) joins a table where there are guests from the same clique as him, with probability proportional to the product of the number of guests from each clique over the product of the number of guests belonging to several cliques on that table or (d) he joins a new table with probability proportional to θ. 2.3 Monte Carlo inference 2.3.1 MCMC algorithm Using the full conditionals, a single site Gibbs sampler can easily be designed to approximate the posterior distribution Pr(Πn |z1:n ). Given a partition Πn , an item k is taken out of the partition. If G−k Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , item k keeps the same value. Otherwise, the item will be assigned to a cluster j, / j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to p(z{k}∪Aj,−k ) × p(zAj,−k ) {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (9) and the item will be assigned to a new cluster with probability proportional to p(z{k} ) × θ. Similarly to [3], we can also deﬁne a procedure to sample from p(θ|n(Πn ) = k)). We assume that θ ∼ G(a, b) and use p auxiliary variables x1 , . . . , xp . The procedure is as follows. • For j = 1, . . . , p, sample xj |k, θ ∼ Beta(θ + nSj , nCj − nSj ) • Sample θ|k, x1:p ∼ G(a + k, b − j log xj ) 2.3.2 Sequential Monte Carlo We have so far only treated the case of an undirected decomposable graph G. We can formulate a sequential updating rule for the corresponding perfect directed version D of G. Indeed, let (a1 , . . . a|V | ) be a perfect ordering and pa(ak ) be the set of parents of ak which is by deﬁnition complete. Let Πk−1 = {A1,k−1 , . . . , An(Πk−1 ),k−1 } denote the partition of the ﬁrst k−1 vertices a1:k−1 and let nj,pa(ak ) be the number of elements with value j in the set pa(ak ), j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ). Then the vertex ak joins the set j with probability nj,pa(ak ) / θ + cluster with probability θ/ θ + q q nq,pa(ak ) and creates a new nq,pa(ak ) . One can then design a particle ﬁlter/SMC method in a similar fashion as [4]. Consider a set of (i) (i) (i) (i) N N particles Πk−1 with weights wk−1 ∝ Pr(Πk−1 , z1:k−1 ) ( i=1 wk−1 = 1) that approximate (i) the posterior distribution Pr(Πk−1 |z1:k−1 ). For each particle i, there are n(Πk−1 ) + 1 possible 4 (i,j) allocations for component ak . We denote Πk the partition obtained by associating component ak (i,j) to cluster j. The weight associated to Πk is given by  nj,pa(ak ) (i)  if j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ) θ+ q nq,pa(ak ) (i,j) (i) p(z{ak }∪Aj,k−1 ) wk−1 = wk−1 × (10) (i) θ  θ+ n p(zAj,k−1 ) if j = n(Πk−1 ) + 1 q q,pa(ak ) (i,j) Then we can perform a deterministic resampling step by keeping the N particles Πk with highest (i,j) (i) (i) weights wk−1 . Let Πk be the resampled particles and wk the associated normalized weights. 3 Prior distributions for inﬁnite binary matrices on decomposable graphs Assume we have n objects; each of these objects being associated to the vertex of a graph G. To K each object is associated a K-dimensional binary vector zn = (zn,1 , . . . , zn,K ) ∈ {0, 1} where zn,i = 1 if object n possesses feature i and zn,i = 0 otherwise. These vectors zt form a binary n × K matrix denoted Z1:n . We denote by ξ1:n the associated equivalence class of left-ordered matrices and let EK be the set of left-ordered matrices with at most K features. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on Z1:n , equivalently on ξ1:n : the Beta-Bernoulli model and the IBP [5]. We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs. This can be used for example to deﬁne a time-varying IBP as illustrated in Section 4. 3.1 Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions The Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the allocation Z1:n is K Pr(Z1:n ) = α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) α K Γ(nj j=1 (11) where nj is the number of objects having feature j. It follows that Pr(ξ1:n ) = K K! 2n −1 h=0 α K Γ(nj α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) Kh ! j=1 (12) where Kh is the number of features possessing the history h (see [5] for details). The nonparametric model is obtained by taking the limit when K → ∞ Pr(ξ1:n ) = αK K+ + 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! exp(−αHn ) where K + is the total number of features and Hn = 3.2 (n − nj )!(nj − 1)! n! j=1 n 1 k=1 k . (13) The IBP follows from (13). Markov combination of Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. As in the Dirichlet-multinomial case, it is easily seen that if for each clique C ∈ C, the marginal distribution is deﬁned by (11), then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (11) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(ZC ) S∈S Pr(ZS ) C∈C Pr(Z1:n ) = (14) where Pr(ZB ) given by (11) for each complete set B ⊆ G. The prior over ξ1:n is thus given, for ξ1:n ∈ EK , by Pr(ξ1:n ) = K! 2n −1 h=0 Kh ! α K α Γ(nj,C + K )Γ(nC −nj,C +1) α Γ(nC +1+ K ) α α Γ(nj,S + K )Γ(nS −nj,S +1) K K α j=1 Γ(nS +1+ K ) K j=1 C∈C S∈S 5 (15) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items having feature j, j = 1, . . . , K in the set B and nB is the whole set of objects in set B. Taking the limit when K → ∞, we obtain after a few calculations Pr(ξ1:n ) = α + K[n] exp [−α ( C HnC − 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! HnS )] × C∈C + KC (nC −nj,C )!(nj,C −1)! j=1 nC ! S∈S S + KS (nS −nj,S )!(nj,S −1)! j=1 nS ! + + + + if K[n] = C KC − S KS and 0 otherwise, where KB is the number of different features possessed by objects in B. G Let En be the subset of En such that for each decomposition A, B and any (u, v) ∈ A × B: {u and v possess feature j} ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that {k possesses feature j}. Let ξ−k be the left-ordered + matrix obtained by removing object k from ξn and K−k be the total number of different features in G−k + ξ−k . For each feature j = 1, . . . , K−k , if ξ−k ∈ En−1 then we have   b C∈C nj,C if i = 1 S∈C nj,S Pr(ξk,j = i) = (16)  b C∈C (nC −nj,C ) if i = 0 (nS −nj,S ) S∈C nS where b is the appropriate normalizing constant then the customer k tries Poisson α {S∈S|k∈S} nC {C∈C|k∈C} new dishes. We can easily generalize this construction to a directed version D of G using arguments similar to those presented in Section 2; see Section 4 for an application to time-varying matrix factorization. 4 4.1 Applications Sharing clusters among relative groups: An alternative to HDP Consider that we are given d groups with nj data yi,j in each group, i = 1, . . . , nj , j = 1, . . . , d. We consider latent cluster variables zi,j that deﬁne the partition of the data. We will use alternatively the notation θi,j = Uzi,j in the following. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process [12] (HDP) is a very popular model for sharing clusters among related groups. It is based on a hierarchy of DPs G0 ∼ DP (γ, H), Gj |G0 ∼ DP (α, G0 ) j = 1, . . . d θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj . Under conjugacy assumptions, G0 , Gj and U can be integrated out and we can approximate the marginal posterior of (zi,j ) given y = (yi,j ) with Gibbs sampling using the Chinese restaurant franchise to sample from the full conditional p(zi,j |z−{i,j} , y). Using the graph formulation deﬁned in Section 2, we propose an alternative to HDP. Let θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N be N auxiliary variables belonging to what we call group 0. We deﬁne each clique Cj (j = 1, . . . , d) to be composed of elements from group j and elements from group 0. This deﬁnes a decomposable graphical model whose separator is given by the elements of group 0. We can rewrite the model in a way quite similar to HDP G0 ∼ DP (α, H), θ0,i |G0 ∼ G0 i = 1, ..., N α α Gj |θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N ∼ DP (α + N, α+N H + α+N θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj N i=1 δθ0,i ) j = 1, . . . d, N For any subset A and j = k ∈ {1, . . . , p} we have corr(Gj (A), Gk (A)) = α+N . Again, under conjugacy conditions, we can integrate out G0 , Gj and U and approximate the marginal posterior distribution over the partition using the Chinese wedding party process deﬁned in Section 2. Note that for latent variables zi,j , j = 1, . . . , d, associated to data, this is the usual CRP update. As in HDP, multiple layers can be added to the model. Figures 2 (a) and (b) resp. give the graphical DP alternative to HDP and 2-layer HDP. 6 z0 root z0 root corpora docs z1 z2 z1 z2 z3 z1,1 z1,2 z2,1 z2,2 z2,3 docs (a) Graphical DP alternative to HDP (b) Graphical DP alternative to 2-layer HDP Figure 2: Hierarchical Graphs of dependency with (a) one layer and (b) two layers of hierarchy. If N = 0, then Gj ∼ DP (α, H) for all j and this is equivalent to setting γ → ∞ in HDP. If N → ∞ then Gj = G0 for all j, G0 ∼ DP (α, H). This is equivalent to setting α → ∞ in the HDP. One interesting feature of the model is that, contrary to HDP, the marginal distribution of Gj at any layer of the tree is DP (α, H). As a consequence, the total number of clusters scales logarithmically (as in the usual DP) with the size of each group, whereas it scales doubly logarithmically in HDP. Contrary to HDP, there are at most N clusters shared between different groups. Our model is in that sense reminiscent of [9] where only a limited number of clusters can be shared. Note however that contrary to [9] we have a simple CRP-like process. The proposed methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the inﬁnite HMM [12]. The main issue of the proposed model is the setting of the number N of auxiliary parameters. Another issue is that to achieve high correlation, we need a large number of auxiliary variables. Nonetheless, the computational time used to sample from auxiliary variables is negligible compared to the time used for latent variables associated to data. Moreover, it can be easily parallelized. The model proposed offers a far richer framework and ensures that at each level of the tree, the marginal distribution of the partition is given by a DP partition model. 4.2 Time-varying matrix factorization Let X1:n be an observed matrix of dimension n × D. We want to ﬁnd a representation of this matrix in terms of two latent matrices Z1:n of dimension n × K and Y of dimension K × D. Here Z1:n 2 is a binary matrix whereas Y is a matrix of latent features. By assuming that Y ∼ N 0, σY IK×D and 2 X1:n = Z1:n Y + σX εn where εn ∼ N 0, σX In×D , we obtain p(X1:n |Z1:n ) ∝ −D/2 2 2 + Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn 1:n 1:n + (n−Kn )D σX exp − + Kn D σY 2 2 + where Σ−1 = I − Z+ Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn n 1:n 1:n 1:n −1 1 T −1 2 tr X1:n Σn X1:n 2σX (17) + Z+T , Kn the number of non-zero columns of 1:n + Z1:n and Z+ is the ﬁrst Kn columns of Z1:n . To avoid having to set K, [5, 14] assume that Z1:n 1:n follows an IBP. The resulting posterior distribution p(Z1:n |X1:n ) can be estimated through MCMC [5] or SMC [14]. We consider here a different model where the object Xt is assumed to arrive at time index t and we want a prior distribution on Z1:n ensuring that objects close in time are more likely to possess similar features. To achieve this, we consider the simple directed graphical model D of Fig. 3 where the site numbering corresponds to a time index in that case and a perfect numbering of D is (1, 2, . . .). The set of parents pa(t) is composed of the r preceding sites {{t − r}, . . . , {t − 1}}. The time-varying IBP to sample from p(Z1:n ) associated to this directed graph follows from (16) and proceeds as follows. At time t = 1 + new new • Sample K1 ∼Poisson(α), set z1,i = 1 for i = 1, ..., K1 and set K1 = Knew . At times t = 2, . . . , r n + new ∼Poisson( α ). • For k = 1, . . .

Using (17) and the prior distribution of Z1:n which can be sampled using the time-varying IBP described above, we can easily design an SMC method to sample from p(Z1:n |X1:n ). We do not detail it here. Note that contrary to [14], our algorithm does not require inverting a matrix whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the data but only a matrix of dimension r × r. In order to illustrate the model and SMC algorithm, we create 200 6 × 6 images using a ground truth Y consisting of 4 different 6 × 6 latent images. The 200 × 4 binary matrix was generated from Pr(zt,k = 1) = πt,k , where πt = ( .6 .5 0 0 ) if t = 1, . . . , 30, πt = ( .4 .8 .4 0 ) if t = 31, . . . , 50 and πt = ( 0 .3 .6 .6 ) if t = 51, . . . , 200. The order of the model is set to r = 50. The feature occurences Z1:n and true features Y and their estimates are represented in Figure 4. Two spurious features are detected by the model (features 2 and 5 on Fig. 3(c)) but quickly discarded (Fig. 4(d)). The algorithm is able to correctly estimate the varying prior occurences of the features over time.

[1] is a special case of the proposed model when G is given by Fig. 3. The bivariate DP of Walker and Muliere [13] is also a special case when G has only two cliques. In this paper, we have assumed that the structure of the graph was known beforehand and we have shown that many ﬂexible models arise from this framework. It would be interesting in the future to investigate the case where the graphical structure is unknown and must be estimated from the data.

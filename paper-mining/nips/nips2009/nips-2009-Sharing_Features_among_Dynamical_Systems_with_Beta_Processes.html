<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin, Ruofei Zhang, Jianchang Mao</p><p>Abstract: Learning to rank is a relatively new ﬁeld of study, aiming to learn a ranking function from a set of training data with relevancy labels. The ranking algorithms are often evaluated using information retrieval measures, such as Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) [1] and Mean Average Precision (MAP) [2]. Until recently, most learning to rank algorithms were not using a loss function related to the above mentioned evaluation measures. The main difﬁculty in direct optimization of these measures is that they depend on the ranks of documents, not the numerical values output by the ranking function. We propose a probabilistic framework that addresses this challenge by optimizing the expectation of NDCG over all the possible permutations of documents. A relaxation strategy is used to approximate the average of NDCG over the space of permutation, and a bound optimization approach is proposed to make the computation efﬁcient. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art ranking algorithms on several benchmark data sets. 1</p><p>3 0.22246712 <a title="217-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Accelerated_Gradient_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization_and_Online_Learning.html">22 nips-2009-Accelerated Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization and Online Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Chonghai Hu, Weike Pan, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Regularized risk minimization often involves non-smooth optimization, either because of the loss function (e.g., hinge loss) or the regularizer (e.g., ℓ1 -regularizer). Gradient methods, though highly scalable and easy to implement, are known to converge slowly. In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated gradient method for stochastic optimization while still preserving their computational simplicity and scalability. The proposed algorithm, called SAGE (Stochastic Accelerated GradiEnt), exhibits fast convergence rates on stochastic composite optimization with convex or strongly convex objectives. Experimental results show that SAGE is faster than recent (sub)gradient methods including FOLOS, SMIDAS and SCD. Moreover, SAGE can also be extended for online learning, resulting in a simple algorithm but with the best regret bounds currently known for these problems. 1</p><p>4 0.2077561 <a title="217-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>
<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A. Knowles</p><p>Abstract: Nonparametric Bayesian models provide a framework for ﬂexible probabilistic modelling of complex datasets. Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features. Our novel MCMC sampler divides a large data set between multiple processors and uses message passing to compute the global likelihoods and posteriors. This algorithm, the ﬁrst parallel inference scheme for IBP-based models, scales to datasets orders of magnitude larger than have previously been possible. 1</p><p>5 0.15021622 <a title="217-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-White_Functionals_for_Anomaly_Detection_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">257 nips-2009-White Functionals for Anomaly Detection in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Jean-philippe Vert, Alexandre D'aspremont</p><p>Abstract: We propose new methodologies to detect anomalies in discrete-time processes taking values in a probability space. These methods are based on the inference of functionals whose evaluations on successive states visited by the process are stationary and have low autocorrelations. Deviations from this behavior are used to ﬂag anomalies. The candidate functionals are estimated in a subspace of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space associated with the original probability space considered. We provide experimental results on simulated datasets which show that these techniques compare favorably with other algorithms.</p><p>6 0.1385645 <a title="217-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Indian_Buffet_Processes_with_Power-law_Behavior.html">114 nips-2009-Indian Buffet Processes with Power-law Behavior</a></p>

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Dilan Gorur</p><p>Abstract: The Indian buffet process (IBP) is an exchangeable distribution over binary matrices used in Bayesian nonparametric featural models. In this paper we propose a three-parameter generalization of the IBP exhibiting power-law behavior. We achieve this by generalizing the beta process (the de Finetti measure of the IBP) to the stable-beta process and deriving the IBP corresponding to it. We ﬁnd interesting relationships between the stable-beta process and the Pitman-Yor process (another stochastic process used in Bayesian nonparametric models with interesting power-law properties). We derive a stick-breaking construction for the stable-beta process, and ﬁnd that our power-law IBP is a good model for word occurrences in document corpora. 1</p><p>3 0.56458908 <a title="217-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>

<p>Author: Theodore J. Perkins</p><p>Abstract: Continuous-time Markov chains are used to model systems in which transitions between states as well as the time the system spends in each state are random. Many computational problems related to such chains have been solved, including determining state distributions as a function of time, parameter estimation, and control. However, the problem of inferring most likely trajectories, where a trajectory is a sequence of states as well as the amount of time spent in each state, appears unsolved. We study three versions of this problem: (i) an initial value problem, in which an initial state is given and we seek the most likely trajectory until a given ﬁnal time, (ii) a boundary value problem, in which initial and ﬁnal states and times are given, and we seek the most likely trajectory connecting them, and (iii) trajectory inference under partial observability, analogous to ﬁnding maximum likelihood trajectories for hidden Markov models. We show that maximum likelihood trajectories are not always well-deﬁned, and describe a polynomial time test for well-deﬁnedness. When well-deﬁnedness holds, we show that each of the three problems can be solved in polynomial time, and we develop efﬁcient dynamic programming algorithms for doing so. 1</p><p>5 0.5052824 <a title="217-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-An_Infinite_Factor_Model_Hierarchy_Via_a_Noisy-Or_Mechanism.html">29 nips-2009-An Infinite Factor Model Hierarchy Via a Noisy-Or Mechanism</a></p>
<p>Author: Douglas Eck, Yoshua Bengio, Aaron C. Courville</p><p>Abstract: The Indian Buffet Process is a Bayesian nonparametric approach that models objects as arising from an inﬁnite number of latent factors. Here we extend the latent factor model framework to two or more unbounded layers of latent factors. From a generative perspective, each layer deﬁnes a conditional factorial prior distribution over the binary latent variables of the layer below via a noisy-or mechanism. We explore the properties of the model with two empirical studies, one digit recognition task and one music tag data experiment. 1</p><p>6 0.48270506 <a title="217-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Accelerated_Gradient_Methods_for_Stochastic_Optimization_and_Online_Learning.html">22 nips-2009-Accelerated Gradient Methods for Stochastic Optimization and Online Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Massih Amini, Nicolas Usunier, Cyril Goutte</p><p>Abstract: We address the problem of learning classiﬁers when observations have multiple views, some of which may not be observed for all examples. We assume the existence of view generating functions which may complete the missing views in an approximate way. This situation corresponds for example to learning text classiﬁers from multilingual collections where documents are not available in all languages. In that case, Machine Translation (MT) systems may be used to translate each document in the missing languages. We derive a generalization error bound for classiﬁers learned on examples with multiple artiﬁcially created views. Our result uncovers a trade-off between the size of the training set, the number of views, and the quality of the view generating functions. As a consequence, we identify situations where it is more interesting to use multiple views for learning instead of classical single view learning. An extension of this framework is a natural way to leverage unlabeled multi-view data in semi-supervised learning. Experimental results on a subset of the Reuters RCV1/RCV2 collections support our ﬁndings by showing that additional views obtained from MT may signiﬁcantly improve the classiﬁcation performance in the cases identiﬁed by our trade-off. 1</p><p>2 0.88054156 <a title="217-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Ensemble_Nystrom_Method.html">81 nips-2009-Ensemble Nystrom Method</a></p>

We introduce a new family of algorithms based on mixtures of Nystr¨ m o approximations, ensemble Nystr¨ m algorithms, that yield more accurate low-rank o approximations than the standard Nystr¨ m method. We give a detailed study of o variants of these algorithms based on simple averaging, an exponential weight method, or regression-based methods. We also present a theoretical analysis of these algorithms, including novel error bounds guaranteeing a better convergence rate than the standard Nystr¨ m method.

<p>Author: Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: Markov random ﬁelds (MRF’s), or undirected graphical models, provide a powerful framework for modeling complex dependencies among random variables. Maximum likelihood learning in MRF’s is hard due to the presence of the global normalizing constant. In this paper we consider a class of stochastic approximation algorithms of the Robbins-Monro type that use Markov chain Monte Carlo to do approximate maximum likelihood learning. We show that using MCMC operators based on tempered transitions enables the stochastic approximation algorithm to better explore highly multimodal distributions, which considerably improves parameter estimates in large, densely-connected MRF’s. Our results on MNIST and NORB datasets demonstrate that we can successfully learn good generative models of high-dimensional, richly structured data that perform well on digit and object recognition tasks.</p><p>5 0.85925817 <a title="217-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_models_of_object_structure.html">133 nips-2009-Learning models of object structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Schlecht, Kobus Barnard</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach for learning stochastic geometric models of object categories from single view images. We focus here on models expressible as a spatially contiguous assemblage of blocks. Model topologies are learned across groups of images, and one or more such topologies is linked to an object category (e.g. chairs). Fitting learned topologies to an image can be used to identify the object class, as well as detail its geometry. The latter goes beyond labeling objects, as it provides the geometric structure of particular instances. We learn the models using joint statistical inference over category parameters, camera parameters, and instance parameters. These produce an image likelihood through a statistical imaging model. We use trans-dimensional sampling to explore topology hypotheses, and alternate between Metropolis-Hastings and stochastic dynamics to explore instance parameters. Experiments on images of furniture objects such as tables and chairs suggest that this is an effective approach for learning models that encode simple representations of category geometry and the statistics thereof, and support inferring both category and geometry on held out single view images. 1</p><p>6 0.85903537 <a title="217-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Exponential_Family_Graph_Matching_and_Ranking.html">87 nips-2009-Exponential Family Graph Matching and Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Garvesh Raskutti, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We study minimax rates for estimating high-dimensional nonparametric regression models with sparse additive structure and smoothness constraints. More precisely, our goal is to estimate a function f ∗ : Rp → R that has an additive decomposition of the form ∗ ∗ f ∗ (X1 , . . . , Xp ) = j∈S hj (Xj ), where each component function hj lies in some class H of “smooth” functions, and S ⊂ {1, . . . , p} is an unknown subset with cardinality s = |S|. Given n i.i.d. observations of f ∗ (X) corrupted with additive white Gaussian noise where the covariate vectors (X1 , X2 , X3 , ..., Xp ) are drawn with i.i.d. components from some distribution P, we determine lower bounds on the minimax rate for estimating the regression function with respect to squared-L2 (P) error. Our main result is a lower bound on the minimax rate that scales as max s log(p/s) , s ǫ2 (H) . The ﬁrst term reﬂects the sample size required for n n performing subset selection, and is independent of the function class H. The second term s ǫ2 (H) is an s-dimensional estimation term corresponding to the sample size required for n estimating a sum of s univariate functions, each chosen from the function class H. It depends linearly on the sparsity index s but is independent of the global dimension p. As a special case, if H corresponds to functions that are m-times differentiable (an mth -order Sobolev space), then the s-dimensional estimation term takes the form sǫ2 (H) ≍ s n−2m/(2m+1) . Either of n the two terms may be dominant in different regimes, depending on the relation between the sparsity and smoothness of the additive decomposition.</p><p>4 0.11078438 <a title="11-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Information-theoretic_lower_bounds_on_the_oracle_complexity_of_convex_optimization.html">116 nips-2009-Information-theoretic lower bounds on the oracle complexity of convex optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Alekh Agarwal, Martin J. Wainwright, Peter L. Bartlett, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: Despite a large literature on upper bounds on complexity of convex optimization, relatively less attention has been paid to the fundamental hardness of these problems. Given the extensive use of convex optimization in machine learning and statistics, gaining a understanding of these complexity-theoretic issues is important. In this paper, we study the complexity of stochastic convex optimization in an oracle model of computation. We improve upon known results and obtain tight minimax complexity estimates for various function classes. We also discuss implications of these results for the understanding the inherent complexity of large-scale learning and estimation problems. 1</p><p>5 0.10575379 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_a_Small_Mixture_of_Trees.html">129 nips-2009-Learning a Small Mixture of Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: M. P. Kumar, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating a given probability distribution using a simpler distribution plays an important role in several areas of machine learning, for example variational inference and classiﬁcation. Within this context, we consider the task of learning a mixture of tree distributions. Although mixtures of trees can be learned by minimizing the KL-divergence using an EM algorithm, its success depends heavily on the initialization. We propose an efﬁcient strategy for obtaining a good initial set of trees that attempts to cover the entire observed distribution by minimizing the α-divergence with α = ∞. We formulate the problem using the fractional covering framework and present a convergent sequential algorithm that only relies on solving a convex program at each iteration. Compared to previous methods, our approach results in a signiﬁcantly smaller mixture of trees that provides similar or better accuracies. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach by learning pictorial structures for face recognition.</p><p>6 0.09177243 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Sensitivity_analysis_in_HMMs_with_application_to_likelihood_maximization.html">215 nips-2009-Sensitivity analysis in HMMs with application to likelihood maximization</a></p>

<p>Author: Pierre-arnaud Coquelin, Romain Deguest, Rémi Munos</p><p>Abstract: This paper considers a sensitivity analysis in Hidden Markov Models with continuous state and observation spaces. We propose an Inﬁnitesimal Perturbation Analysis (IPA) on the ﬁltering distribution with respect to some parameters of the model. We describe a methodology for using any algorithm that estimates the ﬁltering density, such as Sequential Monte Carlo methods, to design an algorithm that estimates its gradient. The resulting IPA estimator is proven to be asymptotically unbiased, consistent and has computational complexity linear in the number of particles. We consider an application of this analysis to the problem of identifying unknown parameters of the model given a sequence of observations. We derive an IPA estimator for the gradient of the log-likelihood, which may be used in a gradient method for the purpose of likelihood maximization. We illustrate the method with several numerical experiments.</p><p>5 0.57791179 <a title="11-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Lower_bounds_on_minimax_rates_for_nonparametric_regression_with_additive_sparsity_and_smoothness.html">144 nips-2009-Lower bounds on minimax rates for nonparametric regression with additive sparsity and smoothness</a></p>

<p>Author: Siamac Fazli, Cristian Grozea, Marton Danoczy, Benjamin Blankertz, Florin Popescu, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: In the quest to make Brain Computer Interfacing (BCI) more usable, dry electrodes have emerged that get rid of the initial 30 minutes required for placing an electrode cap. Another time consuming step is the required individualized adaptation to the BCI user, which involves another 30 minutes calibration for assessing a subject’s brain signature. In this paper we aim to also remove this calibration proceedure from BCI setup time by means of machine learning. In particular, we harvest a large database of EEG BCI motor imagination recordings (83 subjects) for constructing a library of subject-speciﬁc spatio-temporal ﬁlters and derive a subject independent BCI classiﬁer. Our ofﬂine results indicate that BCI-na¨ve ı users could start real-time BCI use with no prior calibration at only a very moderate performance loss.</p><p>2 0.8056075 <a title="11-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Models_for_Unsupervised_Event_Coreference_Resolution.html">171 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Models for Unsupervised Event Coreference Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Ashish Kapoor, Eric Horvitz</p><p>Abstract: To date, the processes employed for active information acquisition during periods of learning and diagnosis have been considered as separate and have been applied in distinct phases of analysis. While active learning centers on the collection of information about training cases in order to build better predictive models, diagnosis uses ﬁxed predictive models for guiding the collection of observations about a speciﬁc test case at hand. We introduce a model and inferential methods that bridge these phases of analysis into a holistic approach to information acquisition that considers simultaneously the extension of the predictive model and the probing of a case at hand. The bridging of active learning and real-time diagnostic feature acquisition leads to a new class of policies for learning and diagnosis. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.77489221 <a title="11-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_General_Projection_Property_for_Distribution_Families.html">11 nips-2009-A General Projection Property for Distribution Families</a></p>

By combining our results with classic univariate inequalities, we provide new worst-case analyses for natural risk criteria arising in classiﬁcation, optimization, portfolio selection and Markov decision processes. 1</p><p>5 0.72810799 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-On_Stochastic_and_Worst-case_Models_for_Investing.html">178 nips-2009-On Stochastic and Worst-case Models for Investing</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>6 0.72189313 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-STDP_enables_spiking_neurons_to_detect_hidden_causes_of_their_inputs.html">210 nips-2009-STDP enables spiking neurons to detect hidden causes of their inputs</a></p>

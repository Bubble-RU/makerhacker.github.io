<p>Author: Chunxiao Zhou, Huixia J. Wang, Yongmei M. Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient moments-based permutation test approach to improve the test s computational efficiency by approximating the permutation distribution of the test statistic with Pearson distribution series. This approach involves the calculation of the first four moments of the permutation distribution. We propose a novel recursive method to derive these moments theoretically and analytically without any permutation. Experimental results using different test statistics are demonstrated using simulated data and real data. The proposed strategy takes advantage of nonparametric permutation tests and parametric Pearson distribution approximation to achieve both accuracy and efficiency. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n Permutation tests are flexible nonparametric alternatives to parametric tests in small samples, or when the distribution of a test statistic is unknown or mathematically intractable. In permutation tests, except exchangeability, no other statistical assumptions are required. The p-values can be obtained by using the permutation distribution. Permutation tests are appealing in many biomedical studies, which often have limited observations with unknown distribution. They have been used successfully in structural MR image analysis [1, 2, 3], in functional MR image analysis [4], and in 3D face analysis [5]. There are three common approaches to construct the permutation distribution [6, 7, 8]: (1) exact permutation enumerating all possible arrangements; (2) approximate permutation based on random sampling from all possible permutations; (3) approximate permutation using the analytical moments of the exact permutation distribution under the null hypothesis. The main disadvantage of the exact permutation is the computational cost, due to the factorial increase in the number of permutations with the increasing number of subjects. The second technique often gives inflated type I errors caused by random sampling. When a large number of repeated tests are needed, the random permutation strategy is also computationally expensive to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Regarding the third approach, the exact permutation distribution may not have moments or moments with tractability. In most applications, it is not the existence but the derivation of moments that limits the third approach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic and efficient way to derive the moments of the permutation distribution. Recently, Zhou [3] proposed a solution by converting the permutation of data to that of the statistic coefficients that are symmetric to the permutation. Since the test statistic coefficients usually have simple presentations, it is easier to track the permutation of the test statistic coefficients than that of data. However, this method requires the derivation of the permutation for each specific test statistic, which is not accessible to practical users. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy by employing a general theoretical method to derive the moments of the permutation distribution of any weighted v-statistics, for both univariate and multivariate data. We note that any moments of the permutation distribution for weighted v-statistics [9] can be considered as a summation of the product of data function term and index function term over a high dimensional index set and all possible permutations. Our key idea is to divide the whole index set into several permutation equivalent (see Definition 2) index subsets such that the summation of the data/index function term over all permutations is invariant within each subset and can be calculated without conducting any permutation. Then we can obtain the moments by summing up several subtotals. The proposed method can be extended to equivalent weighted v-statistics by replacing them with monotonic weighted v-statistics. This is due to the fact that only the order of test statistics of all permutations matters for obtaining the p-values, so that the monotonic weighted v-statistics shares the same p-value with the original test statistic. Given the first four moments, the permutation distribution can be well fitted by Pearson distribution series. The p-values are then obtained without conducting any real permutation. For multiple comparison of two-group difference, given the sample size n1 = 21 and n2 = 21, the number of tests m = 2,000, we need to conduct m×(n1 + n2 )!/n1 !/n2 ! 1.1×1015 permutations for the exact permutation test. Even for 20,000 random permutations per test, we still need m×20,000 4×107 permutations. Alternatively, our moments-based permutation method using Pearson distribution approximation only involves the calculation of the first four analytically-derived moments of exact permutation distributions to achieve high accuracy (see section 3). Instead of calculating test statistics in factorial scale with exact permutation, our moments-based permutation only requires computation of polynomial order. For example, the computational cost for univariate mean difference test statistic and modified multivariate Hotelling's T2 test statistics [8] are O(n) and O(n3 ), respectively, where n = n 1 + n2 . 2 M e t h o d o lo g y In this section, we shall mainly discuss how to calculate the moments of the permutation distribution for weighted v-statistics. For other test statistics, a possible solution is to replace them with their equivalent weighted v-statistics by monotonic transforms. The detailed discussion about equivalent test statistics can be found in [7, 8, 10]. 2.1 C o m p ut a t i o n a l c h a l l e n g e Let us first look at a toy example. Suppose we have a two-group univariate data x = ( x1 , L , xn1 , xn1 +1 ,L , xn1 + n2 ) , where the first n1 elements are in group A and the rest, n2 ,are in group B. For comparison of the two groups, the hypothesis is typically constructed as: H 0 : m A = mB vs. H a : m A ¹ m B , where m A , m B are the population means of the groups A n1 n i =1 i = n1 +1 and B, respectively. Define x A = å xi / n1 and xB = å xi / n2 as the sample means of two groups, where n=n1+n2. We choose the univariate group mean difference statistic, i.e., n T ( x) = x A - xB = å w(i ) xi , i =1 where the index function as the test w(i ) = 1/ n1 , if i Î {1, L , n1} and w(i ) = -1/ n2 , if i Î {n1 + 1, L, n} . Then the total number of all possible permutations of {1, L, n} is n!. To calculate the fourth moment of the permutation distribution, n n n n n 1 1 4 å ( å w(i ) xp (i ) ) = å å å å å w(i1 ) w(i2 ) w(i3 ) w(i4 )xp ( i1 ) xp ( i2 ) xp ( i3 ) xp ( i4 ) , n ! p ÎS n i =1 n ! p ÎS n i1 =1 i2 =1 i3 =1 i4 =1 where is the permutation operator and the symmetric group Sn [11] includes all distinct permutations. The above example shows that the moment calculation can be considered as a summation over all possible permutations and a large index set. It is noticeable that the computational challenge here is to go through the factorial level permutations and polynomial level indices. Ep (T 4 ( x ))= 2.2 P a r t i t i o n t h e i n de x s e t In this paper, we assume that the test statistic T can be expressed as a weighted v-statistic of n n i1 =1 id =1 degree d [9], that is, T ( x) = å L å w(i1 , L , id ) h( xi1 ,L , xid ) , where x = ( x1 , x 2 , L , x n ) T is a data with n observations, and w is a symmetric index function. h is a symmetric data function, i.e., invariant under permutation of (i1 ,L , id ) . Though the symmetry property is not required for our method, it helps reduce the computational cost. Here, each observation xk can be either univariate or multivariate. In the above toy example, d=1 and h is the identity function. Therefore, the r-th moment of the test statistic from the permutated data is: Ep (T r ( x)) = Ep ( å w(i1 ,L , id )h( xp (i1 ) ,L , xp ( id ) ))r i1 ,i2 ,L,id = Ep [ å i1(1) ,L, id (1) , r r k =1 k =1 { Õ w(i1(k ) ,L, id ( k ) ) Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L, xp (i ( k ) ) )}] . L i1( r ) ,L,id ( r ) d 1 Then we can exchange the summation order of permutations and that of indices, Ep (T r ( x)) = å i1(1) ,L, id (1) , L i1( r ) ,L,id ( r ) r r k =1 k =1 {( Õ w(i1( k ) ,L , id ( k ) )) Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L, xp (i ( k ) ) ))}. d 1 Thus any moment of permutation distribution can be considered as a summation of the product of data function term and index function term over a high dimensional index set and all possible permutations. Since all possible permutations map any index value between 1 and n to all possible index r values from 1 to n with equal probability, Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L , xp (i ( k ) ) )) , the summation of k =1 1 d data function over all permutations is only related to the equal/unequal relationship among indices. It is natural to divide the whole index set U = {i1 ,L , id }r = {(i1(1) , L , id (1) ), L (r ) , ( i1 , L , id (r ) r )} into the union of disjoint index subsets, in which Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L , xp (i ( k ) ) )) k =1 1 d is invariant. Definition 1. Since h is a symmetric function, two index elements (i1 ,L , id ) and ( j1 ,L , jd ) are said to be equivalent if they are the same up to the order. For example, for d = 3, (1, 4, 5) = (1,5,4) = (4,1,5) = (4,5,1) = (5,1,4) = (5,4,1). Definition 2. Two indices {(i1(1) , L , id (1) ), L , (i1( r ) , L , id ( r ) )} and {( j1(1) , L , jd (1) ), L , ( j1( r ) , L , jd ( r ) )} are said to be permutation equivalent/ if there exists a permutation p Î Sn such that {(p (i1(1) ), L , p (id (1) )), L , (p (i1( r ) ), L , p (id ( r ) ))} = {( j1(1) , L , jd (1) ), L , ( j1( r ) , L , jd ( r ) )} .

<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ.

<p>Author: Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We show how to sequentially optimize magnetic resonance imaging measurement designs over stacks of neighbouring image slices, by performing convex variational inference on a large scale non-Gaussian linear dynamical system, tracking dominating directions of posterior covariance without imposing any factorization constraints. Our approach can be scaled up to high-resolution images by reductions to numerical mathematics primitives and parallelization on several levels.

<p>Author: Yi-hao Kao, Benjamin V. Roy, Xiang Yan</p><p>Abstract: When used to guide decisions, linear regression analysis typically involves estimation of regression coefﬁcients via ordinary least squares and their subsequent use to make decisions. When there are multiple response variables and features do not perfectly capture their relationships, it is beneﬁcial to account for the decision objective when computing regression coefﬁcients. Empirical optimization does so but sacriﬁces performance when features are well-chosen or training data are insufﬁcient. We propose directed regression, an efﬁcient algorithm that combines merits of ordinary least squares and empirical optimization. We demonstrate through a computational study that directed regression can generate signiﬁcant performance gains over either alternative. We also develop a theory that motivates the algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.054735988 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-fMRI-Based_Inter-Subject_Cortical_Alignment_Using_Functional_Connectivity.html">261 nips-2009-fMRI-Based Inter-Subject Cortical Alignment Using Functional Connectivity</a></p>

Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we develop an efficient moments-based permutation test approach to improve the test s computational efficiency by approximating the permutation distribution of the test statistic with Pearson distribution series. This approach involves the calculation of the first four moments of the permutation distribution. We propose a novel recursive method to derive these moments theoretically and analytically without any permutation. Experimental results using different test statistics are demonstrated using simulated data and real data. The proposed strategy takes advantage of nonparametric permutation tests and parametric Pearson distribution approximation to achieve both accuracy and efficiency. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n Permutation tests are flexible nonparametric alternatives to parametric tests in small samples, or when the distribution of a test statistic is unknown or mathematically intractable. In permutation tests, except exchangeability, no other statistical assumptions are required. The p-values can be obtained by using the permutation distribution. Permutation tests are appealing in many biomedical studies, which often have limited observations with unknown distribution. They have been used successfully in structural MR image analysis [1, 2, 3], in functional MR image analysis [4], and in 3D face analysis [5]. There are three common approaches to construct the permutation distribution [6, 7, 8]: (1) exact permutation enumerating all possible arrangements; (2) approximate permutation based on random sampling from all possible permutations; (3) approximate permutation using the analytical moments of the exact permutation distribution under the null hypothesis. The main disadvantage of the exact permutation is the computational cost, due to the factorial increase in the number of permutations with the increasing number of subjects. The second technique often gives inflated type I errors caused by random sampling. When a large number of repeated tests are needed, the random permutation strategy is also computationally expensive to achieve satisfactory accuracy. Regarding the third approach, the exact permutation distribution may not have moments or moments with tractability. In most applications, it is not the existence but the derivation of moments that limits the third approach. To the best of our knowledge, there is no systematic and efficient way to derive the moments of the permutation distribution. Recently, Zhou [3] proposed a solution by converting the permutation of data to that of the statistic coefficients that are symmetric to the permutation. Since the test statistic coefficients usually have simple presentations, it is easier to track the permutation of the test statistic coefficients than that of data. However, this method requires the derivation of the permutation for each specific test statistic, which is not accessible to practical users. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy by employing a general theoretical method to derive the moments of the permutation distribution of any weighted v-statistics, for both univariate and multivariate data. We note that any moments of the permutation distribution for weighted v-statistics [9] can be considered as a summation of the product of data function term and index function term over a high dimensional index set and all possible permutations. Our key idea is to divide the whole index set into several permutation equivalent (see Definition 2) index subsets such that the summation of the data/index function term over all permutations is invariant within each subset and can be calculated without conducting any permutation. Then we can obtain the moments by summing up several subtotals. The proposed method can be extended to equivalent weighted v-statistics by replacing them with monotonic weighted v-statistics. This is due to the fact that only the order of test statistics of all permutations matters for obtaining the p-values, so that the monotonic weighted v-statistics shares the same p-value with the original test statistic. Given the first four moments, the permutation distribution can be well fitted by Pearson distribution series. The p-values are then obtained without conducting any real permutation. For multiple comparison of two-group difference, given the sample size n1 = 21 and n2 = 21, the number of tests m = 2,000, we need to conduct m×(n1 + n2 )!/n1 !/n2 ! 1.1×1015 permutations for the exact permutation test. Even for 20,000 random permutations per test, we still need m×20,000 4×107 permutations. Alternatively, our moments-based permutation method using Pearson distribution approximation only involves the calculation of the first four analytically-derived moments of exact permutation distributions to achieve high accuracy (see section 3). Instead of calculating test statistics in factorial scale with exact permutation, our moments-based permutation only requires computation of polynomial order. For example, the computational cost for univariate mean difference test statistic and modified multivariate Hotelling's T2 test statistics [8] are O(n) and O(n3 ), respectively, where n = n 1 + n2 . 2 M e t h o d o lo g y In this section, we shall mainly discuss how to calculate the moments of the permutation distribution for weighted v-statistics. For other test statistics, a possible solution is to replace them with their equivalent weighted v-statistics by monotonic transforms. The detailed discussion about equivalent test statistics can be found in [7, 8, 10]. 2.1 C o m p ut a t i o n a l c h a l l e n g e Let us first look at a toy example. Suppose we have a two-group univariate data x = ( x1 , L , xn1 , xn1 +1 ,L , xn1 + n2 ) , where the first n1 elements are in group A and the rest, n2 ,are in group B. For comparison of the two groups, the hypothesis is typically constructed as: H 0 : m A = mB vs. H a : m A ¹ m B , where m A , m B are the population means of the groups A n1 n i =1 i = n1 +1 and B, respectively. Define x A = å xi / n1 and xB = å xi / n2 as the sample means of two groups, where n=n1+n2. We choose the univariate group mean difference statistic, i.e., n T ( x) = x A - xB = å w(i ) xi , i =1 where the index function as the test w(i ) = 1/ n1 , if i Î {1, L , n1} and w(i ) = -1/ n2 , if i Î {n1 + 1, L, n} . Then the total number of all possible permutations of {1, L, n} is n!. To calculate the fourth moment of the permutation distribution, n n n n n 1 1 4 å ( å w(i ) xp (i ) ) = å å å å å w(i1 ) w(i2 ) w(i3 ) w(i4 )xp ( i1 ) xp ( i2 ) xp ( i3 ) xp ( i4 ) , n ! p ÎS n i =1 n ! p ÎS n i1 =1 i2 =1 i3 =1 i4 =1 where is the permutation operator and the symmetric group Sn [11] includes all distinct permutations. The above example shows that the moment calculation can be considered as a summation over all possible permutations and a large index set. It is noticeable that the computational challenge here is to go through the factorial level permutations and polynomial level indices. Ep (T 4 ( x ))= 2.2 P a r t i t i o n t h e i n de x s e t In this paper, we assume that the test statistic T can be expressed as a weighted v-statistic of n n i1 =1 id =1 degree d [9], that is, T ( x) = å L å w(i1 , L , id ) h( xi1 ,L , xid ) , where x = ( x1 , x 2 , L , x n ) T is a data with n observations, and w is a symmetric index function. h is a symmetric data function, i.e., invariant under permutation of (i1 ,L , id ) . Though the symmetry property is not required for our method, it helps reduce the computational cost. Here, each observation xk can be either univariate or multivariate. In the above toy example, d=1 and h is the identity function. Therefore, the r-th moment of the test statistic from the permutated data is: Ep (T r ( x)) = Ep ( å w(i1 ,L , id )h( xp (i1 ) ,L , xp ( id ) ))r i1 ,i2 ,L,id = Ep [ å i1(1) ,L, id (1) , r r k =1 k =1 { Õ w(i1(k ) ,L, id ( k ) ) Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L, xp (i ( k ) ) )}] . L i1( r ) ,L,id ( r ) d 1 Then we can exchange the summation order of permutations and that of indices, Ep (T r ( x)) = å i1(1) ,L, id (1) , L i1( r ) ,L,id ( r ) r r k =1 k =1 {( Õ w(i1( k ) ,L , id ( k ) )) Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L, xp (i ( k ) ) ))}. d 1 Thus any moment of permutation distribution can be considered as a summation of the product of data function term and index function term over a high dimensional index set and all possible permutations. Since all possible permutations map any index value between 1 and n to all possible index r values from 1 to n with equal probability, Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L , xp (i ( k ) ) )) , the summation of k =1 1 d data function over all permutations is only related to the equal/unequal relationship among indices. It is natural to divide the whole index set U = {i1 ,L , id }r = {(i1(1) , L , id (1) ), L (r ) , ( i1 , L , id (r ) r )} into the union of disjoint index subsets, in which Ep ( Õ h( xp (i ( k ) ) ,L , xp (i ( k ) ) )) k =1 1 d is invariant. Definition 1. Since h is a symmetric function, two index elements (i1 ,L , id ) and ( j1 ,L , jd ) are said to be equivalent if they are the same up to the order. For example, for d = 3, (1, 4, 5) = (1,5,4) = (4,1,5) = (4,5,1) = (5,1,4) = (5,4,1). Definition 2. Two indices {(i1(1) , L , id (1) ), L , (i1( r ) , L , id ( r ) )} and {( j1(1) , L , jd (1) ), L , ( j1( r ) , L , jd ( r ) )} are said to be permutation equivalent/ if there exists a permutation p Î Sn such that {(p (i1(1) ), L , p (id (1) )), L , (p (i1( r ) ), L , p (id ( r ) ))} = {( j1(1) , L , jd (1) ), L , ( j1( r ) , L , jd ( r ) )} .

<p>Author: Jonathan Huang, Carlos Guestrin</p><p>Abstract: Representing distributions over permutations can be a daunting task due to the fact that the number of permutations of n objects scales factorially in n. One recent way that has been used to reduce storage complexity has been to exploit probabilistic independence, but as we argue, full independence assumptions impose strong sparsity constraints on distributions and are unsuitable for modeling rankings. We identify a novel class of independence structures, called rifﬂed independence, which encompasses a more expressive family of distributions while retaining many of the properties necessary for performing efﬁcient inference and reducing sample complexity. In rifﬂed independence, one draws two permutations independently, then performs the rifﬂe shufﬂe, common in card games, to combine the two permutations to form a single permutation. In ranking, rifﬂed independence corresponds to ranking disjoint sets of objects independently, then interleaving those rankings. We provide a formal introduction and present algorithms for using rifﬂed independence within Fourier-theoretic frameworks which have been explored by a number of recent papers. 1</p><p>4 0.41698217 <a title="7-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Statistical_Consistency_of_Top-k_Ranking.html">230 nips-2009-Statistical Consistency of Top-k Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Fen Xia, Tie-yan Liu, Hang Li</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with the consistency analysis on listwise ranking methods. Among various ranking methods, the listwise methods have competitive performances on benchmark datasets and are regarded as one of the state-of-the-art approaches. Most listwise ranking methods manage to optimize ranking on the whole list (permutation) of objects, however, in practical applications such as information retrieval, correct ranking at the top k positions is much more important. This paper aims to analyze whether existing listwise ranking methods are statistically consistent in the top-k setting. For this purpose, we deﬁne a top-k ranking framework, where the true loss (and thus the risks) are deﬁned on the basis of top-k subgroup of permutations. This framework can include the permutationlevel ranking framework proposed in previous work as a special case. Based on the new framework, we derive sufﬁcient conditions for a listwise ranking method to be consistent with the top-k true loss, and show an effective way of modifying the surrogate loss functions in existing methods to satisfy these conditions. Experimental results show that after the modiﬁcations, the methods can work signiﬁcantly better than their original versions. 1</p><p>5 0.38773254 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Construction_of_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Models_from_Parametric_Bayes_Equations.html">59 nips-2009-Construction of Nonparametric Bayesian Models from Parametric Bayes Equations</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Orbanz</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of constructing nonparametric Bayesian models on inﬁnite-dimensional random objects, such as functions, inﬁnite graphs or inﬁnite permutations. The problem has generated much interest in machine learning, where it is treated heuristically, but has not been studied in full generality in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, which tends to focus on models over probability distributions. Our approach applies a standard tool of stochastic process theory, the construction of stochastic processes from their ﬁnite-dimensional marginal distributions. The main contribution of the paper is a generalization of the classic Kolmogorov extension theorem to conditional probabilities. This extension allows a rigorous construction of nonparametric Bayesian models from systems of ﬁnitedimensional, parametric Bayes equations. Using this approach, we show (i) how existence of a conjugate posterior for the nonparametric model can be guaranteed by choosing conjugate ﬁnite-dimensional models in the construction, (ii) how the mapping to the posterior parameters of the nonparametric model can be explicitly determined, and (iii) that the construction of conjugate models in essence requires the ﬁnite-dimensional models to be in the exponential family. As an application of our constructive framework, we derive a model on inﬁnite permutations, the nonparametric Bayesian analogue of a model recently proposed for the analysis of rank data. 1</p><p>6 0.37594816 <a title="7-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-The_Wisdom_of_Crowds_in_the_Recollection_of_Order_Information.html">244 nips-2009-The Wisdom of Crowds in the Recollection of Order Information</a></p>

This problem is central to areas within operations research, marketing and econometrics.

<p>Author: Marcel V. Gerven, Botond Cseke, Robert Oostenveld, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the speciﬁcation of constraints between and within sources. We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efﬁcient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior. 1</p><p>3 0.57048315 <a title="7-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Honglak Lee, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classiﬁer. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We ﬁnd that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We ﬁnd that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of “deep” vs. “shallower” representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.56933224 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Slow_Learners_are_Fast.html">220 nips-2009-Slow Learners are Fast</a></p>

Our approach can be scaled up to high-resolution images by reductions to numerical mathematics primitives and parallelization on several levels. In a ﬁrst study, designs are found that improve signiﬁcantly on others chosen independently for each slice or drawn at random. 1</p><p>6 0.56752622 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Beyond_Convexity%3A_Online_Submodular_Minimization.html">45 nips-2009-Beyond Convexity: Online Submodular Minimization</a></p>

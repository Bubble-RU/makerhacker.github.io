<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Alyosha Efros, Josef Sivic, Bill Freeman, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how, given an image, similar images sharing the same global description can help with unsupervised scene segmentation. In contrast to recent work in semantic alignment of scenes, we allow an input image to be explained by partial matches of similar scenes. This allows for a better explanation of the input scenes. We perform MRF-based segmentation that optimizes over matches, while respecting boundary information. The recovered segments are then used to re-query a large database of images to retrieve better matches for the target regions. We show improved performance in detecting the principal occluding and contact boundaries for the scene over previous methods on data gathered from the LabelMe database.</p><p>3 0.14237568 <a title="149-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Region-based_Segmentation_and_Object_Detection.html">201 nips-2009-Region-based Segmentation and Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Gould, Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Object detection and multi-class image segmentation are two closely related tasks that can be greatly improved when solved jointly by feeding information from one task to the other [10, 11]. However, current state-of-the-art models use a separate representation for each task making joint inference clumsy and leaving the classiﬁcation of many parts of the scene ambiguous. In this work, we propose a hierarchical region-based approach to joint object detection and image segmentation. Our approach simultaneously reasons about pixels, regions and objects in a coherent probabilistic model. Pixel appearance features allow us to perform well on classifying amorphous background classes, while the explicit representation of regions facilitate the computation of more sophisticated features necessary for object detection. Importantly, our model gives a single uniﬁed description of the scene—we explain every pixel in the image and enforce global consistency between all random variables in our model. We run experiments on the challenging Street Scene dataset [2] and show signiﬁcant improvement over state-of-the-art results for object detection accuracy. 1</p><p>4 0.11909499 <a title="149-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Learning_from_Neighboring_Strokes%3A_Combining_Appearance_and_Context_for_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition.html">131 nips-2009-Learning from Neighboring Strokes: Combining Appearance and Context for Multi-Domain Sketch Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Tat-jun Chin, Hanzi Wang, David Suter</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel and highly effective approach for multi-body motion segmentation. Drawing inspiration from robust statistical model ﬁtting, we estimate putative subspace hypotheses from the data. However, instead of ranking them we encapsulate the hypotheses in a novel Mercer kernel which elicits the potential of two point trajectories to have emerged from the same subspace. The kernel permits the application of well-established statistical learning methods for effective outlier rejection, automatic recovery of the number of motions and accurate segmentation of the point trajectories. The method operates well under severe outliers arising from spurious trajectories or mistracks. Detailed experiments on a recent benchmark dataset (Hopkins 155) show that our method is superior to other stateof-the-art approaches in terms of recovering the number of motions, segmentation accuracy, robustness against gross outliers and computational efﬁciency. 1 Introduction1 Multi-body motion segmentation concerns the separation of motions arising from multiple moving objects in a video sequence. The input data is usually a set of points on the surface of the objects which are tracked throughout the video sequence. Motion segmentation can serve as a useful preprocessing step for many computer vision applications. In recent years the case of rigid (i.e. nonarticulated) objects for which the motions could be semi-dependent on each other has received much attention [18, 14, 19, 21, 22, 17]. Under this domain the afﬁne projection model is usually adopted. Such a model implies that the point trajectories from a particular motion lie on a linear subspace of at most four, and trajectories from different motions lie on distinct subspaces. Thus multi-body motion segmentation is reduced to the problem of subspace segmentation or clustering. To realize practical algorithms, motion segmentation approaches should possess four desirable attributes: (1) Accuracy in classifying the point trajectories to the motions they respectively belong to. This is crucial for success in the subsequent vision applications, e.g. object recognition, 3D reconstruction. (2) Robustness against inlier noise (e.g. slight localization error) and gross outliers (e.g. mistracks, spurious trajectories), since getting imperfect data is almost always unavoidable in practical circumstances. (3) Ability to automatically deduce the number of motions in the data. This is pivotal to accomplish fully automated vision applications. (4) Computational efﬁciency. This is integral for the processing of video sequences which are usually large amounts of data. Recent work on multi-body motion segmentation can roughly be divided into algebraic or factorization methods [3, 19, 20], statistical methods [17, 7, 14, 6, 10] and clustering methods [22, 21, 5]. Notable approaches include Generalized PCA (GPCA) [19, 20], an algebraic method based on the idea that one can ﬁt a union of m subspaces with a set of polynomials of degree m. Statistical methods often employ concepts such random hypothesis generation [4, 17], Expectation-Maximization [14, 6] 1 This work was supported by the Australian Research Council (ARC) under the project DP0878801. 1 and geometric model selection [7, 8]. Clustering based methods [22, 21, 5] are also gaining attention due to their effectiveness. They usually include a dimensionality reduction step (e.g. manifold learning [5]) followed by a clustering of the point trajectories (e.g. via spectral clustering in [21]). A recent benchmark [18] indicated that Local Subspace Afﬁnity (LSA) [21] gave the best performance in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy, although their result was subsequently surpassed by [5, 10]. However, we argue that most of the previous approaches do not simultaneously fulﬁl the qualities desirable of motion segmentation algorithms. Most notably, although some of the approaches have the means to estimate the number of motions, they are generally unreliable in this respect and require manual input of this parameter. In fact this prior knowledge was given to all the methods compared in [18]2 . Secondly, most of the methods (e.g. [19, 5]) do not explicitly deal with outliers. They will almost always breakdown when given corrupted data. These deﬁciencies reduce the usefulness of available motion segmentation algorithms in practical circumstances. In this paper we attempt to bridge the gap between experimental performance and practical usability. Our previous work [2] indicates that robust multi-structure model ﬁtting can be achieved effectively with statistical learning. Here we extend this concept to motion subspace clustering. Drawing inspiration from robust statistical model ﬁtting [4], we estimate random hypotheses of motion subspaces in the data. However, instead of ranking these hypotheses we encapsulate them in a novel Mercer kernel. The kernel can function reliably despite overwhelming sampling imbalance, and it permits the application of non-linear dimensionality reduction techniques to effectively identify and reject outlying trajectories. This is then followed by Kernel PCA [11] to maximize the separation between groups and spectral clustering [13] to recover the number of motions and clustering. Experiments on the Hopkins 155 benchmark dataset [18] show that our method is superior to other approaches in terms of the qualities described above, including computational efﬁciency. 1.1 Brief review of afﬁne model multi-body motion segmentation Let {tf p ∈ R2 }f =1,...,F be the set of 2D coordinates of P trajectories tracked across F frames. In p=1,...,P multi-body motion segmentation the tf p ’s correspond to points on the surface of rigid objects which are moving. The goal is to separate the trajectories into groups corresponding to the motion they belong to. In other words, if we arrange the coordinates in the following data matrix   t11 · · · t1P  . .  ∈ R2F ×P , .. .  T= . (1) . . . tF 1 . . . tF P the goal is to ﬁnd the permutation Γ ∈ RP ×P such that the columns of T · Γ are arranged according to the respective motions they belong to. It turns out that under afﬁne projection [1, 16] trajectories from the same motion lie on a distinct subspace in R2F , and each of these motion subspaces is of dimensions 2, 3 or 4. Thus motion segmentation can be accomplished via clustering subspaces in R2F . See [1, 16] for more details. Realistically actual motion sequences might contain trajectories which do not correspond to valid objects or motions. These trajectories behave as outliers in the data and, if not taken into account, can be seriously detrimental to subspace clustering algorithms. 2 The Ordered Residual Kernel (ORK) First, we take a statistical model ﬁtting point of view to motion segmentation. Let {xi }i=1,...,N be the set of N samples on which we want to perform model ﬁtting. We randomly draw p-subsets from the data and use it to ﬁt a hypothesis of the model, where p is the number of parameters that deﬁne the model. In motion segmentation, the xi ’s are the columns of matrix T, and p = 4 since the model is a four-dimensional subspace3 . Assume that M of such random hypotheses are drawn. i i For each data point xi compute its absolute residual set ri = {r1 , . . . , rM } as measured to the M hypotheses. For motion segmentation, the residual is the orthogonal distance to a hypothesis 2 As conﬁrmed through private contact with the authors of [18]. Ideally we should also consider degenerate motions with subspace dimensions 2 or 3, but previous work [18] using RANSAC [4] and our results suggest this is not a pressing issue for the Hopkins 155 dataset. 3 2 i i subspace. We sort the elements in ri to obtain the sorted residual set ˜i = {rλi , . . . , rλi }, where r 1 M i i the permutation {λi , . . . , λi } is obtained such that rλi ≤ · · · ≤ rλi . Deﬁne the following 1 M 1 M ˜ θi := {λi , . . . , λi } 1 M (2) ˜ as the sorted hypothesis set of point xi , i.e. θi depicts the order in which xi becomes the inlier of the M hypotheses as a ﬁctitious inlier threshold is increased from 0 to ∞. We deﬁne the Ordered Residual Kernel (ORK) between two data points as 1 kr (xi1 , xi2 ) := ˜ Z M/h t ˜ ˜ zt · k∩ (θi1 , θi2 ), (3) t=1 M/h where zt = 1 are the harmonic series and Z = t=1 zt is the (M/h)-th harmonic number. t Without lost of generality assume that M is wholly divisible by h. Step size h is used to obtain the Difference of Intersection Kernel (DOIK) 1 ˜1:α t ˜ ˜ ˜1:α ˜1:α ˜1:α k∩ (θi1 , θi2 ) := (|θi1 t ∩ θi2 t | − |θi1 t−1 ∩ θi2 t−1 |) (4) h ˜a:b where αt = t · h and αt−1 = (t − 1) · h. Symbol θi indicates the set formed by the a-th to ˜i . Since the contents of the sorted hypotheses set are merely permutations of the b-th elements of θ {1 . . . M }, i.e. there are no repeating elements, 0 ≤ kr (xi1 , xi2 ) ≤ 1. ˜ (5) Note that kr is independent of the type of model to be ﬁtted, thus it is applicable to generic statistical ˜ model ﬁtting problems. However, we concentrate on motion subspaces in this paper. Let τ be a ﬁctitious inlier threshold. The kernel kr captures the intuition that, if τ is low, two ˜ points arising from the same subspace will have high normalized intersection since they share many common hypotheses which correspond to that subspace. If τ is high, implausible hypotheses ﬁtted on outliers start to dominate and decrease the normalized intersection. Step size h allows us to quantify the rate of change of intersection if τ is increased from 0 to ∞, and since zt is decreasing, kr will evaluate to a high value for two points from the same subspace. In contrast, kr is always low ˜ ˜ for points not from the same subspace or that are outliers. Proof of satisfying Mercer’s condition. Let D be a ﬁxed domain, and P(D) be the power set of D, i.e. the set of all subsets of D. Let S ⊆ P(D), and p, q ∈ S. If µ is a measure on D, then k∩ (p, q) = µ(p ∩ q), (6) called the intersection kernel, is provably a valid Mercer kernel [12]. The DOIK can be rewritten as t ˜ ˜ k∩ (θi1 , θi2 ) = 1 ˜(αt−1 +1):αt ˜(αt−1 +1):αt (|θ ∩ θi2 | h i1 ˜1:(α ) ˜(α +1):αt | + |θ (αt−1 +1):αt ∩ θ 1:(αt−1 ) |). ˜ ˜ +|θi1 t−1 ∩ θi2 t−1 i1 i2 (7) If we let D = {1 . . . M } be the set of all possible hypothesis indices and µ be uniform on D, each term in Eq. (7) is simply an intersection kernel multiplied by |D|/h. Since multiplying a kernel with a positive constant and adding two kernels respectively produce valid Mercer kernels [12], the DOIK and ORK are also valid Mercer kernels.• Parameter h in kr depends on the number of random hypotheses M , i.e. step size h can be set as a ˜ ratio of M . The value of M can be determined based on the size of the p-subset and the size of the data N (e.g. [23, 15]), and thus h is not contingent on knowledge of the true inlier noise scale or threshold. Moreover, our experiments in Sec. 4 show that segmentation performance is relatively insensitive to the settings of h and M . 2.1 Performance under sampling imbalance Methods based on random sampling (e.g. RANSAC [4]) are usually affected by unbalanced datasets. The probability of simultaneously retrieving p inliers from a particular structure is tiny if points 3 from that structure represent only a small minority in the data. In an unbalanced dataset the “pure” p-subsets in the M randomly drawn samples will be dominated by points from the majority structure in the data. This is a pronounced problem in motion sequences, since there is usually a background “object” whose point trajectories form a large majority in the data. In fact, for motion sequences from the Hopkins 155 dataset [18] with typically about 300 points per sequence, M has to be raised to about 20,000 before a pure p-subset from the non-background objects is sampled. However, ORK can function reliably despite serious sampling imbalance. This is because points from the same subspace are roughly equi-distance to the sampled hypotheses in their vicinity, even though these hypotheses might not pass through that subspace. Moreover, since zt in Eq. (3) is decreasing only residuals/hypotheses in the vicinity of a point are heavily weighted in the intersection. Fig. 1(a) illustrates this condition. Results in Sec. 4 show that ORK excelled even with M = 1, 000. (a) Data in R2F . (b) Data in RKHS Fkr . ˜ Figure 1: (a) ORK under sampling imbalance. (b) Data in RKHS induced by ORK. 3 Multi-Body Motion Segmentation using ORK In this section, we describe how ORK is used for multi-body motion segmentation. 3.1 Outlier rejection via non-linear dimensionality reduction Denote by Fkr the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) induced by kr . Let matrix A = ˜ ˜ [φ(x1 ) . . . φ(xN )] contain the input data after it is mapped to Fkr . The kernel matrix K = AT A is ˜ computed using the kernel function kr as ˜ Kp,q = φ(xp ), φ(xq ) = kr (xp , xq ), p, q ∈ {1 . . . N }. ˜ (8) Since kr is a valid Mercer kernel, K is guaranteed to be positive semi-deﬁnite [12]. Let K = ˜ Q∆QT be the eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) of K. Then the rank-n Kernel Singular Value Decomposition (Kernel SVD) [12] of A is 1 1 An = [AQn (∆n )− 2 ][(∆n ) 2 ][(Qn )T ] ≡ Un Σn (Vn )T . n n (9) n Via the Matlab notation, Q = Q:,1:n and ∆ = ∆1:n,1:n . The left singular vectors U is an orthonormal basis for the n-dimensional principal subspace of the whole dataset in Fkr . Projecting ˜ the data onto the principal subspace yields 1 1 B = [AQn (∆n )− 2 ]T A = (∆n ) 2 (Qn )T , (10) n×N where B = [b1 . . . bN ] ∈ R is the reduced dimension version of A. Directions of the principal subspace are dominated by inlier points, since kr evaluates to a high value generally for them, but ˜ always to a low value for gross outliers. Moreover the kernel ensures that points from the same subspace are mapped to the same cluster and vice versa. Fig. 1(b) illustrates this condition. Fig. 2(a)(left) shows the ﬁrst frame of sequence “Cars10” from the Hopkins 155 dataset [18] with 100 false trajectories of Brownian motion added to the original data (297 points). The corresponing RKHS norm histogram for n = 3 is displayed in Fig. 2(b).

We exploit this observation for outlier rejection by discarding data with low norms in the principal subspace. The cut-off threshold ψ can be determined by analyzing the shape of the distribution. For instance we can ﬁt a 1D Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with two components and set ψ as the point of equal Mahalanobis distance between the two components. However, our experimentation shows that an effective threshold can be obtained by simply setting ψ as the average value of all the norms, i.e. ψ= 1 N N bi . (11) i=1 This method was applied uniformly on all the sequences in our experiments in Sec. 4. Fig. 2(a)(right) shows an actual result of the method on Fig. 2(a)(left). 3.2 Recovering the number of motions and subspace clustering After outlier rejection, we further take advantage of the mapping induced by ORK for recovering the number of motions and subspace clustering. On the remaining data, we perform Kernel PCA [11] to seek the principal components which maximize the variance of the data in the RKHS, as Fig. 1(b) illustrates. Let {yi }i=1,...,N ′ be the N ′ -point subset of the input data that remains after outlier removal, where N ′ < N . Denote by C = [φ(y1 ) . . . φ(yN ′ )] the data matrix after mapping the data ˜ to Fkr , and by symbol C the result of adjusting C with the empirical mean of {φ(y1 ), . . . , φ(yN ′ )}. ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ The centered kernel matrix K′ = CT C [11] can be obtained as 1 ˜ K′ = ν T K′ ν, ν = [IN ′ − ′ 1N ′ ,N ′ ], (12) N where K′ = CT C is the uncentered kernel matrix, Is and 1s,s are respectively the s × s identity ˜ ˜ matrix and a matrix of ones. If K′ = RΩRT is the EVD of K′ , then we obtain ﬁrst-m kernel m ˜ principal components P of C as the ﬁrst-m left singular vectors of C , i.e. 1 ˜ Pm = CRm (Ωm )− 2 , (13) where Rm = R:,1:m and Ω1:m,1:m ; see Eq. (9). Projecting the data on the principal components yields 1 D = [d1 . . . dN ′ ] = (Ωm ) 2 (Rm )T , (14) ′ where D ∈ Rm×N . The afﬁne subspace span(Pm ) maximizes the spread of the centered data in the RKHS, and the projection D offers an effective representation for clustering. Fig. 3(a) shows the Kernel PCA projection results for m = 3 on the sequence in Fig. 2(a). The number of clusters in D is recovered via spectral clustering. More speciﬁcally we apply the Normalized Cut (Ncut) [13] algorithm. A fully connected graph is ﬁrst derived from the data, where ′ ′ its weighted adjacency matrix W ∈ RN ×N is obtained as Wp,q = exp(− dp − dq 2 /2δ 2 ), (15) and δ is taken as the average nearest neighbour distance in the Euclidean sense among the vectors in D. The Laplacian matrix [13] is then derived from W and eigendecomposed. Under Ncut, 5 0.1 0.05 0 −0.05 −0.1 0.1 −0.15 0.15 0.08 0.1 0.05 0 −0.05 −0.1 0.06 (a) Kernel PCA and Ncut results. (b) W matrix. (c) Final result for “cars10”. Figure 3: Actual results on the motion sequence in Fig. 2(a)(left). the number of clusters is revealed as the number of eigenvalues of the Laplacian that are zero or numerically insigniﬁcant. With this knowledge, a subsequent k-means step is then performed to cluster the points. Fig. 3(b) shows W for the input data in Fig. 2(a)(left) after outlier removal. It can be seen that strong afﬁnity exists between points from the same cluster, thus allowing accurate clustering. Figs. 3(a) and 3(c) illustrate the ﬁnal clustering result for the data in Fig. 2(a)(left). There are several reasons why spectral clustering under our framework is more successful than previous methods. Firstly, we perform an effective outlier rejection step that removes bad trajectories that can potentially mislead the clustering. Secondly, the mapping induced by ORK deliberately separates the trajectories based on their cluster membership. Finally, we perform Kernel PCA to maximize the variance of the data. Effectively this also improves the separation of clusters, thus facilitating an accurate recovery of the number of clusters and also the subsequent segmentation. This distinguishes our work from previous clustering based methods [21, 5] which tend to operate without maximizing the between-class scatter. Results in Sec. 4 validate our claims. 4 Results Henceforth we indicate the proposed method as “ORK”. We leverage on a recently published benchmark on afﬁne model motion segmentation [18] as a basis of comparison. The benchmark was evaluated on the Hopkins 155 dataset4 which contains 155 sequences with tracked point trajectories. A total of 120 sequences have two motions while 35 have three motions. The sequences contain degenerate and non-degenerate motions, independent and partially dependent motions, articulated motions, nonrigid motions etc. In terms of video content three categories exist: Checkerboard sequences, trafﬁc sequences (moving cars, trucks) and articulated motions (moving faces, people). 4.1 Details on benchmarking Four major algorithms were compared in [18]: Generalized PCA (GPCA) [19], Local Subspace Afﬁnity (LSA) [21], Multi-Stage Learning (MSL) [14] and RANSAC [17]. Here we extend the benchmark with newly reported results from Locally Linear Manifold Clustering (LLMC) [5] and Agglomerative Lossy Compression (ALC) [10, 9]. We also compare our method against Kanatani and Matsunaga’s [8] algorithm (henceforth, the “KM” method) in estimating the number of independent motions in the video sequences. Note that KM per se does not perform motion segmentation. For the sake of objective comparisons we use only implementations available publicly5. Following [18], motion segmentation performance is evaluated in terms of the labelling error of the point trajectories, where each point in a sequence has a ground truth label, i.e. number of mislabeled points . (16) classiﬁcation error = total number of points Unlike [18], we also emphasize on the ability of the methods in recovering the number of motions. However, although the methods compared in [18] (except RANSAC) theoretically have the means to 4 Available at http://www.vision.jhu.edu/data/hopkins155/. For MSL and KM, see http://www.suri.cs.okayama-u.ac.jp/e-program-separate.html/. For GPCA, LSA and RANSAC, refer to the url for the Hopkins 155 dataset. 5 6 do so, their estimation of the number of motions is generally unrealiable and the benchmark results in [18] were obtained by revealing the actual number of motions to the algorithms. A similar initialization exists in [5, 10] where the results were obtained by giving LLMC and ALC this knowledge a priori (for LLMC, this was given at least to the variant LLMC 4m during dimensionality reduction [5], where m is the true number of motions). In the following subsections, where variants exist for the compared algorithms we use results from the best performing variant. In the following the number of random hypotheses M and step size h for ORK are ﬁxed at 1000 and 300 respectively, and unlike the others, ORK is not given knowledge of the number of motions. 4.2 Data without gross outliers We apply ORK on the Hopkins 155 dataset. Since ORK uses random sampling we repeat it 100 times for each sequence and average the results. Table 1 depicts the obtained classiﬁcation error among those from previously proposed methods. ORK (column 9) gives comparable results to the other methods for sequences with 2 motions (mean = 7.83%, median = 0.41%). For sequences with 3 motions, ORK (mean = 12.62%, median = 4.75%) outperforms GPCA and RANSAC, but is slightly less accurate than the others. However, bear in mind that unlike the other methods ORK is not given prior knowledge of the true number of motions and has to estimate this independently.

REF represents the reference/control method which operates based on knowledge of ground truth segmentation. Refer to [18] for details. We also separately investigate the accuracy of ORK in estimating the number of motions, and compare it against KM [8] which was proposed for this purpose. Note that such an experiment was not attempted in [18] since approaches compared therein generally do not perform reliably in estimating the number of motions. The results in Table 2 (columns 1–2) show that for sequences with two motions, KM (80.83%) outperforms ORK (67.37%) by ≈ 15 percentage points. However, for sequences with three motions, ORK (49.66%) vastly outperforms KM (14.29%) by more than doubling the percentage points of accuracy. The overall accuracy of KM (65.81%) is slightly better than ORK (63.37%), but this is mostly because sequences with two motions form the majority in the dataset (120 out of 155). This leads us to conclude that ORK is actually the superior method here. Dataset Column Method 2 motions 3 motions Overall Hopkins 155 1 2 KM ORK 80.83% 67.37% 14.29% 49.66% 65.81% 63.37% Hopkins 155 + Outliers 3 4 KM ORK 00.00% 47.58% 100.00% 50.00% 22.58% 48.13% Table 2: Accuracy in determining the number of motions in a sequence. Note that in the experiment with outliers (columns 3–4), KM returns a constant number of 3 motions for all sequences. We re-evaluate the performance of ORK by considering only results on sequences where the number of motions is estimated correctly by ORK (there are about 98 ≡ 63.37% of such cases). The results are tabulated under ORK∗ (column 10) in Table 1. It can be seen that when ORK estimates the number of motions correctly, it is signiﬁcantly more accurate than the other methods. Finally, we compare the speed of the methods in Table 3. ORK was implemented and run in Matlab on a Dual Core Pentium 3.00GHz machine with 4GB of main memory (this is much less powerful 7 than the 8 Core Xeon 3.66GHz with 32GB memory used in [18] for the other methods in Table 3). The results show that ORK is comparable to LSA, much faster than MSL and ALC, but slower than GPCA and RANSAC. Timing results of LLMC are not available in the literature.

For each sequence in Hopkins 155, we add 100 gross outliers by creating trajectories corresponding to mistracks or spuriously occuring points. These are created by randomly initializing 100 locations in the ﬁrst frame and allowing them to drift throughout the sequence according to Brownian motion. The corrupted sequences are then subjected to the algorithms for motion segmentation. Since only ORK is capable of rejecting outliers, the classiﬁcation error of Eq. (16) is evaluated on the inlier points only. The results in Table 4 illustrate that ORK (column 4) is the most accurate method by a large margin. Despite being given the true number of motions a priori, GPCA, LSA and RANSAC are unable to provide satisfactory segmentation results. Column Method Mean Median Mean Median 1 2 3 4 GPCA LSA RANSAC ORK Sequences with 2 motions 28.66 24.25 30.64 16.50 30.96 26.51 32.36 10.54 Sequences with 3 motions 40.61 30.94 42.24 19.99 41.30 27.68 43.43 8.49 5 ORK∗ 1.62 0.00 2.68 0.09 Table 4: Classiﬁcation error (%) on Hopkins 155 sequences with 100 gross outliers per sequence. In terms of estimating the number of motions, as shown in column 4 in Table 2 the overall accuracy of ORK is reduced to 48.13%. This is contributed mainly by the deterioration in accuracy on sequences with two motions (47.58%), although the accuracy on sequences with three motions are maintained (50.00%). This is not a surprising result, since sequences with three motions generally have more (inlying) point trajectories than sequences with two motions, thus the outlier rates for sequences with three motions are lower (recall that a ﬁxed number of 100 false trajectories are added). On the other hand, the KM method (column 3) is completely overwhelmed by the outliers— for all the sequences with outliers it returned a constant “3” as the number of motions. We again re-evaluate ORK by considering results from sequences (now with gross outliers) where the number of motions is correctly estimated (there are about 75 ≡ 48.13% of such cases). The results tabulated under ORK∗ (column 5) in Table 4 show that the proposed method can accurately segment the point trajectories without being inﬂuenced by the gross outliers. 5 Conclusions In this paper we propose a novel and highly effective approach for multi-body motion segmentation. Our idea is based on encapsulating random hypotheses in a novel Mercel kernel and statistical learning. We evaluated our method on the Hopkins 155 dataset with results showing that the idea is superior other state-of-the-art approaches. It is by far the most accurate in terms of estimating the number of motions, and it excels in segmentation accuracy despite lacking prior knowledge of the number of motions. The proposed idea is also highly robust towards outliers in the input data. Acknowledgements.

<p>Author: Kevin Briggman, Winfried Denk, Sebastian Seung, Moritz N. Helmstaedter, Srinivas C. Turaga</p><p>Abstract: Images can be segmented by ﬁrst using a classiﬁer to predict an afﬁnity graph that reﬂects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the afﬁnity classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassiﬁcation rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the afﬁnity graph. We present the ﬁrst machine learning algorithm for training a classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classiﬁcation of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of ﬁnding the connected components of the thresholded afﬁnity graph, we are able to train an afﬁnity classiﬁer to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin afﬁnities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity. 1</p><p>2 0.76372164 <a title="149-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Region-based_Segmentation_and_Object_Detection.html">201 nips-2009-Region-based Segmentation and Object Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Gould, Tianshi Gao, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: Object detection and multi-class image segmentation are two closely related tasks that can be greatly improved when solved jointly by feeding information from one task to the other [10, 11]. However, current state-of-the-art models use a separate representation for each task making joint inference clumsy and leaving the classiﬁcation of many parts of the scene ambiguous. In this work, we propose a hierarchical region-based approach to joint object detection and image segmentation. Our approach simultaneously reasons about pixels, regions and objects in a coherent probabilistic model. Pixel appearance features allow us to perform well on classifying amorphous background classes, while the explicit representation of regions facilitate the computation of more sophisticated features necessary for object detection. Importantly, our model gives a single uniﬁed description of the scene—we explain every pixel in the image and enforce global consistency between all random variables in our model. We run experiments on the challenging Street Scene dataset [2] and show signiﬁcant improvement over state-of-the-art results for object detection accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.75819308 <a title="149-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-Learning_from_Neighboring_Strokes%3A_Combining_Appearance_and_Context_for_Multi-Domain_Sketch_Recognition.html">131 nips-2009-Learning from Neighboring Strokes: Combining Appearance and Context for Multi-Domain Sketch Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Ouyang, Randall Davis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new sketch recognition framework that combines a rich representation of low level visual appearance with a graphical model for capturing high level relationships between symbols. This joint model of appearance and context allows our framework to be less sensitive to noise and drawing variations, improving accuracy and robustness. The result is a recognizer that is better able to handle the wide range of drawing styles found in messy freehand sketches. We evaluate our work on two real-world domains, molecular diagrams and electrical circuit diagrams, and show that our combined approach signiﬁcantly improves recognition performance. 1</p><p>4 0.68359488 <a title="149-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Segmenting_Scenes_by_Matching_Image_Composites.html">211 nips-2009-Segmenting Scenes by Matching Image Composites</a></p>
<p>Author: Bryan Russell, Alyosha Efros, Josef Sivic, Bill Freeman, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate how, given an image, similar images sharing the same global description can help with unsupervised scene segmentation. In contrast to recent work in semantic alignment of scenes, we allow an input image to be explained by partial matches of similar scenes. This allows for a better explanation of the input scenes. We perform MRF-based segmentation that optimizes over matches, while respecting boundary information. The recovered segments are then used to re-query a large database of images to retrieve better matches for the target regions. We show improved performance in detecting the principal occluding and contact boundaries for the scene over previous methods on data gathered from the LabelMe database.</p><p>5 0.57587433 <a title="149-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Simultaneous_Image_Clustering%2C_Annotation_and_Object_Segmentation.html">5 nips-2009-A Bayesian Model for Simultaneous Image Clustering, Annotation and Object Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Lan Du, Lu Ren, Lawrence Carin, David B. Dunson</p><p>Abstract: A non-parametric Bayesian model is proposed for processing multiple images. The analysis employs image features and, when present, the words associated with accompanying annotations. The model clusters the images into classes, and each image is segmented into a set of objects, also allowing the opportunity to assign a word to each object (localized labeling). Each object is assumed to be represented as a heterogeneous mix of components, with this realized via mixture models linking image features to object types. The number of image classes, number of object types, and the characteristics of the object-feature mixture models are inferred nonparametrically. To constitute spatially contiguous objects, a new logistic stick-breaking process is developed. Inference is performed efﬁciently via variational Bayesian analysis, with example results presented on two image databases.</p><p>6 0.54857814 <a title="149-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Constructing_Topological_Maps_using_Markov_Random_Fields_and_Loop-Closure_Detection.html">58 nips-2009-Constructing Topological Maps using Markov Random Fields and Loop-Closure Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Ilya Sutskever, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Ruslan Salakhutdinov</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning probabilistic models for complex relational structures between various types of objects. A model can help us “understand” a dataset of relational facts in at least two ways, by ﬁnding interpretable structure in the data, and by supporting predictions, or inferences about whether particular unobserved relations are likely to be true. Often there is a tradeoff between these two aims: cluster-based models yield more easily interpretable representations, while factorization-based approaches have given better predictive performance on large data sets. We introduce the Bayesian Clustered Tensor Factorization (BCTF) model, which embeds a factorized representation of relations in a nonparametric Bayesian clustering framework. Inference is fully Bayesian but scales well to large data sets. The model simultaneously discovers interpretable clusters and yields predictive performance that matches or beats previous probabilistic models for relational data.</p><p>2 0.86361068 <a title="149-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli_Alignment%3A_A_Generative_Model_for_Multi-Class_Multi-Label_Multi-Instance_Corpora.html">68 nips-2009-Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment: A Generative Model for Multi-Class Multi-Label Multi-Instance Corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Shuang-hong Yang, Hongyuan Zha, Bao-gang Hu</p><p>Abstract: We propose Dirichlet-Bernoulli Alignment (DBA), a generative model for corpora in which each pattern (e.g., a document) contains a set of instances (e.g., paragraphs in the document) and belongs to multiple classes. By casting predeﬁned classes as latent Dirichlet variables (i.e., instance level labels), and modeling the multi-label of each pattern as Bernoulli variables conditioned on the weighted empirical average of topic assignments, DBA automatically aligns the latent topics discovered from data to human-deﬁned classes. DBA is useful for both pattern classiﬁcation and instance disambiguation, which are tested on text classiﬁcation and named entity disambiguation in web search queries respectively.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.86080325 <a title="149-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Maximin_affinity_learning_of_image_segmentation.html">149 nips-2009-Maximin affinity learning of image segmentation</a></p>

Turaga</p><p>Abstract: Images can be segmented by ﬁrst using a classiﬁer to predict an afﬁnity graph that reﬂects the degree to which image pixels must be grouped together and then partitioning the graph to yield a segmentation. Machine learning has been applied to the afﬁnity classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of minimizing edge misclassiﬁcation rates. However, this error measure is only indirectly related to the quality of segmentations produced by ultimately partitioning the afﬁnity graph. We present the ﬁrst machine learning algorithm for training a classiﬁer to produce afﬁnity graphs that are good in the sense of producing segmentations that directly minimize the Rand index, a well known segmentation performance measure. The Rand index measures segmentation performance by quantifying the classiﬁcation of the connectivity of image pixel pairs after segmentation. By using the simple graph partitioning algorithm of ﬁnding the connected components of the thresholded afﬁnity graph, we are able to train an afﬁnity classiﬁer to directly minimize the Rand index of segmentations resulting from the graph partitioning. Our learning algorithm corresponds to the learning of maximin afﬁnities between image pixel pairs, which are predictive of the pixel-pair connectivity. 1</p><p>4 0.85201687 <a title="149-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Individuation%2C_Identification_and_Object_Discovery.html">115 nips-2009-Individuation, Identification and Object Discovery</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Alan Jern, Fei Xu</p><p>Abstract: Humans are typically able to infer how many objects their environment contains and to recognize when the same object is encountered twice. We present a simple statistical model that helps to explain these abilities and evaluate it in three behavioral experiments. Our ﬁrst experiment suggests that humans rely on prior knowledge when deciding whether an object token has been previously encountered. Our second and third experiments suggest that humans can infer how many objects they have seen and can learn about categories and their properties even when they are uncertain about which tokens are instances of the same object. From an early age, humans and other animals [1] appear to organize the ﬂux of experience into a series of encounters with discrete and persisting objects. Consider, for example, a young child who grows up in a home with two dogs. At a relatively early age the child will solve the problem of object discovery and will realize that her encounters with dogs correspond to views of two individuals rather than one or three. The child will also solve the problem of identiﬁcation, and will be able to reliably identify an individual (e.g. Fido) each time it is encountered. This paper presents a Bayesian approach that helps to explain both object discovery and identiﬁcation. Bayesian models are appealing in part because they help to explain how inferences are guided by prior knowledge. Imagine, for example, that you see some photographs taken by your friends Alice and Bob. The ﬁrst shot shows Alice sitting next to a large statue and eating a sandwich, and the second is similar but features Bob rather than Alice. The statues in each photograph look identical, and probably you will conclude that the two photographs are representations of the same statue. The sandwiches in the photographs also look identical, but probably you will conclude that the photographs show different sandwiches. The prior knowledge that contributes to these inferences appears rather complex, but we will explore some much simpler cases where prior knowledge guides identiﬁcation. A second advantage of Bayesian models is that they help to explain how learners cope with uncertainty. In some cases a learner may solve the problem of object discovery but should maintain uncertainty when faced with identiﬁcation problems. For example, I may be quite certain that I have met eight different individuals at a dinner party, even if I am unable to distinguish between two guests who are identical twins. In other cases a learner may need to reason about several related problems even if there is no deﬁnitive solution to any one of them. Consider, for example, a young child who must simultaneously discover which objects her world contains (e.g. Mother, Father, Fido, and Rex) and organize them into categories (e.g. people and dogs). Many accounts of categorization seem to implicitly assume that the problem of identiﬁcation must be solved before categorization can begin, but we will see that a probabilistic approach can address both problems simultaneously. Identiﬁcation and object discovery have been discussed by researchers from several disciplines, including psychology [2, 3, 4, 5, 6], machine learning [7, 8], statistics [9], and philosophy [10]. Many machine learning approaches can handle identity uncertainty, or uncertainty about whether two tokens correspond to the same object. Some approaches such such as BLOG [8] are able in addition to handle problems where the number of objects is not speciﬁed in advance. We propose 1 that some of these approaches can help to explain human learning, and this paper uses a simple BLOG-style approach [8] to account for human inferences. There are several existing psychological models of identiﬁcation, and the work of Shepard [11], Nosofsky [3] and colleagues is probably the most prominent. Models in this tradition usually focus on problems where the set of objects is speciﬁed in advance and where identity uncertainty arises as a result of perceptual noise. In contrast, we focus on problems where the number of objects must be inferred and where identity uncertainty arises from partial observability rather than noise. A separate psychological tradition focuses on problems where the number of objects is not ﬁxed in advance. Developmental psychologists, for example, have used displays where only one object token is visible at any time to explore whether young infants can infer how many different objects have been observed in total [4]. Our work emphasizes some of the same themes as this developmental research, but we go beyond previous work in this area by presenting and evaluating a computational approach to object identiﬁcation and discovery. The problem of deciding how many objects have been observed is sometimes called individuation [12] but here we treat individuation as a special case of object discovery. Note, however, that object discovery can also refer to cases where learners infer the existence of objects that have never been observed. Unobserved-object discovery has received relatively little attention in the psychological literature, but is addressed by statistical models including including species-sampling models [9] and capture-recapture models [13]. Simple statistical models of this kind will not address some of the most compelling examples of unobserved-object discovery, such as the discovery of the planet Neptune, or the ability to infer the existence of a hidden object by following another person’s gaze [14]. We will show, however, that a simple statistical approach helps to explain how humans infer the existence of objects that they have never seen. 1 A probabilistic account of object discovery and identiﬁcation Object discovery and identiﬁcation may depend on many kinds of observations and may be supported by many kinds of prior knowledge. This paper considers a very simple setting where these problems can be explored. Suppose that an agent is learning about a world that contains nw white balls and n − nw gray balls. Let f (oi ) indicate the color of ball oi , where each ball is white (f (oi ) = 1) or gray (f (oi ) = 0). An agent learns about the world by observing a sequence of object tokens. Suppose that label l(j) is a unique identiﬁer of token j—in other words, suppose that the jth token is a token of object ol(j) . Suppose also that the jth token is observed to have feature value g(j). Note the difference between f and g: f is a vector that speciﬁes the color of the n balls in the world, and g is a vector that speciﬁes the color of the object tokens observed thus far. We deﬁne a probability distribution over token sequences by assuming that a world is sampled from a prior P (n, nw ) and that tokens are sampled from this world. The full generative model is: P (n) ∝ 1 n 0 if n ≤ 1000 otherwise nw | n ∼ Uniform(0, n) l(j) | n ∼ Uniform(1, n) g(j) = f (ol(j) ) (1) (2) (3) (4) A prior often used for inferences about a population of unknown size is the scale-invariant Jeffreys 1 prior P (n) = n [15]. We follow this standard approach here but truncate at n = 1000. Choosing some upper bound is convenient when implementing the model, and has the advantage of producing a prior that is proper (note that the Jeffreys prior is improper). Equation 2 indicates that the number of white balls nw is sampled from a discrete uniform distribution. Equation 3 indicates that each token is generated by sampling one of the n balls in the world uniformly at random, and Equation 4 indicates that the color of each token is observed without noise. The generative assumptions just described can be used to deﬁne a probabilistic approach to object discovery and identiﬁcation. Suppose that the observations available to a learner consist of a fully-observed feature vector g and a partially-observed label vector lobs . Object discovery and identiﬁcation can be addressed by using the posterior distribution P (l|g, lobs ) to make inferences about the number of distinct objects observed and about the identity of each token. Computing the posterior distribution P (n|g, lobs ) allows the learner to make inferences about the total number of objects 2 in the world. In some cases, the learner may solve the problem of unobserved-object discovery by realizing that the world contains more objects than she has observed thus far. The next sections explore the idea that the inferences made by humans correspond approximately to the inferences of this ideal learner. Since the ideal learner allows for the possible existence of objects that have not yet been observed, we refer to our model as the open world model. Although we make no claim about the psychological mechanisms that might allow humans to approximate the predictions of the ideal learner, in practice we need some method for computing the predictions of our model. Since the domains we consider are relatively small, all results in this paper were computed by enumerating and summing over the complete set of possible worlds. 2 Experiment 1: Prior knowledge and identiﬁcation The introduction described a scenario (the statue and sandwiches example) where prior knowledge appears to guide identiﬁcation. Our ﬁrst experiment explores a very simple instance of this idea. We consider a setting where participants observe balls that are sampled with replacement from an urn. In one condition, participants sample the same ball from the urn on four consecutive occasions and are asked to predict whether the token observed on the ﬁfth draw is the same ball that they saw on the ﬁrst draw. In a second condition participants are asked exactly the same question about the ﬁfth token but sample four different balls on the ﬁrst four draws. We expect that these different patterns of data will shape the prior beliefs that participants bring to the identiﬁcation problem involving the ﬁfth token, and that participants in the ﬁrst condition will be substantially more likely to identify the ﬁfth token as a ball that they have seen before. Although we consider an abstract setting involving balls and urns the problem we explore has some real-world counterparts. Suppose, for example, that a colleague wears the same tie to four formal dinners. Based on this evidence you might be able to estimate the total number of ties that he owns, and might guess that he is less likely to wear a new tie to the next dinner than a colleague who wore different ties to the ﬁrst four dinners. Method. 12 adults participated for course credit. Participants interacted with a computer interface that displayed an urn, a robotic arm and a beam of UV light. The arm randomly sampled balls from the urn, and participants were told that each ball had a unique serial number that was visible only under UV light. After some balls were sampled, the robotic arm moved them under the UV light and revealed their serial numbers before returning them to the urn. Other balls were returned directly to the urn without having their serial numbers revealed. The serial numbers were alphanumeric strings such as “QXR182”—note that these serial numbers provide no information about the total number of objects, and that our setting is therefore different from the Jeffreys tramcar problem [15]. The experiment included ﬁve within-participant conditions shown in Figure 1. The observations for each condition can be summarized by a string that indicates the number of tokens and the serial numbers of some but perhaps not all tokens. The 1 1 1 1 1 condition in Figure 1a is a case where the same ball (without loss of generality, we call it ball 1) is drawn from the urn on ﬁve consecutive occasions. The 1 2 3 4 5 condition in Figure 1b is a case where ﬁve different balls are drawn from the urn. The 1 condition in Figure 1d is a case where ﬁve draws are made, but only the serial number of the ﬁrst ball is revealed. Within any of the ﬁve conditions, all of the balls had the same color (white or gray), but different colors were used across different conditions. For simplicity, all draws in Figure 1 are shown as white balls. On the second and all subsequent draws, participants were asked two questions about any token that was subsequently identiﬁed. They ﬁrst indicated whether the token was likely to be the same as the ball they observed on the ﬁrst draw (the ball labeled 1 in Figure 1). They then indicated whether the token was likely to be a ball that they had never seen before. Both responses were provided on a scale from 1 (very unlikely) to 7 (very likely). At the end of each condition, participants were asked to estimate the total number of balls in the urn. Twelve options were provided ranging from “exactly 1” to “exactly 12,” and a thirteenth option was labeled “more than 12.” Responses to each option were again provided on a seven point scale. Model predictions and results. The comparisons of primary interest involve the identiﬁcation questions in conditions 1a and 1b. In condition 1a the open world model infers that the total number of balls is probably low, and becomes increasingly conﬁdent that each new token is the same as the 3 a) b) 1 1 1 1 1 ?NEW = NEW 1 2 3 4 5 ? = (1) ?NEW = NEW BALL 1 BALL (1) NEW 5 5 3 3 3 3 1 1 1 1 Open world 7 5 0.66 DP mixture 7 5 0.66 PY mixture Human 7 ? = (1) BALL 1 1 1 0.66 0.66 0.33 0.33 0 0 7 13 0.66 9 0.33 5 0.33 5 0 1 0 1 1 # Balls 1 # Balls 0.66 1 1 ?

The left columns in (a) and (b) show inferences about the identiﬁcation questions. In each plot, the ﬁrst group of bars shows predictions about the probability that each new token is the same ball as the ﬁrst ball drawn from the urn. The second group of bars shows the probability that each new token is a ball that has never been seen before. The right columns in (a) and (b) and the plots in (c) through (e) show inferences about the total number of balls in each urn. All human responses are shown on the 1-7 scale used for the experiment. Model predictions are shown as probabilities (identiﬁcation questions) or ranks (population size questions). ﬁrst object observed. In condition 1b the model infers that the number of balls is probably high, and becomes increasingly conﬁdent that each new token is probably a new ball. The rightmost charts in Figures 1a and 1b show inferences about the total number of balls and conﬁrm that humans expect the number of balls to be low in condition 1a and high in condition 1b. Note that participants in condition 1b have solved the problem of unobserved-object discovery and inferred the existence of objects that they have never seen. The leftmost charts in 1a and 1b show responses to the identiﬁcation questions, and the ﬁnal bar in each group of four shows predictions about the ﬁfth token sampled. As predicted by the model, participants in 1a become increasingly conﬁdent that each new token is the same object as the ﬁrst token, but participants in 1b become increasingly conﬁdent that each new token is a new object. The increase in responses to the new ball questions in Figure 1b is replicated in conditions 2d and 2e of Experiment 2, and therefore appears to be reliable. 4 The third and fourth rows of Figures 1a and 1b show the predictions of two alternative models that are intuitively appealing but that fail to account for our results. The ﬁrst is the Dirichlet Process (DP) mixture model, which was proposed by Anderson [16] as an account of human categorization. Unlike most psychological models of categorization, the DP mixture model reserves some probability mass for outcomes that have not yet been observed. The model incorporates a prior distribution over partitions—in most applications of the model these partitions organize objects into categories, but Anderson suggests that the model can also be used to organize object tokens into classes that correspond to individual objects. The DP mixture model successfully predicts that the ball 1 questions will receive higher ratings in 1a than 1b, but predicts that responses to the new ball question will be identical across these two conditions. According to this model, the probability that a new token θ corresponds to a new object is m+θ where θ is a hyperparameter and m is the number of tokens observed thus far. Note that this probability is the same regardless of the identities of the m tokens previously observed. The Pitman Yor (PY) mixture model in the fourth row is a generalization of the DP mixture model that uses a prior over partitions deﬁned by two hyperparameters [17]. According to this model, the probability that a new token corresponds to a new object is θ+kα , where θ and α are hyperparameters m+θ and k is the number of distinct objects observed so far. The ﬂexibility offered by a second hyperparameter allows the model to predict a difference in responses to the new ball questions across the two conditions, but the model does not account for the increasing pattern observed in condition 1b. Most settings of θ and α predict that the responses to the new ball questions will decrease in condition 1b. A non-generic setting of these hyperparameters with θ = 0 can generate the ﬂat predictions in Figure 1, but no setting of the hyperparameters predicts the increase in the human responses. Although the PY and DP models both make predictions about the identiﬁcation questions, neither model can predict the total number of balls in the urn. Both models assume that the population of balls is countably inﬁnite, which does not seem appropriate for the tasks we consider. Figures 1c through 1d show results for three control conditions. Like condition 1a, 1c and 1d are cases where exactly one serial number is observed. Like conditions 1a and 1b, 1d and 1e are cases where exactly ﬁve tokens are observed. None of these control conditions produces results similar to conditions 1a and 1b, suggesting that methods which simply count the number of tokens or serial numbers will not account for our results. In each of the ﬁnal three conditions our model predicts that the posterior distribution on the number of balls n should decay as n increases. This prediction is not consistent with our data, since most participants assigned equal ratings to all 13 options, including “exactly 12 balls” and “more than 12 balls.” The ﬂat responses in Figures 1c through 1e appear to indicate a generic desire to express uncertainty, and suggest that our ideal learner model accounts for human responses only after several informative observations have been made. 3 Experiment 2: Object discovery and identity uncertainty Our second experiment focuses on object discovery rather than identiﬁcation. We consider cases where learners make inferences about the number of objects they have seen and the total number of objects in the urn even though there is substantial uncertainty about the identities of many of the tokens observed. Our probabilistic model predicts that observations of unidentiﬁed tokens can inﬂuence inferences about the total number of objects, and our second experiment tests this prediction. Method. 12 adults participated for course credit. The same participants took part in Experiments 1 and 2, and Experiment 2 was always completed after Experiment 1. Participants interacted with the same computer interface in both conditions, and the seven conditions in Experiment 2 are shown in Figure 2. Note that each condition now includes one or more gray tokens. In 2a, for example, there are four gray tokens and none of these tokens is identiﬁed. All tokens were sampled with replacement, and the condition labels in Figure 2 summarize the complete set of tokens presented in each condition. Within each condition the tokens were presented in a pseudo-random order—in 2a, for example, the gray and white tokens were interspersed with each other. Model predictions and results. The cases of most interest are the inferences about the total number of balls in conditions 2a and 2c. In both conditions participants observe exactly four white tokens and all four tokens are revealed to be the same ball. The gray tokens in each condition are never identiﬁed, but the number of these tokens varies across the conditions.

The left columns in (a) through (e) show inferences about the identiﬁcation questions, and the remaining plots show inferences about the total number of balls in each urn. of the gray tokens are never revealed, the open world model can use these observations to guide its inference about the total number of balls. In 2a, the proportions of white tokens and gray tokens are equal and there appears to be only one white ball, suggesting that the total number of balls is around two. In 2c grey tokens are now three times more common, suggesting that the total number of balls is larger than two. As predicted, the human responses in Figure 2 show that the peak of the distribution in 2a shifts to the right in 2c. Note, however, that the model does not accurately predict the precise location of the peak in 2c. Some of the remaining conditions in Figure 2 serve as controls for the comparison between 2a and 2c. Conditions 2a and 2c differ in the total number of tokens observed, but condition 2b shows that 6 this difference is not the critical factor. The number of tokens observed is the same across 2b and 2c, yet the inference in 2b is more similar to the inference in 2a than in 2c. Conditions 2a and 2c also differ in the proportion of white tokens observed, but conditions 2f and 2g show that this difference is not sufﬁcient to explain our results. The proportion of white tokens observed is the same across conditions 2a, 2f, and 2g, yet only 2a provides strong evidence that the total number of balls is low. The human inferences for 2f and 2g show the hint of an alternating pattern consistent with the inference that the total number of balls in the urn is even. Only 2 out of 12 participants generated this pattern, however, and the majority of responses are near uniform. Finally, conditions 2d and 2e replicate our ﬁnding from Experiment 1 that the identity labels play an important role. The only difference between 2a and 2e is that the four labels are distinct in the latter case, and this single difference produces a predictable divergence in human inferences about the total number of balls. 4 Experiment 3: Categorization and identity uncertainty Experiment 2 suggested that people make robust inferences about the existence and number of unobserved objects in the presence of identity uncertainty. Our ﬁnal experiment explores categorization in the presence of identity uncertainty. We consider an extreme case where participants make inferences about the variability of a category even though the tokens of that category have never been identiﬁed. Method. The experiment included two between subject conditions, and 20 adults were recruited for each condition. Participants were asked to reason about a category including eggs of a given species, where eggs in the same category might vary in size. The interface used in Experiments 1 and 2 was adapted so that the urn now contained two kinds of objects: notepads and eggs. Participants were told that each notepad had a unique color and a unique label written on the front. The UV light played no role in the experiment and was removed from the interface: notepads could be identiﬁed by visual inspection, and identifying labels for the eggs were never shown. In both conditions participants observed a sequence of 16 tokens sampled from the urn. Half of the tokens were notepads and the others were eggs, and all egg tokens were identical in size. Whenever an egg was sampled, participants were told that this egg was a Kwiba egg. At the end of the condition, participants were shown a set of 11 eggs that varied in size and asked to rate the probability that each one was a Kwiba egg. Participants then made inferences about the total number of eggs and the total number of notepads in the urn. The two conditions were intended to lead to different inferences about the total number of eggs in the urn. In the 4 egg condition, all items (notepad and eggs) were sampled with replacement. The 8 notepad tokens included two tokens of each of 4 notepads, suggesting that the total number of notepads was 4. Since the proportion of egg tokens and notepad tokens was equal, we expected participants to infer that the total number of eggs was roughly four. In the 1 egg condition, four notepads were observed in total, but the ﬁrst three were sampled without replacement and never returned to the urn. The ﬁnal notepad and the egg tokens were always sampled with replacement. After the ﬁrst three notepads had been removed from the urn, the remaining notepad was sampled about half of the time. We therefore expected participants to infer that the urn probably contained a single notepad and a single egg by the end of the experiment, and that all of the eggs they had observed were tokens of a single object. Model. We can simultaneously address identiﬁcation and categorization by combining the open world model with a Gaussian model of categorization. Suppose that the members of a given category (e.g. Kwiba eggs) vary along a single continuous dimension (e.g. size). We assume that the egg sizes are distributed according to a Gaussian with known mean and unknown variance σ 2 . For convenience, we assume that the mean is zero (i.e. we measure size with respect to the average) and β use the standard inverse-gamma prior on the variance: p(σ 2 ) ∝ (σ 2 )−(α+1) e− σ2 . Since we are interested only in qualitative predictions of the model, the precise values of the hyperparameters are not very important. To generate the results shown in Figure 3 we set α = 0.5 and β = 2. Before observing any eggs, the marginal distribution on sizes is p(x) = p(x|σ 2 )p(σ 2 )dσ 2 . Suppose now that we observe m random samples from the category and that each one has size zero. If m is large then these observations provide strong evidence that the variance σ 2 is small, and the posterior distribution p(x|m) will be tightly peaked around zero. If m, is small, however, then the posterior distribution will be broader. 7 2 − Category pdf (1 egg) 1 2 1 0 0 7 7 5 5 3 3 1 1 = p4 (x) − p1 (x) Category pdf (4 eggs) p1 (x) p4 (x) a) Model differences 0.1 0 −0.1 −2 0 2 x (size) Human differences 12 8 10 6 4 0.4 0.2 0 −0.2 −0.4 2 12 8 10 6 4 2 −2 0 2 x (size) −2 0 2 x (size) b) Number of eggs (4 eggs) Number of eggs (1 egg) c) −4 −2 0 2 4 (size) Figure 3: (a) Model predictions for Experiment 3. The ﬁrst two panels show the size distributions inferred for the two conditions, and the ﬁnal panel shows the difference of these distributions. The difference curve for the model rises to a peak of around 1.6 but has been truncated at 0.1. (b) Human inferences about the total number of eggs in the urn. As predicted, participants in the 4 egg condition believe that the urn contains more eggs. (c) The difference of the size distributions generated by participants in each condition. The central peak is absent but otherwise the curve is qualitatively similar to the model prediction. The categorization model described so far is entirely standard, but note that our experiment considers a case where T , the observed stream of object tokens, is not sufﬁcient to determine m, the number of distinct objects observed. We therefore use the open world model to generate a posterior distribution over m, and compute a marginal distribution over size by integrating out both m and σ 2 : p(x|T ) = p(x|σ 2 )p(σ 2 |m)p(m|T )dσ 2 dm. Figure 3a shows predictions of this “open world + Gaussian” model for the two conditions in our experiment. Note that the difference between the curves for the two conditions has the characteristic Mexican-hat shape produced by a difference of Gaussians. Results. Inferences about the total number of eggs suggested that our manipulation succeeded. Figure 3b indicates that participants in the 4 egg condition believed that they had seen more eggs than participants in the 1 egg condition. Participants in both conditions generated a size distribution for the category of Kwiba eggs, and the difference of these distributions is shown in Figure 3c. Although the magnitude of the differences is small, the shape of the difference curve is consistent with the model predictions. The x = 0 bar is the only case that diverges from the expected Mexican hat shape, and this result is probably due to a ceiling effect—80% of participants in both conditions chose the maximum possible rating for the egg with mean size (size zero), leaving little opportunity for a difference between conditions to emerge. To support the qualitative result in Figure 3c we computed the variance of the curve generated by each individual participant and tested the hypothesis that the variances were greater in the 1 egg condition than in the 4 egg condition. A Mann-Whitney test indicated that this difference was marginally signiﬁcant (p < 0.1, one-sided). 5 Conclusion Parsing the world into stable and recurring objects is arguably our most basic cognitive achievement [2, 10]. This paper described a simple model of object discovery and identiﬁcation and evaluated it in three behavioral experiments. Our ﬁrst experiment conﬁrmed that people rely on prior knowledge when solving identiﬁcation problems. Our second and third experiments explored problems where the identities of many object tokens were never revealed. Despite the resulting uncertainty, we found that participants in these experiments were able to track the number of objects they had seen, to infer the existence of unobserved objects, and to learn and reason about categories. Although the tasks in our experiments were all relatively simple, future work can apply our approach to more realistic settings. For example, a straightforward extension of our model can handle problems where objects vary along multiple perceptual dimensions and where observations are corrupted by perceptual noise. Discovery and identiﬁcation problems may take several different forms, but probabilistic inference can help to explain how all of these problems are solved.

<p>Author: Benjamin V. Durme, Ashwin Lall</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has led to the ability to perform space efﬁcient, approximate counting over large vocabularies in a streaming context. Motivated by the existence of data structures of this type, we explore the computation of associativity scores, otherwise known as pointwise mutual information (PMI), in a streaming context. We give theoretical bounds showing the impracticality of perfect online PMI computation, and detail an algorithm with high expected accuracy. Experiments on news articles show our approach gives high accuracy on real world data. 1</p><p>6 0.81466633 <a title="149-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Semi-Supervised_Learning_in_Gigantic_Image_Collections.html">212 nips-2009-Semi-Supervised Learning in Gigantic Image Collections</a></p>

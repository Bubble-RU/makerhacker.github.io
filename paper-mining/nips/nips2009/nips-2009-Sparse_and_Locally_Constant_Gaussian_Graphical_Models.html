<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: High-dimensional statistical inference deals with models in which the the number of parameters p is comparable to or larger than the sample size n. Since it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless p/n → 0, a line of recent work has studied models with various types of structure (e.g., sparse vectors; block-structured matrices; low-rank matrices; Markov assumptions). In such settings, a general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized convex program (known as a regularized M -estimator) which combines a loss function (measuring how well the model ﬁts the data) with some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. The goal of this paper is to provide a uniﬁed framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates for such regularized M estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive several existing results, and also to obtain several new results on consistency and convergence rates. Our analysis also identiﬁes two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure the corresponding regularized M -estimators have fast convergence rates. 1</p><p>3 0.15132096 <a title="224-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-Sparsistent_Learning_of_Varying-coefficient_Models_with_Structural_Changes.html">225 nips-2009-Sparsistent Learning of Varying-coefficient Models with Structural Changes</a></p>
<p>Author: Mladen Kolar, Le Song, Eric P. Xing</p><p>Abstract: To estimate the changing structure of a varying-coefﬁcient varying-structure (VCVS) model remains an important and open problem in dynamic system modelling, which includes learning trajectories of stock prices, or uncovering the topology of an evolving gene network. In this paper, we investigate sparsistent learning of a sub-family of this model — piecewise constant VCVS models. We analyze two main issues in this problem: inferring time points where structural changes occur and estimating model structure (i.e., model selection) on each of the constant segments. We propose a two-stage adaptive procedure, which ﬁrst identiﬁes jump points of structural changes and then identiﬁes relevant covariates to a response on each of the segments. We provide an asymptotic analysis of the procedure, showing that with the increasing sample size, number of structural changes, and number of variables, the true model can be consistently selected. We demonstrate the performance of the method on synthetic data and apply it to the brain computer interface dataset. We also consider how this applies to structure estimation of time-varying probabilistic graphical models. 1</p><p>4 0.14396909 <a title="224-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Speeding_up_Magnetic_Resonance_Image_Acquisition_by_Bayesian_Multi-Slice_Adaptive_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2009-Speeding up Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition by Bayesian Multi-Slice Adaptive Compressed Sensing</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Seeger</p><p>Abstract: We show how to sequentially optimize magnetic resonance imaging measurement designs over stacks of neighbouring image slices, by performing convex variational inference on a large scale non-Gaussian linear dynamical system, tracking dominating directions of posterior covariance without imposing any factorization constraints. Our approach can be scaled up to high-resolution images by reductions to numerical mathematics primitives and parallelization on several levels. In a ﬁrst study, designs are found that improve signiﬁcantly on others chosen independently for each slice or drawn at random. 1</p><p>5 0.14162605 <a title="224-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Matrix_Completion_from_Noisy_Entries.html">147 nips-2009-Matrix Completion from Noisy Entries</a></p>
<p>Author: Raghunandan Keshavan, Andrea Montanari, Sewoong Oh</p><p>Abstract: Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it from noisy observations of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative ﬁltering (the ‘Netﬂix problem’) to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm introduced in [1], based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here O PT S PACE. We prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances. 1</p><p>6 0.13940586 <a title="224-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Multi-Label_Prediction_via_Compressed_Sensing.html">157 nips-2009-Multi-Label Prediction via Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the forward greedy strategy in sparse nonparametric regression. For additive models, we propose an algorithm called additive forward regression; for general multivariate models, we propose an algorithm called generalized forward regression. Both algorithms simultaneously conduct estimation and variable selection in nonparametric settings for the high dimensional sparse learning problem. Our main emphasis is empirical: on both simulated and real data, these two simple greedy methods can clearly outperform several state-ofthe-art competitors, including LASSO, a nonparametric version of LASSO called the sparse additive model (SpAM) and a recently proposed adaptive parametric forward-backward algorithm called Foba. We also provide some theoretical justiﬁcations of speciﬁc versions of the additive forward regression. 1</p><p>4 0.65905601 <a title="224-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-Sparsistent_Learning_of_Varying-coefficient_Models_with_Structural_Changes.html">225 nips-2009-Sparsistent Learning of Varying-coefficient Models with Structural Changes</a></p>

<p>Author: Shuheng Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Given n noisy samples with p dimensions, where n ≪ p, we show that the multistep thresholding procedure can accurately estimate a sparse vector β ∈ Rp in a linear model, under the restricted eigenvalue conditions (Bickel-Ritov-Tsybakov 09). Thus our conditions for model selection consistency are considerably weaker than what has been achieved in previous works. More importantly, this method allows very signiﬁcant values of s, which is the number of non-zero elements in the true parameter. For example, it works for cases where the ordinary Lasso would have failed. Finally, we show that if X obeys a uniform uncertainty principle and if the true parameter is sufﬁciently sparse, the Gauss-Dantzig selector (Cand` se Tao 07) achieves the ℓ2 loss within a logarithmic factor of the ideal mean square error one would achieve with an oracle which would supply perfect information about which coordinates are non-zero and which are above the noise level, while selecting a sufﬁciently sparse model. 1</p><p>6 0.6533072 <a title="224-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Speeding_up_Magnetic_Resonance_Image_Acquisition_by_Bayesian_Multi-Slice_Adaptive_Compressed_Sensing.html">228 nips-2009-Speeding up Magnetic Resonance Image Acquisition by Bayesian Multi-Slice Adaptive Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Chonghai Hu, Weike Pan, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Regularized risk minimization often involves non-smooth optimization, either because of the loss function (e.g., hinge loss) or the regularizer (e.g., ℓ1 -regularizer). Gradient methods, though highly scalable and easy to implement, are known to converge slowly. In this paper, we develop a novel accelerated gradient method for stochastic optimization while still preserving their computational simplicity and scalability. The proposed algorithm, called SAGE (Stochastic Accelerated GradiEnt), exhibits fast convergence rates on stochastic composite optimization with convex or strongly convex objectives. Experimental results show that SAGE is faster than recent (sub)gradient methods including FOLOS, SMIDAS and SCD. Moreover, SAGE can also be extended for online learning, resulting in a simple algorithm but with the best regret bounds currently known for these problems. 1</p><p>2 0.87246811 <a title="224-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Label_Selection_on_Graphs.html">122 nips-2009-Label Selection on Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Guillory, Jeff A. Bilmes</p><p>Abstract: We investigate methods for selecting sets of labeled vertices for use in predicting the labels of vertices on a graph. We speciﬁcally study methods which choose a single batch of labeled vertices (i.e. ofﬂine, non sequential methods). In this setting, we ﬁnd common graph smoothness assumptions directly motivate simple label selection methods with interesting theoretical guarantees. These methods bound prediction error in terms of the smoothness of the true labels with respect to the graph. Some of these bounds give new motivations for previously proposed algorithms, and some suggest new algorithms which we evaluate. We show improved performance over baseline methods on several real world data sets. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.85947645 <a title="224-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Sparse_and_Locally_Constant_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">224 nips-2009-Sparse and Locally Constant Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Honorio, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios, Rita Goldstein, Luis E. Ortiz</p><p>Abstract: Locality information is crucial in datasets where each variable corresponds to a measurement in a manifold (silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images). Although these datasets are typically under-sampled and high-dimensional, they often need to be represented with low-complexity statistical models, which are comprised of only the important probabilistic dependencies in the datasets. Most methods attempt to reduce model complexity by enforcing structure sparseness. However, sparseness cannot describe inherent regularities in the structure. Hence, in this paper we ﬁrst propose a new class of Gaussian graphical models which, together with sparseness, imposes local constancy through 1 -norm penalization. Second, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm which decomposes the strictly convex maximum likelihood estimation into a sequence of problems with closed form solutions. Through synthetic experiments, we evaluate the closeness of the recovered models to the ground truth. We also test the generalization performance of our method in a wide range of complex real-world datasets and demonstrate that it captures useful structures such as the rotation and shrinking of a beating heart, motion correlations between body parts during walking and functional interactions of brain regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art structure learning techniques for Gaussian graphical models both for small and large datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.8439576 <a title="224-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Help_or_Hinder%3A_Bayesian_Models_of_Social_Goal_Inference.html">107 nips-2009-Help or Hinder: Bayesian Models of Social Goal Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Tomer Ullman, Chris Baker, Owen Macindoe, Owain Evans, Noah Goodman, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Everyday social interactions are heavily inﬂuenced by our snap judgments about others’ goals. Even young infants can infer the goals of intentional agents from observing how they interact with objects and other agents in their environment: e.g., that one agent is ‘helping’ or ‘hindering’ another’s attempt to get up a hill or open a box. We propose a model for how people can infer these social goals from actions, based on inverse planning in multiagent Markov decision problems (MDPs). The model infers the goal most likely to be driving an agent’s behavior by assuming the agent acts approximately rationally given environmental constraints and its model of other agents present. We also present behavioral evidence in support of this model over a simpler, perceptual cue-based alternative. 1</p><p>5 0.82206196 <a title="224-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-On_Learning_Rotations.html">177 nips-2009-On Learning Rotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Raman Arora</p><p>Abstract: An algorithm is presented for online learning of rotations. The proposed algorithm involves matrix exponentiated gradient updates and is motivated by the von Neumann divergence. The multiplicative updates are exponentiated skew-symmetric matrices which comprise the Lie algebra of the rotation group. The orthonormality and unit determinant of the matrix parameter are preserved using matrix logarithms and exponentials and the algorithm lends itself to intuitive interpretation in terms of the differential geometry of the manifold associated with the rotation group. A complexity reduction result is presented that exploits the eigenstructure of the matrix updates to simplify matrix exponentiation to a quadratic form. 1</p><p>6 0.8158626 <a title="224-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_in_Markov_Random_Fields_using_Tempered_Transitions.html">132 nips-2009-Learning in Markov Random Fields using Tempered Transitions</a></p>

</p><p>5 1  Introduction  The Indian buffet process (IBP) is an inﬁnitely exchangeable distribution over binary matrices with a ﬁnite number of rows and an unbounded number of columns [1, 2]. [sent-9, score-0.277]
</p><p>6 Using the usual analogy of customers entering an Indian buffet restaurant and sequentially choosing dishes from an inﬁnitely long buffet counter, our generalization with parameters α > 0, c > −σ and σ ∈ [0, 1) is simply as follows: • Customer 1 tries Poisson(α) dishes. [sent-13, score-0.634]
</p><p>7 • Subsequently, customer n + 1: – tries dish k with probability mk −σ , for each dish that has previously been tried; n+c Γ(1+c)Γ(n+c+σ) – tries Poisson(α Γ(n+1+c)Γ(c+σ) ) new dishes. [sent-14, score-0.493]
</p><p>8 where mk is the number of previous customers who tried dish k. [sent-15, score-0.455]
</p><p>9 The dishes and the customers correspond to the columns and the rows of the binary matrix respectively, with an entry of the matrix being one if the corresponding customer tried the dish (and zero otherwise). [sent-16, score-0.539]
</p><p>10 The mass parameter α controls the total number of dishes tried by the customers, the concentration parameter c controls the number of customers that will try each dish, and the stability exponent σ controls the power-law behavior of the process. [sent-17, score-0.606]
</p><p>11 These examples are all based on the Pitman-Yor process [11, 12, 13], a generalization of the Dirichlet process [14] with power-law properties. [sent-21, score-0.239]
</p><p>12 The approach we take in this paper is to ﬁrst deﬁne the underlying de Finetti measure, then to derive the conditional distributions of Bernoulli process observations with the de Finetti measure integrated out. [sent-23, score-0.154]
</p><p>13 It is a novel generalization of the beta process [15] (which is the de Finetti measure of the normal two-parameter IBP [16]) with characteristics reminiscent of the stable process [17, 11] (in turn related to the Pitman-Yor process). [sent-26, score-0.536]
</p><p>14 In the following section we ﬁrst give a brief description of completely random measures, a class of random measures which includes the stable-beta and the beta processes. [sent-28, score-0.287]
</p><p>15 In Section 3 we introduce the stable-beta process, a three parameter generalization of the beta process and derive the powerlaw IBP based on the stable-beta process. [sent-29, score-0.331]
</p><p>16 Based on the proposed model, in Section 4 we construct a model of word occurrences in a document corpus. [sent-30, score-0.169]
</p><p>17 A completely random measure (CRM) µ over (Θ, Ω) is a random measure such that µ(A)⊥ ⊥µ(B) for all disjoint measurable subsets A, B ∈ Ω. [sent-35, score-0.196]
</p><p>18 CRMs can always be decomposed into a sum of three independent parts: a (non-random) measure, an atomic measure with ﬁxed atoms but random masses, and an atomic measure with random atoms and masses. [sent-38, score-0.764]
</p><p>19 In this case we can write µ in the form, N  µ=  M  uk δφk + k=1  vl δψl ,  (1)  l=1  where uk , vl > 0 are the random masses, φk ∈ Θ are the ﬁxed atoms, ψl ∈ Θ are the random atoms, and N, M ∈ N ∪ {∞}. [sent-40, score-0.876]
</p><p>20 The random atoms and their weights {vl , ψl } are jointly drawn from a 2D Poisson process over (0, ∞] × Θ with some nonatomic rate measure Λ called the L´ vy measure. [sent-43, score-0.601]
</p><p>21 If Θ (0,∞] Λ(du × dθ) = M ∗ < ∞ then the number of random atoms M in µ is Poisson distributed with mean M ∗ , otherwise there are an inﬁnite number of random atoms. [sent-45, score-0.334]
</p><p>22 The mass parameter controls the overall mass of the process and the base distribution gives the distribution over the random atom locations. [sent-49, score-0.394]
</p><p>23 When σ = 0 the SBP does not have power-law behavior and reduces to a normal two-parameter beta process [15, 16]. [sent-53, score-0.326]
</p><p>24 When c = 1 − σ the stable-beta process describes the random atoms with masses < 1 in a stable process [17, 11]. [sent-54, score-0.633]
</p><p>25 The SBP is so named as it can be seen as a generalization of both the stable and the beta processes. [sent-55, score-0.254]
</p><p>26 (4)  The random measure µ is a SBP with no ﬁxed atoms and with L´ vy measure (3), while Zi ∼ e BernoulliP(µ) is a Bernoulli process with mean µ [16]. [sent-62, score-0.652]
</p><p>27 This is also a CRM: in a small neighborhood dθ around θ ∈ Θ it has a probability µ(dθ) of having a unit mass atom in dθ; otherwise it does not have an atom in dθ. [sent-63, score-0.279]
</p><p>28 If µ has an atom at θ the probability of Zi having an atom at θ as well is µ({θ}). [sent-64, score-0.226]
</p><p>29 If µ has a smooth component, say µ0 , Zi will have random atoms drawn from a Poisson process with rate measure µ0 . [sent-65, score-0.48]
</p><p>30 In typical applications to featural models the atoms in Zi give the features associated with data item i, while the weights of the atoms in µ give the prior probabilities of the corresponding features occurring in a data item. [sent-66, score-0.644]
</p><p>31 , Zn is still a CRM, but now including ﬁxed atoms given by θ1 , . [sent-85, score-0.286]
</p><p>32 Its updated ∗ L´ vy measure and the distribution of the mass at each ﬁxed atom θk are, e ∗ µ|Z1 , . [sent-89, score-0.374]
</p><p>33 Γ(mk − σ)Γ(n − mk + c + σ)  Λn (du × dθ) =α  (6a) (6b)  Intuitively, the posterior is obtained as follows. [sent-93, score-0.177]
</p><p>34 Secondly, ∗ µ must have ﬁxed atoms at each θk since otherwise the probability that there will be atoms among ∗ ∗ Z1 , . [sent-95, score-0.594]
</p><p>35 The posterior mass at θk is obtained by multiplying a Bernoulli ∗ mk n−mk (since there are mk occurrences of the atom θk among Z1 , . [sent-99, score-0.579]
</p><p>36 Finally, outside of these K atoms there are no other atoms among Z1 , . [sent-103, score-0.594]
</p><p>37 We can think of this as n observations of 0 among n iid Bernoulli variables, so a “likelihood” of (1 − u)n is multiplied into Λ0 (without normalization), giving the updated L´ vy measure in (6a). [sent-107, score-0.253]
</p><p>38 e Let us inspect the distributions (6) of the ﬁxed and random atoms in the posterior µ in turn. [sent-108, score-0.345]
</p><p>39 The ∗ random mass at θk has a distribution Fnk which is simply a beta distribution with parameters (mk − σ, n − mk + c + σ). [sent-109, score-0.414]
</p><p>40 This differs from the usual beta process in the subtraction of σ from mk and addition of σ to n − mk + c. [sent-110, score-0.604]
</p><p>41 This is reminiscent of the Pitman-Yor generalization to the Dirichlet process [11, 12, 13], where a discount parameter is subtracted from the number of customers seated around each table, and added to the chance of sitting at a new table. [sent-111, score-0.299]
</p><p>42 On the other hand, the L´ vy e measure of the random atoms of µ is still a L´ vy measure corresponding to an SBP with updated e parameters Γ(1 + c)Γ(n + c + σ) , Γ(n + 1 + c)Γ(c + σ) c ← c + n,  α ←α  3  σ ←σ H ← H. [sent-112, score-0.706]
</p><p>43 In summary, the posterior of µ is simply an independent sum of an SBP with updated parameters and of ﬁxed atoms with beta distributed masses. [sent-117, score-0.536]
</p><p>44 This is different from the beta process and again reminiscent of Pitman-Yor processes, where the posterior is also a sum of a Pitman-Yor process with updated parameters and ﬁxed atoms with random masses, but not a Pitman-Yor process [11]. [sent-120, score-0.894]
</p><p>45 In the next subsections we describe an Indian buffet process and a stick-breaking construction corresponding to the SBP. [sent-122, score-0.251]
</p><p>46 Efﬁcient inference techniques based on both representations for the beta process can be straightforwardly generalized to the SBP [1, 16, 21]. [sent-123, score-0.298]
</p><p>47 2  The Stable-beta Indian Buffet Process  We can derive an Indian buffet process (IBP) corresponding to the SBP by deriving, for each n, the distribution of Zn+1 conditioned on Z1 , . [sent-125, score-0.224]
</p><p>48 This derivation is ∗ straightforward and follows closely that for the beta process [16]. [sent-129, score-0.298]

</p><p>50 , Zn ] =  mk − σ n+c  (8)  Metaphorically speaking, customer n + 1 tries dish k with probability mk −σ . [sent-140, score-0.486]
</p><p>51 , Zn ] = 0 1  =  uα 0  Γ(1 + c) u−1−σ (1 − u)n+c+σ−1 duH(dθ) Γ(1 − σ)Γ(c + σ)  1 Γ(1 + c) H(dθ) u−σ (1 − u)n+c+σ−1 du Γ(1 − σ)Γ(c + σ) 0 Γ(1 + c)Γ(n + c + σ) H(dθ) =α Γ(n + 1 + c)Γ(c + σ)  =α  (9)  ∗ ∗ Since Zn+1 is completely random and H is smooth, the above shows that on Θ\{θ1 , . [sent-152, score-0.17]
</p><p>52 In the IBP metaphor, this corresponds to customer n+1 trying new dishes, with each dish associated with a new draw from H. [sent-157, score-0.201]
</p><p>53 The resulting Indian buffet process is as described in the introduction. [sent-158, score-0.224]
</p><p>54 , Zn ) = exp −α i=1  (10)  k=1  ∗ ∗ where there are K atoms (dishes) θ1 , . [sent-166, score-0.286]

</p><p>56 terms in [1] are absent as we have to distinguish among these Kh dishes in assigning each of them a distinct atom (this ∗ also contributes the h(θk ) terms). [sent-175, score-0.308]
</p><p>57 3  Stick-breaking constructions  In this section we describe stick-breaking constructions for the SBP generalizing those for the beta process. [sent-181, score-0.274]
</p><p>58 The ﬁrst is based on the size-biased ordering of atoms induced by the IBP [16], while 4  the second is based on the inverse L´ vy measure method [22], and produces a sequence of random e atoms of strictly decreasing masses [21]. [sent-182, score-0.875]
</p><p>59 The size-biased construction is straightforward: we use the IBP to generate the atoms (dishes) in the SBP; each time a dish is newly generated the atom is drawn from H and its mass from Fnk . [sent-183, score-0.602]
</p><p>60 n=1 k=1  The inverse L´ vy measure is a general method of generating from a Poisson process with none uniform rate measure. [sent-191, score-0.291]
</p><p>61 The L´ vy measure Λ0 of e the SBP factorizes into a product Λ0 (du × dθ) = L(du)H(dθ) of a σ-ﬁnite measure L(du) = Γ(1+c) α Γ(1−σ)Γ(c+σ) u−σ−1 (1−u)c+σ−1 du over (0, 1) and a probability measure H over Θ. [sent-194, score-0.408]
</p><p>62 This implies that we can generate a sample {vl , ψl }∞ of the random atoms of µ and their masses by ﬁrst saml=1 pling the masses {vl }∞ ∼ PoissonP(L) from a Poisson process on (0, 1) with rate measure L, and l=1 associating each vl with an iid draw ψl ∼ H [19]. [sent-195, score-1.059]
</p><p>63 Transforming back with vl = T −1 (tl ), ∞ we have {vl }l=1 ∼ PoissonP(L). [sent-200, score-0.39]
</p><p>64 Deriving the density of vl given vl−1 , we get: p(vl |vl−1 ) =  dtl dvl  Γ(1+c) −σ−1 p(tl |tl−1 ) = α Γ(1−σ)Γ(c+σ) vl (1−vl )c+σ−1 exp −  vl−1  L(du) . [sent-208, score-0.78]
</p><p>65 (13) vl  In general these densities do not simplify and we have to resort to solving for T −1 (tl ) numerically. [sent-209, score-0.39]
</p><p>66 In the stable process case when c = 1 − σ and σ = 0, the density of vl simpliﬁes to: Γ(2−σ) −σ−1 p(vl | vl−1 ) = α Γ(1−σ)Γ(1) vl × exp −σ−1 = α(1 − σ)vl exp  −  −  vl−1 vl  Γ(2−σ) α Γ(1−σ)Γ(1) u−σ−1 du  α(1−σ) −σ (vl σ  −σ − vl−1 ) . [sent-212, score-1.417]
</p><p>67 (14)  −σ Doing a change of values to yl = vl , we get:  p(yl |yl−1 ) = α 1−σ exp σ  − α 1−σ (yl − yl−1 ) . [sent-213, score-0.459]
</p><p>68 In this section we shall assume σ > 0 since the case σ = 0 reduces the SBP to the usual beta process with less interesting power-law properties. [sent-219, score-0.32]

</p><p>74 Asymptotically we can show that the proportion of dishes tried by m customers is O(m−1−σ ). [sent-232, score-0.363]

</p><p>77 Let Zi ({θ}) = 1 if word type θ occurs in document i and 0 otherwise, and let µ({θ}) be the occurrence probability of word type θ among the documents in the corpus. [sent-239, score-0.313]
</p><p>78 We use the hierarchical model (4) with a SBP prior1 on µ and with each document modeled as a conditionally independent Bernoulli process draw. [sent-240, score-0.169]
</p><p>79 We use the popularity of each word type across all 20 newsgroups as the base distribution2 : for each word type θ let nθ be the number of documents containing θ and let H({θ}) ∝ nθ . [sent-247, score-0.273]
</p><p>80 In the ﬁrst experiment we compared the SBP to the beta process by ﬁtting the parameters α, c and σ of both models to each newsgroup by maximum likelihood (in beta process case σ is ﬁxed at 0) . [sent-248, score-0.627]

<p>Author: Finale Doshi-velez, Shakir Mohamed, Zoubin Ghahramani, David A.

Unfortunately, the high-dimensional averages required for Bayesian methods can be slow, especially with the unbounded representations used by nonparametric models. We address the challenge of scaling Bayesian inference to the increasingly large datasets found in real-world applications. We focus on parallelisation of inference in the Indian Buffet Process (IBP), which allows data points to have an unbounded number of sparse latent features.

<p>Author: Kurt Miller, Michael I. Jordan, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: As the availability and importance of relational data—such as the friendships summarized on a social networking website—increases, it becomes increasingly important to have good models for such data. The kinds of latent structure that have been considered for use in predicting links in such networks have been relatively limited. In particular, the machine learning community has focused on latent class models, adapting Bayesian nonparametric methods to jointly infer how many latent classes there are while learning which entities belong to each class. We pursue a similar approach with a richer kind of latent variable—latent features—using a Bayesian nonparametric approach to simultaneously infer the number of features at the same time we learn which entities have each feature. Our model combines these inferred features with known covariates in order to perform link prediction. We demonstrate that the greater expressiveness of this approach allows us to improve performance on three datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.10215394 <a title="114-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Multi-Label_Prediction_via_Sparse_Infinite_CCA.html">158 nips-2009-Multi-Label Prediction via Sparse Infinite CCA</a></p>

<p>Author: Francois Caron, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: Over recent years Dirichlet processes and the associated Chinese restaurant process (CRP) have found many applications in clustering while the Indian buffet process (IBP) is increasingly used to describe latent feature models. These models are attractive because they ensure exchangeability (over samples). We propose here extensions of these models where the dependency between samples is given by a known decomposable graph. These models have appealing properties and can be easily learned using Monte Carlo techniques. 1 Motivation The CRP and IBP have found numerous applications in machine learning over recent years [5, 10]. We consider here the case where the data we are interested in are ‘locally’ dependent; these dependencies being represented by a known graph G where each data point/object is associated to a vertex. These local dependencies can correspond to any conceptual or real (e.g. space, time) metric. For example, in the context of clustering, we might want to propose a prior distribution on partitions enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to be in the same cluster. Similarly, in the context of latent feature models, we might be interested in a prior distribution on features enforcing that data which are ‘close’ in the graph are more likely to possess similar features. The ‘standard’ CRP and IBP correspond to the case where the graph G is complete; that is it is fully connected. In this paper, we generalize the CRP and IBP to decomposable graphs. The resulting generalized versions of the CRP and IBP enjoy attractive properties. Each clique of the graph follows marginally a CRP or an IBP process and explicit expressions for the joint prior distribution on the graph is available. It makes it easy to learn those models using straightforward generalizations of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) or Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithms proposed to perform inference for the CRP and IBP [5, 10, 14]. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the popular Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and the Dirichlet Process (DP) partition distribution. We propose an extension of these two models to decomposable graphical models. In Section 3 we discuss nonparametric latent feature models, reviewing brieﬂy the construction in [5] and extending it to decomposable graphs. We demonstrate these models in Section 4 on two applications: an alternative to the hierarchical DP model [12] and a time-varying matrix factorization problem. 2 Prior distributions for partitions on decomposable graphs Assume we have n observations. When performing clustering, we associate to each of this observation an allocation variable zi ∈ [K] = {1, . . . , K}. Let Πn be the partition of [n] = {1, . . . , n} deﬁned by the equivalence relation i ↔ j ⇔ zi = zj . The resulting partition Πn = {A1 , . . . , An(Πn ) } 1 is an unordered collection of disjoint non-empty subsets Aj of [n], j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), where ∪j Aj = [n] and n(Πn ) is the number of subsets for partition Πn . We also denote by Pn be the set of all partitions of [n] and let nj , j = 1, . . . , n(Πn ), be the size of the subset Aj . Each allocation variable zi is associated to a vertex/site of an undirected graph G, which is assumed to be known. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we ﬁrst review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on z1:n , equivalently on Πn . We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs; see [2, 8] for an introduction to decomposable graphs. Finally we brieﬂy discuss the directed case. Note that the models proposed here are completely different from the hyper multinomial-Dirichlet in [2] and its recent DP extension [6]. 2.1 Dirichlet multinomial allocation model and DP partition distribution Assume for the time being that K is ﬁnite. When the graph is complete, a popular choice for the allocation variables is to consider a Dirichlet multinomial allocation model [11] θ θ , . . . , ), zi |π ∼ π (1) K K where D is the standard Dirichlet distribution and θ > 0. Integrating out π, we obtain the following Dirichlet multinomial prior distribution π ∼ D( Pr(z1:n ) = K j=1 Γ(θ) Γ(nj + θ K) (2) θ Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )K and then, using the straightforward equality Pr(Πn ) = PK where PK = {Πn ∈ Pn |n(Πn ) ≤ K}, we obtain K! (K−n(Πn ))! Pr(z1:n ) valid for for all Πn ∈ n(Π ) Pr(Πn ) = θ Γ(θ) j=1n Γ(nj + K ) K! . θ (K − n(Πn ))! Γ(θ + n)Γ( K )n(Πn ) (3) DP may be seen as a generalization of the Dirichlet multinomial model when the number of components K → ∞; see for example [10]. In this case the distribution over the partition Πn of [n] is given by [11] n(Π ) θn(Πn ) j=1n Γ(nj ) . (4) Pr(Πn ) = n i=1 (θ + i − 1) Let Π−k = {A1,−k , . . . , An(Π−k ),−k } be the partition induced by removing item k to Πn and nj,−k be the size of cluster j for j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ). It follows from (4) that an item k is assigned to an existing cluster j, j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to nj,−k / (n − 1 + θ) and forms a new cluster with probability θ/ (n − 1 + θ). This property is the basis of the CRP. We now extend the Dirichlet multinomial allocation and the DP partition distribution models to decomposable graphs. 2.2 Markov combination of Dirichlet multinomial and DP partition distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. It can be easily checked that if the marginal distribution of zC for each clique C ∈ C is deﬁned by (2) then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (2) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Dirichlet multinomial distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(zC ) S∈S Pr(zS ) C∈C Pr(z1:n ) = (5) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, we have Pr(zB ) given by (2). It follows that we have for any Πn ∈ PK Γ(θ) K! Pr(Πn ) = (K − n(Πn ))! C∈C Γ(θ) S∈S 2 K j=1 θ Γ(nj,C + K ) θ Γ(θ+nC )Γ( K )K K j=1 θ Γ(nj,S + K ) θ Γ(θ+nS )Γ( K )K (6) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items associated to cluster j, j = 1, . . . , K in B and nB is the total number of items in B. Within each complete set B, the allocation variables deﬁne a partition distributed according to the Dirichlet-multinomial distribution. We now extend this approach to DP partition distributions; that is we derive a joint distribution over Πn such that the distribution of ΠB over each complete set B of the graph is given by (4) with θ > 0. Such a distribution satisﬁes the consistency condition over the separators as the restriction of any partition distributed according to (4) still follows (4) [7]. G Proposition. Let Pn be the set of partitions Πn ∈ Pn such that for each decomposition A, B, and any (i, j) ∈ A × B, i ↔ j ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that k ↔ i ↔ j. As K → ∞, the prior distribution G over partitions (6) is given for each Πn ∈ Pn by Pr(Πn ) = θn(Πn ) n(ΠC ) Γ(nj,C ) j=1 nC i=1 (θ+i−1) n(ΠS ) Γ(nj,S ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 C∈C S∈S (7) where n(ΠB ) is the number of clusters in the complete set B. Proof. From (6), we have θ n(ΠC ) K(K − 1) . . . (K − n(Πn ) + 1) Pr(Πn ) = K C∈C n(ΠC )− S∈S n(ΠS ) C∈C θ n(ΠS ) S∈S n(ΠC ) θ Γ(nj,C + K ) j=1 nC (θ+i−1) i=1 n(ΠS ) θ Γ(nj,S + K ) j=1 nS (θ+i−1) i=1 Thus when K → ∞, we obtain (7) if n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) and 0 otherwise. We have n(Πn ) ≤ C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) for any Πn ∈ Pn and the subset of Pn verifying G n(Πn ) = C∈C n(ΠC ) − S∈S n(ΠS ) corresponds to the set Pn . Example. Let the notation i ∼ j (resp. i j) indicates an edge (resp. no edge) between two sites. Let n = 3 and G be the decomposable graph deﬁned by the relations 1 ∼ 2, 2 ∼ 3 and 1 3. G The set P3 is then equal to {{{1, 2, 3}}; {{1, 2}, {3}}; {{1}, {2, 3}}; {{1}, {2}, {3}}}. Note that G the partition {{1, 3}, {2}} does not belong to P3 . Indeed, as there is no edge between 1 and 3, they cannot be in the same cluster if 2 is in another cluster. The cliques are C1 = {1, 2} and C2 = {2, 3} Pr(ΠC1 ) Pr(ΠC2 ) hence we can and the separator is S2 = {2}. The distribution is given by Pr(Π3 ) = Pr(ΠS ) 2 check that we obtain Pr({1, 2, 3}) = (θ + 1)−2 , Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = Pr({1, 2}, {3}) = θ(θ + 1)−2 and Pr({1}, {2}, {3}) = θ2 (θ + 1)−2 . Let now deﬁne the full conditional distributions. Based on (7) the conditional assignment of an item k is proportional to the conditional over the cliques divided by the conditional over the separators. G Let denote G−k the undirected graph obtained by removing vertex k from G. Suppose that Πn ∈ Pn . G−k If Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , then do not change the value of item k. Otherwise, item k is assigned to cluster j / where j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ) with probability proportional to {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (8) and to a new cluster with probability proportional to θ, where n−k,j,C is the number of items in the set C \ {k} belonging to cluster j. The updating process is illustrated by the Chinese wedding party process1 in Fig. 1. The results of this section can be extended to the Pitman-Yor process, and more generally to species sampling models. Example (continuing). Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1}, A2 = {3}}, we have −1 Pr( item 2 assigned to A1 = {1}| Π−2 ) = Pr( item 2 assigned to A2 = {3}| Π−2 ) = (θ + 2) −1 and Pr( item 2 assigned to new cluster A3 | Π−2 ) = θ (θ + 2) . Given Π−2 = {A1 = {1, 3}}, item 2 is assigned to A1 with probability 1. 1 Note that this representation describes the full conditionals while the CRP represents the sequential updat- ing. 3 (a) (b) (d) (c) (e) Figure 1: Chinese wedding party. Consider a group of n guests attending a wedding party. Each of the n guests may belong to one or several cliques, i.e. maximal groups of people such that everybody knows everybody. The belonging of each guest to the different cliques is represented by color patches on the ﬁgures, and the graphical representation of the relationship between the guests is represented by the graphical model (e). (a) Suppose that the guests are already seated such that two guests cannot be together at the same table is they are not part of the same clique, or if there does not exist a group of other guests such that they are related (“Any friend of yours is a friend of mine”). (b) The guest number k leaves his table and either (c) joins a table where there are guests from the same clique as him, with probability proportional to the product of the number of guests from each clique over the product of the number of guests belonging to several cliques on that table or (d) he joins a new table with probability proportional to θ. 2.3 Monte Carlo inference 2.3.1 MCMC algorithm Using the full conditionals, a single site Gibbs sampler can easily be designed to approximate the posterior distribution Pr(Πn |z1:n ). Given a partition Πn , an item k is taken out of the partition. If G−k Π−k ∈ Pn−1 , item k keeps the same value. Otherwise, the item will be assigned to a cluster j, / j = 1, . . . , n(Π−k ), with probability proportional to p(z{k}∪Aj,−k ) × p(zAj,−k ) {C∈C|n−k,j,C >0} n−k,j,C {S∈S|n−k,j,S >0} n−k,j,S (9) and the item will be assigned to a new cluster with probability proportional to p(z{k} ) × θ. Similarly to [3], we can also deﬁne a procedure to sample from p(θ|n(Πn ) = k)). We assume that θ ∼ G(a, b) and use p auxiliary variables x1 , . . . , xp . The procedure is as follows. • For j = 1, . . . , p, sample xj |k, θ ∼ Beta(θ + nSj , nCj − nSj ) • Sample θ|k, x1:p ∼ G(a + k, b − j log xj ) 2.3.2 Sequential Monte Carlo We have so far only treated the case of an undirected decomposable graph G. We can formulate a sequential updating rule for the corresponding perfect directed version D of G. Indeed, let (a1 , . . . a|V | ) be a perfect ordering and pa(ak ) be the set of parents of ak which is by deﬁnition complete. Let Πk−1 = {A1,k−1 , . . . , An(Πk−1 ),k−1 } denote the partition of the ﬁrst k−1 vertices a1:k−1 and let nj,pa(ak ) be the number of elements with value j in the set pa(ak ), j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ). Then the vertex ak joins the set j with probability nj,pa(ak ) / θ + cluster with probability θ/ θ + q q nq,pa(ak ) and creates a new nq,pa(ak ) . One can then design a particle ﬁlter/SMC method in a similar fashion as [4]. Consider a set of (i) (i) (i) (i) N N particles Πk−1 with weights wk−1 ∝ Pr(Πk−1 , z1:k−1 ) ( i=1 wk−1 = 1) that approximate (i) the posterior distribution Pr(Πk−1 |z1:k−1 ). For each particle i, there are n(Πk−1 ) + 1 possible 4 (i,j) allocations for component ak . We denote Πk the partition obtained by associating component ak (i,j) to cluster j. The weight associated to Πk is given by  nj,pa(ak ) (i)  if j = 1, . . . , n(Πk−1 ) θ+ q nq,pa(ak ) (i,j) (i) p(z{ak }∪Aj,k−1 ) wk−1 = wk−1 × (10) (i) θ  θ+ n p(zAj,k−1 ) if j = n(Πk−1 ) + 1 q q,pa(ak ) (i,j) Then we can perform a deterministic resampling step by keeping the N particles Πk with highest (i,j) (i) (i) weights wk−1 . Let Πk be the resampled particles and wk the associated normalized weights. 3 Prior distributions for inﬁnite binary matrices on decomposable graphs Assume we have n objects; each of these objects being associated to the vertex of a graph G. To K each object is associated a K-dimensional binary vector zn = (zn,1 , . . . , zn,K ) ∈ {0, 1} where zn,i = 1 if object n possesses feature i and zn,i = 0 otherwise. These vectors zt form a binary n × K matrix denoted Z1:n . We denote by ξ1:n the associated equivalence class of left-ordered matrices and let EK be the set of left-ordered matrices with at most K features. In the standard case where the graph G is complete, we review brieﬂy here two popular prior distributions on Z1:n , equivalently on ξ1:n : the Beta-Bernoulli model and the IBP [5]. We then extend these models to undirected decomposable graphs. This can be used for example to deﬁne a time-varying IBP as illustrated in Section 4. 3.1 Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions The Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the allocation Z1:n is K Pr(Z1:n ) = α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) α K Γ(nj j=1 (11) where nj is the number of objects having feature j. It follows that Pr(ξ1:n ) = K K! 2n −1 h=0 α K Γ(nj α + K )Γ(n − nj + 1) α Γ(n + 1 + K ) Kh ! j=1 (12) where Kh is the number of features possessing the history h (see [5] for details). The nonparametric model is obtained by taking the limit when K → ∞ Pr(ξ1:n ) = αK K+ + 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! exp(−αHn ) where K + is the total number of features and Hn = 3.2 (n − nj )!(nj − 1)! n! j=1 n 1 k=1 k . (13) The IBP follows from (13). Markov combination of Beta-Bernoulli and IBP distributions Let G be a decomposable undirected graph, C = {C1 , . . . , Cp } a perfect ordering of the cliques and S = {S2 , . . . , Cp } the associated separators. As in the Dirichlet-multinomial case, it is easily seen that if for each clique C ∈ C, the marginal distribution is deﬁned by (11), then these distributions are consistent as they yield the same distribution (11) over the separators. Therefore, the unique Markov distribution over G with Beta-Bernoulli distribution over the cliques is deﬁned by [8] Pr(ZC ) S∈S Pr(ZS ) C∈C Pr(Z1:n ) = (14) where Pr(ZB ) given by (11) for each complete set B ⊆ G. The prior over ξ1:n is thus given, for ξ1:n ∈ EK , by Pr(ξ1:n ) = K! 2n −1 h=0 Kh ! α K α Γ(nj,C + K )Γ(nC −nj,C +1) α Γ(nC +1+ K ) α α Γ(nj,S + K )Γ(nS −nj,S +1) K K α j=1 Γ(nS +1+ K ) K j=1 C∈C S∈S 5 (15) where for each complete set B ⊆ G, nj,B is the number of items having feature j, j = 1, . . . , K in the set B and nB is the whole set of objects in set B. Taking the limit when K → ∞, we obtain after a few calculations Pr(ξ1:n ) = α + K[n] exp [−α ( C HnC − 2n −1 h=1 Kh ! HnS )] × C∈C + KC (nC −nj,C )!(nj,C −1)! j=1 nC ! S∈S S + KS (nS −nj,S )!(nj,S −1)! j=1 nS ! + + + + if K[n] = C KC − S KS and 0 otherwise, where KB is the number of different features possessed by objects in B. G Let En be the subset of En such that for each decomposition A, B and any (u, v) ∈ A × B: {u and v possess feature j} ⇒ ∃k ∈ A ∩ B such that {k possesses feature j}. Let ξ−k be the left-ordered + matrix obtained by removing object k from ξn and K−k be the total number of different features in G−k + ξ−k . For each feature j = 1, . . . , K−k , if ξ−k ∈ En−1 then we have   b C∈C nj,C if i = 1 S∈C nj,S Pr(ξk,j = i) = (16)  b C∈C (nC −nj,C ) if i = 0 (nS −nj,S ) S∈C nS where b is the appropriate normalizing constant then the customer k tries Poisson α {S∈S|k∈S} nC {C∈C|k∈C} new dishes. We can easily generalize this construction to a directed version D of G using arguments similar to those presented in Section 2; see Section 4 for an application to time-varying matrix factorization. 4 4.1 Applications Sharing clusters among relative groups: An alternative to HDP Consider that we are given d groups with nj data yi,j in each group, i = 1, . . . , nj , j = 1, . . . , d. We consider latent cluster variables zi,j that deﬁne the partition of the data. We will use alternatively the notation θi,j = Uzi,j in the following. Hierarchical Dirichlet Process [12] (HDP) is a very popular model for sharing clusters among related groups. It is based on a hierarchy of DPs G0 ∼ DP (γ, H), Gj |G0 ∼ DP (α, G0 ) j = 1, . . . d θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj . Under conjugacy assumptions, G0 , Gj and U can be integrated out and we can approximate the marginal posterior of (zi,j ) given y = (yi,j ) with Gibbs sampling using the Chinese restaurant franchise to sample from the full conditional p(zi,j |z−{i,j} , y). Using the graph formulation deﬁned in Section 2, we propose an alternative to HDP. Let θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N be N auxiliary variables belonging to what we call group 0. We deﬁne each clique Cj (j = 1, . . . , d) to be composed of elements from group j and elements from group 0. This deﬁnes a decomposable graphical model whose separator is given by the elements of group 0. We can rewrite the model in a way quite similar to HDP G0 ∼ DP (α, H), θ0,i |G0 ∼ G0 i = 1, ..., N α α Gj |θ0,1 , . . . , θ0,N ∼ DP (α + N, α+N H + α+N θi,j |Gj ∼ Gj , yi,j |θi,j ∼ f (θi,j ) i = 1, . . . , nj N i=1 δθ0,i ) j = 1, . . . d, N For any subset A and j = k ∈ {1, . . . , p} we have corr(Gj (A), Gk (A)) = α+N . Again, under conjugacy conditions, we can integrate out G0 , Gj and U and approximate the marginal posterior distribution over the partition using the Chinese wedding party process deﬁned in Section 2. Note that for latent variables zi,j , j = 1, . . . , d, associated to data, this is the usual CRP update. As in HDP, multiple layers can be added to the model. Figures 2 (a) and (b) resp. give the graphical DP alternative to HDP and 2-layer HDP. 6 z0 root z0 root corpora docs z1 z2 z1 z2 z3 z1,1 z1,2 z2,1 z2,2 z2,3 docs (a) Graphical DP alternative to HDP (b) Graphical DP alternative to 2-layer HDP Figure 2: Hierarchical Graphs of dependency with (a) one layer and (b) two layers of hierarchy. If N = 0, then Gj ∼ DP (α, H) for all j and this is equivalent to setting γ → ∞ in HDP. If N → ∞ then Gj = G0 for all j, G0 ∼ DP (α, H). This is equivalent to setting α → ∞ in the HDP. One interesting feature of the model is that, contrary to HDP, the marginal distribution of Gj at any layer of the tree is DP (α, H). As a consequence, the total number of clusters scales logarithmically (as in the usual DP) with the size of each group, whereas it scales doubly logarithmically in HDP. Contrary to HDP, there are at most N clusters shared between different groups. Our model is in that sense reminiscent of [9] where only a limited number of clusters can be shared. Note however that contrary to [9] we have a simple CRP-like process. The proposed methodology can be straightforwardly extended to the inﬁnite HMM [12]. The main issue of the proposed model is the setting of the number N of auxiliary parameters. Another issue is that to achieve high correlation, we need a large number of auxiliary variables. Nonetheless, the computational time used to sample from auxiliary variables is negligible compared to the time used for latent variables associated to data. Moreover, it can be easily parallelized. The model proposed offers a far richer framework and ensures that at each level of the tree, the marginal distribution of the partition is given by a DP partition model. 4.2 Time-varying matrix factorization Let X1:n be an observed matrix of dimension n × D. We want to ﬁnd a representation of this matrix in terms of two latent matrices Z1:n of dimension n × K and Y of dimension K × D. Here Z1:n 2 is a binary matrix whereas Y is a matrix of latent features. By assuming that Y ∼ N 0, σY IK×D and 2 X1:n = Z1:n Y + σX εn where εn ∼ N 0, σX In×D , we obtain p(X1:n |Z1:n ) ∝ −D/2 2 2 + Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn 1:n 1:n + (n−Kn )D σX exp − + Kn D σY 2 2 + where Σ−1 = I − Z+ Z+T Z+ + σX /σY IKn n 1:n 1:n 1:n −1 1 T −1 2 tr X1:n Σn X1:n 2σX (17) + Z+T , Kn the number of non-zero columns of 1:n + Z1:n and Z+ is the ﬁrst Kn columns of Z1:n . To avoid having to set K, [5, 14] assume that Z1:n 1:n follows an IBP. The resulting posterior distribution p(Z1:n |X1:n ) can be estimated through MCMC [5] or SMC [14]. We consider here a different model where the object Xt is assumed to arrive at time index t and we want a prior distribution on Z1:n ensuring that objects close in time are more likely to possess similar features. To achieve this, we consider the simple directed graphical model D of Fig. 3 where the site numbering corresponds to a time index in that case and a perfect numbering of D is (1, 2, . . .). The set of parents pa(t) is composed of the r preceding sites {{t − r}, . . . , {t − 1}}. The time-varying IBP to sample from p(Z1:n ) associated to this directed graph follows from (16) and proceeds as follows. At time t = 1 + new new • Sample K1 ∼Poisson(α), set z1,i = 1 for i = 1, ..., K1 and set K1 = Knew . At times t = 2, . . . , r n + new ∼Poisson( α ). • For k = 1, . . .

At times t = r + 1, . . . , n n + α new ∼Poisson( r+1 ). • For k = 1, . . . Kt , sample zt,k ∼ Ber( t−r:t−1,k ) and Kt r+1 + Here Kt is the total number of features appearing from time max(1, t − r) to t − 1 and nt−r:t−1,k the restriction of n1:t−1 to the r last customers. Using (17) and the prior distribution of Z1:n which can be sampled using the time-varying IBP described above, we can easily design an SMC method to sample from p(Z1:n |X1:n ). We do not detail it here. Note that contrary to [14], our algorithm does not require inverting a matrix whose dimension grows linearly with the size of the data but only a matrix of dimension r × r. In order to illustrate the model and SMC algorithm, we create 200 6 × 6 images using a ground truth Y consisting of 4 different 6 × 6 latent images. The 200 × 4 binary matrix was generated from Pr(zt,k = 1) = πt,k , where πt = ( .6 .5 0 0 ) if t = 1, . . . , 30, πt = ( .4 .8 .4 0 ) if t = 31, . . . , 50 and πt = ( 0 .3 .6 .6 ) if t = 51, . . . , 200. The order of the model is set to r = 50. The feature occurences Z1:n and true features Y and their estimates are represented in Figure 4. Two spurious features are detected by the model (features 2 and 5 on Fig. 3(c)) but quickly discarded (Fig. 4(d)). The algorithm is able to correctly estimate the varying prior occurences of the features over time.

[1] is a special case of the proposed model when G is given by Fig. 3. The bivariate DP of Walker and Muliere [13] is also a special case when G has only two cliques. In this paper, we have assumed that the structure of the graph was known beforehand and we have shown that many ﬂexible models arise from this framework. It would be interesting in the future to investigate the case where the graphical structure is unknown and must be estimated from the data.

<p>Author: Yee W. Teh, Dilan Gorur</p><p>Abstract: The Indian buffet process (IBP) is an exchangeable distribution over binary matrices used in Bayesian nonparametric featural models. In this paper we propose a three-parameter generalization of the IBP exhibiting power-law behavior. We achieve this by generalizing the beta process (the de Finetti measure of the IBP) to the stable-beta process and deriving the IBP corresponding to it. We ﬁnd interesting relationships between the stable-beta process and the Pitman-Yor process (another stochastic process used in Bayesian nonparametric models with interesting power-law properties). We derive a stick-breaking construction for the stable-beta process, and ﬁnd that our power-law IBP is a good model for word occurrences in document corpora. 1</p><p>2 0.66444719 <a title="114-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Nonparametric_Bayesian_Texture_Learning_and_Synthesis.html">172 nips-2009-Nonparametric Bayesian Texture Learning and Synthesis</a></p>
<p>Author: Long Zhu, Yuanahao Chen, Bill Freeman, Antonio Torralba</p><p>Abstract: We present a nonparametric Bayesian method for texture learning and synthesis. A texture image is represented by a 2D Hidden Markov Model (2DHMM) where the hidden states correspond to the cluster labeling of textons and the transition matrix encodes their spatial layout (the compatibility between adjacent textons). The 2DHMM is coupled with the Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) which allows the number of textons and the complexity of transition matrix grow as the input texture becomes irregular. The HDP makes use of Dirichlet process prior which favors regular textures by penalizing the model complexity. This framework (HDP-2DHMM) learns the texton vocabulary and their spatial layout jointly and automatically. The HDP-2DHMM results in a compact representation of textures which allows fast texture synthesis with comparable rendering quality over the state-of-the-art patch-based rendering methods. We also show that the HDP2DHMM can be applied to perform image segmentation and synthesis. The preliminary results suggest that HDP-2DHMM is generally useful for further applications in low-level vision problems. 1</p><p>3 0.64141029 <a title="114-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Generalization_Errors_and_Learning_Curves_for_Regression_with_Multi-task_Gaussian_Processes.html">101 nips-2009-Generalization Errors and Learning Curves for Regression with Multi-task Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Kian M. Chai</p><p>Abstract: We provide some insights into how task correlations in multi-task Gaussian process (GP) regression affect the generalization error and the learning curve. We analyze the asymmetric two-tasks case, where a secondary task is to help the learning of a primary task. Within this setting, we give bounds on the generalization error and the learning curve of the primary task. Our approach admits intuitive understandings of the multi-task GP by relating it to single-task GPs. For the case of one-dimensional input-space under optimal sampling with data only for the secondary task, the limitations of multi-task GP can be quantiﬁed explicitly. 1</p><p>4 0.60580301 <a title="114-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Particle-based_Variational_Inference_for_Continuous_Systems.html">187 nips-2009-Particle-based Variational Inference for Continuous Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew Frank, Padhraic Smyth, Alexander T. Ihler</p><p>Abstract: Since the development of loopy belief propagation, there has been considerable work on advancing the state of the art for approximate inference over distributions deﬁned on discrete random variables. Improvements include guarantees of convergence, approximations that are provably more accurate, and bounds on the results of exact inference. However, extending these methods to continuous-valued systems has lagged behind. While several methods have been developed to use belief propagation on systems with continuous values, recent advances for discrete variables have not as yet been incorporated. In this context we extend a recently proposed particle-based belief propagation algorithm to provide a general framework for adapting discrete message-passing algorithms to inference in continuous systems. The resulting algorithms behave similarly to their purely discrete counterparts, extending the beneﬁts of these more advanced inference techniques to the continuous domain. 1</p><p>5 0.51664001 <a title="114-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Neural_Implementation_of_Hierarchical_Bayesian_Inference_by_Importance_Sampling.html">162 nips-2009-Neural Implementation of Hierarchical Bayesian Inference by Importance Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Shi, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The goal of perception is to infer the hidden states in the hierarchical process by which sensory data are generated. Human behavior is consistent with the optimal statistical solution to this problem in many tasks, including cue combination and orientation detection. Understanding the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior is of particular importance, since probabilistic computations are notoriously challenging. Here we propose a simple mechanism for Bayesian inference which involves averaging over a few feature detection neurons which ﬁre at a rate determined by their similarity to a sensory stimulus. This mechanism is based on a Monte Carlo method known as importance sampling, commonly used in computer science and statistics. Moreover, a simple extension to recursive importance sampling can be used to perform hierarchical Bayesian inference. We identify a scheme for implementing importance sampling with spiking neurons, and show that this scheme can account for human behavior in cue combination and the oblique effect. 1</p><p>6 0.41996163 <a title="114-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Large_Scale_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Inference%3A_Data_Parallelisation_in_the_Indian_Buffet_Process.html">123 nips-2009-Large Scale Nonparametric Bayesian Inference: Data Parallelisation in the Indian Buffet Process</a></p>

[sent-10, score-0.612]
</p><p>2 For example, tree-reweighted belief propagation (TRW-BP) can be thought of as a linear programming relaxation of an integer program for a given MAP problem [1, 2]. [sent-14, score-0.313]
</p><p>3 We illustrate here instead how it is possible to tighten a given relaxation itself, without impacting its structural complexity. [sent-17, score-0.253]
</p><p>4 Second, we compensate for the relaxation by introducing auxiliary parameters, which we use to restore certain properties, leading to a tighter approximation. [sent-20, score-0.3]
</p><p>5 We shall in fact propose two distinct properties on which a compensation can be based. [sent-21, score-0.581]
</p><p>6 The ﬁrst is based on a simpliﬁed case where a compensation can be guaranteed to yield exact results. [sent-22, score-0.548]
</p><p>7 We further propose an algorithm for ﬁnding such a compensation, that starts with a relaxation and iteratively provides monotonically decreasing upper bounds on the MAP solution (at least empirically). [sent-26, score-0.261]
</p><p>8 , Xn = xn } is an assignment of factor graph variables Xi to states xi , and where a is an index to the factor ψa (Xa ) over the domain Xa ⊆ X. [sent-31, score-0.35]
</p><p>9 3  Relaxation  The structural relaxations that we consider here are based on the relaxation of equivalence constraints from a model M, where an equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj is a factor ψeq (Xi , Xj ) over two variables Xi and Xj that have the same states. [sent-42, score-0.832]
</p><p>10 Further, ψeq (xi , xj ) is 1 if xi = xj and 0 otherwise. [sent-43, score-0.778]
</p><p>11 We call an assignment x valid, with respect to an equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj , if it sets variables Xi and Xj to the same state, and invalid otherwise. [sent-44, score-0.367]
</p><p>12 Note that when we remove an equivalence constraint from a model M, the values map(x) for valid conﬁgurations x do not change, since log 1 = 0. [sent-45, score-0.32]
</p><p>13 Thus, the MAP value after relaxing an equivalence constraint in M is an upper bound on the original MAP value. [sent-48, score-0.396]
</p><p>14 When we now add the factor ψ2 (C, C ′ ) for the ′ equivalence constraint C ≡ C , we have a new model M′ which is equivalent to the original model M, in that an assignment x in M corresponds to an assignment x′ in M′ , where assignment x′ sets a variable and its clone to the same state. [sent-52, score-0.649]
</p><p>15 We note that a number of structural relaxations can be reduced to the removal of equivalence constraints, including relaxations found by deleting edges [6, 7], as well as mini-bucket approximations [5, 4]. [sent-54, score-0.523]
</p><p>16 In fact, the example above can be considered a relaxation where we delete a factor graph edge C → ψ1 , substituting clone C ′ in place of variable C. [sent-55, score-0.264]
</p><p>17 Say that we remove the equivalence constraints in M, resulting in a relaxed model with MAP values r-map(. [sent-59, score-0.293]
</p><p>18 To this end, we introduce into the relaxation additional factors ψij;i (Xi ) and ψij;j (Xj ) for each equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj that we remove. [sent-65, score-0.461]
</p><p>19 These new factors add new parameters into the approximation, which we shall use to recover a weaker notion of equivalence into the model. [sent-67, score-0.332]
</p><p>20 More speciﬁcally, given a set of equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj to relax, we have the original MAP values map(. [sent-68, score-0.267]
</p><p>21 Consider then the case where an optimal assignment x⋆ for the relaxation happens to set variables Xi and Xj to the same state x, for each equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj that we relaxed. [sent-72, score-0.575]
</p><p>22 In this case, the optimal solution for the relaxation is also an optimal solution for the original model, i. [sent-73, score-0.248]
</p><p>23 On the other hand, if a relaxation’s optimal assignment sets Xi and Xj to different states, then it is not a valid assignment for the original model M, as it violates the equivalence constraint and thus has log probability −∞. [sent-76, score-0.543]
</p><p>24 Consider, for a given equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj , the relaxation’s MAP values r-map(Xi = x) and r-map(Xj = x) when we set, respectively, a single variable Xi or Xj to a state x. [sent-77, score-0.288]
</p><p>25 In this case, if there is a MAP assignment that sets variable Xi to a state x, then there is at least a MAP assignment that sets variable Xj to the same state, even if there is no MAP assignment that sets both Xi and Xj to the same state at the same time. [sent-80, score-0.34]
</p><p>26 We now want to identify parameters θ(Xi ) and θ(Xj ) to compensate for a relaxation in this manner. [sent-81, score-0.276]
</p><p>27 To get the intuitions behind these approaches, we consider ﬁrst the simpliﬁed case where a single equivalence constraint is relaxed. [sent-83, score-0.282]
</p><p>28 1  Intuitions: Splitting a Model into Two  Consider the case where relaxing a single equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj splits a model M into two independent sub-models, Mi and Mj , where sub-model Mi contains variable Xi and sub-model Mj contains variable Xj . [sent-85, score-0.331]
</p><p>29 Since sub-models Mi and Mj become independent after relaxing the single equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj , computing these parameters is sufﬁcient to reconstruct the MAP solution for the original model M. [sent-89, score-0.369]
</p><p>30 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing an equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj that split M into two independent sub-models. [sent-97, score-0.898]
</p><p>31 Then the compensation has parameters satisfying Equation 1 iff c-map(Xi = x) = c-map(Xj = x) = map(Xi = x, Xj = x) + γ. [sent-98, score-0.594]
</p><p>32 In the case where relaxing an equivalence constraint does not split a model into two, a compensation satisfying Equation 1 at least satisﬁes a weaker notion of equivalence. [sent-100, score-0.954]
</p><p>33 We might expect that such a compensation may lead to more meaningful, and hopefully more accurate, approximations than a relaxation. [sent-101, score-0.596]
</p><p>34 Indeed, this compensation will eventually lead to a generalized class of belief propagation approximations. [sent-102, score-0.675]
</p><p>35 Thus, we call a compensation satisfying Equation 1 a REC - BP approximation. [sent-103, score-0.578]
</p><p>36 If a compensation has valid conﬁgurations, then its optimal solution sets variables Xi and Xj to the same state, and is thus a valid assignment for the original instance (it satisﬁes the equivalence constraint). [sent-110, score-0.983]
</p><p>37 Moreover, if it has scaled values, then the compensation further allows us to recover the MAP value as well. [sent-111, score-0.589]
</p><p>38 A compensation having valid conﬁgurations and scaled values is thus ideal as it is sufﬁcient for us to recover the exact solution. [sent-112, score-0.692]
</p><p>39 As the following proposition tells us, if a compensation is an ideal one, then it must at least satisfy Equation 2. [sent-115, score-0.629]
</p><p>40 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing an equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj in M. [sent-118, score-0.898]
</p><p>41 We thus call a compensation satisfying Equation 2 a REC - I compensation. [sent-122, score-0.578]
</p><p>42 In particular, if a compensation happens to satisfy c-map(Xi = x) = c-map(Xj = x) = c-map(Xi = x, Xj = x) for some state x, we have that θ(Xi = x) + θ(Xj = x) = map(Xi = x, Xj = x) (i. [sent-124, score-0.601]
</p><p>43 Before we discuss the general case where we relax multiple equivalence constraints, we highlight ﬁrst a few properties shared by both REC - BP and REC - I compensations, that shall follow from more general results that we shall present. [sent-127, score-0.321]
</p><p>44 First, if the optimal assignment x⋆ for a compensation sets the variables Xi and Xj to the same state, then: (1) the assignment x⋆ is also optimal for the original 1 model M; and (2) 2 c-map⋆ = map⋆ . [sent-128, score-0.81]
</p><p>45 2 Thus, at least in the case where a single equivalence constraint is relaxed, the compensations implied by Equations 1 and 2 do indeed tighten a relaxation (see the auxiliary Appendix for further details). [sent-131, score-0.699]
</p><p>46 3  General Properties  In this section, we identify the conditions that compensations should satisfy in the more general case where multiple equivalence constraints are relaxed, and further highlight some of their properties. [sent-133, score-0.504]
</p><p>47 4  Suppose that k equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj are relaxed from a given model M. [sent-134, score-0.274]
</p><p>48 Then compensations REC - BP and REC - I seek to recover into the relaxation two weaker notions of equivalence. [sent-135, score-0.454]
</p><p>49 First, a REC - BP compensation has auxiliary parameters satisfying: c-map(Xi = x) = c-map(Xj = x) = θ(Xi = x) + θ(Xj = x) + γ where γ =  k ⋆ 1+k c-map . [sent-136, score-0.59]
</p><p>50 ⋆  We then approximate the exact MAP value map by the value  (3) 1 ⋆ 1+k c-map . [sent-137, score-0.262]
</p><p>51 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing enough equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj in M to render it fully disconnected. [sent-141, score-0.895]
</p><p>52 Then a compensation whose parameters satisfy Equation 3 has values exp{c-map(Xi = x)} that correspond to the max-marginals of a ﬁxed-point of max-product belief propagation run on M, and vice-versa. [sent-142, score-0.743]
</p><p>53 Loopy max-product belief propagation is thus the degenerate case of a REC - BP compensation, when the approximation is fully disconnected (by deleting every factor graph edge, as deﬁned in Section 3). [sent-143, score-0.277]
</p><p>54 Next, a REC - I compensation has parameters satisfying: c-map(Xi = x) = c-map(Xj = x) = (1 + k)[θ(Xi = x) + θ(Xj = x)] We again approximate the exact MAP value map⋆ with the value  (4)  1 ⋆ 1+k c-map . [sent-145, score-0.564]
</p><p>55 In both compensations, it is possible to determine if the optimal assignment x⋆ of a compensation is an optimal assignment for the original model M: we need only check that it is a valid assignment. [sent-146, score-0.862]
</p><p>56 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing k equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj . [sent-149, score-0.875]
</p><p>57 A REC - I compensation has additional properties over a REC - BP compensation. [sent-153, score-0.548]
</p><p>58 First, a REC - I compensation yields upper bounds on the MAP value, whereas REC - BP does not yield a bound in general. [sent-154, score-0.623]
</p><p>59 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing k equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj . [sent-157, score-0.875]
</p><p>60 If an assignment x⋆ is optimal for a relaxation with MAP values r-map(. [sent-160, score-0.325]
</p><p>61 , it does not violate the equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj ), then x⋆ is also optimal for M, where r-map(x⋆ ) = map(x⋆ ) (since they are composed of the same factor values). [sent-163, score-0.277]
</p><p>62 If an assignment x⋆ of a relaxation is not valid for model M, then the MAP value of the relaxation is an upper bound on the original MAP value. [sent-164, score-0.589]
</p><p>63 On the other hand, REC - I compensations are tighter approximations than the corresponding relaxation, at least in the case when a single equivalence constraint is relaxed: 1 map⋆ ≤ 2 c-map⋆ ≤ r-map⋆ . [sent-165, score-0.53]
</p><p>64 When we relax multiple equivalence constraints we ﬁnd, at least empirically, that REC - I bounds are never worse than relaxations, although we leave this point open. [sent-166, score-0.298]
</p><p>65 ) denote the MAP values of a compensation that results from relaxing k equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj . [sent-170, score-0.875]
</p><p>66 4, and if z is a partial assignment that sets the same sign to vari1 ables Xi and Xj , for any equivalence constraint Xi ≡ Xj relaxed, then: map(z) ≤ 1+k c-map(z). [sent-172, score-0.349]
</p><p>67 5  Algorithm 1 RelaxEq-and-Compensate (REC) input: a model M with k equivalence constraints Xi ≡ Xj output: a compensation M′ main: 1: M′ ← result of relaxing all Xi ≡ Xj in M 0 2: add to M′ the factors θ(Xi ), θ(Xj ), for each Xi ≡ Xj 0 1 3: initialize all parameters θ0 (Xi = x), θ0 (Xj = x), e. [sent-176, score-0.898]
</p><p>68 Consider, for the case of REC - BP, the fact that parameters satisfy Equation 3 iff they satisfy: θ(Xi = x) = c-map(Xj = x) − θ(Xj = x) − γ θ(Xj = x) = c-map(Xi = x) − θ(Xi = x) − γ This suggests an iterative ﬁxed-point procedure for ﬁnding the parameters of a compensation that satisfy Equation 3. [sent-180, score-0.668]
</p><p>69 First, we start with an initial compensation with MAP values c-map0 (. [sent-181, score-0.567]
</p><p>70 For an iteration t > 0, we can update our parameters using the compensation from the previous iteration: θt (Xi = x) θt (Xj = x)  = c-mapt−1 (Xj = x) − θt−1 (Xj = x) − γt−1 = c-mapt−1 (Xi = x) − θt−1 (Xi = x) − γt−1  (5) (6)  k where γt−1 = 1+k c-map⋆ . [sent-183, score-0.564]
</p><p>71 If at some point, the parameters of one iteration do not change in t−1 the next, then we can say that the iterations have converged, and that the compensation satisﬁes Equation 3. [sent-184, score-0.586]
</p><p>72 Similarly, for REC - I compensations, we use the update equations:  θt (Xi = x) = θt (Xj = x) =  1 1+k c-mapt−1 (Xj = x) − θt−1 (Xj = x) 1 1+k c-mapt−1 (Xi = x) − θt−1 (Xi = x)  (7) (8)  to identify compensations that satisfy Equation 4. [sent-185, score-0.252]
</p><p>73 The 2 1 ⋆ consequence of this is that our initial compensation has the MAP value 1+k c-map0 = r-map⋆ . [sent-190, score-0.548]
</p><p>74 1 That is, the initial compensation is equivalent to the relaxation, for both REC - BP and REC - I. [sent-191, score-0.548]
</p><p>75 On the other hand, by Theorem 3, we know that a REC - I compensation must yield an upper bound on the true MAP value map⋆ . [sent-194, score-0.591]
</p><p>76 Right column: frustrated grids, using REC - BP (top) with a fully disconnected relaxation, and REC - I (bottom) with a relaxation with max cluster size 3. [sent-236, score-0.356]
</p><p>77 6  Experiments  Our goal in this section is to highlight the degree to which different types of compensations can tighten a relaxation, as well as to highlight the differences in the iterative algorithms to ﬁnd them. [sent-237, score-0.312]
</p><p>78 We evaluated our compensations using randomly parametrized 10 × 10 grid networks. [sent-238, score-0.259]
</p><p>79 We judge the quality of an approximation by the degree to which a compensation is able to improve a relaxation. [sent-239, score-0.568]
</p><p>80 We ﬁrst consider grid networks where factors ψa (xi , xj ) were assigned to grid edges (i, j), with values drawn uniformly at random from 0 to 1 (we assigned no factors to nodes). [sent-244, score-0.518]
</p><p>81 Consider ﬁrst Figure 1 (left), where we generated ten random grid networks (we plotted only ten for clarity) and plotted the compensation errors (y-axis) as they evolved over iterations (x-axis). [sent-247, score-0.687]
</p><p>82 At iteration 0, the MAP value of each compensation is equivalent to that of the relaxation (by design). [sent-248, score-0.734]
</p><p>83 We see that, once we start iterating, that both methods of compensation can tighten the approximation of our very coarse relaxation. [sent-249, score-0.606]
</p><p>84 For REC - I, convergence is slower, but the compensation is still a signiﬁcant improvement over the relaxation. [sent-251, score-0.548]
</p><p>85 Moreover, it is apparent that further iterations would beneﬁt the compensation further. [sent-252, score-0.57]
</p><p>86 An attractive factor ψa (Xi , Xj ) was given a value at random from 1 − p to 1 if xi = xj and a value from 0 to 2 ˆ For each factor ψa and for each variable X in ψa , we replaced variable X with a unique clone X and ˆ introduced the equivalence constraint X ≡ X. [sent-255, score-0.829]
</p><p>87 When we then relax all equivalence constraints, the resulting factor graph is fully disconnected. [sent-256, score-0.28]
</p><p>88 7  1 p if xi = xj , which favors conﬁgurations xi = xj when p ≤ 2 . [sent-258, score-0.942]
</p><p>89 Similarly for repulsive factors, which favors instead conﬁgurations where xi = xj . [sent-259, score-0.492]
</p><p>90 It is well known that belief propagation tends to not converge in networks with frustrated interactions [11]. [sent-260, score-0.255]
</p><p>91 On the other hand, REC - I compensations were relatively well behaved, and produced monotonically decreasing upper bounds on the MAP value; see Figure 1 (center). [sent-264, score-0.275]
</p><p>92 Although the degree of compensation is not as dramatic, we note that we are compensating for a very coarse relaxation (fully disconnected). [sent-265, score-0.772]
</p><p>93 Moreover, we can see in that one instance, REC - BP converges below the true MAP value; remember that by Theorem 3, REC - I compensations always yield upper bounds. [sent-267, score-0.261]
</p><p>94 In the case of REC - I, the compensations did not improve signiﬁcantly on the fully disconnected relaxations (not shown). [sent-268, score-0.375]
</p><p>95 Surprisingly, this was enough for REC - I to compensate for the relaxation completely (to within 10−8 ) in 7 of the 10 instances plotted. [sent-273, score-0.257]
</p><p>96 The idea of using structural relaxations for upper-bounding MAP solutions in probabilistic graphical models goes back to mini-bucket approximations [13], which can be considered to be a particular way of relaxing equivalence constraints from a model [4]. [sent-278, score-0.516]
</p><p>97 One approach to compensation identiﬁed a generalized class of max-product belief propagation approximations. [sent-280, score-0.675]
</p><p>98 We then identiﬁed a second approach that led to another class of approximations that we have observed to yield tighter upper bounds on MAP solutions as compared to a relaxation alone. [sent-281, score-0.362]
</p><p>99 In contrast to the above approaches, compensations further guarantee, in Theorem 4, upper bounds on MAP solutions under any partial assignment (without rerunning the algorithm). [sent-286, score-0.395]
</p><p>100 We hope that this perspective will enable the design of new approximations, especially in domains where speciﬁc notions of compensation may suggest themselves. [sent-290, score-0.585]

<p>Author: Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on approximations to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) task in probabilistic graphical models, that is based on simplifying a given instance, and then tightening the approximation. First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deﬁciencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we ﬁnd that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more reﬁned idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively seeks tighter approximations. 1</p><p>2 0.14999104 <a title="35-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2009-An_LP_View_of_the_M-best_MAP_problem.html">31 nips-2009-An LP View of the M-best MAP problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0.

<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>4 0.093889974 <a title="35-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Local_Rules_for_Global_MAP%3A_When_Do_They_Work_%3F.html">141 nips-2009-Local Rules for Global MAP: When Do They Work ?</a></p>
<p>Author: Kyomin Jung, Pushmeet Kohli, Devavrat Shah</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of computing Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) assignment in an arbitrary pair-wise Markov Random Field (MRF). We present a randomized iterative algorithm based on simple local updates. The algorithm, starting with an arbitrary initial assignment, updates it in each iteration by ﬁrst, picking a random node, then selecting an (appropriately chosen) random local neighborhood and optimizing over this local neighborhood. Somewhat surprisingly, we show that this algorithm ﬁnds a near optimal assignment within n log 2 n iterations with high probability for any n node pair-wise MRF with geometry (i.e. MRF graph with polynomial growth) with the approximation error depending on (in a reasonable manner) the geometric growth rate of the graph and the average radius of the local neighborhood – this allows for a graceful tradeoff between the complexity of the algorithm and the approximation error. Through extensive simulations, we show that our algorithm ﬁnds extremely good approximate solutions for various kinds of MRFs with geometry.</p><p>5 0.092209771 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Graph_Zeta_Function_in_the_Bethe_Free_Energy_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">103 nips-2009-Graph Zeta Function in the Bethe Free Energy and Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on approximations to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) task in probabilistic graphical models, that is based on simplifying a given instance, and then tightening the approximation. First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deﬁciencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we ﬁnd that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more reﬁned idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively seeks tighter approximations. 1</p><p>2 0.7527442 <a title="35-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Graph_Zeta_Function_in_the_Bethe_Free_Energy_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">103 nips-2009-Graph Zeta Function in the Bethe Free Energy and Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Amir Leshem</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm for the linear least squares problem where the unknown variables are constrained to be in a ﬁnite set. The factor graph that corresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence, applying the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. The algorithm described here is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian density of the unconstrained linear system. It is shown that even though the approximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the BP algorithm to the modiﬁed factor graph outperforms current methods in terms of both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO detection.</p><p>4 0.65546393 <a title="35-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-An_LP_View_of_the_M-best_MAP_problem.html">31 nips-2009-An LP View of the M-best MAP problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments. Signiﬁcantly, any MAP 5 Attractive Grids Ranks Run-times 1 50 Mixed Grids Ranks Run-times 1 50 0.5 0 S N B 0 Hard Protein SCP Ranks Run-times 1 50 0.5 S N B 0 0 S+R N+R B+R 0.5 S+R N+R B+R 0 S+R B B+R 0 S+R B B+R Figure 2: Number of best ranks and normalized run-times for the attractive and mixed grids, and the more diﬃcult protein SCP problems.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ.

<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>6 0.50915217 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Asymptotic_Analysis_of_MAP_Estimation_via_the_Replica_Method_and_Compressed_Sensing.html">36 nips-2009-Asymptotic Analysis of MAP Estimation via the Replica Method and Compressed Sensing</a></p>

<p>Author: Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on approximations to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) task in probabilistic graphical models, that is based on simplifying a given instance, and then tightening the approximation. First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deﬁciencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we ﬁnd that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more reﬁned idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively seeks tighter approximations. 1</p><p>2 0.62391883 <a title="35-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Variational_Gaussian-process_factor_analysis_for_modeling_spatio-temporal_data.html">254 nips-2009-Variational Gaussian-process factor analysis for modeling spatio-temporal data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaakko Luttinen, Alexander T. Ihler</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic factor analysis model which can be used for studying spatio-temporal datasets. The spatial and temporal structure is modeled by using Gaussian process priors both for the loading matrix and the factors. The posterior distributions are approximated using the variational Bayesian framework. High computational cost of Gaussian process modeling is reduced by using sparse approximations. The model is used to compute the reconstructions of the global sea surface temperatures from a historical dataset. The results suggest that the proposed model can outperform the state-of-the-art reconstruction systems.</p><p>3 0.61762512 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Gaussian_process_regression_with_Student-t_likelihood.html">100 nips-2009-Gaussian process regression with Student-t likelihood</a></p>
<p>Author: Jarno Vanhatalo, Pasi Jylänki, Aki Vehtari</p><p>Abstract: In the Gaussian process regression the observation model is commonly assumed to be Gaussian, which is convenient in computational perspective. However, the drawback is that the predictive accuracy of the model can be signiﬁcantly compromised if the observations are contaminated by outliers. A robust observation model, such as the Student-t distribution, reduces the inﬂuence of outlying observations and improves the predictions. The problem, however, is the analytically intractable inference. In this work, we discuss the properties of a Gaussian process regression model with the Student-t likelihood and utilize the Laplace approximation for approximate inference. We compare our approach to a variational approximation and a Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme, which utilize the commonly used scale mixture representation of the Student-t distribution. 1</p><p>4 0.61061323 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Sparse_and_Locally_Constant_Gaussian_Graphical_Models.html">224 nips-2009-Sparse and Locally Constant Gaussian Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean Honorio, Dimitris Samaras, Nikos Paragios, Rita Goldstein, Luis E. Ortiz</p><p>Abstract: Locality information is crucial in datasets where each variable corresponds to a measurement in a manifold (silhouettes, motion trajectories, 2D and 3D images). Although these datasets are typically under-sampled and high-dimensional, they often need to be represented with low-complexity statistical models, which are comprised of only the important probabilistic dependencies in the datasets. Most methods attempt to reduce model complexity by enforcing structure sparseness. However, sparseness cannot describe inherent regularities in the structure. Hence, in this paper we ﬁrst propose a new class of Gaussian graphical models which, together with sparseness, imposes local constancy through 1 -norm penalization. Second, we propose an efﬁcient algorithm which decomposes the strictly convex maximum likelihood estimation into a sequence of problems with closed form solutions. Through synthetic experiments, we evaluate the closeness of the recovered models to the ground truth. We also test the generalization performance of our method in a wide range of complex real-world datasets and demonstrate that it captures useful structures such as the rotation and shrinking of a beating heart, motion correlations between body parts during walking and functional interactions of brain regions. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art structure learning techniques for Gaussian graphical models both for small and large datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.61053002 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-An_Integer_Projected_Fixed_Point_Method_for_Graph_Matching_and_MAP_Inference.html">30 nips-2009-An Integer Projected Fixed Point Method for Graph Matching and MAP Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Marius Leordeanu, Martial Hebert, Rahul Sukthankar</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching and MAP inference are essential problems in computer vision and machine learning. We introduce a novel algorithm that can accommodate both problems and solve them efﬁciently. Recent graph matching algorithms are based on a general quadratic programming formulation, which takes in consideration both unary and second-order terms reﬂecting the similarities in local appearance as well as in the pairwise geometric relationships between the matched features. This problem is NP-hard, therefore most algorithms ﬁnd approximate solutions by relaxing the original problem. They ﬁnd the optimal continuous solution of the modiﬁed problem, ignoring during optimization the original discrete constraints. Then the continuous solution is quickly binarized at the end, but very little attention is put into this ﬁnal discretization step. In this paper we argue that the stage in which a discrete solution is found is crucial for good performance. We propose an efﬁcient algorithm, with climbing and convergence properties, that optimizes in the discrete domain the quadratic score, and it gives excellent results either by itself or by starting from the solution returned by any graph matching algorithm. In practice it outperforms state-or-the art graph matching algorithms and it also signiﬁcantly improves their performance if used in combination. When applied to MAP inference, the algorithm is a parallel extension of Iterated Conditional Modes (ICM) with climbing and convergence properties that make it a compelling alternative to the sequential ICM. In our experiments on MAP inference our algorithm proved its effectiveness by signiﬁcantly outperforming [13], ICM and Max-Product Belief Propagation. 1</p><p>6 0.60948396 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Convex_Relaxation_of_Mixture_Regression_with_Efficient_Algorithms.html">61 nips-2009-Convex Relaxation of Mixture Regression with Efficient Algorithms</a></p>

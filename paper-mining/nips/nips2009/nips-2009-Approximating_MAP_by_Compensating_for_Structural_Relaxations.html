<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>3 0.1594104 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-An_LP_View_of_the_M-best_MAP_problem.html">31 nips-2009-An LP View of the M-best MAP problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ. Deﬁne p(x) as: ˆ z ˆ xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) no constraint 0 no constraint ∃ l x l = zl As in Eq. 12 0 ˆ ˆ z µ (z ,x ) p(ˆ ) n−1,n βn−1 n α−I(µ,ˆ ) ˆx α µ (z ,z ) p(ˆ ) n−1,n βn−1 n ˆx (z ,x ) ˆˆ ˆ µ I(µ, z ) n−1,n αn−1 n 1 0 0 1 1 ∀ l x l = zl p(x) 1 which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0, as required. 8 References [1] F.

<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Nathan Srebro, Xueyuan Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We study the behavior of the popular Laplacian Regularization method for SemiSupervised Learning at the regime of a ﬁxed number of labeled points but a large number of unlabeled points. We show that in Rd , d 2, the method is actually not well-posed, and as the number of unlabeled points increases the solution degenerates to a noninformative function. We also contrast the method with the Laplacian Eigenvector method, and discuss the “smoothness” assumptions associated with this alternate method. 1 Introduction and Setup In this paper we consider the limit behavior of two popular semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods based on the graph Laplacian: the regularization approach [15] and the spectral approach [3]. We consider the limit when the number of labeled points is ﬁxed and the number of unlabeled points goes to inﬁnity. This is a natural limit for SSL as the basic SSL scenario is one in which unlabeled data is virtually inﬁnite. We can also think of this limit as “perfect” SSL, having full knowledge of the marginal density p(x). The premise of SSL is that the marginal density p(x) is informative about the unknown mapping y(x) we are trying to learn, e.g. since y(x) is expected to be “smooth” in some sense relative to p(x). Studying the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit, where p(x) is fully known, allows us to formulate and understand the underlying smoothness assumptions of a particular SSL method, and judge whether it is well-posed and sensible. Understanding the inﬁnite-unlabeled-data limit is also a necessary ﬁrst step to studying the convergence of the ﬁnite-labeled-data estimator. We consider the following setup: Let p(x) be an unknown smooth density on a compact domain Ω ⊂ Rd with a smooth boundary. Let y : Ω → Y be the unknown function we wish to estimate. In case of regression Y = R whereas in binary classiﬁcation Y = {−1, 1}. The standard (transductive) semisupervised learning problem is formulated as follows: Given l labeled points, (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ), with yi = y(xi ), and u unlabeled points xl+1 , . . . , xl+u , with all points xi sampled i.i.d. from p(x), the goal is to construct an estimate of y(xl+i ) for any unlabeled point xl+i , utilizing both the labeled and the unlabeled points. We denote the total number of points by n = l + u. We are interested in the regime where l is ﬁxed and u → ∞. 1 2 SSL with Graph Laplacian Regularization We ﬁrst consider the following graph-based approach formulated by Zhu et. al. [15]: y (x) = arg min In (y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l y where 1 n2 In (y) = Wi,j (y(xi ) − y(xj ))2 (1) (2) i,j is a Laplacian regularization term enforcing “smoothness” with respect to the n×n similarity matrix W . This formulation has several natural interpretations in terms of, e.g. random walks and electrical circuits [15]. These interpretations, however, refer to a ﬁxed graph, over a ﬁnite set of points with given similarities. In contrast, our focus here is on the more typical scenario where the points xi ∈ Rd are a random sample from a density p(x), and W is constructed based on this sample. We would like to understand the behavior of the method in terms of the density p(x), particularly in the limit where the number of unlabeled points grows. Under what assumptions on the target labeling y(x) and on the density p(x) is the method (1) sensible? The answer, of course, depends on how the matrix W is constructed. We consider the common situation where the similarities are obtained by applying some decay ﬁlter to the distances: xi −xj σ Wi,j = G (3) where G : R+ → R+ is some function with an adequately fast decay. Popular choices are the 2 Gaussian ﬁlter G(z) = e−z /2 or the ǫ-neighborhood graph obtained by the step ﬁlter G(z) = 1z<1 . For simplicity, we focus here on the formulation (1) where the solution is required to satisfy the constraints at the labeled points exactly. In practice, the hard labeling constraints are often replaced with a softer loss-based data term, which is balanced against the smoothness term In (y), e.g. [14, 6]. Our analysis and conclusions apply to such variants as well. Limit of the Laplacian Regularization Term As the number of unlabeled examples grows the regularization term (2) converges to its expectation, where the summation is replaced by integration w.r.t. the density p(x): lim In (y) = I (σ) (y) = n→∞ G Ω Ω x−x′ σ (y(x) − y(x′ ))2 p(x)p(x′ )dxdx′ . (4) In the above limit, the bandwidth σ is held ﬁxed. Typically, one would also drive the bandwidth σ to zero as n → ∞. There are two reasons for this choice. First, from a practical perspective, this makes the similarity matrix W sparse so it can be stored and processed. Second, from a theoretical perspective, this leads to a clear and well deﬁned limit of the smoothness regularization term In (y), at least when σ → 0 slowly enough1 , namely when σ = ω( d log n/n). If σ → 0 as n → ∞, and as long as nσ d / log n → ∞, then after appropriate normalization, the regularizer converges to a density weighted gradient penalty term [7, 8]: d lim d+2 In (y) n→∞ Cσ (σ) d (y) d+2 I σ→0 Cσ = lim ∇y(x) 2 p(x)2 dx = J(y) = (5) Ω where C = Rd z 2 G( z )dz, and assuming 0 < C < ∞ (which is the case for both the Gaussian and the step ﬁlters). This energy functional J(f ) therefore encodes the notion of “smoothness” with respect to p(x) that is the basis of the SSL formulation (1) with the graph constructions speciﬁed by (3). To understand the behavior and appropriateness of (1) we must understand this functional and the associated limit problem: y (x) = arg min J(y) ˆ subject to y(xi ) = yi , i = 1, . . . , l (6) y p When σ = o( d 1/n) then all non-diagonal weights Wi,j vanish (points no longer have any “close by” p neighbors). We are not aware of an analysis covering the regime where σ decays roughly as d 1/n, but would be surprised if a qualitatively different meaningful limit is reached. 1 2 3 Graph Laplacian Regularization in R1 We begin by considering the solution of (6) for one dimensional data, i.e. d = 1 and x ∈ R. We ﬁrst consider the situation where the support of p(x) is a continuous interval Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R (a and/or b may be inﬁnite). Without loss of generality, we assume the labeled data is sorted in increasing order a x1 < x2 < · · · < xl b. Applying the theory of variational calculus, the solution y (x) ˆ satisﬁes inside each interval (xi , xi+1 ) the Euler-Lagrange equation d dy p2 (x) = 0. dx dx Performing two integrations and enforcing the constraints at the labeled points yields y(x) = yi + x 1/p2 (t)dt xi (yi+1 xi+1 1/p2 (t)dt xi − yi ) for xi x xi+1 (7) with y(x) = x1 for a x x1 and y(x) = xl for xl x b. If the support of p(x) is a union of disjoint intervals, the above analysis and the form of the solution applies in each interval separately. The solution (7) seems reasonable and desirable from the point of view of the “smoothness” assumptions: when p(x) is uniform, the solution interpolates linearly between labeled data points, whereas across low-density regions, where p(x) is close to zero, y(x) can change abruptly. Furthermore, the regularizer J(y) can be interpreted as a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) squared semi-norm, giving us additional insight into this choice of regularizer: b 1 Theorem 1. Let p(x) be a smooth density on Ω = [a, b] ⊂ R such that Ap = 4 a 1/p2 (t)dt < ∞. 2 Then, J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm J(f ) = f Kp induced by the kernel x′ ′ Kp (x, x ) = Ap − 1 2 x with a null-space of all constant functions. That is, f the RKHS induced by Kp . 1 p2 (t) dt Kp . (8) is the norm of the projection of f onto If p(x) is supported on several disjoint intervals, Ω = ∪i [ai , bi ], then J(f ) can be written as a squared semi-norm induced by the kernel 1 bi dt 4 ai p2 (t) ′ Kp (x, x ) = − 1 2 x′ dt x p2 (t) if x, x′ ∈ [ai , bi ] (9) if x ∈ [ai , bi ], x′ ∈ [aj , bj ], i = j 0 with a null-space spanned by indicator functions 1[ai ,bi ] (x) on the connected components of Ω. Proof. For any f (x) = i αi Kp (x, xi ) in the RKHS induced by Kp : df dx J(f ) = 2 p2 (x)dx = αi αj Jij (10) i,j where Jij = d d Kp (x, xi ) Kp (x, xj )p2 (x)dx dx dx When xi and xj are in different connected components of Ω, the gradients of Kp (·, xi ) and Kp (·, xj ) are never non-zero together and Jij = 0 = Kp (xi , xj ). When they are in the same connected component [a, b], and assuming w.l.o.g. a xi xj b: Jij = = xi 1 4 1 4 a b a 1 dt + p2 (t) 1 1 dt − p2 (t) 2 xj xi xj xi −1 dt + p2 (t) xj 1 dt p2 (t) 1 dt = Kp (xi , xj ). p2 (t) Substituting Jij = Kp (xi , xj ) into (10) yields J(f ) = 3 b αi αj Kp (xi , xj ) = f (11) Kp . Combining Theorem 1 with the Representer Theorem [13] establishes that the solution of (6) (or of any variant where the hard constraints are replaced by a data term) is of the form: l y(x) = αj Kp (x, xj ) + βi 1[ai ,bi ] (x), j=1 i where i ranges over the connected components [ai , bi ] of Ω, and we have: l J(y) = αi αj Kp (xi , xj ). (12) i,j=1 Viewing the regularizer as y 2 p suggests understanding (6), and so also its empirical approximaK tion (1), by interpreting Kp (x, x′ ) as a density-based “similarity measure” between x and x′ . This similarity measure indeed seems sensible: for a uniform density it is simply linearly decreasing as a function of the distance. When the density is non-uniform, two points are relatively similar only if they are connected by a region in which 1/p2 (x) is low, i.e. the density is high, but are much less “similar”, i.e. related to each other, when connected by a low-density region. Furthermore, there is no dependence between points in disjoint components separated by zero density regions. 4 Graph Laplacian Regularization in Higher Dimensions The analysis of the previous section seems promising, at it shows that in one dimension, the SSL method (1) is well posed and converges to a sensible limit. Regretfully, in higher dimensions this is not the case anymore. In the following theorem we show that the inﬁmum of the limit problem (6) is zero and can be obtained by a sequence of functions which are certainly not a sensible extrapolation of the labeled points. Theorem 2. Let p(x) be a smooth density over Rd , d 2, bounded from above by some constant pmax , and let (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xl , yl ) be any (non-repeating) set of labeled examples. There exist continuous functions yǫ (x), for any ǫ > 0, all satisfying the constraints yǫ (xj ) = yj , j = 1, . . . , l, such ǫ→0 ǫ→0 that J(yǫ ) −→ 0 but yǫ (x) −→ 0 for all x = xj , j = 1, . . . , l. Proof. We present a detailed proof for the case of l = 2 labeled points. The generalization of the proof to more labeled points is straightforward. Furthermore, without loss of generality, we assume the ﬁrst labeled point is at x0 = 0 with y(x0 ) = 0 and the second labeled point is at x1 with x1 = 1 and y(x1 ) = 1. In addition, we assume that the ball B1 (0) of radius one centered around the origin is contained in Ω = {x ∈ Rd | p(x) > 0}. We ﬁrst consider the case d > 2. Here, for any ǫ > 0, consider the function x ǫ yǫ (x) = min ,1 which indeed satisﬁes the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1. Then, J(yǫ ) = Bǫ (0) p2 (x) dx ǫ2 pmax ǫ2 dx = p2 Vd ǫd−2 max (13) Bǫ (0) where Vd is the volume of a unit ball in Rd . Hence, the sequence of functions yǫ (x) satisfy the constraints, but for d > 2, inf ǫ J(yǫ ) = 0. For d = 2, a more extreme example is necessary: consider the functions 2 x yǫ (x) = log +ǫ ǫ log 1+ǫ ǫ for x 1 and yǫ (x) = 1 for x > 1. These functions satisfy the two constraints yǫ (xi ) = yi , i = 0, 1 and: J(yǫ ) = 4 h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ 4πp2 max h “ ”i 1+ǫ 2 log ǫ x B1 (0) log ( x 1+ǫ ǫ 2 2 +ǫ)2 p2 (x)dx 4p2 h “ max ”i2 1+ǫ log ǫ 4πp2 max ǫ→0 = −→ 0. log 1+ǫ ǫ 4 1 0 r2 (r 2 +ǫ)2 2πrdr The implication of Theorem 2 is that regardless of the values at the labeled points, as u → ∞, the solution of (1) is not well posed. Asymptotically, the solution has the form of an almost everywhere constant function, with highly localized spikes near the labeled points, and so no learning is performed. In particular, an interpretation in terms of a density-based kernel Kp , as in the onedimensional case, is not possible. Our analysis also carries over to a formulation where a loss-based data term replaces the hard label constraints, as in l 1 y = arg min ˆ (y(xj ) − yj )2 + γIn (y) y(x) l j=1 In the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, functions of the form yǫ (x) above have a zero data penalty term (since they exactly match the labels) and also drive the regularization term J(y) to zero. Hence, it is possible to drive the entire objective functional (the data term plus the regularization term) to zero with functions that do not generalize at all to unlabeled points. 4.1 Numerical Example We illustrate the phenomenon detailed by Theorem 2 with a simple example. Consider a density p(x) in R2 , which is a mixture of two unit variance spherical Gaussians, one per class, centered at the origin and at (4, 0). We sample a total of n = 3000 points, and label two points from each of the two components (four total). We then construct a similarity matrix using a Gaussian ﬁlter with σ = 0.4. Figure 1 depicts the predictor y (x) obtained from (1). In fact, two different predictors are shown, ˆ obtained by different numerical methods for solving (1). Both methods are based on the observation that the solution y (x) of (1) satisﬁes: ˆ n y (xi ) = ˆ n Wij y (xj ) / ˆ j=1 Wij on all unlabeled points i = l + 1, . . . , l + u. (14) j=1 Combined with the constraints of (1), we obtain a system of linear equations that can be solved by Gaussian elimination (here invoked through MATLAB’s backslash operator). This is the method used in the top panels of Figure 1. Alternatively, (14) can be viewed as an update equation for y (xi ), ˆ which can be solved via the power method, or label propagation [2, 6]: start with zero labels on the unlabeled points and iterate (14), while keeping the known labels on x1 , . . . , xl . This is the method used in the bottom panels of Figure 1. As predicted, y (x) is almost constant for almost all unlabeled points. Although all values are very ˆ close to zero, thresholding at the “right” threshold does actually produce sensible results in terms of the true -1/+1 labels. However, beyond being inappropriate for regression, a very ﬂat predictor is still problematic even from a classiﬁcation perspective. First, it is not possible to obtain a meaningful conﬁdence measure for particular labels. Second, especially if the size of each class is not known apriori, setting the threshold between the positive and negative classes is problematic. In our example, setting the threshold to zero yields a generalization error of 45%. The differences between the two numerical methods for solving (1) also point out to another problem with the ill-posedness of the limit problem: the solution is numerically very un-stable. A more quantitative evaluation, that also validates that the effect in Figure 1 is not a result of choosing a “wrong” bandwidth σ, is given in Figure 2. We again simulated data from a mixture of two Gaussians, one Gaussian per class, this time in 20 dimensions, with one labeled point per class, and an increasing number of unlabeled points. In Figure 2 we plot the squared error, and the classiﬁcation error of the resulting predictor y (x). We plot the classiﬁcation error both when a threshold ˆ of zero is used (i.e. the class is determined by sign(ˆ(x))) and with the ideal threshold minimizing y the test error. For each unlabeled sample size, we choose the bandwidth σ yielding the best test performance (this is a “cheating” approach which provides a lower bound on the error of the best method for selecting the bandwidth). As the number of unlabeled examples increases the squared error approaches 1, indicating a ﬂat predictor. Using a threshold of zero leads to an increase in the classiﬁcation error, possibly due to numerical instability. Interestingly, although the predictors become very ﬂat, the classiﬁcation error using the ideal threshold actually improves slightly.

For each error measure and sample size, the bandwidth minimizing the test error was used, and is plotted. ideal classiﬁcation performance is achieved with a signiﬁcantly larger bandwidth than the bandwidth minimizing the squared loss, i.e. when the predictor is even ﬂatter. 4.2 Probabilistic Interpretation, Exit and Hitting Times As mentioned above, the Laplacian regularization method (1) has a probabilistic interpretation in terms of a random walk on the weighted graph. Let x(t) denote a random walk on the graph with transition matrix M = D−1 W where D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij . Then, for the binary classiﬁcation case with yi = ±1 we have [15]: y (xi ) = 2 Pr x(t) hits a point labeled +1 before hitting a point labeled -1 x(0) = xi − 1 ˆ We present an interpretation of our analysis in terms of the limiting properties of this random walk. Consider, for simplicity, the case where the two classes are separated by a low density region. Then, the random walk has two intrinsic quantities of interest. The ﬁrst is the mean exit time from one cluster to the other, and the other is the mean hitting time to the labeled points in that cluster. As the number of unlabeled points increases and σ → 0, the random walk converges to a diffusion process [12]. While the mean exit time then converges to a ﬁnite value corresponding to its diffusion analogue, the hitting time to a labeled point increases to inﬁnity (as these become absorbing boundaries of measure zero). With more and more unlabeled data the random walk will fully mix, forgetting where it started, before it hits any label. Thus, the probability of hitting +1 before −1 will become uniform across the entire graph, independent of the starting location xi , yielding a ﬂat predictor. 5 Keeping σ Finite At this point, a reader may ask whether the problems found in higher dimensions are due to taking the limit σ → 0. One possible objection is that there is an intrinsic characteristic scale for the data σ0 where (with high probability) all points at a distance xi − xj < σ0 have the same label. If this is the case, then it may not necessarily make sense to take values of σ < σ0 in constructing W . However, keeping σ ﬁnite while taking the number of unlabeled points to inﬁnity does not resolve the problem. On the contrary, even the one-dimensional case becomes ill-posed in this case. To see this, consider a function y(x) which is zero everywhere except at the labeled points, where y(xj ) = yj . With a ﬁnite number of labeled points of measure zero, I (σ) (y) = 0 in any dimension 6 50 points 500 points 3500 points 1 1 0.5 0.5 0.5 0 0 0 −0.5 y 1 −0.5 −0.5 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 −1 −2 0 2 4 6 x Figure 3: Minimizer of (1) for a 1-d problem with a ﬁxed σ = 0.4, two labeled points and an increasing number of unlabeled points. and for any ﬁxed σ > 0. While this limiting function is discontinuous, it is also possible to construct ǫ→0 a sequence of continuous functions yǫ that all satisfy the constraints and for which I (σ) (yǫ ) −→ 0. This behavior is illustrated in Figure 3. We generated data from a mixture of two 1-D Gaussians centered at the origin and at x = 4, with one Gaussian labeled −1 and the other +1. We used two labeled points at the centers of the Gaussians and an increasing number of randomly drawn unlabeled points. As predicted, with a ﬁxed σ, although the solution is reasonable when the number of unlabeled points is small, it becomes ﬂatter, with sharp spikes on the labeled points, as u → ∞. 6 Fourier-Eigenvector Based Methods Before we conclude, we discuss a different approach for SSL, also based on the Graph Laplacian, suggested by Belkin and Niyogi [3]. Instead of using the Laplacian as a regularizer, constraining candidate predictors y(x) non-parametrically to those with small In (y) values, here the predictors are constrained to the low-dimensional space spanned by the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of the Laplacian: The similarity matrix W is computed as before, and the Graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W is considered (recall D is a diagonal matrix with Dii = j Wij ). Only predictors p j=1 aj ej y (x) = ˆ (15) spanned by the ﬁrst p eigenvectors e1 , . . . , ep of L (with smallest eigenvalues) are considered. The coefﬁcients aj are chosen by minimizing a loss function on the labeled data, e.g. the squared loss: (ˆ1 , . . . , ap ) = arg min a ˆ l j=1 (yj − y (xj ))2 . ˆ (16) Unlike the Laplacian Regularization method (1), the Laplacian Eigenvector method (15)–(16) is well posed in the limit u → ∞. This follows directly from the convergence of the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian to the eigenfunctions of the corresponding Laplace-Beltrami operator [10, 4]. Eigenvector based methods were shown empirically to provide competitive generalization performance on a variety of simulated and real world problems. Belkin and Niyogi [3] motivate the approach by arguing that ‘the eigenfunctions of the Laplace-Beltrami operator provide a natural basis for functions on the manifold and the desired classiﬁcation function can be expressed in such a basis’. In our view, the success of the method is actually not due to data lying on a low-dimensional manifold, but rather due to the low density separation assumption, which states that different class labels form high-density clusters separated by low density regions. Indeed, under this assumption and with sufﬁcient separation between the clusters, the eigenfunctions of the graph Laplace-Beltrami operator are approximately piecewise constant in each of the clusters, as in spectral clustering [12, 11], providing a basis for a labeling that is constant within clusters but variable across clusters. In other settings, such as data uniformly distributed on a manifold but without any signiﬁcant cluster structure, the success of eigenvector based methods critically depends on how well can the unknown classiﬁcation function be approximated by a truncated expansion with relatively few eigenvectors. We illustrate this issue with the following three-dimensional example: Let p(x) denote the uniform density in the box [0, 1] × [0, 0.8] × [0, 0.6], where the box lengths are different to prevent eigenvalue multiplicity. Consider learning three different functions, y1 (x) = 1x1 >0.5 , y2 (x) = 1x1 >x2 /0.8 and y3 (x) = 1x2 /0.8>x3 /0.6 . Even though all three functions are relatively simple, all having a linear separating boundary between the classes on the manifold, as shown in the experiment described in Figure 4, the Eigenvector based method (15)–(16) gives markedly different generalization performances on the three targets. This happens both when the number of eigenvectors p is set to p = l/5 as suggested by Belkin and Niyogi, as well as for the optimal (oracle) value of p selected on the test set (i.e. a “cheating” choice representing an upper bound on the generalization error of this method). 7 Prediction Error (%) p = #labeled points/5 40 optimal p 20 labeled points 40 Approx. Error 50 20 20 0 20 20 40 60 # labeled points 0 10 20 40 60 # labeled points 0 0 5 10 15 # eigenvectors 0 0 5 10 15 # eigenvectors Figure 4: Left three panels: Generalization Performance of the Eigenvector Method (15)–(16) for the three different functions described in the text. All panels use n = 3000 points. Prediction counts the number of sign agreements with the true labels. Rightmost panel: best ﬁt when many (all 3000) points are used, representing the best we can hope for with a few leading eigenvectors. The reason for this behavior is that y2 (x) and even more so y3 (x) cannot be as easily approximated by the very few leading eigenfunctions—even though they seem “simple” and “smooth”, they are signiﬁcantly more complicated than y1 (x) in terms of measure of simplicity implied by the Eigenvector Method. Since the density is uniform, the graph Laplacian converges to the standard Laplacian and its eigenfunctions have the form ψi,j,k (x) = cos(iπx1 ) cos(jπx2 /0.8) cos(kπx3 /0.6), making it hard to represent simple decision boundaries which are not axis-aligned. 7 Discussion Our results show that a popular SSL method, the Laplacian Regularization method (1), is not wellbehaved in the limit of inﬁnite unlabeled data, despite its empirical success in various SSL tasks. The empirical success might be due to two reasons. First, it is possible that with a large enough number of labeled points relative to the number of unlabeled points, the method is well behaved. This regime, where the number of both labeled and unlabeled points grow while l/u is ﬁxed, has recently been analyzed by Wasserman and Lafferty [9]. However, we do not ﬁnd this regime particularly satisfying as we would expect that having more unlabeled data available should improve performance, rather than require more labeled points or make the problem ill-posed. It also places the user in a delicate situation of choosing the “just right” number of unlabeled points without any theoretical guidance. Second, in our experiments we noticed that although the predictor y (x) becomes extremely ﬂat, in ˆ binary tasks, it is still typically possible to ﬁnd a threshold leading to a good classiﬁcation performance. We do not know of any theoretical explanation for such behavior, nor how to characterize it. Obtaining such an explanation would be very interesting, and in a sense crucial to the theoretical foundation of the Laplacian Regularization method. On a very practical level, such a theoretical understanding might allow us to correct the method so as to avoid the numerical instability associated with ﬂat predictors, and perhaps also make it appropriate for regression. The reason that the Laplacian regularizer (1) is ill-posed in the limit is that the ﬁrst order gradient is not a sufﬁcient penalty in high dimensions. This fact is well known in spline theory, where the Sobolev Embedding Theorem [1] indicates one must control at least d+1 derivatives in Rd . In the 2 context of Laplacian regularization, this can be done using the iterated Laplacian: replacing the d+1 graph Laplacian matrix L = D − W , where D is the diagonal degree matrix, with L 2 (matrix to d+1 the 2 power). In the inﬁnite unlabeled data limit, this corresponds to regularizing all order- d+1 2 (mixed) partial derivatives. In the typical case of a low-dimensional manifold in a high dimensional ambient space, the order of iteration should correspond to the intrinsic, rather then ambient, dimensionality, which poses a practical problem of estimating this usually unknown dimensionality. We are not aware of much practical work using the iterated Laplacian, nor a good understanding of its appropriateness for SSL. A different approach leading to a well-posed solution is to include also an ambient regularization term [5]. However, the properties of the solution and in particular its relation to various assumptions about the “smoothness” of y(x) relative to p(x) remain unclear.

<p>Author: Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on approximations to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) task in probabilistic graphical models, that is based on simplifying a given instance, and then tightening the approximation. First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deﬁciencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we ﬁnd that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more reﬁned idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively seeks tighter approximations. 1</p><p>2 0.76346099 <a title="35-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Graph_Zeta_Function_in_the_Bethe_Free_Energy_and_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">103 nips-2009-Graph Zeta Function in the Bethe Free Energy and Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jacob Goldberger, Amir Leshem</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new algorithm for the linear least squares problem where the unknown variables are constrained to be in a ﬁnite set. The factor graph that corresponds to this problem is very loopy; in fact, it is a complete graph. Hence, applying the Belief Propagation (BP) algorithm yields very poor results. The algorithm described here is based on an optimal tree approximation of the Gaussian density of the unconstrained linear system. It is shown that even though the approximation is not directly applied to the exact discrete distribution, applying the BP algorithm to the modiﬁed factor graph outperforms current methods in terms of both performance and complexity. The improved performance of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated on the problem of MIMO detection.</p><p>4 0.64097166 <a title="35-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-An_LP_View_of_the_M-best_MAP_problem.html">31 nips-2009-An LP View of the M-best MAP problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Menachem Fromer, Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of ﬁnding the M assignments with maximum probability in a probabilistic graphical model. We show how this problem can be formulated as a linear program (LP) on a particular polytope. We prove that, for tree graphs (and junction trees in general), this polytope has a particularly simple form and diﬀers from the marginal polytope in a single inequality constraint. We use this characterization to provide an approximation scheme for non-tree graphs, by using the set of spanning trees over such graphs. The method we present puts the M -best inference problem in the context of LP relaxations, which have recently received considerable attention and have proven useful in solving diﬃcult inference problems. We show empirically that our method often ﬁnds the provably exact M best conﬁgurations for problems of high tree-width. A common task in probabilistic modeling is ﬁnding the assignment with maximum probability given a model. This is often referred to as the MAP (maximum a-posteriori) problem. Of particular interest is the case of MAP in graphical models, i.e., models where the probability factors into a product over small subsets of variables. For general models, this is an NP-hard problem [11], and thus approximation algorithms are required. Of those, the class of LP based relaxations has recently received considerable attention [3, 5, 18]. In fact, it has been shown that some problems (e.g., ﬁxed backbone protein design) can be solved exactly via sequences of increasingly tighter LP relaxations [13]. In many applications, one is interested not only in the MAP assignment but also in the M maximum probability assignments [19]. For example, in a protein design problem, we might be interested in the M amino acid sequences that are most stable on a given backbone structure [2]. In cases where the MAP problem is tractable, one can devise tractable algorithms for the M best problem [8, 19]. Speciﬁcally, for low tree-width graphs, this can be done via a variant of max-product [19]. However, when ﬁnding MAPs is not tractable, it is much less clear how to approximate the M best case. One possible approach is to use loopy max-product to obtain approximate max-marginals and use those to approximate the M best solutions [19]. However, this is largely a heuristic and does not provide any guarantees in terms of optimality certiﬁcates or bounds on the optimal values. LP approximations to MAP do enjoy such guarantees. Speciﬁcally, they provide upper bounds on the MAP value and optimality certiﬁcates. Furthermore, they often work for graphs with large tree-width [13]. The goal of the current work is to leverage the power of LP relaxations to the M best case. We begin by focusing on the problem of ﬁnding the second best solution. We show how it can be formulated as an LP over a polytope we call the “assignment-excluding marginal polytope”. In the general case, this polytope may require an exponential number of inequalities, but we prove that when the graph is a tree it has a very compact representation. We proceed to use this result to obtain approximations to the second best problem, and show how these can be tightened in various ways. Next, we show how M best assignments can be found by relying on algorithms for 1 second best assignments, and thus our results for the second best case can be used to devise an approximation algorithm for the M best problem. We conclude by applying our method to several models, showing that it often ﬁnds the exact M best assignments. 1 The M-best MAP problem and its LP formulation Consider a function on n variables deﬁned as: f (x1 , . . . , xn ; θ) = θij (xi , xj ) + ij∈E θi (xi ) (1) i∈V where V and E are the vertices and nodes of a graph G with n nodes. We shall be interested in the M assignments with largest f (x; θ) value.1 Denote these by x(1) , . . . , x(M) , so that x(1) is the assignment that maximizes f (x; θ), x(2) is the 2nd best assignment, etc. The MAP problem (i.e., ﬁnding x(1) ) can be formulated as an LP as follows [15]. Let µ be a vector of distributions that includes {µij (xi , xj )}ij∈E over edge variables and {µi (xi )}i∈V over nodes. The set of µ that arise from some joint distribution is known as the marginal polytope [15] and is denoted by M(G). Formally: M(G) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ) , p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . where ∆ is the set of distributions on x. The MAP problem can then be shown to be equivalent to the following LP:2 max f (x; θ) = max µ · θ , (2) x µ∈M(G) It can be shown that this LP always has a maximizing µ that is a vertex of M(G) and is integral. Furthermore, this µ corresponds to the MAP assignment x(1) . Although the number of variables in this LP is only O(|E| + |V |), the diﬃculty comes from an exponential number of linear inequalities generally required to describe the marginal polytope M(G). We shall ﬁnd it useful to deﬁne a mapping between assignments x and integral vertices of the polytope. Given an integral vertex v ∈ M(G), deﬁne x(v) to be the assignment that maximizes vi (xi ). And, given an assignment z deﬁne v(z) to be the integral vertex in M(G) corresponding to the assignment z. Thus the LP in Eq. 2 will be maximized by v(x(1) ). One simple outer bound of the marginal polytope is the local polytope ML (G), which only enforces pairwise constraints between variables:     µi (xi ) = 1 (3) µij (xi , xj ) = µj (xj ), µij (xi , xj ) = µi (xi ), ML (G) = µ ≥ 0   x x x i j i The LP relaxation is then to maximize µ · θ where µ ∈ ML (G). For tree structured graphs, ML (G) = M(G) [15] and thus the LP relaxation yields the exact MAP x(1) . An LP Formulation for the 2nd -best MAP 2 Assume we found the MAP assignment x(1) and are now interested in ﬁnding x(2) . Is there a simple LP whose solution yields x(2) ? We begin by focusing on the case where G is a tree so that the local LP relaxation is exact. We ﬁrst treat the case of a connected tree. To construct an LP whose solution is x(2) , a natural approach is to use the LP for x(1) (i.e., the LP in Eq. 2) but somehow eliminate the solution x(1) using additional constraints. This, however, is somewhat trickier than it sounds. The key diﬃculty is that the new constraints should not generate fractional vertices, so that the resulting LP is still exact. We begin by deﬁning the polytope over which we need to optimize in order to obtain x(2) . 1 2 This is equivalent to ﬁnding P maximum probability assignments for a model p(x) ∝ ef (x;θ) . the P P P We use the notation µ · θ = ij∈E xi ,xj µij (xi , xj )θij (xi , xj ) + i xi µi (xi )θi (xi ) 2 Deﬁnition 1. The assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | ∃p(x) ∈ ∆ s.t. p(z) = 0, p(xi , xj ) = µij (xi , xj ), p(xi ) = µi (xi )} . ˆ M(G, z) is simply the convex hull of all (integral) vectors v(x) for x = z. (4) ˆ The following result shows that optimizing over M(G, x(1) ) will yield the second best soluˆ tion x(2) , so that we refer to M(G, x(1) ) as the second-best marginal polytope. Lemma 1. The 2nd best solution is obtained via the following LP: maxx=x(1) f (x; θ) = maxµ∈M(G,x(1) ) µ · θ. Furthermore, the µ that maximizes the LP on ˆ the right is integral and corresponds to the second-best MAP assignment x(2) . The proof is similar to that of Eq. 2: instead of optimizing over x, we optimize over distributions p(x), while enforcing that p(x(1) ) = 0 so that x(1) is excluded from the maximization. The key question which we now address is how to obtain a simple characterization of ˆ ˆ M(G, z). Intuitively, it would seems that M(G, z) should be “similar” to M(G), such that it can be described as M(G) plus some constraints that “block” the assignment z. To illustrate the diﬃculty in ﬁnding such “blocking” constraints, consider the following constraint, originally suggested by Santos [10]: i µi (zi ) ≤ n − 1. This inequality is not satisﬁed by µ = v(z) since v(z) attains the value n for the LHS of the above. Furthermore, for any x = z and µ = v(x), the LHS would be n − 1 or less. Thus, this inequality separates ˆ v(z) from all other integral vertices. One might conclude that we can deﬁne M(G, z) by adding this inequality to M(G). The diﬃculty is that the resulting polytope has fractional vertices,3 and maximizing over it won’t generally yield an integral solution. It turns out that there is a diﬀerent inequality that does yield an exact characterization of ˆ M(G, z) when G is a tree. We now deﬁne this inequality and state our main theorem. Deﬁnition 2. Consider the functional I(µ, z) (which is linear in µ): (1 − di )µi (zi ) + I(µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (5) ij∈E where di is the degree of node i in the tree graph G. ˆ Theorem 1. Adding the single inequality I(µ, z) ≤ 0 to M(G) yields M(G, z). ˆ M(G, z) = {µ | µ ∈ M(G), I(µ, z) ≤ 0 } (6) The theorem is proved in the appendix. Taken together with Lemma 1, it implies that x(2) may be obtained via an LP that is very similar to the MAP-LP, but has an additional constraint. We note the interesting similarity between I(µ, z) and the Bethe entropy [20]. The only diﬀerence is that in Bethe, µi , µij are replaced by H(Xi ), H(Xi , Xj ) respectively.4 The theorem also generalizes to the case where G is not a tree, but we have a junction tree for G. In this case, the theorem still holds if we deﬁne a generalized I(µ, z) inequality as: (1 − dS )µS (zS ) + S∈S µC (zC ) ≤ 0 (7) C∈C where C and S are the junction tree cliques and their separators, respectively, and dS is the number of cliques that intersect on separator S. In this case, the marginal polytope should enforce consistency between marginals µC (zC ) and their separators µS (zS ). However, such a characterization requires variables whose cardinality is exponential in the tree-width and is thus tractable only for graphs of low tree-width. In the next section, we address approximations for general graphs. A corresponding result exists for the case when G is a forest. In this case, the inequality in Eq. 6 is modiﬁed to: I(µ, z) ≤ |P | − 1, where |P | denotes the number of connected components of G. Interestingly, for a graph without edges, this gives the Santos inequality. 3 Consider the case of a single edge between 2 nodes where the MAP assignment is (0, 0). Adding the inequality µ1 (0) + µ2 (0) ≤ 1 produces the fractional vertex (0.5, 0.5). 4 The connection to Bethe can be more clearly understood from a duality-based proof of Theorem 1. We will cover this in an extended version of the manuscript. 3 2nd best LPs for general graphs - Spanning tree inequalities 3 When the graph G is not a tree, the marginal polytope M(G) generally requires an exponential number of inequalities. However, as mentioned above, it does have an exact description in terms of marginals over cliques and separators of a junction tree. Given such marginals on ˆ junction tree cliques, we also have an exact characterization of M(G, z) via the constraint in Eq. 7. However, in general, we cannot aﬀord to be exponential in tree-width. Thus a common strategy [15] is to replace M(G) with an outer bound that enforces consistency between marginals on overlapping sets of variables. The simplest example is ML (G) in Eq. 3. ˆ In what follows, we describe an outer-bound approximation scheme for M(G, z). We use ML (G) as the approximation for M(G) (more generally ML (G) can enforce consistency between any set of small regions, e.g., triplets). When G is not a tree, the linear constraint in ˆ Eq. 6 will no longer suﬃce to derive M(G, z). Moreover, direct application of the inequality will incorrectly remove some integral vertices. An alternative approach is to add inequalities that separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. This will serve to eliminate more and more fractional vertices, and if enough constraints are added, this may result in an integral solution. One obvious family of such constraints are those corresponding to spanning trees in G and have the form of Eq. 5. Deﬁnition 3. Consider any T that is a spanning tree of G. Deﬁne the functional I T (µ, z): (1 − dT )µi (zi ) + i I T (µ, z) = i µij (zi , zj ) (8) ij∈T where dT is the degree of i in T . We refer to I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 as a spanning tree inequality. i For any sub-tree T of G, the corresponding spanning tree inequality separates the vertex v(z) from the other vertices. This can be shown via similar arguments as in the proof of Theorem 1. Note, however, that the resulting polytope may still have fractional vertices. The above argument shows that any spanning tree provides a separating inequality for ˆ M(G, z). In principle, we would like to use as many such inequalities as possible. Deﬁnition 4. The spanning tree assignment-excluding marginal polytope is deﬁned as: ˆ MST (G, z) = µ | µ ∈ ML (G), L ∀ tree T ⊆ E I T (µ, z) ≤ 0 (9) where the ST notation indicates the inclusion of all spanning tree inequalities for G.5 Thus, we would actually like to perform the following optimization problem: max ˆ µ∈MST (G,z) L µ·θ ˆ as an approximation to optimization over M(G, z); i.e., we seek the optimal µ subject to all spanning tree inequalities for G with the ambition that this µ be integral and thus provide the non-z MAP assignment, with a certiﬁcate of optimality. Although the number of spanning trees is exponential in n, it turns out that all spanning inequalities can be used in practice. One way to achieve this is via a cutting plane algorithm [12] that ﬁnds the most violated spanning tree inequality and adds it to the LP. To implement this eﬃciently, we note that for a particular µ and a spanning tree T , the value of I T (µ, z) can be decomposed into a sum over the edges in T (and a T -independent constant): I T (µ, z) = µi (zi ) µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ) + (10) i ij∈T The tree maximizing the above is the maximum-weight spanning tree with edge-weights wij = µij (zi , zj ) − µi (zi ) − µj (zj ). It can thus be found eﬃciently. The cutting plane algorithm proceeds as follows. We start by adding an arbitrary spanning tree. Then, as long as the optimal µ is fractional, we ﬁnd the spanning tree inequality that µ most violates (where this is implemented via the maximum-weight spanning tree). This constraint will necessarily remove µ from the polytope. If there are no violated inequalities 5 ˆ ˆL Note that M(G, z) ⊆ MST (G, z) ⊂ ML (G). 4 but µ is still fractional, then spanning tree inequalities do not suﬃce to ﬁnd an integral solution (but see below on hypertree constraints to add in this case). In practice, we found that only a relatively small number of inequalities are needed to successfully yield an integral solution, or determine that all such inequalities are already satisﬁed. An alternative approach for solving the all spanning-tree problem is to work via the dual. The dual variables roughly correspond to points in the spanning tree polytope [16], optimization over which can be done in polynomial time, e.g., via the ellipsoid algorithm. We do not pursue this here since the cutting plane algorithm performed well in our experiments. ˆ As mentioned earlier, we can exactly characterize M(G, z) using Eq. 7, albeit at a cost exponential in the tree-width of the graph. A practical compromise would be to use inequalities over clique trees of G, where the cliques are relatively small, e.g., triplets. The corresponding constraint (Eq. 7 with the small cliques and their separators) will necessarily separate v(z) from the other integral vertices. Finding the maximally violated such inequality is an NP-hard problem, equivalent to a prize collecting Steiner tree problem, but recent work has found that such problems are often exactly solvable in practice [7]. It thus might be practical to include all such trees as constraints using a cutting plane algorithm. 4 From 2nd -best to M-best Thus far, we only dealt with the 2nd best case. As we show now, it turns out that the 2nd -best formalism can be used to devise an algorithm for M best. We begin by describing an algorithm for the exact M best and then show how it can be used to approximate those via the approximations for 2nd best described above. Fig. 1 describes our scheme, which we call Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions (or PES) for solving the M best problem. The scheme is general and only assumes that MAP-“like” problems can be solved. It is inspired by several pre-existing M best solution schemes [4, 6, 8, 19] but diﬀers from them in highlighting the role of ﬁnding a second best solution within a given subspace. for m ← 1 to M do if m = 1 then Run MAP solver to obtain the best assignment: x(1) ≡ arg max f (x; θ) CONSTRAINTS1 ← ∅ else k ←− arg max ′ k′ ∈{1,...,m−1} f (y(k ) ; θ) // sub-space containing mth best assignment x(m) ← y(k) // mth best assignment // A variable choice that distinguishes x(m) from x(k) : (m) (v, a) ← any member of the set {(i, xi (m) ) : xi (k) = xi } CONSTRAINTSm ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(k) (as MAP) from subspace m CONSTRAINTSk ← CONSTRAINTSk ∪ {xv = a} // Eliminate x(m) (as 2nd -best) from subspace k y(k) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSk , x(k) ) end y(m) ← CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTSm , x(m) ) end return {x(m) }M m=1 /* Find next best solution in sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS */ Function CalcNextBestSolution(CONSTRAINTS, x(∗) ) // x(∗) is the MAP in the sub-space defined by CONSTRAINTS: Run MAP solver to obtain the second-best solution: y ≡ arg max f (x; θ), and return y. x=x(∗) ,CONSTRAINTS end Figure 1: Pseudocode for the PES algorithm. The modus operandi of the PES algorithm is to eﬃciently partition the search space while systematically excluding all previously determined assignments. Signiﬁcantly, any MAP 5 Attractive Grids Ranks Run-times 1 50 Mixed Grids Ranks Run-times 1 50 0.5 0 S N B 0 Hard Protein SCP Ranks Run-times 1 50 0.5 S N B 0 0 S+R N+R B+R 0.5 S+R N+R B+R 0 S+R B B+R 0 S+R B B+R Figure 2: Number of best ranks and normalized run-times for the attractive and mixed grids, and the more diﬃcult protein SCP problems.

Algorithms marked with +R denote that regions of variables were added for those runs. solver can be plugged into it, on the condition that it is capable of solving the arg max in the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine. The correctness of PES can be shown by observing that at the M th stage, all previous best solutions are excluded from the optimization and no other assignment is excluded. Of note, this simple partitioning scheme is possible due to the observation that the ﬁrst-best and second-best MAP assignments must diﬀer in the assignment of at least one variable in the graph. The main computational step of the PES algorithm is to maximize f (x; θ) subject to x = x(∗) and x ∈ CONSTRAINTS (see the CalcNextBestSolution subroutine). The CONSTRAINTS set merely enforces that some of the coordinates of x are either equal to or diﬀerent from speciﬁed values.6 Within the LP, these can be enforced by setting µi (xi = a) = 1 or µi (xi = a) = 0. It can be shown that if one optimizes µ · θ with ˆ these constraints and µ ∈ M(G, x(∗) ), the solution is integral. Thus, the only element ˆ requiring approximation in the general case is the description of M(G, x(∗) ). We choose as ˆ this approximation the polytope MST (G, x(∗) ) in Eq. 9. We call the resulting approximaL tion algorithm Spanning TRee Inequalities and Partitioning for Enumerating Solutions, or STRIPES. In the next section, we evaluate this scheme experimentally. 5 Experiments We compared the performance of STRIPES to the BMMF algorithm [19] and the Lawler/Nilsson algorithm [6, 8]. Nilsson’s algorithm is equivalent to PES where the 2nd best assignment is obtained from maximizations within O(n) partitions, so that its runtime is O(n) times the cost of ﬁnding a single MAP. Here we approximated each MAP with its LP relaxation (as in STRIPES), so that both STRIPES and Nilsson come with certiﬁcates of optimality when their LP solutions are integral. BMMF relies on loopy BP to approximate the M best solutions.7 We used M = 50 in all experiments. To compare the algorithms, we pooled all their solutions, noting the 50 top probabilities, and then counted the fraction of these that any particular algorithm found (its solution rank). For run-time comparisons, we normalized the times by the longest-running algorithm for each example. We begin by considering pairwise MRFs on binary grid graphs of size 10 × 10. In the ﬁrst experiment, we used an Ising model with attractive (submodular) potentials, a setting in which the pairwise LP relaxation is exact [14]. For each grid edge ij, we randomly chose Jij ∈ [0, 0.5], and local potentials were randomized in the range ±0.5. The results for 25 graphs are shown in Fig. 2. Both the STRIPES and Nilsson algorithms obtained the 50 optimal solutions (as learned from their optimality certiﬁcates), while BMMF clearly fared less well for some of the graphs. While the STRIPES algorithm took < 0.5 to 2 minutes to run, the Nilsson algorithm took around 13 minutes. On the other hand, BMMF was quicker, taking around 10 seconds per run, while failing to ﬁnd a signiﬁcant portion of the top solutions. Overall, the STRIPES algorithm was required to employ up to 19 spanning tree inequalities per calculation of second-best solution. 6 This is very diﬀerent from the second best constraint, since setting x1 = 1 blocks all assignments with this value, as opposed to setting x = 1 which blocks only the assignment with all ones. 7 For BMMF, we used the C implementation at http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~ talyam/ inference.html. The LPs for STRIPES and Nilsson were solved using CPLEX. 6 Next, we studied Ising models with mixed interaction potentials (with Jij and the local potentials randomly chosen in [−0.5, 0.5]). For almost all of the 25 models, all three algorithms were not able to successfully ﬁnd the top solutions. Thus, we added regions of triplets (two for every grid face) to tighten the LP relaxation (for STRIPES and Nilsson) and to perform GBP instead of BP (for BMMF). This resulted in STRIPES and Nilsson always provably ﬁnding the optimal solutions, and BMMF mostly ﬁnding these solutions (Fig. 2). For these more diﬃcult grids, however, STRIPES was the fastest of the algorithms, taking 0.5 - 5 minutes. On the other hand, the Nilsson and BMMF algorithms took 18 minutes and 2.5 7 minutes, respectively. STRIPES added up to 23 spanning tree inequalities per iteration. The protein side-chain prediction (SCP) problem is to to predict the placement of amino acid side-chains given a protein backbone [2, 18]. Minimization of a protein energy function corresponds to ﬁnding a MAP assignment for a pairwise MRF [19]. We employed the dataset of [18] (up to 45 states per variable, mean approximate tree-width 50), running all algorithms to calculate the optimal side-chain conﬁgurations. For 315 of 370 problems in the dataset, the ﬁrst MAP solution was obtained directly as a result of the LP relaxation having an integral solution (“easy” problems). STRIPES provably found the subsequent top 50 solutions within 4.5 hours for all but one of these cases (up to 8 spanning trees per calculation), and BMMF found the same 50 solutions for each case within 0.5 hours; note that only STRIPES provides a certiﬁcate of optimality for these solutions. On the other hand, only for 146 of the 315 problems was the Nilsson method able to complete within ﬁve days; thus, we do not compare its performance here. For the remaining 55 (“hard”) problems (Fig. 2), we added problem-speciﬁc triplet regions using the MPLP algorithm [13]. We then ran the STRIPES algorithm to ﬁnd the optimal solutions. Surprisingly, it was able to exactly ﬁnd the 50 top solutions for all cases, using up to 4 standard spanning tree inequalities per second-best calculation. The STRIPES run-times for these problems ranged from 6 minutes to 23 hours. On the other hand, whether running BMMF without these regions (BP) or with the regions (GBP), it did not perform as well as STRIPES in terms of the number of high-ranking solutions or its speed. To summarize, STRIPES provably found the top 50 solutions for 369 of the 370 protein SCP problems. 6 Conclusion ˆ In this work, we present a novel combinatorial object M(G, z) and show its utility in obtaining the M best MAP assignments. We provide a simple characterization of it for tree structured graphs, and show how it can be used for approximations in non-tree graphs. As with the marginal polytope, many interesting questions arise about the properties of ˆ M(G, z). For example, in which non-tree cases can we provide a compact characterization (e.g., as for the cut-polytope for planar graphs [1]). Another compelling question is in which problems the spanning tree inequalities are provably optimal. An interesting generalization of our method is to predict diverse solutions satisfying some local measure of “distance” from each other, e.g., as in [2]. Here we studied the polytope that results from excluding one assignment. An intriguing question is to characterize the polytope that excludes M assignments. We have found that it does not simply correspond to adding M constraints I(µ, z i ) ≤ 0 for i = 1, . . . , M , so its ˆ geometry is apparently more complicated than that of M(G, z). Here we used LP solvers to solve for µ. Such generic solvers could be slow for large-scale problems. However, in recent years, specialized algorithms have been suggested for solving MAP-LP relaxations [3, 5, 9, 17]. These use the special form of the constraints to obtain local-updates and more scalable algorithms. We intend to apply these schemes to our method. Finally, our empirical results show that our method indeed leverages the power of LP relaxations and yields exact M best optimal solutions for problems with large tree-width.

Denote pµ (z) as the minimal value of p(z) among all p(x) that give µ. We prove that ˆ pµ (z) = max(0, I(µ, z)), from which the theorem follows (since pµ (z) = 0 iﬀ µ ∈ M(G, z)). The proof is by induction on n. For n = 1, the node has degree 0, so I(µ, z) = µ1 (z1 ). Clearly, pµ (z) = µ1 (z1 ), so pµ (z) = I(µ, z). For n > 1, there must exist a leaf in G ˆ (assume that its index is n and its neighbor’s is n − 1). Denote G as the tree obtained ˆ by removing node n and its edge with n − 1. For any assignment x, denote x as the corresponding sub-assignment for the ﬁrst n − 1 variables. Also, any µ can be derived by ˆ ˆ adding appropriate coordinates to a unique µ ∈ M(G). For an integral vertex µ = v(x), ˆˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ x denote its projected µ as v (ˆ ). Denote by I(µ, z ) the functional in Eq. 5 applied to G. For ˆ any µ and its projected µ, it can be seen that: ˆˆ ˆ I(µ, z) = I(µ, z ) − α (11) where we deﬁne α = xn =zn µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) (so 0 ≤ α ≤ 1). The inductive assumption ˆ ˆ ˆ gives a p(ˆ ) that has marginals µ and also p(ˆ ) = max(0, I(µ, z )). We next use p(ˆ ) to ˆx ˆz ˆx construct a p(x) that has marginals µ and the desired minimal pµ (z). Consider three cases: ˆˆ ˆ I. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 and I(µ, z ) ≤ 0. From the inductive assumption, pµ (ˆ ) = 0, so we deﬁne: ˆˆ z µn−1,n (xn−1 , xn ) p(x) = p(ˆ ) ˆx (12) µn−1 (xn−1 ) which indeed marginalizes to µ, and p(z) = 0 so that pµ (z) = 0 as required. If µn−1 (xn−1 ) = 0, then p(ˆ ) is necessarily 0, in which case we deﬁne p(x) = 0. Note that this construction ˆx is identical to that used in proving that ML (G) = M(G) for a tree graph G. ˆˆ ˆ II. I(µ, z) > 0. Based on Eq. 11 and α ≥ 0, we have I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive ˆ µ, z ) = pµ (ˆ ) > 0. Now, deﬁne p(x) so that p(z) = I(µ, z): ˆ assumption to µ, we obtain I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z xl , l ≤ n − 2 δ(xn−1 = zn−1 ) δ(xn = zn ) p(x) no constraint 0 no constraint As in Eq. 12 0 0 ∃ l x l = zl 1 ∀ l x l = zl 1 µn−1,n (zn−1 , xn ) 1 1 p(ˆ ) ˆx 0 I(µ, z) Simple algebra shows that p(x) is non-negative and has µ as marginals. We now show that p(z) is minimal. Based on the inductive assumption and Eq. 11, it can easily be shown that I(v(z), z) = 1, I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z. For any p(x) s.t. µ = x p(x)v(x), from linearity, I(µ, z) = p(z) + x=z p(x)I(v(x), z) ≤ p(z) (since I(v(x), z) ≤ 0 for x = z). Since the p(z) we deﬁne achieves this lower bound, it is clearly minimal. ˆˆ ˆ ˆ III. I(µ, z) ≤ 0 but I(µ, z ) > 0. Applying the inductive assumption to µ, we see that ˆ µ, z ) > 0; Eq. 11 implies α − I(µ, z ) ≥ 0. Deﬁne β = µn−1 (zn−1 ) − pµ (ˆ ), which ˆˆ ˆ ˆˆ z pµ (ˆ ) = I( ˆ ˆ ˆˆ z ˆ is non-negative since µn−1 (zn−1 ) = µn−1 (ˆ n−1 ) and p marginalizes to µ.

<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>6 0.47307679 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Manifold_Regularization_for_SIR_with_Rate_Root-n_Convergence.html">146 nips-2009-Manifold Regularization for SIR with Rate Root-n Convergence</a></p>

<p>Author: Sundeep Rangan, Alyson K. Fletcher</p><p>Abstract: A well-known analysis of Tropp and Gilbert shows that orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) can recover a k-sparse n-dimensional real vector from m = 4k log(n) noise-free linear measurements obtained through a random Gaussian measurement matrix with a probability that approaches one as n → ∞. This work strengthens this result by showing that a lower number of measurements, m = 2k log(n − k), is in fact sufﬁcient for asymptotic recovery. More generally, when the sparsity level satisﬁes kmin ≤ k ≤ kmax but is unknown, m = 2kmax log(n − kmin ) measurements is sufﬁcient. Furthermore, this number of measurements is also sufﬁcient for detection of the sparsity pattern (support) of the vector with measurement errors provided the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scales to inﬁnity. The scaling m = 2k log(n − k) exactly matches the number of measurements required by the more complex lasso method for signal recovery in a similar SNR scaling.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.88130128 <a title="35-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Approximating_MAP_by_Compensating_for_Structural_Relaxations.html">35 nips-2009-Approximating MAP by Compensating for Structural Relaxations</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Choi, Adnan Darwiche</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new perspective on approximations to the maximum a posteriori (MAP) task in probabilistic graphical models, that is based on simplifying a given instance, and then tightening the approximation. First, we start with a structural relaxation of the original model. We then infer from the relaxation its deﬁciencies, and compensate for them. This perspective allows us to identify two distinct classes of approximations. First, we ﬁnd that max-product belief propagation can be viewed as a way to compensate for a relaxation, based on a particular idealized case for exactness. We identify a second approach to compensation that is based on a more reﬁned idealized case, resulting in a new approximation with distinct properties. We go on to propose a new class of algorithms that, starting with a relaxation, iteratively seeks tighter approximations. 1</p><p>3 0.836707 <a title="35-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-A_unified_framework_for_high-dimensional_analysis_of_%24M%24-estimators_with_decomposable_regularizers.html">20 nips-2009-A unified framework for high-dimensional analysis of $M$-estimators with decomposable regularizers</a></p>
<p>Author: Sahand Negahban, Bin Yu, Martin J. Wainwright, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: High-dimensional statistical inference deals with models in which the the number of parameters p is comparable to or larger than the sample size n. Since it is usually impossible to obtain consistent procedures unless p/n → 0, a line of recent work has studied models with various types of structure (e.g., sparse vectors; block-structured matrices; low-rank matrices; Markov assumptions). In such settings, a general approach to estimation is to solve a regularized convex program (known as a regularized M -estimator) which combines a loss function (measuring how well the model ﬁts the data) with some regularization function that encourages the assumed structure. The goal of this paper is to provide a uniﬁed framework for establishing consistency and convergence rates for such regularized M estimators under high-dimensional scaling. We state one main theorem and show how it can be used to re-derive several existing results, and also to obtain several new results on consistency and convergence rates. Our analysis also identiﬁes two key properties of loss and regularization functions, referred to as restricted strong convexity and decomposability, that ensure the corresponding regularized M -estimators have fast convergence rates. 1</p><p>4 0.83550626 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-Robust_Principal_Component_Analysis%3A_Exact_Recovery_of_Corrupted_Low-Rank_Matrices_via_Convex_Optimization.html">208 nips-2009-Robust Principal Component Analysis: Exact Recovery of Corrupted Low-Rank Matrices via Convex Optimization</a></p>
<p>Author: John Wright, Arvind Ganesh, Shankar Rao, Yigang Peng, Yi Ma</p><p>Abstract: Principal component analysis is a fundamental operation in computational data analysis, with myriad applications ranging from web search to bioinformatics to computer vision and image analysis. However, its performance and applicability in real scenarios are limited by a lack of robustness to outlying or corrupted observations. This paper considers the idealized “robust principal component analysis” problem of recovering a low rank matrix A from corrupted observations D = A + E. Here, the corrupted entries E are unknown and the errors can be arbitrarily large (modeling grossly corrupted observations common in visual and bioinformatic data), but are assumed to be sparse. We prove that most matrices A can be efﬁciently and exactly recovered from most error sign-and-support patterns by solving a simple convex program, for which we give a fast and provably convergent algorithm. Our result holds even when the rank of A grows nearly proportionally (up to a logarithmic factor) to the dimensionality of the observation space and the number of errors E grows in proportion to the total number of entries in the matrix. A by-product of our analysis is the ﬁrst proportional growth results for the related problem of completing a low-rank matrix from a small fraction of its entries. Simulations and real-data examples corroborate the theoretical results, and suggest potential applications in computer vision. 1</p><p>5 0.83405602 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Free_energy_score_space.html">97 nips-2009-Free energy score space</a></p>
<p>Author: Alessandro Perina, Marco Cristani, Umberto Castellani, Vittorio Murino, Nebojsa Jojic</p><p>Abstract: A score function induced by a generative model of the data can provide a feature vector of a ﬁxed dimension for each data sample. Data samples themselves may be of differing lengths (e.g., speech segments, or other sequence data), but as a score function is based on the properties of the data generation process, it produces a ﬁxed-length vector in a highly informative space, typically referred to as a “score space”. Discriminative classiﬁers have been shown to achieve higher performance in appropriately chosen score spaces than is achievable by either the corresponding generative likelihood-based classiﬁers, or the discriminative classiﬁers using standard feature extractors. In this paper, we present a novel score space that exploits the free energy associated with a generative model. The resulting free energy score space (FESS) takes into account latent structure of the data at various levels, and can be trivially shown to lead to classiﬁcation performance that at least matches the performance of the free energy classiﬁer based on the same generative model, and the same factorization of the posterior. We also show that in several typical vision and computational biology applications the classiﬁers optimized in FESS outperform the corresponding pure generative approaches, as well as a number of previous approaches to combining discriminating and generative models.</p><p>6 0.83378929 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Group_Sparse_Coding.html">104 nips-2009-Group Sparse Coding</a></p>

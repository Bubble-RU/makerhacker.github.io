<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Honglak Lee, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classiﬁer. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We ﬁnd that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We ﬁnd that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of “deep” vs. “shallower” representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.20995702 <a title="219-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2009-The_%27tree-dependent_components%27_of_natural_scenes_are_edge_filters.html">241 nips-2009-The 'tree-dependent components' of natural scenes are edge filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>4 0.1542877 <a title="219-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-3D_Object_Recognition_with_Deep_Belief_Nets.html">2 nips-2009-3D Object Recognition with Deep Belief Nets</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinod Nair, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new type of top-level model for Deep Belief Nets and evaluate it on a 3D object recognition task. The top-level model is a third-order Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under diﬀerent lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modiﬁed version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error. 1</p><p>5 0.1491068 <a title="219-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Learning_transport_operators_for_image_manifolds.html">137 nips-2009-Learning transport operators for image manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, James S. Bergstra</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new type of neural network activation function based on recent physiological rate models for complex cells in visual area V1. A single-hiddenlayer neural network of this kind of model achieves 1.50% error on MNIST. We also introduce an existing criterion for learning slow, decorrelated features as a pretraining strategy for image models. This pretraining strategy results in orientation-selective features, similar to the receptive ﬁelds of complex cells. With this pretraining, the same single-hidden-layer model achieves 1.34% error, even though the pretraining sample distribution is very different from the ﬁne-tuning distribution. To implement this pretraining strategy, we derive a fast algorithm for online learning of decorrelated features such that each iteration of the algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of features. 1</p><p>2 0.75252998 <a title="219-lsi-2" href="./nips-2009-Measuring_Invariances_in_Deep_Networks.html">151 nips-2009-Measuring Invariances in Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ian Goodfellow, Honglak Lee, Quoc V. Le, Andrew Saxe, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: For many pattern recognition tasks, the ideal input feature would be invariant to multiple confounding properties (such as illumination and viewing angle, in computer vision applications). Recently, deep architectures trained in an unsupervised manner have been proposed as an automatic method for extracting useful features. However, it is difﬁcult to evaluate the learned features by any means other than using them in a classiﬁer. In this paper, we propose a number of empirical tests that directly measure the degree to which these learned features are invariant to different input transformations. We ﬁnd that stacked autoencoders learn modestly increasingly invariant features with depth when trained on natural images. We ﬁnd that convolutional deep belief networks learn substantially more invariant features in each layer. These results further justify the use of “deep” vs. “shallower” representations, but suggest that mechanisms beyond merely stacking one autoencoder on top of another may be important for achieving invariance. Our evaluation metrics can also be used to evaluate future work in deep learning, and thus help the development of future algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.68038768 <a title="219-lsi-3" href="./nips-2009-The_%27tree-dependent_components%27_of_natural_scenes_are_edge_filters.html">241 nips-2009-The 'tree-dependent components' of natural scenes are edge filters</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Zoran, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new model for natural image statistics. Instead of minimizing dependency between components of natural images, we maximize a simple form of dependency in the form of tree-dependencies. By learning ﬁlters and tree structures which are best suited for natural images we observe that the resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters, similar to the famous ICA on natural images results. Calculating the likelihood of an image patch using our model requires estimating the squared output of pairs of ﬁlters connected in the tree. We observe that after learning, these pairs of ﬁlters are predominantly of similar orientations but different phases, so their joint energy resembles models of complex cells. 1 Introduction and related work Many models of natural image statistics have been proposed in recent years [1, 2, 3, 4]. A common goal of many of these models is ﬁnding a representation in which components or sub-components of the image are made as independent or as sparse as possible [5, 6, 2]. This has been found to be a difﬁcult goal, as natural images have a highly intricate structure and removing dependencies between components is hard [7]. In this work we take a different approach, instead of minimizing dependence between components we try to maximize a simple form of dependence - tree dependence. It would be useful to place this model in context of previous works about natural image statistics. Many earlier models are described by the marginal statistics solely, obtaining a factorial form of the likelihood: p(x) = pi (xi ) (1) i The most notable model of this approach is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), where one seeks to ﬁnd a linear transformation which maximizes independence between components (thus ﬁtting well with the aforementioned factorization). This model has been applied to many scenarios, and proved to be one of the great successes of natural image statistics modeling with the emergence of edge-ﬁlters [5]. This approach has two problems. The ﬁrst is that dependencies between components are still very strong, even with those learned transformation seeking to remove them. Second, it has been shown that ICA achieves, after the learned transformation, only marginal gains when measured quantitatively against simpler method like PCA [7] in terms of redundancy reduction. A different approach was taken recently in the form of radial Gaussianization [8], in which components which are distributed in a radially symmetric manner are made independent by transforming them non-linearly into a radial Gaussian, and thus, independent from one another. A more elaborate approach, related to ICA, is Independent Subspace Component Analysis or ISA. In this model, one looks for independent subspaces of the data, while allowing the sub-components 1 Figure 1: Our model with respect to marginal models such as ICA (a), and ISA like models (b). Our model, being a tree based model (c), allows components to belong to more than one subspace, and the subspaces are not required to be independent. of each subspace to be dependent: p(x) = pk (xi∈K ) (2) k This model has been applied to natural images as well and has been shown to produce the emergence of phase invariant edge detectors, akin to complex cells in V1 [2]. Independent models have several shortcoming, but by far the most notable one is the fact that the resulting components are, in fact, highly dependent. First, dependency between the responses of ICA ﬁlters has been reported many times [2, 7]. Also, dependencies between ISA components has also been observed [9]. Given these robust dependencies between ﬁlter outputs, it is somewhat peculiar that in order to get simple cell properties one needs to assume independence. In this work we ask whether it is possible to obtain V1 like ﬁlters in a model that assumes dependence. In our model we assume the ﬁlter distribution can be described by a tree graphical model [10] (see Figure 1). Degenerate cases of tree graphical models include ICA (in which no edges are present) and ISA (in which edges are only present within a subspace). But in its non-degenerate form, our model assumes any two ﬁlter outputs may be dependent. We allow components to belong to more than one subspace, and as a result, do not require independence between them. 2 Model and learning Our model is comprised of three main components. Given a set of patches, we look for the parameters which maximize the likelihood of a whitened natural image patch z: N p(yi |ypai ; β) p(z; W, β, T ) = p(y1 ) (3) i=1 Where y = Wz, T is the tree structure, pai denotes the parent of node i and β is a parameter of the density model (see below for the details). The three components we are trying to learn are: 1. The ﬁlter matrix W, where every row deﬁnes one of the ﬁlters. The response of these ﬁlters is assumed to be tree-dependent. We assume that W is orthogonal (and is a rotation of a whitening transform). 2. The tree structure T which speciﬁes which components are dependent on each other. 3. The probability density function for connected nodes in the tree, which specify the exact form of dependency between nodes. All three together describe a complete model for whitened natural image patches, allowing likelihood estimation and exact inference [11]. We perform the learning in an iterative manner: we start by learning the tree structure and density model from the entire data set, then, keeping the structure and density constant, we learn the ﬁlters via gradient ascent in mini-batches. Going back to the tree structure we repeat the process many times iteratively. It is important to note that both the ﬁlter set and tree structure are learned from the data, and are continuously updated during learning. In the following sections we will provide details on the speciﬁcs of each part of the model. 2 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 β=0.0 β=0.5 β=1.0 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 −1 0 −1 −2 −1 −2 −3 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 0 x1 2 −2 −3 −2 0 x1 2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 −1 −2 −3 −2 0 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 2 x2 3 −3 −2 0 x1 2 −2 0 x1 2 Figure 2: Shape of the conditional (Left three plots) and joint (Right three plots) density model in log scale for several values of β, from dependence to independence. 2.1 Learning tree structure In their seminal paper, Chow and Liu showed how to learn the optimal tree structure approximation for a multidimensional probability density function [12]. This algorithm is easy to apply to this scenario, and requires just a few simple steps. First, given the current estimate for the ﬁlter matrix W, we calculate the response of each of the ﬁlters with all the patches in the data set. Using these responses, we calculate the mutual information between each pair of ﬁlters (nodes) to obtain a fully connected weighted graph. The ﬁnal step is to ﬁnd a maximal spanning tree over this graph. The resulting unrooted tree is the optimal tree approximation of the joint distribution function over all nodes. We will note that the tree is unrooted, and the root can be chosen arbitrarily - this means that there is no node, or ﬁlter, that is more important than the others - the direction in the tree graph is arbitrary as long as it is chosen in a consistent way. 2.2 Joint probability density functions Gabor ﬁlter responses on natural images exhibit highly kurtotic marginal distributions, with heavy tails and sharp peaks [13, 3, 14]. Joint pair wise distributions also exhibit this same shape with varying degrees of dependency between the components [13, 2]. The density model we use allows us to capture both the highly kurtotic nature of the distributions, while still allowing varying degrees of dependence using a mixing variable. We use a mix of two forms of ﬁnite, zero mean Gaussian Scale Mixtures (GSM). In one, the components are assumed to be independent of each other and in the other, they are assumed to be spherically distributed. The mixing variable linearly interpolates between the two, allowing us to capture the whole range of dependencies: p(x1 , x2 ; β) = βpdep (x1 , x2 ) + (1 − β)pind (x1 , x2 ) (4) When β = 1 the two components are dependent (unless p is Gaussian), whereas when β = 0 the two components are independent. For the density functions themselves, we use a ﬁnite GSM. The dependent case is a scale mixture of bivariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 , x2 ; σk I) pdep (x1 , x2 ) = (5) k While the independent case is a product of two independent univariate Gaussians: 2 πk N (x1 ; σk ) pind (x1 , x2 ) = k 2 πk N (x2 ; σk ) (6) k 2 Estimating parameters πk and σk for the GSM is done directly from the data using Expectation Maximization. These parameters are the same for all edges and are estimated only once on the ﬁrst iteration. See Figure 2 for a visualization of the conditional distribution functions for varying values of β. We will note that the marginal distributions for the two types of joint distributions above are the same. The mixing parameter β is also estimated using EM, but this is done for each edge in the tree separately, thus allowing our model to theoretically capture the fully independent case (ICA) and other degenerate models such as ISA. 2.3 Learning tree dependent components Given the current tree structure and density model, we can now learn the matrix W via gradient ascent on the log likelihood of the model. All learning is performed on whitened, dimensionally 3 reduced patches. This means that W is a N × N rotation (orthonormal) matrix, where N is the number of dimensions after dimensionality reduction (see details below). Given an image patch z we multiply it by W to get the response vector y: y = Wz (7) Now we can calculate the log likelihood of the given patch using the tree model (which we assume is constant at the moment): N log p(yi |ypai ) log p(y) = log p(yroot ) + (8) i=1 Where pai denotes the parent of node i. Now, taking the derivative w.r.t the r-th row of W: ∂ log p(y) ∂ log p(y) T = z ∂Wr ∂yr (9) Where z is the whitened natural image patch. Finally, we can calculate the derivative of the log likelihood with respect to the r-th element in y: ∂ log p(ypar , yr ) ∂ log p(y) = + ∂yr ∂yr c∈C(r) ∂ log p(yr , yc ) ∂ log p(yr ) − ∂yr ∂yr (10) Where C(r) denote the children of node r. In summary, the gradient ascent rule for updating the rotation matrix W is given by: t+1 t Wr = Wr + η ∂ log p(y) T z ∂yr (11) Where η is the learning rate constant. After update, the rows of W are orthonormalized. This gradient ascent rule is applied for several hundreds of patches (see details below), after which the tree structure is learned again as described in Section 2.1, using the new ﬁlter matrix W, repeating this process for many iterations. 3 Results and analysis 3.1 Validation Before running the full algorithm on natural image data, we wanted to validate that it does produce sensible results with simple synthetic data. We generated noise from four different models, one is 1/f independent Gaussian noise with 8 Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) ﬁlters, the second is a simple ICA model with 8 DCT ﬁlters, and highly kurtotic marginals. The third was a simple ISA model - 4 subspaces, each with two ﬁlters from the DCT ﬁlter set. Distribution within the subspace was a circular, highly kurtotic GSM, and the subspaces were sampled independently. Finally, we generated data from a simple synthetic tree of DCT ﬁlters, using the same joint distributions as for the ISA model. These four synthetic random data sets were given to the algorithm - results can be seen in Figure 3 for the ICA, ISA and tree samples. In all cases the model learned the ﬁlters and distribution correctly, reproducing both the ﬁlters (up to rotations within the subspace in ISA) and the dependency structure between the different ﬁlters. In the case of 1/f Gaussian noise, any whitening transformation is equally likely and any value of beta is equally likely. Thus in this case, the algorithm cannot ﬁnd the tree or the ﬁlters. 3.2 Learning from natural image patches We then ran experiments with a set of natural images [9]1 . These images contain natural scenes such as mountains, ﬁelds and lakes. . The data set was 50,000 patches, each 16 × 16 pixels large. The patches’ DC was removed and they were then whitened using PCA. Dimension was reduced from 256 to 128 dimensions. The GSM for the density model had 16 components. Several initial 1 available at http://www.cis.hut.ﬁ/projects/ica/imageica/ 4 Figure 3: Validation of the algorithm. Noise was generated from three models - top row is ICA, middle row is ISA and bottom row is a tree model. Samples were then given to the algorithm. On the right are the resulting learned tree models. Presented are the learned ﬁlters, tree model (with white edges meaning β = 0, black meaning β = 1 and grays intermediate values) and an example of a marginal histogram for one of the ﬁlters. It can be seen that in all cases all parts of the model were correctly learned. Filters in the ISA case were learned up to rotation within the subspace, and all ﬁlters were learned up to sign. β values for the ICA case were always below 0.1, as were the values of β between subspaces in ISA. conditions for the matrix W were tried out (random rotations, identity) but this had little effect on results. Mini-batches of 10 patches each were used for the gradient ascent - the gradient of 10 patches was summed, and then normalized to have unit norm. The learning rate constant η was set to 0.1. Tree structure learning and estimation of the mixing variable β were done every 500 mini-batches. All in all, 50 iterations were done over the data set. 3.3 Filters and tree structure Figures 4 and 5 show the learned ﬁlters (WQ where Q is the whitening matrix) and tree structure (T ) learned from natural images. Unlike the ISA toy data in ﬁgure 3, here a full tree was learned and β is approximately one for all edges. The GSM that was learned for the marginals was highly kurtotic. It can be seen that resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters at varying scales, positions and orientations. This is similar to the result one gets when applying ICA to natural images [5, 15]. More interesting is Figure 4: Left: Filter set learned from 16 × 16 natural image patches. Filters are ordered by PCA eigenvalues, largest to smallest. Resulting ﬁlters are edge ﬁlters having different orientations, positions, frequencies and phases. Right: The “feature” set learned, that is, columns of the pseudo inverse of the ﬁlter set. 5 Figure 5: The learned tree graph structure and feature set. It can be seen that neighboring features on the graph have similar orientation, position and frequency. See Figure 4 for a better view of the feature details, and see text for full detail and analysis. Note that the ﬁgure is rotated CW. 6 Optimal Orientation Optimal Frequency 3.5 Optimal Phase 7 3 0.8 6 2.5 Optimal Position Y 0.9 6 5 5 0.7 0.6 3 Child 1.5 4 Child 2 Child Child 4 3 2 1 1 0.4 0.3 2 0.5 0.5 0.2 0 1 0.1 0 0 1 2 Parent 3 4 0 0 2 4 Parent 6 8 0 0 1 2 3 Parent 4 5 6 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 Parent 0.8 1 Figure 6: Correlation of optimal parameters in neighboring nodes in the tree graph. Orientation, frequency and position are highly correlated, while phase seems to be entirely uncorrelated. This property of correlation in frequency and orientation, while having no correlation in phase is related to the ubiquitous energy model of complex cells in V1. See text for further details. Figure 7: Left: Comparison of log likelihood values of our model with PCA, ICA and ISA. Our model gives the highest likelihood. Right: Samples taken at random from ICA, ISA and our model. Samples from our model appear to contain more long-range structure. the tree graph structure learned along with the ﬁlters which is shown in Figure 5. It can be seen that neighboring ﬁlters (nodes) in the tree tend to have similar position, frequency and orientation. Figure 6 shows the correlation of optimal frequency, orientation and position for neighboring ﬁlters in the tree - it is obvious that all three are highly correlated. Also apparent in this ﬁgure is the fact that the optimal phase for neighboring ﬁlters has no signiﬁcant correlation. It has been suggested that ﬁlters which have the same orientation, frequency and position with different phase can be related to complex cells in V1 [2, 16]. 3.4 Comparison to other models Since our model is a generalization of both ICA and ISA we use it to learn both models. In order to learn ICA we used the exact same data set, but the tree had no edges and was not learned from the data (alternatively, we could have just set β = 0). For ISA we used a forest architecture of 2 node trees, setting β = 1 for all edges (which means a spherical symmetric distribution), no tree structure was learned. Both models produce edge ﬁlters similar to what we learn (and to those in [5, 15, 6]). The ISA model produces neighboring nodes with similar frequency and orientation, but different phase, as was reported in [2]. We also compare to a simple PCA whitening transform, using the same whitening transform and marginals as in the ICA case, but setting W = I. We compare the likelihood each model gives for a test set of natural image patches, different from the one that was used in training. There were 50,000 patches in the test set, and we calculate the mean log likelihood over the entire set. The table in Figure 7 shows the result - as can be seen, our model performs better in likelihood terms than both ICA and ISA. Using a tree model, as opposed to more complex graphical models, allows for easy sampling from the model. Figure 7 shows 20 random samples taken from our tree model along with samples from the ICA and ISA models. Note the elongated structures (e.g. in the bottom left sample) in the samples from the tree model, and compare to patches sampled from the ICA and ISA models. 7 40 40 30 30 20 20 10 1 10 0.8 0.6 0.4 0 0.2 0 0 1 2 3 Orientation 4 0 0 2 4 6 Frequency 8 0 2 4 Phase Figure 8: Left: Interpretation of the model. Given a patch, the response of all edge ﬁlters is computed (“simple cells”), then at each edge, the corresponding nodes are squared and summed to produce the response of the “complex cell” this edge represents. Both the response of complex cells and simple cells is summed to produce the likelihood of the patch. Right: Response of a “complex cell” in our model to changing phase, frequency and orientation. Response in the y-axis is the sum of squares of the two ﬁlters in this “complex cell”. Note that while the cell is selective to orientation and frequency, it is rather invariant to phase. 3.5 Tree models and complex cells One way to interpret the model is looking at the likelihood of a given patch under this model. For the case of β = 1 substituting Equation 4 into Equation 3 yields: 2 2 ρ( yi + ypai ) − ρ(|ypai |) log L(z) = (12) i 2 Where ρ(x) = log k πk N (x; σk ) . This form of likelihood has an interesting similarity to models of complex cells in V1 [2, 4]. In Figure 8 we draw a simple two-layer network that computes the likelihood. The ﬁrst layer applies linear ﬁlters (“simple cells”) to the image patch, while the second layer sums the squared outputs of similarly oriented ﬁlters from the ﬁrst layer, having different phases, which are connected in the tree (“complex cells”). Output is also dependent on the actual response of the “simple cell” layer. The likelihood here is maximized when both the response of the parent ﬁlter ypai and the child yi is zero, but, given that one ﬁlter has responded with a non-zero value, the likelihood is maximized when the other ﬁlter also ﬁres (see the conditional density in Figure 2). Figure 8 also shows an example of the phase invariance which is present in the learned</p><p>4 0.63505787 <a title="219-lsi-4" href="./nips-2009-3D_Object_Recognition_with_Deep_Belief_Nets.html">2 nips-2009-3D Object Recognition with Deep Belief Nets</a></p>
<p>Author: Vinod Nair, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new type of top-level model for Deep Belief Nets and evaluate it on a 3D object recognition task. The top-level model is a third-order Boltzmann machine, trained using a hybrid algorithm that combines both generative and discriminative gradients. Performance is evaluated on the NORB database (normalized-uniform version), which contains stereo-pair images of objects under diﬀerent lighting conditions and viewpoints. Our model achieves 6.5% error on the test set, which is close to the best published result for NORB (5.9%) using a convolutional neural net that has built-in knowledge of translation invariance. It substantially outperforms shallow models such as SVMs (11.6%). DBNs are especially suited for semi-supervised learning, and to demonstrate this we consider a modiﬁed version of the NORB recognition task in which additional unlabeled images are created by applying small translations to the images in the database. With the extra unlabeled data (and the same amount of labeled data as before), our model achieves 5.2% error. 1</p><p>5 0.60767925 <a title="219-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_audio_classification_using_convolutional_deep_belief_networks.html">253 nips-2009-Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Peter Pham, Yan Largman, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained signiﬁcant interest as a way of building hierarchical representations from unlabeled data. However, to our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks to audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classiﬁcation tasks. In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classiﬁcation tasks. We hope that this paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches applied to a wide range of audio recognition tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.59249943 <a title="219-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Learning_transport_operators_for_image_manifolds.html">137 nips-2009-Learning transport operators for image manifolds</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Alex Kulesza, Mark Dredze</p><p>Abstract: We present AROW, a new online learning algorithm that combines several useful properties: large margin training, conﬁdence weighting, and the capacity to handle non-separable data. AROW performs adaptive regularization of the prediction function upon seeing each new instance, allowing it to perform especially well in the presence of label noise. We derive a mistake bound, similar in form to the second order perceptron bound, that does not assume separability. We also relate our algorithm to recent conﬁdence-weighted online learning techniques and show empirically that AROW achieves state-of-the-art performance and notable robustness in the case of non-separable data. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.76368713 <a title="219-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Slow%2C_Decorrelated_Features_for_Pretraining_Complex_Cell-like_Networks.html">219 nips-2009-Slow, Decorrelated Features for Pretraining Complex Cell-like Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, James S. Bergstra</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a new type of neural network activation function based on recent physiological rate models for complex cells in visual area V1. A single-hiddenlayer neural network of this kind of model achieves 1.50% error on MNIST. We also introduce an existing criterion for learning slow, decorrelated features as a pretraining strategy for image models. This pretraining strategy results in orientation-selective features, similar to the receptive ﬁelds of complex cells. With this pretraining, the same single-hidden-layer model achieves 1.34% error, even though the pretraining sample distribution is very different from the ﬁne-tuning distribution. To implement this pretraining strategy, we derive a fast algorithm for online learning of decorrelated features such that each iteration of the algorithm runs in linear time with respect to the number of features. 1</p><p>3 0.75525105 <a title="219-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Rethinking_LDA%3A_Why_Priors_Matter.html">205 nips-2009-Rethinking LDA: Why Priors Matter</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrew McCallum, David M. Mimno, Hanna M. Wallach</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of topic models typically use symmetric Dirichlet priors with ﬁxed concentration parameters, with the implicit assumption that such “smoothing parameters” have little practical effect. In this paper, we explore several classes of structured priors for topic models. We ﬁnd that an asymmetric Dirichlet prior over the document–topic distributions has substantial advantages over a symmetric prior, while an asymmetric prior over the topic–word distributions provides no real beneﬁt. Approximation of this prior structure through simple, efﬁcient hyperparameter optimization steps is sufﬁcient to achieve these performance gains. The prior structure we advocate substantially increases the robustness of topic models to variations in the number of topics and to the highly skewed word frequency distributions common in natural language. Since this prior structure can be implemented using efﬁcient algorithms that add negligible cost beyond standard inference techniques, we recommend it as a new standard for topic modeling. 1</p><p>4 0.68188202 <a title="219-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-On_Stochastic_and_Worst-case_Models_for_Investing.html">178 nips-2009-On Stochastic and Worst-case Models for Investing</a></p>
<p>Author: Elad Hazan, Satyen Kale</p><p>Abstract: In practice, most investing is done assuming a probabilistic model of stock price returns known as the Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM). While often an acceptable approximation, the GBM model is not always valid empirically. This motivates a worst-case approach to investing, called universal portfolio management, where the objective is to maximize wealth relative to the wealth earned by the best ﬁxed portfolio in hindsight. In this paper we tie the two approaches, and design an investment strategy which is universal in the worst-case, and yet capable of exploiting the mostly valid GBM model. Our method is based on new and improved regret bounds for online convex optimization with exp-concave loss functions. 1</p><p>5 0.67673004 <a title="219-lda-5" href="./nips-2009-Conditional_Random_Fields_with_High-Order_Features_for_Sequence_Labeling.html">57 nips-2009-Conditional Random Fields with High-Order Features for Sequence Labeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Ye, Wee S. Lee, Hai L. Chieu, Dan Wu</p><p>Abstract: Dependencies among neighbouring labels in a sequence is an important source of information for sequence labeling problems. However, only dependencies between adjacent labels are commonly exploited in practice because of the high computational complexity of typical inference algorithms when longer distance dependencies are taken into account. In this paper, we show that it is possible to design efﬁcient inference algorithms for a conditional random ﬁeld using features that depend on long consecutive label sequences (high-order features), as long as the number of distinct label sequences used in the features is small. This leads to efﬁcient learning algorithms for these conditional random ﬁelds. We show experimentally that exploiting dependencies using high-order features can lead to substantial performance improvements for some problems and discuss conditions under which high-order features can be effective. 1</p><p>6 0.63715571 <a title="219-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Replicated_Softmax%3A_an_Undirected_Topic_Model.html">204 nips-2009-Replicated Softmax: an Undirected Topic Model</a></p>

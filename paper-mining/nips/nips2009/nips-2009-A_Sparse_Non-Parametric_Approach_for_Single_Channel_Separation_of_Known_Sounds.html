The approach is based on a Gaussian observation model and Gaussian priors with bilinear equality and inequality constraints. We present an efﬁcient Markov chain Monte Carlo inference procedure based on Gibbs sampling. Special cases of the proposed model are Bayesian formulations of nonnegative matrix factorization and factor analysis. The method is evaluated on a blind source separation problem.

<p>Author: Marcel V. Gerven, Botond Cseke, Robert Oostenveld, Tom Heskes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel multivariate Laplace (MVL) distribution as a sparsity promoting prior for Bayesian source localization that allows the speciﬁcation of constraints between and within sources. We represent the MVL distribution as a scale mixture that induces a coupling between source variances instead of their means. Approximation of the posterior marginals using expectation propagation is shown to be very efﬁcient due to properties of the scale mixture representation. The computational bottleneck amounts to computing the diagonal elements of a sparse matrix inverse. Our approach is illustrated using a mismatch negativity paradigm for which MEG data and a structural MRI have been acquired. We show that spatial coupling leads to sources which are active over larger cortical areas as compared with an uncoupled prior. 1</p><p>4 0.15005498 <a title="17-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2009-Matrix_Completion_from_Noisy_Entries.html">147 nips-2009-Matrix Completion from Noisy Entries</a></p>
<p>Author: Raghunandan Keshavan, Andrea Montanari, Sewoong Oh</p><p>Abstract: Given a matrix M of low-rank, we consider the problem of reconstructing it from noisy observations of a small, random subset of its entries. The problem arises in a variety of applications, from collaborative ﬁltering (the ‘Netﬂix problem’) to structure-from-motion and positioning. We study a low complexity algorithm introduced in [1], based on a combination of spectral techniques and manifold optimization, that we call here O PT S PACE. We prove performance guarantees that are order-optimal in a number of circumstances. 1</p><p>5 0.11082995 <a title="17-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2009-Group_Sparse_Coding.html">104 nips-2009-Group Sparse Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Samy Bengio, Fernando Pereira, Yoram Singer, Dennis Strelow</p><p>Abstract: Bag-of-words document representations are often used in text, image and video processing. While it is relatively easy to determine a suitable word dictionary for text documents, there is no simple mapping from raw images or videos to dictionary terms. The classical approach builds a dictionary using vector quantization over a large set of useful visual descriptors extracted from a training set, and uses a nearest-neighbor algorithm to count the number of occurrences of each dictionary word in documents to be encoded. More robust approaches have been proposed recently that represent each visual descriptor as a sparse weighted combination of dictionary words. While favoring a sparse representation at the level of visual descriptors, those methods however do not ensure that images have sparse representation. In this work, we use mixed-norm regularization to achieve sparsity at the image level as well as a small overall dictionary. This approach can also be used to encourage using the same dictionary words for all the images in a class, providing a discriminative signal in the construction of image representations. Experimental results on a benchmark image classiﬁcation dataset show that when compact image or dictionary representations are needed for computational efﬁciency, the proposed approach yields better mean average precision in classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>6 0.10429182 <a title="17-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_audio_classification_using_convolutional_deep_belief_networks.html">253 nips-2009-Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Zahi Karam, Douglas Sturim, William M. Campbell</p><p>Abstract: Speaker comparison, the process of ﬁnding the speaker similarity between two speech signals, occupies a central role in a variety of applications—speaker veriﬁcation, clustering, and identiﬁcation. Speaker comparison can be placed in a geometric framework by casting the problem as a model comparison process. For a given speech signal, feature vectors are produced and used to adapt a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Speaker comparison can then be viewed as the process of compensating and ﬁnding metrics on the space of adapted models. We propose a framework, inner product discriminant functions (IPDFs), which extends many common techniques for speaker comparison—support vector machines, joint factor analysis, and linear scoring. The framework uses inner products between the parameter vectors of GMM models motivated by several statistical methods. Compensation of nuisances is performed via linear transforms on GMM parameter vectors. Using the IPDF framework, we show that many current techniques are simple variations of each other. We demonstrate, on a 2006 NIST speaker recognition evaluation task, new scoring methods using IPDFs which produce excellent error rates and require signiﬁcantly less computation than current techniques.</p><p>5 0.39142296 <a title="17-lsi-5" href="./nips-2009-Unsupervised_feature_learning_for_audio_classification_using_convolutional_deep_belief_networks.html">253 nips-2009-Unsupervised feature learning for audio classification using convolutional deep belief networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Peter Pham, Yan Largman, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: In recent years, deep learning approaches have gained signiﬁcant interest as a way of building hierarchical representations from unlabeled data. However, to our knowledge, these deep learning approaches have not been extensively studied for auditory data. In this paper, we apply convolutional deep belief networks to audio data and empirically evaluate them on various audio classiﬁcation tasks. In the case of speech data, we show that the learned features correspond to phones/phonemes. In addition, our feature representations learned from unlabeled audio data show very good performance for multiple audio classiﬁcation tasks. We hope that this paper will inspire more research on deep learning approaches applied to a wide range of audio recognition tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.38753229 <a title="17-lsi-6" href="./nips-2009-Matrix_Completion_from_Noisy_Entries.html">147 nips-2009-Matrix Completion from Noisy Entries</a></p>

<p>Author: Romain Brasselet, Roland Johansson, Angelo Arleo</p><p>Abstract: We study an encoding/decoding mechanism accounting for the relative spike timing of the signals propagating from peripheral nerve ﬁbers to second-order somatosensory neurons in the cuneate nucleus (CN). The CN is modeled as a population of spiking neurons receiving as inputs the spatiotemporal responses of real mechanoreceptors obtained via microneurography recordings in humans. The efﬁciency of the haptic discrimination process is quantiﬁed by a novel deﬁnition of entropy that takes into full account the metrical properties of the spike train space. This measure proves to be a suitable decoding scheme for generalizing the classical Shannon entropy to spike-based neural codes. It permits an assessment of neurotransmission in the presence of a large output space (i.e. hundreds of spike trains) with 1 ms temporal precision. It is shown that the CN population code performs a complete discrimination of 81 distinct stimuli already within 35 ms of the ﬁrst afferent spike, whereas a partial discrimination (80% of the maximum information transmission) is possible as rapidly as 15 ms. This study suggests that the CN may not constitute a mere synaptic relay along the somatosensory pathway but, rather, it may convey optimal contextual accounts (in terms of fast and reliable information transfer) of peripheral tactile inputs to downstream structures of the central nervous system. 1</p><p>2 0.85359615 <a title="17-lda-2" href="./nips-2009-Time-rescaling_methods_for_the_estimation_and_assessment_of_non-Poisson_neural_encoding_models.html">247 nips-2009-Time-rescaling methods for the estimation and assessment of non-Poisson neural encoding models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work on the statistical modeling of neural responses has focused on modulated renewal processes in which the spike rate is a function of the stimulus and recent spiking history. Typically, these models incorporate spike-history dependencies via either: (A) a conditionally-Poisson process with rate dependent on a linear projection of the spike train history (e.g., generalized linear model); or (B) a modulated non-Poisson renewal process (e.g., inhomogeneous gamma process). Here we show that the two approaches can be combined, resulting in a conditional renewal (CR) model for neural spike trains. This model captures both real-time and rescaled-time history effects, and can be ﬁt by maximum likelihood using a simple application of the time-rescaling theorem [1]. We show that for any modulated renewal process model, the log-likelihood is concave in the linear ﬁlter parameters only under certain restrictive conditions on the renewal density (ruling out many popular choices, e.g. gamma with shape κ = 1), suggesting that real-time history effects are easier to estimate than non-Poisson renewal properties. Moreover, we show that goodness-of-ﬁt tests based on the time-rescaling theorem [1] quantify relative-time effects, but do not reliably assess accuracy in spike prediction or stimulus-response modeling. We illustrate the CR model with applications to both real and simulated neural data. 1</p><p>3 0.85316372 <a title="17-lda-3" href="./nips-2009-Manifold_Regularization_for_SIR_with_Rate_Root-n_Convergence.html">146 nips-2009-Manifold Regularization for SIR with Rate Root-n Convergence</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Bian, Dacheng Tao</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the manifold regularization for the Sliced Inverse Regression (SIR). The manifold regularization improves the standard SIR in two aspects: 1) it encodes the local geometry for SIR and 2) it enables SIR to deal with transductive and semi-supervised learning problems. We prove that the proposed graph Laplacian based regularization is convergent at rate root-n. The projection directions of the regularized SIR are optimized by using a conjugate gradient method on the Grassmann manifold. Experimental results support our theory.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.80007809 <a title="17-lda-4" href="./nips-2009-A_Sparse_Non-Parametric_Approach_for_Single_Channel_Separation_of_Known_Sounds.html">17 nips-2009-A Sparse Non-Parametric Approach for Single Channel Separation of Known Sounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Paris Smaragdis, Madhusudana Shashanka, Bhiksha Raj</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present an algorithm for separating mixed sounds from a monophonic recording. Our approach makes use of training data which allows us to learn representations of the types of sounds that compose the mixture. In contrast to popular methods that attempt to extract compact generalizable models for each sound from training data, we employ the training data itself as a representation of the sources in the mixture. We show that mixtures of known sounds can be described as sparse combinations of the training data itself, and in doing so produce signiﬁcantly better separation results as compared to similar systems based on compact statistical models.

<p>Author: Han Liu, Xi Chen</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the forward greedy strategy in sparse nonparametric regression. For additive models, we propose an algorithm called additive forward regression; for general multivariate models, we propose an algorithm called generalized forward regression. Both algorithms simultaneously conduct estimation and variable selection in nonparametric settings for the high dimensional sparse learning problem. Our main emphasis is empirical: on both simulated and real data, these two simple greedy methods can clearly outperform several state-ofthe-art competitors, including LASSO, a nonparametric version of LASSO called the sparse additive model (SpAM) and a recently proposed adaptive parametric forward-backward algorithm called Foba. We also provide some theoretical justiﬁcations of speciﬁc versions of the additive forward regression. 1</p><p>6 0.78459275 <a title="17-lda-6" href="./nips-2009-Bayesian_Nonparametric_Models_on_Decomposable_Graphs.html">40 nips-2009-Bayesian Nonparametric Models on Decomposable Graphs</a></p>

<h1>112 nips-2010-Hashing Hyperplane Queries to Near Points with Applications to Large-Scale Active Learning</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-112-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4088-hashing-hyperplane-queries-to-near-points-with-applications-to-large-scale-active-learning.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Prateek Jain, Sudheendra Vijayanarasimhan, Kristen Grauman</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of retrieving the database points nearest to a given hyperplane query without exhaustively scanning the database. We propose two hashingbased solutions. Our ﬁrst approach maps the data to two-bit binary keys that are locality-sensitive for the angle between the hyperplane normal and a database point. Our second approach embeds the data into a vector space where the Euclidean norm reﬂects the desired distance between the original points and hyperplane query. Both use hashing to retrieve near points in sub-linear time. Our ﬁrst method’s preprocessing stage is more efﬁcient, while the second has stronger accuracy guarantees. We apply both to pool-based active learning: taking the current hyperplane classiﬁer as a query, our algorithm identiﬁes those points (approximately) satisfying the well-known minimal distance-to-hyperplane selection criterion. We empirically demonstrate our methods’ tradeoffs, and show that they make it practical to perform active selection with millions of unlabeled points. 1</p><br/>

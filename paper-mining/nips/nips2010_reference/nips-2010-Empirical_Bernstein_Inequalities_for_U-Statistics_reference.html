<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-74-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4081-empirical-bernstein-inequalities-for-u-statistics.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Thomas Peel, Sandrine Anthoine, Liva Ralaivola</p><p>Abstract: We present original empirical Bernstein inequalities for U-statistics with bounded symmetric kernels q. They are expressed with respect to empirical estimates of either the variance of q or the conditional variance that appears in the Bernsteintype inequality for U-statistics derived by Arcones [2]. Our result subsumes other existing empirical Bernstein inequalities, as it reduces to them when U-statistics of order 1 are considered. In addition, it is based on a rather direct argument using two applications of the same (non-empirical) Bernstein inequality for U-statistics. We discuss potential applications of our new inequalities, especially in the realm of learning ranking/scoring functions. In the process, we exhibit an efﬁcient procedure to compute the variance estimates for the special case of bipartite ranking that rests on a sorting argument. We also argue that our results may provide test set bounds and particularly interesting empirical racing algorithms for the problem of online learning of scoring functions. 1</p><br/>

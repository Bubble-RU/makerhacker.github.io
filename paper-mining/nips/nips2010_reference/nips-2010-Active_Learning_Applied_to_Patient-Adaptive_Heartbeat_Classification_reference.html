<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-24-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4091-active-learning-applied-to-patient-adaptive-heartbeat-classification.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Jenna Wiens, John V. Guttag</p><p>Abstract: While clinicians can accurately identify different types of heartbeats in electrocardiograms (ECGs) from different patients, researchers have had limited success in applying supervised machine learning to the same task. The problem is made challenging by the variety of tasks, inter- and intra-patient differences, an often severe class imbalance, and the high cost of getting cardiologists to label data for individual patients. We address these difﬁculties using active learning to perform patient-adaptive and task-adaptive heartbeat classiﬁcation. When tested on a benchmark database of cardiologist annotated ECG recordings, our method had considerably better performance than other recently proposed methods on the two primary classiﬁcation tasks recommended by the Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation. Additionally, our method required over 90% less patient-speciﬁc training data than the methods to which we compared it. 1</p><br/>

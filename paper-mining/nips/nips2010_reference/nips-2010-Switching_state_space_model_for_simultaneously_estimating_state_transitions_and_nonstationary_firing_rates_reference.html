This algorithm enables us to detect state transitions on the basis of not only the discontinuous changes of mean ﬁring rates but also discontinuous changes in temporal proﬁles of ﬁring rates, e.g., temporal correlation. We construct a variational Bayes algorithm for a non-Gaussian SSSM whose non-Gaussian property is caused by binary spike events. Synthetic data analysis reveals that our algorithm has the high performance for estimating state transitions, the number of neural states, and nonstationary ﬁring rates compared to previous methods. We also analyze neural data that were recorded from the medial temporal area. The statistically detected neural states probably coincide with transient and sustained states that have been detected heuristically. Estimated parameters suggest that our algorithm detects the state transition on the basis of discontinuous changes in the temporal correlation of ﬁring rates, which transitions previous methods cannot detect. This result suggests that our algorithm is advantageous in real-data analysis. 021 022 023 024 025 026 027 028 029 030 031 032 033 034 035 036 037 038 039 040 041 042 043 044 045 046 047 048 049 050 051 052 053</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-220-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4039-random-projection-trees-revisited.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Aman Dhesi, Purushottam Kar</p><p>Abstract: The Random Projection Tree (RPT REE) structures proposed in [1] are space partitioning data structures that automatically adapt to various notions of intrinsic dimensionality of data. We prove new results for both the RPT REE -M AX and the RPT REE -M EAN data structures. Our result for RPT REE -M AX gives a nearoptimal bound on the number of levels required by this data structure to reduce the size of its cells by a factor s ≥ 2. We also prove a packing lemma for this data structure. Our ﬁnal result shows that low-dimensional manifolds have bounded Local Covariance Dimension. As a consequence we show that RPT REE -M EAN adapts to manifold dimension as well.</p><br/>

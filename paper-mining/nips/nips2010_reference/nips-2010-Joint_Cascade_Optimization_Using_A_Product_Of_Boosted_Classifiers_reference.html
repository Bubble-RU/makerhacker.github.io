<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-132-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4148-joint-cascade-optimization-using-a-product-of-boosted-classifiers.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Leonidas Lefakis, Francois Fleuret</p><p>Abstract: The standard strategy for efﬁcient object detection consists of building a cascade composed of several binary classiﬁers. The detection process takes the form of a lazy evaluation of the conjunction of the responses of these classiﬁers, and concentrates the computation on difﬁcult parts of the image which cannot be trivially rejected. We introduce a novel algorithm to construct jointly the classiﬁers of such a cascade, which interprets the response of a classiﬁer as the probability of a positive prediction, and the overall response of the cascade as the probability that all the predictions are positive. From this noisy-AND model, we derive a consistent loss and a Boosting procedure to optimize that global probability on the training set. Such a joint learning allows the individual predictors to focus on a more restricted modeling problem, and improves the performance compared to a standard cascade. We demonstrate the efﬁciency of this approach on face and pedestrian detection with standard data-sets and comparisons with reference baselines. 1</p><br/>

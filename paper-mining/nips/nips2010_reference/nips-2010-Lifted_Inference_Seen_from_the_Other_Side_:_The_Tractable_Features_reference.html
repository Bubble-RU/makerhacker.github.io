<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2010-159-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4067-lifted-inference-seen-from-the-other-side-the-tractable-features.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Abhay Jha, Vibhav Gogate, Alexandra Meliou, Dan Suciu</p><p>Abstract: Lifted Inference algorithms for representations that combine ﬁrst-order logic and graphical models have been the focus of much recent research. All lifted algorithms developed to date are based on the same underlying idea: take a standard probabilistic inference algorithm (e.g., variable elimination, belief propagation etc.) and improve its efﬁciency by exploiting repeated structure in the ﬁrst-order model. In this paper, we propose an approach from the other side in that we use techniques from logic for probabilistic inference. In particular, we deﬁne a set of rules that look only at the logical representation to identify models for which exact efﬁcient inference is possible. Our rules yield new tractable classes that could not be solved efﬁciently by any of the existing techniques. 1</p><br/>

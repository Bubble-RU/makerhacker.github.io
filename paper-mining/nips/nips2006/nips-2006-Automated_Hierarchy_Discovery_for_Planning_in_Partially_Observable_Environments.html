The policy is chosen based on its empirical performance in simulations.

We show that under bounds on the amount of computation involved in computing policies, transition dynamics and rewards, uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true value functions occurs.

<p>Author: Mohammad Ghavamzadeh, Yaakov Engel</p><p>Abstract: Policy gradient methods are reinforcement learning algorithms that adapt a parameterized policy by following a performance gradient estimate. Conventional policy gradient methods use Monte-Carlo techniques to estimate this gradient. Since Monte Carlo methods tend to have high variance, a large number of samples is required, resulting in slow convergence. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian framework that models the policy gradient as a Gaussian process. This reduces the number of samples needed to obtain accurate gradient estimates. Moreover, estimates of the natural gradient as well as a measure of the uncertainty in the gradient estimates are provided at little extra cost. 1</p><p>5 0.24314149 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Logarithmic_Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Reinforcement_Learning.html">125 nips-2006-Logarithmic Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Auer, Ronald Ortner</p><p>Abstract: We present a learning algorithm for undiscounted reinforcement learning. Our interest lies in bounds for the algorithm’s online performance after some ﬁnite number of steps. In the spirit of similar methods already successfully applied for the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in multi-armed bandit problems, we use upper conﬁdence bounds to show that our UCRL algorithm achieves logarithmic online regret in the number of steps taken with respect to an optimal policy. 1 1.1</p><p>6 0.23426145 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Natural_Actor-Critic_for_Road_Traffic_Optimisation.html">143 nips-2006-Natural Actor-Critic for Road Traffic Optimisation</a></p>

<p>Author: Silvia Richter, Douglas Aberdeen, Jin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Current road-trafﬁc optimisation practice around the world is a combination of hand tuned policies with a small degree of automatic adaption. Even state-ofthe-art research controllers need good models of the road trafﬁc, which cannot be obtained directly from existing sensors. We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the trafﬁc signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the trafﬁc system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison. Along the way we extend natural-actor critic approaches to work for distributed and online inﬁnite-horizon problems. 1</p><p>3 0.69122303 <a title="38-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Policy_Gradient_Algorithms.html">44 nips-2006-Bayesian Policy Gradient Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Michael Kearns</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a game-theoretic model for network formation inspired by earlier stochastic models that mix localized and long-distance connectivity. In this model, players may purchase edges at distance d at a cost of dα , and wish to minimize the sum of their edge purchases and their average distance to other players. In this model, we show there is a striking “small world” threshold phenomenon: in two dimensions, if α < 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network of constant diameter (independent of network size), and if α > 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network whose diameter grows as a root of the network size, and thus is unbounded. We contrast our results with those of Kleinberg [8] in a stochastic model, and empirically investigate the “navigability” of equilibrium networks. Our theoretical results all generalize to higher dimensions. 1</p><p>4 0.58582842 <a title="38-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Human_Motion_Using_Binary_Latent_Variables.html">134 nips-2006-Modeling Human Motion Using Binary Latent Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model ﬁnds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during motion capture.

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>6 0.57946324 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Correcting_Sample_Selection_Bias_by_Unlabeled_Data.html">62 nips-2006-Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data</a></p>

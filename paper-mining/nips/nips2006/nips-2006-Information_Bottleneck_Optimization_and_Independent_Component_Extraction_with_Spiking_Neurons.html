<p>Author: Thomas Voegtlin</p><p>Abstract: In biological neurons, the timing of a spike depends on the timing of synaptic currents, in a way that is classically described by the Phase Response Curve. This has implications for temporal coding: an action potential that arrives on a synapse has an implicit meaning, that depends on the position of the postsynaptic neuron on the ﬁring cycle. Here we show that this implicit code can be used to perform computations. Using theta neurons, we derive a spike-timing dependent learning rule from an error criterion. We demonstrate how to train an auto-encoder neural network using this rule. 1</p><p>3 0.45664266 <a title="99-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Attentional_Processing_on_a_Spike-Based_VLSI_Neural_Network.html">36 nips-2006-Attentional Processing on a Spike-Based VLSI Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingxue Wang, Rodney J. Douglas, Shih-Chii Liu</p><p>Abstract: The neurons of the neocortex communicate by asynchronous events called action potentials (or ’spikes’). However, for simplicity of simulation, most models of processing by cortical neural networks have assumed that the activations of their neurons can be approximated by event rates rather than taking account of individual spikes. The obstacle to exploring the more detailed spike processing of these networks has been reduced considerably in recent years by the development of hybrid analog-digital Very-Large Scale Integrated (hVLSI) neural networks composed of spiking neurons that are able to operate in real-time. In this paper we describe such a hVLSI neural network that performs an interesting task of selective attentional processing that was previously described for a simulated ’pointer-map’ rate model by Hahnloser and colleagues. We found that most of the computational features of their rate model can be reproduced in the spiking implementation; but, that spike-based processing requires a modiﬁcation of the original network architecture in order to memorize a previously attended target. 1</p><p>4 0.40513527 <a title="99-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Context_dependent_amplification_of_both_rate_and_event-correlation_in_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">59 nips-2006-Context dependent amplification of both rate and event-correlation in a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: Cooperative competitive networks are believed to play a central role in cortical processing and have been shown to exhibit a wide set of useful computational properties. We propose a VLSI implementation of a spiking cooperative competitive network and show how it can perform context dependent computation both in the mean ﬁring rate domain and in spike timing correlation space. In the mean rate case the network ampliﬁes the activity of neurons belonging to the selected stimulus and suppresses the activity of neurons receiving weaker stimuli. In the event correlation case, the recurrent network ampliﬁes with a higher gain the correlation between neurons which receive highly correlated inputs while leaving the mean ﬁring rate unaltered. We describe the network architecture and present experimental data demonstrating its context dependent computation capabilities. 1</p><p>5 0.38582993 <a title="99-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Predicting_spike_times_from_subthreshold_dynamics_of_a_neuron.html">162 nips-2006-Predicting spike times from subthreshold dynamics of a neuron</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Kobayashi, Shigeru Shinomoto</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that a neuron reproduces highly precise spike response to identical ﬂuctuating input currents. We wish to accurately predict the ﬁring times of a given neuron for any input current. For this purpose we adopt a model that mimics the dynamics of the membrane potential, and then take a cue from its dynamics for predicting the spike occurrence for a novel input current. It is found that the prediction is signiﬁcantly improved by observing the state space of the membrane potential and its time derivative(s) in advance of a possible spike, in comparison to simply thresholding an instantaneous value of the estimated potential. 1</p><p>6 0.38229594 <a title="99-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Uncertainty%2C_phase_and_oscillatory_hippocampal_recall.html">197 nips-2006-Uncertainty, phase and oscillatory hippocampal recall</a></p>

<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, population behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the ﬁring phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only ﬁre once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each neuron represents by its ﬁring phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it ﬁres. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system. 1</p><p>4 0.87599117 <a title="99-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Predicting_spike_times_from_subthreshold_dynamics_of_a_neuron.html">162 nips-2006-Predicting spike times from subthreshold dynamics of a neuron</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhi-hua Zhou, Min-ling Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formalize multi-instance multi-label learning, where each training example is associated with not only multiple instances but also multiple class labels. Such a problem can occur in many real-world tasks, e.g. an image usually contains multiple patches each of which can be described by a feature vector, and the image can belong to multiple categories since its semantics can be recognized in different ways. We analyze the relationship between multi-instance multi-label learning and the learning frameworks of traditional supervised learning, multiinstance learning and multi-label learning. Then, we propose the M IML B OOST and M IML S VM algorithms which achieve good performance in an application to scene classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.7775405 <a title="99-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Temporal_Coding_using_the_Response_Properties_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">187 nips-2006-Temporal Coding using the Response Properties of Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Robert Jenssen, Torbjørn Eltoft, Mark Girolami, Deniz Erdogmus</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new kernel-based data transformation technique. It is founded on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) preservation, hence named kernel MaxEnt. The key measure is Renyi’s entropy estimated via Parzen windowing. We show that kernel MaxEnt is based on eigenvectors, and is in that sense similar to kernel PCA, but may produce strikingly different transformed data sets. An enhanced spectral clustering algorithm is proposed, by replacing kernel PCA by kernel MaxEnt as an intermediate step. This has a major impact on performance.</p><p>5 0.77434051 <a title="99-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Handling_Advertisements_of_Unknown_Quality_in_Search_Advertising.html">89 nips-2006-Handling Advertisements of Unknown Quality in Search Advertising</a></p>
<p>Author: Sandeep Pandey, Christopher Olston</p><p>Abstract: We consider how a search engine should select advertisements to display with search results, in order to maximize its revenue. Under the standard “pay-per-click” arrangement, revenue depends on how well the displayed advertisements appeal to users. The main diﬃculty stems from new advertisements whose degree of appeal has yet to be determined. Often the only reliable way of determining appeal is exploration via display to users, which detracts from exploitation of other advertisements known to have high appeal. Budget constraints and ﬁnite advertisement lifetimes make it necessary to explore as well as exploit. In this paper we study the tradeoﬀ between exploration and exploitation, modeling advertisement placement as a multi-armed bandit problem. We extend traditional bandit formulations to account for budget constraints that occur in search engine advertising markets, and derive theoretical bounds on the performance of a family of algorithms. We measure empirical performance via extensive experiments over real-world data. 1</p><p>6 0.77266645 <a title="99-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Parameter_Expanded_Variational_Bayesian_Methods.html">159 nips-2006-Parameter Expanded Variational Bayesian Methods</a></p>

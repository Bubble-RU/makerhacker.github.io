<p>Author: Jason V. Davis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian data is pervasive and many learning algorithms (e.g., k-means) model their inputs as a single sample drawn from a multivariate Gaussian. However, in many real-life settings, each input object is best described by multiple samples drawn from a multivariate Gaussian. Such data can arise, for example, in a movie review database where each movie is rated by several users, or in time-series domains such as sensor networks. Here, each input can be naturally described by both a mean vector and covariance matrix which parameterize the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering such input objects, each represented as a multivariate Gaussian. We formulate the problem using an information theoretic approach and draw several interesting theoretical connections to Bregman divergences and also Bregman matrix divergences. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic data, sensor network data, and a statistical debugging application. 1</p><p>3 0.10214886 <a title="129-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_to_Rank_with_Nonsmooth_Cost_Functions.html">119 nips-2006-Learning to Rank with Nonsmooth Cost Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher J. Burges, Robert Ragno, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: The quality measures used in information retrieval are particularly difﬁcult to optimize directly, since they depend on the model scores only through the sorted order of the documents returned for a given query. Thus, the derivatives of the cost with respect to the model parameters are either zero, or are undeﬁned. In this paper, we propose a class of simple, ﬂexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difﬁculties by working with implicit cost functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the resulting implicit cost function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate signiﬁcantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for signiﬁcantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions. 1</p><p>4 0.092521496 <a title="129-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_Under_Prior_Knowledge_with_Application_to_Image_Segmentation.html">51 nips-2006-Clustering Under Prior Knowledge with Application to Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>5 0.091106087 <a title="129-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-A_selective_attention_multi--chip_system_with_dynamic_synapses_and_spiking_neurons.html">18 nips-2006-A selective attention multi--chip system with dynamic synapses and spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Chiara Bartolozzi, Giacomo Indiveri</p><p>Abstract: Selective attention is the strategy used by biological sensory systems to solve the problem of limited parallel processing capacity: salient subregions of the input stimuli are serially processed, while non–salient regions are suppressed. We present an mixed mode analog/digital Very Large Scale Integration implementation of a building block for a multi–chip neuromorphic hardware model of selective attention. We describe the chip’s architecture and its behavior, when its is part of a multi–chip system with a spiking retina as input, and show how it can be used to implement in real-time ﬂexible models of bottom-up attention. 1</p><p>6 0.08575505 <a title="129-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Support_Vector_Machines_on_a_Budget.html">186 nips-2006-Support Vector Machines on a Budget</a></p>

<p>Author: Amit Gore, Shantanu Chakrabartty</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge in designing analog-to-digital converters for cortically implanted prosthesis is to sense and process high-dimensional neural signals recorded by the micro-electrode arrays. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion that combines Σ∆ conversion with spatial de-correlation within a single module. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Σ∆ is based on a min-max gradient descent optimization of a regularized linear cost function that naturally lends to an A/D formulation. Using an online formulation, the architecture can adapt to slow variations in cross-channel correlations, observed due to relative motion of the microelectrodes with respect to the signal sources. Experimental results with real recorded multi-channel neural data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in alleviating cross-channel redundancy across electrodes and performing data-compression directly at the A/D converter. 1</p><p>4 0.5624845 <a title="129-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Support_Vector_Machines_on_a_Budget.html">186 nips-2006-Support Vector Machines on a Budget</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: The standard Support Vector Machine formulation does not provide its user with the ability to explicitly control the number of support vectors used to deﬁne the generated classiﬁer. We present a modiﬁed version of SVM that allows the user to set a budget parameter B and focuses on minimizing the loss attained by the B worst-classiﬁed examples while ignoring the remaining examples. This idea can be used to derive sparse versions of both L1-SVM and L2-SVM. Technically, we obtain these new SVM variants by replacing the 1-norm in the standard SVM formulation with various interpolation-norms. We also adapt the SMO optimization algorithm to our setting and report on some preliminary experimental results. 1</p><p>5 0.54606789 <a title="129-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Ordinal_Regression_by_Extended_Binary_Classification.html">156 nips-2006-Ordinal Regression by Extended Binary Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Li, Hsuan-tien Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a reduction framework from ordinal regression to binary classiﬁcation based on extended examples. The framework consists of three steps: extracting extended examples from the original examples, learning a binary classiﬁer on the extended examples with any binary classiﬁcation algorithm, and constructing a ranking rule from the binary classiﬁer. A weighted 0/1 loss of the binary classiﬁer would then bound the mislabeling cost of the ranking rule. Our framework allows not only to design good ordinal regression algorithms based on well-tuned binary classiﬁcation approaches, but also to derive new generalization bounds for ordinal regression from known bounds for binary classiﬁcation. In addition, our framework uniﬁes many existing ordinal regression algorithms, such as perceptron ranking and support vector ordinal regression. When compared empirically on benchmark data sets, some of our newly designed algorithms enjoy advantages in terms of both training speed and generalization performance over existing algorithms, which demonstrates the usefulness of our framework. 1</p><p>6 0.49590862 <a title="129-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-An_Application_of_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Aerobatic_Helicopter_Flight.html">25 nips-2006-An Application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight</a></p>

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many modern large-scale learning applications, the amount of unlabeled data far exceeds that of labeled data. A common instance of this problem is the transductive setting where the unlabeled test points are known to the learning algorithm. This paper presents a study of regression problems in that setting. It presents explicit VC-dimension error bounds for transductive regression that hold for all bounded loss functions and coincide with the tight classiﬁcation bounds of Vapnik when applied to classiﬁcation. It also presents a new transductive regression algorithm inspired by our bound that admits a primal and kernelized closedform solution and deals efﬁciently with large amounts of unlabeled data. The algorithm exploits the position of unlabeled points to locally estimate their labels and then uses a global optimization to ensure robust predictions. Our study also includes the results of experiments with several publicly available regression data sets with up to 20,000 unlabeled examples. The comparison with other transductive regression algorithms shows that it performs well and that it can scale to large data sets.</p><p>3 0.54804868 <a title="129-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>4 0.54717875 <a title="129-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Active_learning_for_misspecified_generalized_linear_models.html">20 nips-2006-Active learning for misspecified generalized linear models</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Active learning refers to algorithmic frameworks aimed at selecting training data points in order to reduce the number of required training data points and/or improve the generalization performance of a learning method. In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis of active learning for generalized linear models. Our analysis holds under the common practical situation of model misspeciﬁcation, and is based on realistic assumptions regarding the nature of the sampling distributions, which are usually neither independent nor identical. We derive unbiased estimators of generalization performance, as well as estimators of expected reduction in generalization error after adding a new training data point, that allow us to optimize its sampling distribution through a convex optimization problem. Our analysis naturally leads to an algorithm for sequential active learning which is applicable for all tasks supported by generalized linear models (e.g., binary classiﬁcation, multi-class classiﬁcation, regression) and can be applied in non-linear settings through the use of Mercer kernels. 1</p><p>5 0.5447014 <a title="129-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-A_Complexity-Distortion_Approach_to_Joint_Pattern_Alignment.html">3 nips-2006-A Complexity-Distortion Approach to Joint Pattern Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off ﬁdelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational beneﬁts of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.54351646 <a title="129-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-A_Theory_of_Retinal_Population_Coding.html">16 nips-2006-A Theory of Retinal Population Coding</a></p>

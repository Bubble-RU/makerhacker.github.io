<p>Author: Tommi S. Jaakkola, Yuan Qi</p><p>Abstract: Bayesian inference has become increasingly important in statistical machine learning. Exact Bayesian calculations are often not feasible in practice, however. A number of approximate Bayesian methods have been proposed to make such calculations practical, among them the variational Bayesian (VB) approach. The VB approach, while useful, can nevertheless suffer from slow convergence to the approximate solution. To address this problem, we propose Parameter-eXpanded Variational Bayesian (PX-VB) methods to speed up VB. The new algorithm is inspired by parameter-expanded expectation maximization (PX-EM) and parameterexpanded data augmentation (PX-DA). Similar to PX-EM and -DA, PX-VB expands a model with auxiliary variables to reduce the coupling between variables in the original model. We analyze the convergence rates of VB and PX-VB and demonstrate the superior convergence rates of PX-VB in variational probit regression and automatic relevance determination. 1</p><p>4 0.10638501 <a title="19-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Random_Effects.html">91 nips-2006-Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes with Random Effects</a></p>
<p>Author: Seyoung Kim, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Data sets involving multiple groups with shared characteristics frequently arise in practice. In this paper we extend hierarchical Dirichlet processes to model such data. Each group is assumed to be generated from a template mixture model with group level variability in both the mixing proportions and the component parameters. Variabilities in mixing proportions across groups are handled using hierarchical Dirichlet processes, also allowing for automatic determination of the number of components. In addition, each group is allowed to have its own component parameters coming from a prior described by a template mixture model. This group-level variability in the component parameters is handled using a random effects model. We present a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling algorithm to estimate model parameters and demonstrate the method by applying it to the problem of modeling spatial brain activation patterns across multiple images collected via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). 1</p><p>5 0.087787494 <a title="19-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Stability_of_%24K%24-Means_Clustering.html">181 nips-2006-Stability of $K$-Means Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Andrea Caponnetto</p><p>Abstract: We phrase K-means clustering as an empirical risk minimization procedure over a class HK and explicitly calculate the covering number for this class. Next, we show that stability of K-means clustering is characterized by the geometry of HK with respect to the underlying distribution. We prove that in the case of a unique global minimizer, the clustering solution is stable with respect to complete changes of the data, while for the case of multiple minimizers, the change of Ω(n1/2 ) samples deﬁnes the transition between stability and instability. While for a ﬁnite number of minimizers this result follows from multinomial distribution estimates, the case of inﬁnite minimizers requires more reﬁned tools. We conclude by proving that stability of the functions in HK implies stability of the actual centers of the clusters. Since stability is often used for selecting the number of clusters in practice, we hope that our analysis serves as a starting point for ﬁnding theoretically grounded recipes for the choice of K. 1</p><p>6 0.081921823 <a title="19-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Map-Reduce_for_Machine_Learning_on_Multicore.html">129 nips-2006-Map-Reduce for Machine Learning on Multicore</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer interaction, video surveillance, and Web data analysis. We propose a non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven fashion what “factors” are generating the observations on a particular day, including (for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-speciﬁc effects corresponding to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category. Applications to real–world data sets of count data involving both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique. 1</p><p>5 0.4281905 <a title="19-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Parameter_Expanded_Variational_Bayesian_Methods.html">159 nips-2006-Parameter Expanded Variational Bayesian Methods</a></p>

<p>Author: Oliver Williams</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a Gaussian process framework for inferring pixel-wise disparity and bi-layer segmentation of a scene given a stereo pair of images. The Gaussian process covariance is parameterized by a foreground-backgroundocclusion segmentation label to model both smooth regions and discontinuities. As such, we call our model a switched Gaussian process. We propose a greedy incremental algorithm for adding observations from the data and assigning segmentation labels. Two observation schedules are proposed: the ﬁrst treats scanlines as independent, the second uses an active learning criterion to select a sparse subset of points to measure. We show that this probabilistic framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>3 0.54710859 <a title="19-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Complexity-Distortion_Approach_to_Joint_Pattern_Alignment.html">3 nips-2006-A Complexity-Distortion Approach to Joint Pattern Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off ﬁdelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational beneﬁts of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated. 1</p><p>4 0.54674566 <a title="19-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Distributed_Inference_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">69 nips-2006-Distributed Inference in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>5 0.54583013 <a title="19-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Active_learning_for_misspecified_generalized_linear_models.html">20 nips-2006-Active learning for misspecified generalized linear models</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach</p><p>Abstract: Active learning refers to algorithmic frameworks aimed at selecting training data points in order to reduce the number of required training data points and/or improve the generalization performance of a learning method. In this paper, we present an asymptotic analysis of active learning for generalized linear models. Our analysis holds under the common practical situation of model misspeciﬁcation, and is based on realistic assumptions regarding the nature of the sampling distributions, which are usually neither independent nor identical. We derive unbiased estimators of generalization performance, as well as estimators of expected reduction in generalization error after adding a new training data point, that allow us to optimize its sampling distribution through a convex optimization problem. Our analysis naturally leads to an algorithm for sequential active learning which is applicable for all tasks supported by generalized linear models (e.g., binary classiﬁcation, multi-class classiﬁcation, regression) and can be applied in non-linear settings through the use of Mercer kernels. 1</p><p>6 0.54567951 <a title="19-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Learning_from_Multiple_Sources.html">116 nips-2006-Learning from Multiple Sources</a></p>

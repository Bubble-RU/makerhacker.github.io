<p>Author: Gregory Shakhnarovich, Sung-phil Kim, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Neural motor prostheses (NMPs) require the accurate decoding of motor cortical population activity for the control of an artiﬁcial motor system. Previous work on cortical decoding for NMPs has focused on the recovery of hand kinematics. Human NMPs however may require the control of computer cursors or robotic devices with very different physical and dynamical properties. Here we show that the ﬁring rates of cells in the primary motor cortex of non-human primates can be used to control the parameters of an artiﬁcial physical system exhibiting realistic dynamics. The model represents 2D hand motion in terms of a point mass connected to a system of idealized springs. The nonlinear spring coefﬁcients are estimated from the ﬁring rates of neurons in the motor cortex. We evaluate linear and a nonlinear decoding algorithms using neural recordings from two monkeys performing two different tasks. We found that the decoded spring coefﬁcients produced accurate hand trajectories compared with state-of-the-art methods for direct decoding of hand kinematics. Furthermore, using a physically-based system produced decoded movements that were more “natural” in that their frequency spectrum more closely matched that of natural hand movements. 1</p><p>3 0.070231661 <a title="107-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Recursive_ICA.html">167 nips-2006-Recursive ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghao Shan, Lingyun Zhang, Garrison W. Cottrell</p><p>Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular method for extracting independent features from visual data. However, as a fundamentally linear technique, there is always nonlinear residual redundancy that is not captured by ICA. Hence there have been many attempts to try to create a hierarchical version of ICA, but so far none of the approaches have a natural way to apply them more than once. Here we show that there is a relatively simple technique that transforms the absolute values of the outputs of a previous application of ICA into a normal distribution, to which ICA maybe applied again. This results in a recursive ICA algorithm that may be applied any number of times in order to extract higher order structure from previous layers. 1</p><p>4 0.057801217 <a title="107-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>5 0.056023333 <a title="107-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Context_dependent_amplification_of_both_rate_and_event-correlation_in_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">59 nips-2006-Context dependent amplification of both rate and event-correlation in a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: Cooperative competitive networks are believed to play a central role in cortical processing and have been shown to exhibit a wide set of useful computational properties. We propose a VLSI implementation of a spiking cooperative competitive network and show how it can perform context dependent computation both in the mean ﬁring rate domain and in spike timing correlation space. In the mean rate case the network ampliﬁes the activity of neurons belonging to the selected stimulus and suppresses the activity of neurons receiving weaker stimuli. In the event correlation case, the recurrent network ampliﬁes with a higher gain the correlation between neurons which receive highly correlated inputs while leaving the mean ﬁring rate unaltered. We describe the network architecture and present experimental data demonstrating its context dependent computation capabilities. 1</p><p>6 0.051313896 <a title="107-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Attentional_Processing_on_a_Spike-Based_VLSI_Neural_Network.html">36 nips-2006-Attentional Processing on a Spike-Based VLSI Neural Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Alexis Battle, Rajat Raina, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for ﬁnding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, ﬁnding sparse codes remains a very difﬁcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efﬁcient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1 -regularized least squares problem and an L2 -constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a signiﬁcant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive ﬁeld surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1</p><p>5 0.51314777 <a title="107-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-An_Application_of_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Aerobatic_Helicopter_Flight.html">25 nips-2006-An Application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight</a></p>
<p>Author: Pieter Abbeel, Adam Coates, Morgan Quigley, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Autonomous helicopter ﬂight is widely regarded to be a highly challenging control problem. This paper presents the ﬁrst successful autonomous completion on a real RC helicopter of the following four aerobatic maneuvers: forward ﬂip and sideways roll at low speed, tail-in funnel, and nose-in funnel. Our experimental results signiﬁcantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter ﬂight. We used the following approach: First we had a pilot ﬂy the helicopter to help us ﬁnd a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function. Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to ﬁnd a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function. More speciﬁcally, we used differential dynamic programming (DDP), an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). 1</p><p>6 0.50911844 <a title="107-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Multiple_timescales_and_uncertainty_in_motor_adaptation.html">141 nips-2006-Multiple timescales and uncertainty in motor adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Moritz Grosse-wentrup, Klaus Gramann, Martin Buss</p><p>Abstract: The performance of EEG-based Brain-Computer-Interfaces (BCIs) critically depends on the extraction of features from the EEG carrying information relevant for the classiﬁcation of different mental states. For BCIs employing imaginary movements of different limbs, the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) has been shown to achieve excellent classiﬁcation results. The CSP-algorithm however suffers from a lack of robustness, requiring training data without artifacts for good performance. To overcome this lack of robustness, we propose an adaptive spatial ﬁlter that replaces the training data in the CSP approach by a-priori information. More speciﬁcally, we design an adaptive spatial ﬁlter that maximizes the ratio of the variance of the electric ﬁeld originating in a predeﬁned region of interest (ROI) and the overall variance of the measured EEG. Since it is known that the component of the EEG used for discriminating imaginary movements originates in the motor cortex, we design two adaptive spatial ﬁlters with the ROIs centered in the hand areas of the left and right motor cortex.

In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion that combines Σ∆ conversion with spatial de-correlation within a single module. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Σ∆ is based on a min-max gradient descent optimization of a regularized linear cost function that naturally lends to an A/D formulation. Using an online formulation, the architecture can adapt to slow variations in cross-channel correlations, observed due to relative motion of the microelectrodes with respect to the signal sources. Experimental results with real recorded multi-channel neural data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in alleviating cross-channel redundancy across electrodes and performing data-compression directly at the A/D converter. 1</p><p>3 0.8224225 <a title="107-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-A_recipe_for_optimizing_a_time-histogram.html">17 nips-2006-A recipe for optimizing a time-histogram</a></p>
<p>Author: Hideaki Shimazaki, Shigeru Shinomoto</p><p>Abstract: The time-histogram method is a handy tool for capturing the instantaneous rate of spike occurrence. In most of the neurophysiological literature, the bin size that critically determines the goodness of the ﬁt of the time-histogram to the underlying rate has been selected by individual researchers in an unsystematic manner. We propose an objective method for selecting the bin size of a time-histogram from the spike data, so that the time-histogram best approximates the unknown underlying rate. The resolution of the histogram increases, or the optimal bin size decreases, with the number of spike sequences sampled. It is notable that the optimal bin size diverges if only a small number of experimental trials are available from a moderately ﬂuctuating rate process. In this case, any attempt to characterize the underlying spike rate will lead to spurious results. Given a paucity of data, our method can also suggest how many more trials are needed until the set of data can be analyzed with the required resolution. 1</p><p>4 0.78342003 <a title="107-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Structural_Equation_Models_for_fMRI.html">113 nips-2006-Learning Structural Equation Models for fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrico Simonotto, Heather Whalley, Stephen Lawrie, Lawrence Murray, David Mcgonigle, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Structural equation models can be seen as an extension of Gaussian belief networks to cyclic graphs, and we show they can be understood generatively as the model for the joint distribution of long term average equilibrium activity of Gaussian dynamic belief networks. Most use of structural equation models in fMRI involves postulating a particular structure and comparing learnt parameters across different groups. In this paper it is argued that there are situations where priors about structure are not ﬁrm or exhaustive, and given sufﬁcient data, it is worth investigating learning network structure as part of the approach to connectivity analysis. First we demonstrate structure learning on a toy problem. We then show that for particular fMRI data the simple models usually assumed are not supported. We show that is is possible to learn sensible structural equation models that can provide modelling beneﬁts, but that are not necessarily going to be the same as a true causal model, and suggest the combination of prior models and learning or the use of temporal information from dynamic models may provide more beneﬁts than learning structural equations alone. 1</p><p>5 0.75438809 <a title="107-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Statistical_Modeling_of_Images_with_Fields_of_Gaussian_Scale_Mixtures.html">182 nips-2006-Statistical Modeling of Images with Fields of Gaussian Scale Mixtures</a></p>
<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: The local statistical properties of photographic images, when represented in a multi-scale basis, have been described using Gaussian scale mixtures (GSMs). Here, we use this local description to construct a global ﬁeld of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM). Speciﬁcally, we model subbands of wavelet coeﬃcients as a product of an exponentiated homogeneous Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (hGMRF) and a second independent hGMRF. We show that parameter estimation for FoGSM is feasible, and that samples drawn from an estimated FoGSM model have marginal and joint statistics similar to wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. We develop an algorithm for image denoising based on the FoGSM model, and demonstrate substantial improvements over current state-ofthe-art denoising method based on the local GSM model. Many successful methods in image processing and computer vision rely on statistical models for images, and it is thus of continuing interest to develop improved models, both in terms of their ability to precisely capture image structures, and in terms of their tractability when used in applications. Constructing such a model is diﬃcult, primarily because of the intrinsic high dimensionality of the space of images. Two simplifying assumptions are usually made to reduce model complexity. The ﬁrst is Markovianity: the density of a pixel conditioned on a small neighborhood, is assumed to be independent from the rest of the image. The second assumption is homogeneity: the local density is assumed to be independent of its absolute position within the image. The set of models satisfying both of these assumptions constitute the class of homogeneous Markov random ﬁelds (hMRFs). Over the past two decades, studies of photographic images represented with multi-scale multiorientation image decompositions (loosely referred to as “wavelets”) have revealed striking nonGaussian regularities and inter and intra-subband dependencies. For instance, wavelet coeﬃcients generally have highly kurtotic marginal distributions [1, 2], and their amplitudes exhibit strong correlations with the amplitudes of nearby coeﬃcients [3, 4]. One model that can capture the nonGaussian marginal behaviors is a product of non-Gaussian scalar variables [5]. A number of authors have developed non-Gaussian MRF models based on this sort of local description [6, 7, 8], among which the recently developed ﬁelds of experts model [7] has demonstrated impressive performance in denoising (albeit at an extremely high computational cost in learning model parameters). An alternative model that can capture non-Gaussian local structure is a scale mixture model [9, 10, 11]. An important special case is Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM), which consists of a Gaussian random vector whose amplitude is modulated by a hidden scaling variable. The GSM model provides a particularly good description of local image statistics, and the Gaussian substructure of the model leads to eﬃcient algorithms for parameter estimation and inference. Local GSM-based methods represent the current state-of-the-art in image denoising [12]. The power of GSM models should be substantially improved when extended to describe more than a small neighborhood of wavelet coeﬃcients. To this end, several authors have embedded local Gaussian mixtures into tree-structured MRF models [e.g., 13, 14]. In order to maintain tractability, these models are arranged such that coeﬃcients are grouped in non-overlapping clusters, allowing a graphical probability model with no loops. Despite their global consistency, the artiﬁcially imposed cluster boundaries lead to substantial artifacts in applications such as denoising. In this paper, we use a local GSM as a basis for a globally consistent and spatially homogeneous ﬁeld of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM). Speciﬁcally, the FoGSM is formulated as the product of two mutually independent MRFs: a positive multiplier ﬁeld obtained by exponentiating a homogeneous Gaussian MRF (hGMRF), and a second hGMRF. We develop a parameter estimation procedure, and show that the model is able to capture important statistical regularities in the marginal and joint wavelet statistics of a photographic image. We apply the FoGSM to image denoising, demonstrating substantial improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results obtained with a local GSM model. 1 Gaussian scale mixtures A GSM random vector x is formed as the product of a zero-mean Gaussian random vector u and an d √ d independent random variable z, as x = zu, where = denotes equality in distribution. The density of x is determined by the covariance of the Gaussian vector, Σ, and the density of the multiplier, p z (z), through the integral Nx (0, zΣ)pz (z)dz ∝ p(x) = z z xT Σ−1 x 1 pz (z)dz. exp − √ 2z z|Σ| (1) A key property of GSMs is that when z determines the scale of the conditional variance of x given z, which is a Gaussian variable with zero mean and covariance zΣ. In addition, the normalized variable √ x z is a zero mean Gaussian with covariance matrix Σ. The GSM model has been used to describe the marginal and joint densities of local clusters of wavelet coeﬃcients, both within and across subbands [9], where the embedded Gaussian structure aﬀords simple and eﬃcient computation. This local GSM model has been be used for denoising, by independently estimating each coeﬃcient conditioned on its surrounding cluster [12]. This method achieves state-of-the-art performances, despite the fact that treating overlapping clusters as independent does not give rise to a globally consistent statistical model that satisﬁes all the local constraints. 2 Fields of Gaussian scale mixtures In this section, we develop ﬁelds of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM) as a framework for modeling wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. Analogous to the local GSM model, we use a latent multiplier ﬁeld to modulate a homogeneous Gaussian MRF (hGMRF). Formally, we deﬁne a FoGSM x as the product of two mutually independent MRFs, √ d x = u ⊗ z, (2) where u is a zero-mean hGMRF, and z is a ﬁeld of positive multipliers that control the local coeﬃcient variances. The operator ⊗ denotes element-wise multiplication, and the square root operation is applied to each component. Note that x has a one-dimensional GSM marginal distributions, while its components have dependencies captured by the MRF structures of u and z. Analogous to the local GSM, when conditioned on z, x is an inhomogeneous GMRF p(x|z) ∝ √ 1 |Qu | exp − xT D z zi 2 i −1 Qu D √ z −1 x = 1 |Qu | exp − (x zi 2 i √ T z) Qu (x √ z) , (3) where Qu is the inverse covariance matrix of u (also known as the precision matrix), and D(·) denotes the operator that form a diagonal matrix from an input vector. Note also that the element√ wise division of the two ﬁelds, x z, yields a hGMRF with precision matrix Q u . To complete the FoGSM model, we need to specify the structure of the multiplier ﬁeld z. For tractability, we use another hGMRF as a substrate, and map it into positive values by exponentiation, x u log z Fig. 1. Decomposition of a subband from image “boat” (left) into the normalized subband u (middle) and the multiplier ﬁeld z (right, in the logarithm domain). Each image is rescaled individually to ﬁll the full range of grayscale intensities. as was done in [10]. To be more speciﬁc, we model log(z) as a hGMRF with mean µ and precision matrix Qz , where the log operator is applied element-wise, from which the density of z follows as: pz (z) ∝ |Qz | 1 exp − (log z − µ)T Qz (log z − µ) . zi 2 i (4) This is a natural extension of the univariate lognormal prior used previously for the scalar multiplier in the local GSM model [12]. The restriction to hGMRFs greatly simpliﬁes computation with FoGSM. Particularly, we take advantage of the fact that a 2D hGMRF with circular boundary handling has a sparse block-circulant precision matrix with a generating kernel θ specifying its nonzero elements. A block-circulant matrix is diagonalized by the Fourier transform, and its multiplication with a vector corresponds to convolution with the kernel θ. The diagonalizability with a ﬁxed and eﬃciently computed transform makes the parameter estimation, sampling, and inference with a hGMRF substantially more tractable than with a general MRF. Readers are referred to [15] for a detailed description of hGMRFs. Parameter estimation: The estimation of the latent multiplier ﬁeld z and the model parameters (µ, Qz , Qu ) may be achieved by maximizing log p(x, z; Q u, Qz , µ) with an iterative coordinate-ascent method, which is guaranteed to converge. Speciﬁcally, based on the statistical dependency structures in the FoGSM model, the following three steps are repeated until convergence: (i) z(t+1) = argmaxz log p(x|z; Q(t) ) + log p(z; Q(t) , µ(t) ) u z (ii) Q(t+1) = argmaxQu log p(x|z(t+1); Qu ) u (iii) (Q(t+1) , µ(t+1) ) = argmaxQz ,µ log p(z(t+1) ; Qz , µ) z (5) According to the FoGSM model structure, steps (ii) and (iii) correspond to maximum likelihood √ z(t+1) and log z(t+1) , respectively. Because of this, estimates of the parameters of hGMRFs, x both steps may be eﬃciently implemented by exploiting the diagonalization of the precision matrices with 2D Fourier transforms [15]. Step (i) in (5) may be implemented with conjugate gradient ascent [16]. To simplify description and computation, we introduce a new variable for the element-wise inverse square root of the multiplier: √ s=1 z. The likelihood in (3) is then changed to: p(x|s) ∝ i 1 si exp − (x ⊗ s)T Qu (x ⊗ s) = 2 i 1 si exp − sT D(x)Qu D(x)s . 2 (6) The joint density of s is obtained from (4), using the relations between densities of transformed variables, as 1 1 exp − (2 log s + µ)T Qz (2 log s + µ) . (7) p(s) ∝ si 2 i ˆ Combining . (6) and (7), step (i) in (5) is equivalent to computing s = argmaxs log p(x|s; Qu ) + log p(s; Qz , µ), which is further simpliﬁed into: argmin s 1 T 1 s D (x) Qu D (x) s + (2 log s + µ)T Qz (2 log s + µ) . 2 2 (8) boat house peppers x x x x log p(x) Barbara Fig. 2.

This decomposition is a tight frame, constructed from oriented multiscale derivative operators, and is overcomplete by a factor of 4K/3, where K is the number of orientation bands. Note that the marginal and joint statistics we describe are not speciﬁc to this decomposition, and are similar for other multi-scale oriented representations. We ﬁt a FoGSM model to each subband of a decomposed photographic image, using the algorithms described in the previous section. For precision matrices Q u and Qz , we assumed a 5 × 5 Markov neighborhood (corresponding to a 5 × 5 convolution kernel), which was loosely chosen to optimize the tradeoﬀ between accuracy and overﬁtting. Figure 1 shows the result of ﬁtting a FoGSM model to an example subband from the “boat” image (left panel). The subband is decomposed into the product of the u ﬁeld (middle panel) and the z ﬁeld (right panel, in the logarithm domain), along with model parameters Q u , µ and Qz (not shown). Visually, the changing spatial variances are represented in the estimated log z ﬁeld, and the estimated u is much more homogeneous than the original subband and has a marginal distribution close to Gaussian.1 However, the log z ﬁeld still has a non-Gaussian marginal distribution and is spatially inhomogeneous, suggesting limitations of FoGSM for modeling photographic image wavelet coeﬃcients (see Discussion). The statistical dependencies captured by the FoGSM model can be further revealed by examining marginal and joint statistics of samples synthesized with the estimated model parameters. A sample √ from FoGSM can be formed by multiplying samples of u and z. The former is obtained by sampling from hGMRF u, and the latter is obtained from the element-wise exponentiation followed by a element-wise square root operation of a sample of hGMRF log z. This procedure is again eﬃcient for FoGSM due to the use of hGMRFs as building blocks [15]. Marginal distributions: We start by comparing the marginal distributions of the samples and the original subband. Figure 2 shows empirical histograms in the log domain of a particular subband 1 This ”Gaussianizing” behavior was ﬁrst noted in photographic images by Ruderman [18], who observed that image derivative measurements that were normalized by a local estimate of their standard deviation had approximately Gaussian marginal distributions. close ∆ = 1 near ∆ = 4 far ∆ = 32 orientation scale real sim real sim Fig. 3.

See text for details. from four diﬀerent photographic images (blue dot-dashed line), and those of the synthesized samples of FoGSM models learned from each corresponding subband (red solid line). For comparison, a Gaussian with the same standard deviation as the image subband is also displayed (red dashed line). Note that the synthesized samples have conspicuous non-Gaussian characteristics similar to the real subbands, exempliﬁed by the high peak and heavy tails in the marginal distributions. On the other hand, they are typically less kurtotic than the real subbands. We believe this arises from the imprecise Gaussian approximation of log z (see Discussion). Joint distributions: In addition to one-dimensional marginal statistics, the FoGSM model is capable of capturing the joint behavior of wavelet coeﬃcients. As described in [4, 9], wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images present non-Gaussian dependencies. Shown in the ﬁrst and the third rows in Fig. 3 are empirical joint and conditional histograms for one subband of the “boat” image, for ﬁve pairs of coeﬃcients, corresponding to basis functions with spatial separations of ∆ = {1, 4, 32} samples, two orthogonal orientations and two adjacent scales. Contour lines in the joint histogram are drawn at equal intervals of log probability. Intensities in the conditional histograms correspond to probability, except that each column is independently rescaled to ﬁll the full range of intensity. For a pair of adjacent coeﬃcients, we observe an elliptical joint distribution and a “bow-tie” shaped conditional distribution. The latter is indicative of strong non-Gaussian dependencies. For coeﬃcients that are distant, the dependency becomes weaker and the corresponding joint and conditional histograms become more separable, as would be expected for two independent random variables. Random samples drawn from a FoGSM model, with parameters ﬁtted to the corresponding subband, have statistical characteristics consistent with the general description of wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. Shown in the second and the fourth rows of Fig. 3 are the joint and conditional histograms of synthesized samples from the FoGSM model estimated from the same subband as in the ﬁrst and the third rows. Note that the joint and conditional histograms of the synthesized samples have similar transition of spatial dependencies as the separation increases (column 1,2 and 3), suggesting that the FoGSM accounts well for pairwise joint dependencies of coeﬃcients over a full range of spatial separations. On the other hand, the dependencies between subbands of diﬀerent orientations and scales are not properly modeled by FoGSM (column 4 and 5). This is especially true for subbands at diﬀerent scales, which exhibit strong dependencies.

In an overcomplete wavelet domain such as steerable pyramid, the white Gaussian noise is transformed into correlated Gaussian noise w ∼ N w (0, Σw ), whose covariance Σ w can be derived from the basis functions of the pyramid transform. With FoGSM as prior over x, commonly used denoising methods involve expensive high-dimensional integration: for instance, maximum ˆ a posterior estimate, x MAP = argmaxx log p(x|y), requires a high-dimensional integral over z, and ˆ the Bayesian least square estimation, x BLS = E(x|y) requires a double high-dimensional integral over x and z. Although it is possible to optimize with these criteria using Monte-Carlo Markov sampling or other approximations, we instead develop a more eﬃcient deterministic algorithm that takes advantage of the hGMRF structure in the FoGSM model. Speciﬁcally, we compute (ˆ , z, Qu , Qz , µ) = argmaxx,z,Qu ,Qz ,µ log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) x ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ (9) ˆ and take x as the optimal denoised subband. Note that the model parameters are learned within the inference process rather than in a separate parameter learning step. This strategy, known as partial optimal solution [19], greatly reduces the computational complexity. We optimize (9) with coordinate ascent, iterating between maximizing each of (x, z, Q u , Qz , µ) while ﬁxing the others. With ﬁxed estimates of (z, Q u , Qz , µ), the optimization of x is argmaxx log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) = argmaxx log p(x|z, y; Q u, Qz , µ) + log p(z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) , which reduces to argmax x log p(x|z, y; Q u), with the second term independent of x and can be dropped from optimization. Given the Gaussian structure of x given z, this step is then equivalent to a Wiener ﬁlter (linear in y). Fixing (x, Q u , Qz , µ), the optimization of z is argmaxz log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ)= argmaxz log p(y|x, z; Q u)+log p(x, z; Q u, Qz , µ)−log p(y; Qu , Qz , µ) , which is further reduced to argmax z log p(x, z; Qu , Qz , µ). Here, the ﬁrst term was dropped since y is independent of z when conditioned on x. The last term was also dropped since it is also independent of z. Therefore, optimizing z given (x, Q u , Qz , µ) is equivalent to the ﬁrst step of the algorithm in section 2, which can be implemented with eﬃcient gradient descent. Finally, given (x, z), the FoGSM √ z(t+1) and log z(t+1) , similar to the model parameters (Q u , Qz , µ) are estimated from hGMRFs x second and third step in the algorithm of section 2. However, to reduce the overall computation time, instead of a complete maximum likelihood estimation, these parameters are estimated with a maximum pseudo-likelihood procedure [20], which ﬁnds the parameters maximizing the product of all conditional distributions (which are 1D Gaussians in the GMRF case), followed by a projection to the subspace of FoGSM parameters that results in positive deﬁnite precision matrices. We tested this denoising method on a standard set of test images [12]. The noise corrupted images were ﬁrst decomposed these into a steerable pyramid with multiple levels (5 levels for a 512 × 512 image and 4 levels for a 256 × 256 image ) and 8 orientations. We assumed a FoGSM model for each subband, with a 5 × 5 neighborhood for ﬁeld u and a 1 × 1 neighborhood for ﬁeld log z. These sizes were chosen to provide a reasonable combination of performance and computational eﬃciency. We then estimate the optimal x with the algorithm described previously, with the initial values of x and z computed from subband denoised with the local GSM model [12]. Shown in Fig. 4 is an example of denoising the “boat” image corrupted with simulated additive white Gaussian noise of strength σ = 50, corresponding to a peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), of 14.15 dB. We compare this with the local GSM method in [12], which, assuming a local GSM model for the neighborhood consisting of 3 × 3 spatial neighbors plus parent in the next coarsest scale, computes a Bayes least squares estimate of each coeﬃcient conditioned on its surrounding neighborhood. The FoGSM denoising achieves substantial improvement (+0.68 in PSNR) and is seen to exhibit better contrast and continuation of oriented features (see Fig. 4). On the other hand, FoGSM introduces some noticeable artifacts in low contrast areas, which is caused by numerical instability at locations with small z. We ﬁnd that the improvement in terms of PSNR is consistent across photographic images and noise levels, as reported in Table 1. But even with a restricted neighborhood for the multiplier ﬁeld, this PSNR improvement does come at a substantial computational cost. As a rough indication, running on a PowerPC G5 workstation with 2.3 Ghz processor and 16 Gb RAM memory, using unoptimized MATLAB (version R14) code, denoising a 512 × 512 image takes on average 4.5 hours (results averaging over 5 images), and denoising a 256×256 image takes on average 2.4 hours (result averaging over 2 images), to a convergence precision producing the reported results. Our preliminary investigation indicates that the slow running time is mainly due to the nature of coordinate ascent and the landscape of (9), which requires many iterations to converge. 5 Discussion We have introduced ﬁelds of Gaussian scale mixtures as a ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool for modeling the statistics of wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. We developed a feasible (although admittedly computationally costly) parameter estimation method, and showed that samples synthesized from the ﬁtted FoGSM model are able to capture structures in the marginal and joint wavelet statistics of photographic images. Preliminary results of applying FoGSM to image denoising indicate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods based on the local GSM model. Although FoGSM has a structure that is similar to the local scale mixture model [9, 10], there is a fundamental diﬀerence between them. In FoGSM, hGMRF structures are enforced in u and log z, while the local scale mixture models impose minimal statistical structure on these variables. Because of this, our model easily extends to images of arbitrary size, while the local scale mixture models are essentially conﬁned to describing small image patches (the curse of dimensionality, and the increase in computational cost prevent one from scaling the patch size up). On the other hand, the close relation to Gaussian MRF makes the analysis and computation of FoGSM signiﬁcantly easier than other non-Gaussian MRF based image models [6, 7, 5]. We envision, and are currently working on, a number of model improvements. First, the model should beneﬁt from the introduction of more general Markov neighborhoods, including wavelet coeﬃcients from subbands at other scales and orientations [4, 12], since the current model is clearly not accounting for these dependencies (see Fig. 3). Secondly, the log transformation used to derive the multiplier ﬁeld from a hGMRF is somewhat ad hoc, and we believe that substitution of another nonlinear transformation (e.g., a power law [14]) might lead to a more accurate description of the image statistics. Thirdly, the current denoising method estimates model parameter during the process of denoising, which produces image adaptive model parameters. We are exploring the possibility of using a set of generic model parameter learned a priori on a large set of photographic images, so that a generic statistical model for all photographic images based on FoGSM can be built. Finally, there exist residual inhomogeneous structures in the log z ﬁeld (see Fig. 1) that can likely be captured by explicitly incorporating local orientation [21] or phase into the model. Finding tractable models and algorithms for handling such circular variables is challenging, but we believe their inclusion will result in substantial improvements in modeling and in denoising performance. σ/PSNR 10/28.13 25/20.17 50/14.15 100/8.13 σ/PSNR 10/28.13 25/20.17 50/14.15 100/8.13 Barbara 35.01 (34.01) 30.10 (29.07) 26.40 (25.45) 23.01 (22.61) Flintstones 32.47 (31.78) 28.29 (27.48) 24.82 (24.02) 21.24 (20.49) barco 35.05 (34.42) 30.44 (29.73) 27.36 (26.63) 24.44 (23.84) house 35.63 (35.27) 31.64 (31.32) 28.51 (28.23) 25.33 (25.31) boat 34.12 (33.58) 30.03 (29.34) 27.01 (26.35) 24.20 (23.79) Lena 35.94 (35.60) 32.11 (31.70) 29.12 (28.62) 26.12 (25.77) ﬁngerprint 33.28 (32.45) 28.45 (27.44) 25.11 (24.13) 21.78 (21.21) peppers 34.38 (33.73) 29.78 (29.18) 26.43 (25.93) 23.17 (22.80) Table 1.

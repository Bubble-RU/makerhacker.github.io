<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information about a classiﬁcation problem in feature space is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem. Thus, kernels not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved even by linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economic use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data to perform classiﬁcation. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the subspace and dimensionality relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to help in model selection, and to (3) de-noise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results. 1</p><p>3 0.11946134 <a title="77-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Unsupervised_Regression_with_Applications_to_Nonlinear_System_Identification.html">200 nips-2006-Unsupervised Regression with Applications to Nonlinear System Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Ben Recht</p><p>Abstract: We derive a cost functional for estimating the relationship between highdimensional observations and the low-dimensional process that generated them with no input-output examples. Limiting our search to invertible observation functions confers numerous beneﬁts, including a compact representation and no suboptimal local minima. Our approximation algorithms for optimizing this cost functional are fast and give diagnostic bounds on the quality of their solution. Our method can be viewed as a manifold learning algorithm that utilizes a prior on the low-dimensional manifold coordinates. The beneﬁts of taking advantage of such priors in manifold learning and searching for the inverse observation functions in system identiﬁcation are demonstrated empirically by learning to track moving targets from raw measurements in a sensor network setting and in an RFID tracking experiment. 1</p><p>4 0.1187092 <a title="77-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Prediction_on_a_Graph_with_a_Perceptron.html">163 nips-2006-Prediction on a Graph with a Perceptron</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Herbster, Massimiliano Pontil</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of online prediction of a noisy labeling of a graph with the perceptron. We address both label noise and concept noise. Graph learning is framed as an instance of prediction on a ﬁnite set. To treat label noise we show that the hinge loss bounds derived by Gentile [1] for online perceptron learning can be transformed to relative mistake bounds with an optimal leading constant when applied to prediction on a ﬁnite set. These bounds depend crucially on the norm of the learned concept. Often the norm of a concept can vary dramatically with only small perturbations in a labeling. We analyze a simple transformation that stabilizes the norm under perturbations. We derive an upper bound that depends only on natural properties of the graph – the graph diameter and the cut size of a partitioning of the graph – which are only indirectly dependent on the size of the graph. The impossibility of such bounds for the graph geodesic nearest neighbors algorithm will be demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.11663426 <a title="77-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-A_Small_World_Threshold_for_Economic_Network_Formation.html">14 nips-2006-A Small World Threshold for Economic Network Formation</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Michael Kearns</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a game-theoretic model for network formation inspired by earlier stochastic models that mix localized and long-distance connectivity. In this model, players may purchase edges at distance d at a cost of dα , and wish to minimize the sum of their edge purchases and their average distance to other players. In this model, we show there is a striking “small world” threshold phenomenon: in two dimensions, if α < 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network of constant diameter (independent of network size), and if α > 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network whose diameter grows as a root of the network size, and thus is unbounded. We contrast our results with those of Kleinberg [8] in a stochastic model, and empirically investigate the “navigability” of equilibrium networks. Our theoretical results all generalize to higher dimensions. 1</p><p>6 0.11367404 <a title="77-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Kernel_Maximum_Entropy_Data_Transformation_and_an_Enhanced_Spectral_Clustering_Algorithm.html">102 nips-2006-Kernel Maximum Entropy Data Transformation and an Enhanced Spectral Clustering Algorithm</a></p>

<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Praveen Srinivasan, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. We present two contributions. First, we give a new spectral relaxation technique for approximate solutions to matching problems, that naturally incorporates one-to-one or one-to-many constraints within the relaxation scheme. The second is a normalization procedure for existing graph matching scoring functions that can dramatically improve the matching accuracy. It is based on a reinterpretation of the graph matching compatibility matrix as a bipartite graph on edges for which we seek a bistochastic normalization. We evaluate our two contributions on a comprehensive test set of random graph matching problems, as well as on image correspondence problem. Our normalization procedure can be used to improve the performance of many existing graph matching algorithms, including spectral matching, graduated assignment and semideﬁnite programming. 1</p><p>4 0.58736676 <a title="77-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Small_World_Threshold_for_Economic_Network_Formation.html">14 nips-2006-A Small World Threshold for Economic Network Formation</a></p>

<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Jiayuan Huang, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We usually endow the investigated objects with pairwise relationships, which can be illustrated as graphs. In many real-world problems, however, relationships among the objects of our interest are more complex than pairwise. Naively squeezing the complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be expected valuable for our learning tasks however. Therefore we consider using hypergraphs instead to completely represent complex relationships among the objects of our interest, and thus the problem of learning with hypergraphs arises. Our main contribution in this paper is to generalize the powerful methodology of spectral clustering which originally operates on undirected graphs to hypergraphs, and further develop algorithms for hypergraph embedding and transductive classiﬁcation on the basis of the spectral hypergraph clustering approach. Our experiments on a number of benchmarks showed the advantages of hypergraphs over usual graphs. 1</p><p>6 0.53045869 <a title="77-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Graph_Laplacian_Regularization_for_Large-Scale_Semidefinite_Programming.html">87 nips-2006-Graph Laplacian Regularization for Large-Scale Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: David Barber, Bertrand Mesot</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a method for approximate smoothed inference in a class of switching linear dynamical systems, based on a novel form of Gaussian Sum smoother. This class includes the switching Kalman Filter and the more general case of switch transitions dependent on the continuous latent state. The method improves on the standard Kim smoothing approach by dispensing with one of the key approximations, thus making fuller use of the available future information. Whilst the only central assumption required is projection to a mixture of Gaussians, we show that an additional conditional independence assumption results in a simpler but stable and accurate alternative. Unlike the alternative unstable Expectation Propagation procedure, our method consists only of a single forward and backward pass and is reminiscent of the standard smoothing ‘correction’ recursions in the simpler linear dynamical system. The algorithm performs well on both toy experiments and in a large scale application to noise robust speech recognition. 1 Switching Linear Dynamical System The Linear Dynamical System (LDS) [1] is a key temporal model in which a latent linear process generates the observed series. For complex time-series which are not well described globally by a single LDS, we may break the time-series into segments, each modeled by a potentially different LDS. This is the basis for the Switching LDS (SLDS) [2, 3, 4, 5] where, for each time t, a switch variable st ∈ 1, . . . , S describes which of the LDSs is to be used. The observation (or ‘visible’) vt ∈ RV is linearly related to the hidden state ht ∈ RH with additive noise η by vt = B(st )ht + η v (st ) p(vt |ht , st ) = N (B(st )ht , Σv (st )) ≡ (1) where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and covariance Σ. The transition dynamics of the continuous hidden state ht is linear, ht = A(st )ht−1 + η h (st ), ≡ p(ht |ht−1 , st ) = N A(st )ht−1 , Σh (st ) (2) The switch st may depend on both the previous st−1 and ht−1 . This is an augmented SLDS (aSLDS), and deﬁnes the model T p(vt |ht , st )p(ht |ht−1 , st )p(st |ht−1 , st−1 ) p(v1:T , h1:T , s1:T ) = t=1 The standard SLDS[4] considers only switch transitions p(st |st−1 ). At time t = 1, p(s1 |h0 , s0 ) simply denotes the prior p(s1 ), and p(h1 |h0 , s1 ) denotes p(h1 |s1 ). The aim of this article is to address how to perform inference in the aSLDS. In particular we desire the ﬁltered estimate p(ht , st |v1:t ) and the smoothed estimate p(ht , st |v1:T ), for any 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Both ﬁltered and smoothed inference in the SLDS is intractable, scaling exponentially with time [4]. s1 s2 s3 s4 h1 h2 h3 h4 v1 v2 v3 v4 Figure 1: The independence structure of the aSLDS. Square nodes denote discrete variables, round nodes continuous variables. In the SLDS links from h to s are not normally considered. 2 Expectation Correction Our approach to approximate p(ht , st |v1:T ) mirrors the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ‘correction’ smoother for the simpler LDS [1].The method consists of a single forward pass to recursively ﬁnd the ﬁltered posterior p(ht , st |v1:t ), followed by a single backward pass to correct this into a smoothed posterior p(ht , st |v1:T ). The forward pass we use is equivalent to standard Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) [6]. The main contribution of this paper is a novel form of backward pass, based only on collapsing the smoothed posterior to a mixture of Gaussians. Together with the ADF forward pass, we call the method Expectation Correction, since it corrects the moments found from the forward pass. A more detailed description of the method, including pseudocode, is given in [7]. 2.1 Forward Pass (Filtering) Readers familiar with ADF may wish to continue directly to Section (2.2). Our aim is to form a recursion for p(st , ht |v1:t ), based on a Gaussian mixture approximation of p(ht |st , v1:t ). Without loss of generality, we may decompose the ﬁltered posterior as p(ht , st |v1:t ) = p(ht |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (3) The exact representation of p(ht |st , v1:t ) is a mixture with O(S t ) components. We therefore approximate this with a smaller I-component mixture I p(ht |st , v1:t ) ≈ p(ht |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t ) it =1 where p(ht |it , st , v1:t ) is a Gaussian parameterized with mean f (it , st ) and covariance F (it , st ). To ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters, consider p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) = p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) (4) st ,it Evaluating p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) We ﬁnd p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) by ﬁrst computing the joint distribution p(ht+1 , vt+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t ), which is a Gaussian with covariance and mean elements, Σhh = A(st+1 )F (it , st )AT (st+1 ) + Σh (st+1 ), Σvv = B(st+1 )Σhh B T (st+1 ) + Σv (st+1 ) Σvh = B(st+1 )F (it , st ), µv = B(st+1 )A(st+1 )f (it , st ), µh = A(st+1 )f (it , st ) (5) and then conditioning on vt+1 1 . For the case S = 1, this forms the usual Kalman Filter recursions[1]. Evaluating p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) The mixture weight in (4) can be found from the decomposition p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (6) 1 p(x|y) is a Gaussian with mean µx + Σxy Σ−1 (y − µy ) and covariance Σxx − Σxy Σ−1 Σyx . yy yy The ﬁrst factor in (6), p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t ) is a Gaussian with mean µv and covariance Σvv , as given in (5). The last two factors p(it |st , v1:t ) and p(st |v1:t ) are given from the previous iteration. Finally, p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) is found from p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) = p(st+1 |ht , st ) p(ht |it ,st ,v1:t ) (7) where · p denotes expectation with respect to p. In the SLDS, (7) is replaced by the Markov transition p(st+1 |st ). In the aSLDS, however, (7) will generally need to be computed numerically. Closing the recursion We are now in a position to calculate (4). For each setting of the variable st+1 , we have a mixture of I × S Gaussians which we numerically collapse back to I Gaussians to form I p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ≈ p(ht+1 |it+1 , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) it+1 =1 Any method of choice may be supplied to collapse a mixture to a smaller mixture; our code simply repeatedly merges low-weight components. In this way the new mixture coefﬁcients p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ), it+1 ∈ 1, . . . , I are deﬁned, completing the description of how to form a recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) in (3). A recursion for the switch variable is given by p(st+1 |v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |st+1 , it , st , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) st ,it where all terms have been computed during the recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ). The likelihood p(v1:T ) may be found by recursing p(v1:t+1 ) = p(vt+1 |v1:t )p(v1:t ), where p(vt+1 |vt ) = p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) it ,st ,st+1 2.2 Backward Pass (Smoothing) The main contribution of this paper is to ﬁnd a suitable way to ‘correct’ the ﬁltered posterior p(st , ht |v1:t ) obtained from the forward pass into a smoothed posterior p(st , ht |v1:T ). We derive this for the case of a single Gaussian representation. The extension to the mixture case is straightforward and presented in [7]. We approximate the smoothed posterior p(ht |st , v1:T ) by a Gaussian with mean g(st ) and covariance G(st ) and our aim is to ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters. A useful starting point for a recursion is: p(st+1 |v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht , st |v1:T ) = st+1 The term p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) may be computed as p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) = p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) (8) ht+1 The recursion therefore requires p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ), which we can write as p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ∝ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) (9) The difﬁculty here is that the functional form of p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) is not squared exponential in ht+1 , so that p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be Gaussian2 . One possibility would be to approximate the non-Gaussian p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) by a Gaussian (or mixture thereof) by minimizing the Kullback-Leilbler divergence between the two, or performing moment matching in the case of a single Gaussian. A simpler alternative (which forms ‘standard’ EC) is to make the assumption p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), where p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) is already known from the previous backward recursion. Under this assumption, the recursion becomes p(ht , st |v1:T ) ≈ p(st+1 |v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (10) st+1 2 In the exact calculation, p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) is a mixture of Gaussians, see [7]. However, since in (9) the two terms p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) will only be approximately computed during the recursion, our approximation to p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be a mixture of Gaussians. Evaluating p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian in ht , whose statistics we will now compute. First we ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) which may be obtained from the joint distribution p(ht , ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |ht , st+1 )p(ht |st , v1:t ) (11) which itself can be found from a forward dynamics from the ﬁltered estimate p(ht |st , v1:t ). The statistics for the marginal p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:t ) are simply those of p(ht |st , v1:t ), since st+1 carries no extra information about ht . The remaining statistics are the mean of ht+1 , the covariance of ht+1 and cross-variance between ht and ht+1 , which are given by ht+1 = A(st+1 )ft (st ), Σt+1,t+1 = A(st+1 )Ft (st )AT (st+1 )+Σh (st+1 ), Σt+1,t = A(st+1 )Ft (st ) Given the statistics of (11), we may now condition on ht+1 to ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ). Doing so effectively constitutes a reversal of the dynamics, ← − − ht = A (st , st+1 )ht+1 + ←(st , st+1 ) η ← − ← − − − where A (st , st+1 ) and ←(st , st+1 ) ∼ N (← t , st+1 ), Σ (st , st+1 )) are easily found using η m(s conditioning. Averaging the above reversed dynamics over p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), we ﬁnd that p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian with statistics ← − ← − ← − ← − − µt = A (st , st+1 )g(st+1 )+← t , st+1 ), Σt,t = A (st , st+1 )G(st+1 ) A T (st , st+1 )+ Σ (st , st+1 ) m(s These equations directly mirror the standard RTS backward pass[1]. Evaluating p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) The main departure of EC from previous methods is in treating the term p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) = p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (12) The term p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) is given by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) ′ ′ s′ p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) (13) t Here p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ), where p(st+1 |st , v1:t ) occurs in the forward pass, (7). In (13), p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t ) is found by marginalizing (11). Computing the average of (13) with respect to p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) may be achieved by any numerical integration method desired. A simple approximation is to evaluate the integrand at the mean value of the averaging distribution p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ). More sophisticated methods (see [7]) such as sampling from the Gaussian p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) have the advantage that covariance information is used3 . Closing the Recursion We have now computed both the continuous and discrete factors in (8), which we wish to use to write the smoothed estimate in the form p(ht , st |v1:T ) = p(st |v1:T )p(ht |st , v1:T ). The distribution p(ht |st , v1:T ) is readily obtained from the joint (8) by conditioning on st to form the mixture p(ht |st , v1:T ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) st+1 which may then be collapsed to a single Gaussian (the mixture case is discussed in [7]). The smoothed posterior p(st |v1:T ) is given by p(st |v1:T ) = p(st+1 |v1:T ) p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) . (14) st+1 3 This is a form of exact sampling since drawing samples from a Gaussian is easy. This should not be confused with meaning that this use of sampling renders EC a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme. 2.3 Relation to other methods The EC Backward pass is closely related to Kim’s method [8]. In both EC and Kim’s method, the approximation p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), is used to form a numerically simple backward pass. The other ‘approximation’ in EC is to numerically compute the average in (14). In Kim’s method, however, an update for the discrete variables is formed by replacing the required term in (14) by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) ≈ p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) (15) Since p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) ∝ p(st+1 |st )p(st |v1:t )/p(st+1 |v1:t ), this can be computed simply from the ﬁltered results alone. The fundamental difference therefore between EC and Kim’s method is that the approximation, (15), is not required by EC. The EC backward pass therefore makes fuller use of the future information, resulting in a recursion which intimately couples the continuous and discrete variables. The resulting effect on the quality of the approximation can be profound, as we will see in the experiments. The Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm makes the central assumption of collapsing the posteriors to a Gaussian family [5]; the collapse is deﬁned by a consistency criterion on overlapping marginals. In our experiments, we take the approach in [9] of collapsing to a single Gaussian. Ensuring consistency requires frequent translations between moment and canonical parameterizations, which is the origin of potentially severe numerical instability [10]. In contrast, EC works largely with moment parameterizations of Gaussians, for which relatively few numerical difﬁculties arise. Unlike EP, EC is not based on a consistency criterion and a subtle issue arises about possible inconsistencies in the Forward and Backward approximations for EC. For example, under the conditional independence assumption in the Backward Pass, p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) ≈ p(hT |sT , v1:T ), which is in contradiction to (5) which states that the approximation to p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) will depend on sT −1 . Such potential inconsistencies arise because of the approximations made, and should not be considered as separate approximations in themselves. Rather than using a global (consistency) objective, EC attempts to faithfully approximate the exact Forward and Backward propagation routines. For this reason, as in the exact computation, only a single Forward and Backward pass are required in EC. In [11] a related dynamics reversed is proposed. However, the singularities resulting from incorrectly treating p(vt+1:T |ht , st ) as a density are heuristically ﬁnessed. In [12] a variational method approximates the joint distribution p(h1:T , s1:T |v1:T ) rather than the marginal inference p(ht , st |v1:T ). This is a disadvantage when compared to other methods that directly approximate the marginal. Sequential Monte Carlo methods (Particle Filters)[13], are essentially mixture of delta-function approximations. Whilst potentially powerful, these typically suffer in high-dimensional hidden spaces, unless techniques such as Rao-Blackwellization are performed. ADF is generally preferential to Particle Filtering since in ADF the approximation is a mixture of non-trivial distributions, and is therefore more able to represent the posterior. 3 Demonstration Testing EC in a problem with a reasonably long temporal sequence, T , is important since numerical instabilities may not be apparent in timeseries of just a few points. To do this, we sequentially generate hidden and visible states from a given model, here with H = 3, S = 2, V = 1 – see Figure(2) for full details of the experimental setup. Then, given only the parameters of the model and the visible observations (but not any of the hidden states h1:T , s1:T ), the task is to infer p(ht |st , v1:T ) and p(st |v1:T ). Since the exact computation is exponential in T , a simple alternative is to assume that the original sample states s1:T are the ‘correct’ inferences, and compare how our most probable posterior smoothed estimates arg maxst p(st |v1:T ) compare with the assumed correct sample st . We chose conditions that, from the viewpoint of classical signal processing, are difﬁcult, with changes in the switches occurring at a much higher rate than the typical frequencies in the signal vt . For EC we use the mean approximation for the numerical integration of (12). We included the Particle Filter merely for a point of comparison with ADF, since they are not designed to approximate PF RBPF EP ADFS KimS ECS ADFM KimM ECM 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 Figure 2: The number of errors in estimating p(st |v1:T ) for a binary switch (S = 2) over a time series of length T = 100.

For the RaoBlackwellized Particle Filter [13], 500 particles were used, with Kitagawa resampling. We found that EP4 was numerically unstable and often struggled to converge. To encourage convergence, we used the damping method in [9], performing 20 iterations with a damping factor of 0.5. Nevertheless, the disappointing performance of EP is most likely due to conﬂicts resulting from numerical instabilities introduced by the frequent conversions between moment and canonical representations. The best ﬁltered results are given using ADF, since this is better able to represent the variance in the ﬁltered posterior than the sampling methods. Unlike Kim’s method, EC makes good use of the future information to clean up the ﬁltered results considerably. One should bear in mind that both EC and Kim’s method use the same ADF ﬁltered results. This demonstrates that EC may dramatically improve on Kim’s method, so that the small amount of extra work in making a numerical approximation of p(st |st+1 , v1:T ), (12), may bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts. We found similar conclusions for experiments with an aSLDS[7]. 4 Application to Noise Robust ASR Here we brieﬂy present an application of the SLDS to robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for which the intractable inference is performed by EC, and serves to demonstrate how EC scales well to a large-scale application. Fuller details are given in [14]. The standard approach to noise robust ASR is to provide a set of noise-robust features to a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classiﬁer, which is based on modeling the acoustic feature vector. For example, the method of Unsupervised Spectral Subtraction (USS) [15] provides state-of-the-art performance in this respect. Incorporating noise models directly into such feature-based HMM systems is difﬁcult, mainly because the explicit inﬂuence of the noise on the features is poorly understood. An alternative is to model the raw speech signal directly, such as the SAR-HMM model [16] for which, under clean conditions, isolated spoken digit recognition performs well. However, the SAR-HMM performs poorly under noisy conditions, since no explicit noise processes are taken into account by the model. The approach we take here is to extend the SAR-HMM to include an explicit noise process, so that h the observed signal vt is modeled as a noise corrupted version of a clean hidden signal vt : h vt = vt + ηt ˜ 4 with ηt ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) ˜ ˜ Generalized EP [5], which groups variables together improves on the results, but is still far inferior to the EC results presented here – Onno Zoeter personal communication.

The dynamics of the clean signal is modeled by a switching AR process R h vt = h h cr (st )vt−r + ηt (st ), h ηt (st ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (st )) r=1 where st ∈ {1, . . . , S} denotes which of a set of AR coefﬁcients cr (st ) are to be used at time t, h and ηt (st ) is the so-called innovation noise. When σ 2 (st ) ≡ 0, this model reproduces the SARHMM of [16], a specially constrained HMM. Hence inference and learning for the SAR-HMM are tractable and straightforward. For the case σ 2 (st ) > 0 the model can be recast as an SLDS. To do this we deﬁne ht as a vector which contains the R most recent clean hidden samples ht = h vt h . . . vt−r+1 T (16) and we set A(st ) to be an R × R matrix where the ﬁrst row contains the AR coefﬁcients −cr (st ) and the rest is a shifted down identity matrix. For example, for a third order (R = 3) AR process, A(st ) = −c1 (st ) −c2 (st ) −c3 (st ) 1 0 0 0 1 0 . (17) The hidden covariance matrix Σh (s) has all elements zero, except the top-left most which is set to the innovation variance. To extract the ﬁrst component of ht we use the (switch independent) 1 × R projection matrix B = [ 1 0 . . . 0 ]. The (switch independent) visible scalar noise 2 variance is given by Σv ≡ σv . A well-known issue with raw speech signal models is that the energy of a signal may vary from one speaker to another or because of a change in recording conditions. For this reason the innovation Σh is adjusted by maximizing the likelihood of an observed sequence with respect to the innovation covariance, a process called Gain Adaptation [16]. 4.1 Training & Evaluation Following [16], we trained a separate SAR-HMM for each of the eleven digits (0–9 and ‘oh’) from the TI-DIGITS database [17]. The training set for each digit was composed of 110 single digit utterances down-sampled to 8 kHz, each one pronounced by a male speaker. Each SAR-HMM was composed of ten states with a left-right transition matrix. Each state was associated with a 10thorder AR process and the model was constrained to stay an integer multiple of K = 140 time steps (0.0175 seconds) in the same state. We refer the reader to [16] for a detailed explanation of the training procedure used with the SAR-HMM. An AR-SLDS was built for each of the eleven digits by copying the parameters of the corresponding trained SAR-HMM, i.e., the AR coefﬁcients cr (s) are copied into the ﬁrst row of the hidden transition matrix A(s) and the same discrete transition distribution p(st | st−1 ) is used. The models were then evaluated on a test set composed of 112 corrupted utterances of each of the eleven digits, each pronounced by different male speakers than those used in the training set. The recognition accuracy obtained by the models on the corrupted test sets is presented in Table 1. As expected, the performance of the SAR-HMM rapidly decreases with noise. The feature-based HMM with USS has high accuracy only for high SNR levels. In contrast, the AR-SLDS achieves a recognition accuracy of 61.2% at a SNR close to 0 dB, while the performance of the two other methods is equivalent to random guessing (9.1%). Whilst other inference methods may also perform well in this case, we found that EC performs admirably, without numerical instabilities, even for time-series with several thousand time-steps. 5 Discussion We presented a method for approximate smoothed inference in an augmented class of switching linear dynamical systems. Our approximation is based on the idea that due to the forgetting which commonly occurs in Markovian models, a ﬁnite number of mixture components may provide a reasonable approximation. Clearly, in systems with very long correlation times our method may require too many mixture components to produce a satisfactory result, although we are unaware of other techniques that would be able to cope well in that case. The main beneﬁt of EC over Kim smoothing is that future information is more accurately dealt with. Whilst EC is not as general as EP, EC carefully exploits the properties of singly-connected distributions, such as the aSLDS, to provide a numerically stable procedure. We hope that the ideas presented here may therefore help facilitate the practical application of dynamic hybrid networks. Acknowledgements This work is supported by the EU Project FP6-0027787.

Our algebra in RKHS allow us to exploit sparsity in directed and undirected graphs more effectively than previous methods, yielding sub-cubic computational complexity when combined with conjugate gradient solvers or ﬁxed-point iterations.

The policy is chosen based on its empirical performance in simulations. We are interested in conditions on the complexity of the policy class that ensure the success of such simulation based policy search methods. We show that under bounds on the amount of computation involved in computing policies, transition dynamics and rewards, uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true value functions occurs. Previously, such results were derived by assuming boundedness of pseudodimension and Lipschitz continuity. These assumptions and ours are both stronger than the usual combinatorial complexity measures. We show, via minimax inequalities, that this is essential: boundedness of pseudodimension or fat-shattering dimension alone is not sufﬁcient.</p><p>4 0.55871189 <a title="77-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Automated_Hierarchy_Discovery_for_Planning_in_Partially_Observable_Environments.html">38 nips-2006-Automated Hierarchy Discovery for Planning in Partially Observable Environments</a></p>
<p>Author: Laurent Charlin, Pascal Poupart, Romy Shioda</p><p>Abstract: Planning in partially observable domains is a notoriously difﬁcult problem. However, in many real-world scenarios, planning can be simpliﬁed by decomposing the task into a hierarchy of smaller planning problems. Several approaches have been proposed to optimize a policy that decomposes according to a hierarchy speciﬁed a priori. In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatically discovering the hierarchy. More precisely, we frame the optimization of a hierarchical policy as a non-convex optimization problem that can be solved with general non-linear solvers, a mixed-integer non-linear approximation or a form of bounded hierarchical policy iteration. By encoding the hierarchical structure as variables of the optimization problem, we can automatically discover a hierarchy. Our method is ﬂexible enough to allow any parts of the hierarchy to be speciﬁed based on prior knowledge while letting the optimization discover the unknown parts. It can also discover hierarchical policies, including recursive policies, that are more compact (potentially inﬁnitely fewer parameters) and often easier to understand given the decomposition induced by the hierarchy. 1</p><p>5 0.55548131 <a title="77-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Distributed_Inference_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">69 nips-2006-Distributed Inference in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>6 0.555291 <a title="77-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Correcting_Sample_Selection_Bias_by_Unlabeled_Data.html">62 nips-2006-Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data</a></p>

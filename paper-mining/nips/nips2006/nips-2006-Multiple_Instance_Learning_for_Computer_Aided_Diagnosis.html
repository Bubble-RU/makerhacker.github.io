<p>Author: Zhi-hua Zhou, Min-ling Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we formalize multi-instance multi-label learning, where each training example is associated with not only multiple instances but also multiple class labels. Such a problem can occur in many real-world tasks, e.g. an image usually contains multiple patches each of which can be described by a feature vector, and the image can belong to multiple categories since its semantics can be recognized in different ways. We analyze the relationship between multi-instance multi-label learning and the learning frameworks of traditional supervised learning, multiinstance learning and multi-label learning. Then, we propose the M IML B OOST and M IML S VM algorithms which achieve good performance in an application to scene classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>3 0.076963641 <a title="140-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Discriminative_Visual_Codebooks_using_Randomized_Clustering_Forests.html">78 nips-2006-Fast Discriminative Visual Codebooks using Randomized Clustering Forests</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Moosmann, Bill Triggs, Frederic Jurie</p><p>Abstract: Some of the most effective recent methods for content-based image classiﬁcation work by extracting dense or sparse local image descriptors, quantizing them according to a coding rule such as k-means vector quantization, accumulating histograms of the resulting “visual word” codes over the image, and classifying these with a conventional classiﬁer such as an SVM. Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests – ensembles of randomly created clustering trees – and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.069213457 <a title="140-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Max-margin_classification_of_incomplete_data.html">130 nips-2006-Max-margin classification of incomplete data</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Geremy Heitz, Gal Elidan, Pieter Abbeel, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of learning classiﬁers for structurally incomplete data, where some objects have a subset of features inherently absent due to complex relationships between the features. The common approach for handling missing features is to begin with a preprocessing phase that completes the missing features, and then use a standard classiﬁcation procedure. In this paper we show how incomplete data can be classiﬁed directly without any completion of the missing features using a max-margin learning framework. We formulate this task using a geometrically-inspired objective function, and discuss two optimization approaches: The linearly separable case is written as a set of convex feasibility problems, and the non-separable case has a non-convex objective that we optimize iteratively. By avoiding the pre-processing phase in which the data is completed, these approaches oﬀer considerable computational savings. More importantly, we show that by elegantly handling complex patterns of missing values, our approach is both competitive with other methods when the values are missing at random and outperforms them when the missing values have non-trivial structure. We demonstrate our results on two real-world problems: edge prediction in metabolic pathways, and automobile detection in natural images. 1</p><p>5 0.064807326 <a title="140-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Online_Clustering_of_Moving_Hyperplanes.html">153 nips-2006-Online Clustering of Moving Hyperplanes</a></p>
<p>Author: René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefﬁcients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The ﬁnal result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird ﬂoating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefﬁcients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.</p><p>6 0.055963211 <a title="140-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>

<p>Author: Konrad Rieck, Pavel Laskov, Sören Sonnenburg</p><p>Abstract: We propose a generic algorithm for computation of similarity measures for sequential data. The algorithm uses generalized sufﬁx trees for efﬁcient calculation of various kernel, distance and non-metric similarity functions. Its worst-case run-time is linear in the length of sequences and independent of the underlying embedding language, which can cover words, k-grams or all contained subsequences. Experiments with network intrusion detection, DNA analysis and text processing applications demonstrate the utility of distances and similarity coefﬁcients for sequences as alternatives to classical kernel functions.</p><p>5 0.56977451 <a title="140-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Large_Margin_Component_Analysis.html">105 nips-2006-Large Margin Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Kuang-chih Lee</p><p>Abstract: Metric learning has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation. In problems involving thousands of features, distance learning algorithms cannot be used due to overﬁtting and high computational complexity. In such cases, previous work has relied on a two-step solution: ﬁrst apply dimensionality reduction methods to the data, and then learn a metric in the resulting low-dimensional subspace. In this paper we show that better classiﬁcation performance can be achieved by unifying the objectives of dimensionality reduction and metric learning. We propose a method that solves for the low-dimensional projection of the inputs, which minimizes a metric objective aimed at separating points in different classes by a large margin. This projection is deﬁned by a signiﬁcantly smaller number of parameters than metrics learned in input space, and thus our optimization reduces the risks of overﬁtting. Theory and results are presented for both a linear as well as a kernelized version of the algorithm. Overall, we achieve classiﬁcation rates similar, and in several cases superior, to those of support vector machines. 1</p><p>6 0.51994962 <a title="140-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Online_Clustering_of_Moving_Hyperplanes.html">153 nips-2006-Online Clustering of Moving Hyperplanes</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Hein, Markus Maier</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of denoising a noisily sampled submanifold M in Rd , where the submanifold M is a priori unknown and we are only given a noisy point sample. The presented denoising algorithm is based on a graph-based diffusion process of the point sample. We analyze this diffusion process using recent results about the convergence of graph Laplacians. In the experiments we show that our method is capable of dealing with non-trivial high-dimensional noise. Moreover using the denoising algorithm as pre-processing method we can improve the results of a semi-supervised learning algorithm. 1</p><p>3 0.48578188 <a title="140-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Multi-Instance_Multi-Label_Learning_with_Application_to_Scene_Classification.html">136 nips-2006-Multi-Instance Multi-Label Learning with Application to Scene Classification</a></p>

We analyze the relationship between multi-instance multi-label learning and the learning frameworks of traditional supervised learning, multiinstance learning and multi-label learning. Then, we propose the M IML B OOST and M IML S VM algorithms which achieve good performance in an application to scene classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>4 0.4720723 <a title="140-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>5 0.46844715 <a title="140-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Sparse_Representation_for_Signal_Classification.html">179 nips-2006-Sparse Representation for Signal Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ke Huang, Selin Aviyente</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, application of sparse representation (factorization) of signals over an overcomplete basis (dictionary) for signal classiﬁcation is discussed. Searching for the sparse representation of a signal over an overcomplete dictionary is achieved by optimizing an objective function that includes two terms: one that measures the signal reconstruction error and another that measures the sparsity. This objective function works well in applications where signals need to be reconstructed, like coding and denoising. On the other hand, discriminative methods, such as linear discriminative analysis (LDA), are better suited for classiﬁcation tasks. However, discriminative methods are usually sensitive to corruption in signals due to lacking crucial properties for signal reconstruction. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for signal classiﬁcation with sparse representation. The approach combines the discrimination power of the discriminative methods with the reconstruction property and the sparsity of the sparse representation that enables one to deal with signal corruptions: noise, missing data and outliers. The proposed approach is therefore capable of robust classiﬁcation with a sparse representation of signals. The theoretical results are demonstrated with signal classiﬁcation tasks, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the standard discriminative methods and the standard sparse representation in the case of corrupted signals. 1</p><p>6 0.46836722 <a title="140-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Using_Combinatorial_Optimization_within_Max-Product_Belief_Propagation.html">201 nips-2006-Using Combinatorial Optimization within Max-Product Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>3 0.14130619 <a title="118-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Branch_and_Bound_for_Semi-Supervised_Support_Vector_Machines.html">48 nips-2006-Branch and Bound for Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: In many modern large-scale learning applications, the amount of unlabeled data far exceeds that of labeled data. A common instance of this problem is the transductive setting where the unlabeled test points are known to the learning algorithm. This paper presents a study of regression problems in that setting. It presents explicit VC-dimension error bounds for transductive regression that hold for all bounded loss functions and coincide with the tight classiﬁcation bounds of Vapnik when applied to classiﬁcation. It also presents a new transductive regression algorithm inspired by our bound that admits a primal and kernelized closedform solution and deals efﬁciently with large amounts of unlabeled data. The algorithm exploits the position of unlabeled points to locally estimate their labels and then uses a global optimization to ensure robust predictions. Our study also includes the results of experiments with several publicly available regression data sets with up to 20,000 unlabeled examples.

<p>Author: Ivor W. Tsang, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning is more powerful than supervised learning by using both labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, the manifold regularization framework, together with kernel methods, leads to the Laplacian SVM (LapSVM) that has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, the LapSVM solution typically involves kernel expansions of all the labeled and unlabeled examples, and is slow on testing. Moreover, existing semi-supervised learning methods, including the LapSVM, can only handle a small number of unlabeled examples. In this paper, we integrate manifold regularization with the core vector machine, which has been used for large-scale supervised and unsupervised learning. By using a sparsiﬁed manifold regularizer and formulating as a center-constrained minimum enclosing ball problem, the proposed method produces sparse solutions with low time and space complexities. Experimental results show that it is much faster than the LapSVM, and can handle a million unlabeled examples on a standard PC; while the LapSVM can only handle several thousand patterns. 1</p><p>6 0.09510535 <a title="118-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Simplifying_Mixture_Models_through_Function_Approximation.html">175 nips-2006-Simplifying Mixture Models through Function Approximation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason M. Samonds, Brian R. Potetz, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of stereopsis, how neurons interact in a network during stereo computation remains unclear. Computational models on stereopsis suggest local competition and long-range cooperation are important for resolving ambiguity during stereo matching. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded from multiple neurons in V1 of awake, behaving macaques while presenting surfaces of different depths rendered in dynamic random dot stereograms. We found that the interaction between pairs of neurons was a function of similarity in receptive fields, as well as of the input stimulus. Neurons coding the same depth experienced common inhibition early in their responses for stimuli presented at their nonpreferred disparities. They experienced mutual facilitation later in their responses for stimulation at their preferred disparity. These findings are consistent with a local competition mechanism that first removes gross mismatches, and a global cooperative mechanism that further refines depth estimates. 1 In trod u ction The human visual system is able to extract three-dimensional (3D) structures in random noise stereograms even when such images evoke no perceptible patterns when viewed monocularly [1]. Bela Julesz proposed that this is accomplished by a stereopsis mechanism that detects correlated shifts in 2D noise patterns between the two eyes. He also suggested that this mechanism likely involves cooperative neural processing early in the visual system. Marr and Poggio formalized the computational constraints for solving stereo matching (Fig. 1a) and devised an algorithm that can discover the underlying 3D structures in a variety of random dot stereogram patterns [2]. Their algorithm was based on two rules: (1) each element or feature is unique (i.e., can be assigned only one disparity) and (2) surfaces of objects are cohesive (i.e., depth changes gradually across space). To describe their algorithm in neurophysiological terms, we can consider neurons in primary visual cortex as simple element or feature detectors. The first rule is implemented by introducing competitive interactions (mutual inhibition) among neurons of different disparity tuning at each location (Fig. 1b, blue solid horizontal or vertical lines), allowing only one disparity to be detected at each location. The second rule is implemented by introducing cooperative interactions (mutual facilitation) among neurons tuned to the same depth (image disparity) across different spatial locations (Fig. 1b, along the red dashed diagonal lines). In other words, a disparity estimate at one location is more likely to be correct if neighboring locations have similar disparity estimates. A dynamic system under such constraints can relax to a stable global disparity map. Here, we present neurophysiological evidence of interactions between disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that is consistent with this general approach. We sampled from a variety of spatially distributed disparity tuned neurons (see electrodes Fig. 1b) while displaying DRDS stimuli defined at various disparities (see stimulus Fig.1b). We then measured the dynamics of interactions by assessing the temporal evolution of correlation in neural responses. a Left Image b Right Image Electrodes Disparity Left Image ?

We simultaneously recorded from 4-8 electrodes providing data from up to 10 neurons in a single recording session (some electrodes recorded from as many as 3 neurons). We collected data from 112 neurons that provided 224 pairs for cross-correlation analysis. For stimuli, we used 12 Hz dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS; 25% density black and white pixels on a mean luminance background) presented in a 3.5-degree aperture. Liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to present random dot patterns to each eye separately. Eleven horizontal disparities between the two eyes, ranging from ±0.9 degrees, were tested. Seventy-four neurons (66%) had significant disparity tuning and 99 pairs (44%) were comprised of neurons that both had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p<0.05). b 5mm Medial - Lateral 100µV 0.2ms 1° Figure 2: (a) Example recording session from five electrodes in V1.

<p>Author: René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefﬁcients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The ﬁnal result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird ﬂoating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefﬁcients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.76902038 <a title="118-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_to_Model_Spatial_Dependency%3A_Semi-Supervised_Discriminative_Random_Fields.html">118 nips-2006-Learning to Model Spatial Dependency: Semi-Supervised Discriminative Random Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-hoon Lee, Shaojun Wang, Feng Jiao, Dale Schuurmans, Russell Greiner</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel, semi-supervised approach to training discriminative random ﬁelds (DRFs) that efﬁciently exploits labeled and unlabeled training data to achieve improved accuracy in a variety of image processing tasks. We formulate DRF training as a form of MAP estimation that combines conditional loglikelihood on labeled data, given a data-dependent prior, with a conditional entropy regularizer deﬁned on unlabeled data. Although the training objective is no longer concave, we develop an efﬁcient local optimization procedure that produces classiﬁers that are more accurate than ones based on standard supervised DRF training. We then apply our semi-supervised approach to train DRFs to segment both synthetic and real data sets, and demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements over supervised DRFs in each case.</p><p>4 0.70237345 <a title="118-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Distributed_Inference_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">69 nips-2006-Distributed Inference in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>5 0.6967963 <a title="118-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Inferring_Network_Structure_from_Co-Occurrences.html">98 nips-2006-Inferring Network Structure from Co-Occurrences</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael G. Rabbat, Mário Figueiredo, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the structure of a network from cooccurrence data: observations that indicate which nodes occur in a signaling pathway but do not directly reveal node order within the pathway. This problem is motivated by network inference problems arising in computational biology and communication systems, in which it is difﬁcult or impossible to obtain precise time ordering information. Without order information, every permutation of the activated nodes leads to a different feasible solution, resulting in combinatorial explosion of the feasible set. However, physical principles underlying most networked systems suggest that not all feasible solutions are equally likely. Intuitively, nodes that co-occur more frequently are probably more closely connected. Building on this intuition, we model path co-occurrences as randomly shufﬂed samples of a random walk on the network. We derive a computationally efﬁcient network inference algorithm and, via novel concentration inequalities for importance sampling estimators, prove that a polynomial complexity Monte Carlo version of the algorithm converges with high probability. 1</p><p>6 0.69448674 <a title="118-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>

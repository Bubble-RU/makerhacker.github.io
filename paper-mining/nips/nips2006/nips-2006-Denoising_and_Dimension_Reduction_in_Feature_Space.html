<p>Author: Robert Jenssen, Torbjørn Eltoft, Mark Girolami, Deniz Erdogmus</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new kernel-based data transformation technique. It is founded on the principle of maximum entropy (MaxEnt) preservation, hence named kernel MaxEnt. The key measure is Renyi’s entropy estimated via Parzen windowing. We show that kernel MaxEnt is based on eigenvectors, and is in that sense similar to kernel PCA, but may produce strikingly different transformed data sets. An enhanced spectral clustering algorithm is proposed, by replacing kernel PCA by kernel MaxEnt as an intermediate step. This has a major impact on performance.</p><p>3 0.22848272 <a title="65-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Generalized_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_and_Unsupervised_Kernel_Learning.html">83 nips-2006-Generalized Maximum Margin Clustering and Unsupervised Kernel Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum margin clustering was proposed lately and has shown promising performance in recent studies [1, 2]. It extends the theory of support vector machine to unsupervised learning. Despite its good performance, there are three major problems with maximum margin clustering that question its eﬃciency for real-world applications. First, it is computationally expensive and diﬃcult to scale to large-scale datasets because the number of parameters in maximum margin clustering is quadratic in the number of examples. Second, it requires data preprocessing to ensure that any clustering boundary will pass through the origins, which makes it unsuitable for clustering unbalanced dataset. Third, it is sensitive to the choice of kernel functions, and requires external procedure to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose “generalized maximum margin clustering” framework that addresses the above three problems simultaneously. The new framework generalizes the maximum margin clustering algorithm by allowing any clustering boundaries including those not passing through the origins. It signiﬁcantly improves the computational eﬃciency by reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the new framework is able to automatically determine the appropriate kernel matrix without any labeled data. Finally, we show a formal connection between maximum margin clustering and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the eﬃciency of the generalized maximum margin clustering algorithm using both synthetic datasets and real datasets from the UCI repository. 1</p><p>4 0.19561258 <a title="65-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Kenji Fukumizu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of kernels for structured objects which is based on the bag-ofcomponents paradigm. However, rather than decomposing each complex object into the single histogram of its components, we use for each object a family of nested histograms, where each histogram in this hierarchy describes the object seen from an increasingly granular perspective. We use this hierarchy of histograms to deﬁne elementary kernels which can detect coarse and ﬁne similarities between the objects. We compute through an efﬁcient averaging trick a mixture of such speciﬁc kernels, to propose a ﬁnal kernel value which weights efﬁciently local and global matches. We propose experimental results on an image retrieval experiment which show that this mixture is an effective template procedure to be used with kernels on histograms.</p><p>5 0.17907593 <a title="65-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Emergence_of_conjunctive_visual_features_by_quadratic_independent_component_analysis.html">76 nips-2006-Emergence of conjunctive visual features by quadratic independent component analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: J.t. Lindgren, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: In previous studies, quadratic modelling of natural images has resulted in cell models that react strongly to edges and bars. Here we apply quadratic Independent Component Analysis to natural image patches, and show that up to a small approximation error, the estimated components are computing conjunctions of two linear features. These conjunctive features appear to represent not only edges and bars, but also inherently two-dimensional stimuli, such as corners. In addition, we show that for many of the components, the underlying linear features have essentially V1 simple cell receptive ﬁeld characteristics. Our results indicate that the development of the V2 cells preferring angles and corners may be partly explainable by the principle of unsupervised sparse coding of natural images. 1</p><p>6 0.17525724 <a title="65-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Multi-Task_Feature_Learning.html">138 nips-2006-Multi-Task Feature Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Jerónimo Arenas-garcía, Kaare B. Petersen, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are presenting a novel multivariate analysis method. Our scheme is based on a novel kernel orthonormalized partial least squares (PLS) variant for feature extraction, imposing sparsity constrains in the solution to improve scalability. The algorithm is tested on a benchmark of UCI data sets, and on the analysis of integrated short-time music features for genre prediction. The upshot is that the method has strong expressive power even with rather few features, is clearly outperforming the ordinary kernel PLS, and therefore is an appealing method for feature extraction of labelled data. 1</p><p>4 0.77746224 <a title="65-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Gaussian_and_Wishart_Hyperkernels.html">82 nips-2006-Gaussian and Wishart Hyperkernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Risi Kondor, Tony Jebara</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new method for constructing hyperkenels and deﬁne two promising special cases that can be computed in closed form. These we call the Gaussian and Wishart hyperkernels. The former is especially attractive in that it has an interpretable regularization scheme reminiscent of that of the Gaussian RBF kernel. We discuss how kernel learning can be used not just for improving the performance of classiﬁcation and regression methods, but also as a stand-alone algorithm for dimensionality reduction and relational or metric learning. 1</p><p>5 0.71261346 <a title="65-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Iterative_Kernel_PCA.html">79 nips-2006-Fast Iterative Kernel PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicol N. Schraudolph, Simon Günter, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce two methods to improve convergence of the Kernel Hebbian Algorithm (KHA) for iterative kernel PCA. KHA has a scalar gain parameter which is either held constant or decreased as 1/t, leading to slow convergence. Our KHA/et algorithm accelerates KHA by incorporating the reciprocal of the current estimated eigenvalues as a gain vector. We then derive and apply Stochastic MetaDescent (SMD) to KHA/et; this further speeds convergence by performing gain adaptation in RKHS. Experimental results for kernel PCA and spectral clustering of USPS digits as well as motion capture and image de-noising problems conﬁrm that our methods converge substantially faster than conventional KHA. 1</p><p>6 0.6703034 <a title="65-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off ﬁdelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational beneﬁts of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated. 1</p><p>3 0.8799597 <a title="65-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Uncertainty%2C_phase_and_oscillatory_hippocampal_recall.html">197 nips-2006-Uncertainty, phase and oscillatory hippocampal recall</a></p>
<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, population behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the ﬁring phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only ﬁre once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each neuron represents by its ﬁring phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it ﬁres. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system. 1</p><p>4 0.87651342 <a title="65-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Simplifying_Mixture_Models_through_Function_Approximation.html">175 nips-2006-Simplifying Mixture Models through Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Zhang, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Finite mixture model is a powerful tool in many statistical learning problems. In this paper, we propose a general, structure-preserving approach to reduce its model complexity, which can bring signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts in many applications. The basic idea is to group the original mixture components into compact clusters, and then minimize an upper bound on the approximation error between the original and simpliﬁed models. By adopting the L2 norm as the distance measure between mixture models, we can derive closed-form solutions that are more robust and reliable than using the KL-based distance measure. Moreover, the complexity of our algorithm is only linear in the sample size and dimensionality. Experiments on density estimation and clustering-based image segmentation demonstrate its outstanding performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.87570655 <a title="65-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-MLLE%3A_Modified_Locally_Linear_Embedding_Using_Multiple_Weights.html">127 nips-2006-MLLE: Modified Locally Linear Embedding Using Multiple Weights</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhenyue Zhang, Jing Wang</p><p>Abstract: The locally linear embedding (LLE) is improved by introducing multiple linearly independent local weight vectors for each neighborhood. We characterize the reconstruction weights and show the existence of the linearly independent weight vectors at each neighborhood. The modiﬁed locally linear embedding (MLLE) proposed in this paper is much stable. It can retrieve the ideal embedding if MLLE is applied on data points sampled from an isometric manifold. MLLE is also compared with the local tangent space alignment (LTSA). Numerical examples are given that show the improvement and efﬁciency of MLLE. 1</p><p>6 0.87392634 <a title="65-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>

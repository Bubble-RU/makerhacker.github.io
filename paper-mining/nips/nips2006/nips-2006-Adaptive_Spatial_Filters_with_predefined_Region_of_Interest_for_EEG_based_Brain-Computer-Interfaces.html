</p><p>8 While a variety of mental states can be used to induce pattern changes in the EEG, most BCIs utilize motor imagery of different limbs for this purpose. [sent-16, score-0.682]
</p><p>9 This is based on the observation that movement preparation of a certain limb leads to a power decrease (event related desynchronization - ERD) in the µ- (∼ 8 − 12 Hz) and β-spectrum (∼ 18 − 26 Hz) over the area of the contralateral motor cortex representing the speciﬁc limb [2]. [sent-17, score-0.579]
</p><p>10 This ERD can also be observed in motor imagery, which was ﬁrst used in [3] to discriminate imaginary movements of the left vs. [sent-18, score-0.584]

</p><p>13 For BCIs based on EEG, the feature extraction is aggravated by the fact that due to volume conduction only the superimposed electric activity of a large area of cortex can be measured at every electrode. [sent-26, score-0.578]
</p><p>14 While it is known that the ERD caused by motor imagery originates in the motor cortex [4], the EEG measured on the scalp over the motor cortex includes electrical activity of multiple neural sources that are not related to the imaginary movements. [sent-27, score-2.008]
</p><p>15 Given two EEG data sets recorded during motor imagery of the left and right hand, the CSP-algorithm ﬁnds two linear transformations that maximize the variance of the one while minimizing the variance of the other data set. [sent-32, score-0.74]
</p><p>16 In the ideal case the spatio-temporal differences are caused only by the motor imagery, in which case the algorithm can be claimed to be optimal. [sent-36, score-0.429]
</p><p>17 For example, if a strong artifact is present in only one of the data sets, the CSP is trained on the artifact and not on the differences caused by motor imagery [7]. [sent-38, score-0.787]
</p><p>18 This is possible, since it is known that the signal of interest for the classiﬁcation of imaginary movements originates in the motor cortex [4]. [sent-41, score-0.748]
</p><p>19 More speciﬁcally, we design an adaptive spatial ﬁlter (ASF) that maximizes the ratio of the variance of the electric ﬁeld originating in a predeﬁned region of interest (ROI) in the cortex and the overall variance of the EEG measurements. [sent-42, score-0.764]
</p><p>20 In this way, we can design spatial ﬁlters that optimally suppress electric activity originating from other areas than the chosen ROI. [sent-43, score-0.632]
</p><p>21 By designing two spatial ﬁlters with the respective ROIs centered in the hand areas of the motor cortex in the left and right hemisphere, we achieve a robust feature extraction that enables better classiﬁcation results than obtained with the CSP-algorithm. [sent-44, score-0.885]
</p><p>22 In the results section, the ASF is applied to EEG data of three subjects, recorded during imaginary movements of the right and left hand. [sent-47, score-0.276]
</p><p>23 1  The Common Spatial Patterns Algorithm  Given two EEG data sets x1 ∈ RN ×T and x2 ∈ RN ×T with N the number of electrodes and T the number of samples, the CSP-algorithm ﬁnds a linear transformation w that maximizes the variance of the one while minimizing the variance of the other data set. [sent-54, score-0.294]
</p><p>24 This can be formulated as the following optimization problem [8]: max w  w T R1 w w T R2 w  (1)  with R1 and R2 the spatial covariance matrices of x1 and x2 . [sent-55, score-0.149]
</p><p>25 This optimization problem is in the form of the well known Rayleigh quotient, which means that the solution to (1) is given by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem R1 w = λR2 w. [sent-56, score-0.17]
</p><p>26 (2)  The two eigenvectors w1 and w2 with the largest and smallest respective eigenvalue represent two spatial ﬁlters that maximize the variance of the one while minimizing the variance of the other data set. [sent-57, score-0.288]
</p><p>27 In practice, however, the differences between two datasets will have multiple causes such as spontaneous EEG activity, mental states unrelated to the motor imagery or muscular artifacts. [sent-59, score-0.683]
</p><p>28 If the CSP-algorithm is applied to such data, the linear transformations w1/2 will be trained to extract the artifactual components of the EEG and not the spatial-temporal pattern changes caused by the motor imagery. [sent-60, score-0.493]
</p><p>29 In the case of motor imagery, the speciﬁc a-priori information is that the signal of interest for classiﬁcation originates in the motor cortex. [sent-63, score-0.79]
</p><p>30 We will now show how the component of the EEG originating in a certain ROI, chosen to correspond to the motor cortex for our purpose, can be estimated in an optimal manner. [sent-64, score-0.69]
</p><p>31 In general, it would be desirable to derive a spatial ﬁlter that eliminates all electric activity that does not originate in a chosen ROI. [sent-65, score-0.375]
</p><p>32 In EEG recordings, electric activity originating from an inﬁnite dimensional space (the continuous current distribution within the brain) is mapped onto a ﬁnite number of measurement electrodes. [sent-69, score-0.461]
</p><p>33 Hence, the best one can do is to ﬁnd a spatial ﬁlter that in some sense optimally suppresses all activity not originating in the chosen ROI. [sent-70, score-0.373]
</p><p>34 Towards this goal, note that the electric ﬁeld generated by the brain at a position r outside the head is given by (c. [sent-71, score-0.275]
</p><p>35 In EEG recordings, the electric ﬁeld of the brain is spatially sampled at i = 1 . [sent-75, score-0.222]
</p><p>36 N electrodes on the scalp with position r i , resulting in a measurement vector x(t) with the elements L(r i , r ′ )T P (r ′ , t)dV (r ′ ), i = 1 . [sent-78, score-0.266]
</p><p>37 xi (t) =  (4)  V  We now wish to ﬁnd a linear transformation of the measured EEG y(t) = wT x(t)  (5)  that maximizes the ratio of the variance of the electric ﬁeld originating in a certain area of the cortex and the overall variance. [sent-82, score-0.624]
</p><p>38 For this we deﬁne the component of the EEG originating in a certain ROI ˜ as x(t), with the elements L(r i , r ′ )T P (r ′ , t)dV (r ′ ), i = 1 . [sent-83, score-0.187]
</p><p>39 xi (t) = ˜  (6)  ROI  The spatial ﬁlter w is then found by max {f (w)} with f (w) = w  ˜ x wT x(t)˜ (t)T w wT Rx (t)w ˜ = T T x(t)x(t)T w w w Rx (t)w  (7)  ˜ and Rx (t) and Rx (t) the (spatial) covariance matrices of x(t) and x(t). [sent-87, score-0.149]
</p><p>40 As for (1), the solution to (7) is given by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem Rx (t)w = λRx (t)w. [sent-89, score-0.17]
</p><p>41 ˜  (8)  The crucial difference between the CSP- and the ASF-algorithm is that for the CSP-algorithm the covariance matrix R1 in the numerator of (1), describing the signal subspace of the data, is given by the measured EEG of one condition. [sent-90, score-0.106]
</p><p>42 For the ASF-algorithm, the corresponding covariance matrix Rx (t) is replaced by a-priori knowledge independent of the measured EEG. [sent-91, score-0.106]
</p><p>43 The covariance matrix of the EEG originating in the ROI however is substantially harder to estimate. [sent-96, score-0.235]
</p><p>44 , each column li of the leadﬁeld matrix L is found by placing a single current dipole with unit dipole moment at position ri in a four shell spherical head model, and calculating its projection to each of the N electrodes [11]. [sent-110, score-0.468]
</p><p>45 In summary, the adaptive linear spatial ﬁlter w is given by the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue of the generalized eigenvalue problem ˆ LLT w = λRx w. [sent-111, score-0.314]
</p><p>46 It is also important to point out that the covariance matrix of the component of the EEG originating in the ROI is assumed to be the identity matrix, implying that sources in the ROI are not correlated. [sent-116, score-0.265]
</p><p>47 Finally, note that the quality of the obtained ﬁlter also depends on the rank of the covariance matrix of the electric activity originating in the ROI. [sent-119, score-0.509]
</p><p>48 The higher the rank of Rx , the more ˜ degrees of freedom of the spatial ﬁlter are required to pass activity from the signal subspace, i. [sent-120, score-0.186]
</p><p>49 , activity originating in the ROI, and consequently less degrees of freedom are available for suppressing electric activity originating outside the ROI. [sent-122, score-0.733]
</p><p>50 The quality of the spatial ﬁlter thus decreases with the rank of Rx . [sent-123, score-0.101]
</p><p>51 For this reason, it is beneﬁcial to only consider radially oriented dipole sources in the ˜ ROI, which leads to a covariance matrix with a lower rank than if dipole moments in x, y, and z direction are considered. [sent-124, score-0.32]
</p><p>52 Furthermore, this is a physiologically justiﬁed assumption, since neurons in a cortical column are oriented radially to the surface of the cortex (c. [sent-125, score-0.257]
</p><p>53 3  Results  In this section, we evaluate the effectiveness of the ASF by applying it to EEG data gathered from three subjects during motor imagery of the right and left hand, and compare its performance with the CSP-algorithm. [sent-128, score-0.685]
</p><p>54 Subsequently motor imagery of the left/right hand will be termed condition IL/IR. [sent-129, score-0.642]
</p><p>55 Subjects S1 and S2 had no experience with motor imagery or BCIs, while subject S3 participated in a motor imagery experiment for the second time. [sent-132, score-1.268]
</p><p>56 The subjects were placed in a shielded room approximately two meters in front of a screen, and were asked to continually imagine opening and closing their right/left hand as long as an arrow pointing in the respective direction was displayed on the screen. [sent-133, score-0.267]
</p><p>57 The subjects were explicitly instructed to perform haptic motor imagery, i. [sent-134, score-0.437]
</p><p>58 , to feel how they were opening and closing their hands, to ensure that actual motor imagery and not visual imagery was used. [sent-136, score-0.895]
</p><p>59 Each trial started with a ﬁxation cross, which was superimposed by an arrow either pointing to the right or to the left after three seconds. [sent-137, score-0.099]
</p><p>60 A total of 300 trials were recorded for each subject, consisting of 150 trials for each condition in randomized order. [sent-140, score-0.111]
</p><p>61 The spatial position of each electrode was measured with a tracking system. [sent-143, score-0.257]
</p><p>62 , starting 500 ms after the instruction which motor imagery to perform). [sent-149, score-0.621]
</p><p>63 3  Design of the Adaptive Spatial Filters  To obtain estimates of the electric ﬁeld originating in the hand areas of the left and right motor cortex, two ASFs were designed. [sent-154, score-0.861]
</p><p>64 For the ﬁrst ASF, the ROI was chosen as a sphere located 1 cm inside the cortex radially below electrode C3 (centered above the hand area of the motor cortex of the left hemisphere) with a radius of 1 cm. [sent-155, score-0.897]
</p><p>65 Radially oriented dipoles with unit moment were placed on an equally spaced grid 2 mm apart from each other inside the sphere, and their respective projections to each of the electrodes were calculated as in [11] to obtain an estimate of the leadﬁeld matrix L in (11). [sent-156, score-0.296]
</p><p>66 For this purpose, the measured positions of the electrodes were radially projected onto the outermost sphere of the headmodel. [sent-157, score-0.384]
</p><p>67 The second ASF was designed in the same fashion, but with the center of the sphere located at the same depth as the ﬁrst one radially below electrode C4 (centered above the hand area of the motor cortex of the right hemisphere). [sent-158, score-0.741]
</p><p>68 For each of the 300 trials of each subject, the data covariance matrix of the recorded EEG was estimated according to (9), using EEG data in the same time window as for computation of the CSPS (3. [sent-159, score-0.157]
</p><p>69 The two ASFs with the ROIs centered below electrodes C3 and C4 were then calculated by solving the generalized eigenvalue problem (13), and taking the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue as the ASF. [sent-161, score-0.447]
</p><p>70 The estimated activity inside the ROIs was then obtained by multiplying the ASFs with the observed EEG of that trial according to (5). [sent-162, score-0.121]
</p><p>71 4  Experimental Results  To obtain estimates of the frequency bands suitable for classiﬁcation, event related synchronization and desynchronization (ERS/ERD) was calculated for each subject relative to the pre-stimulus baseline (0 - 3 s) as implemented in [12]. [sent-168, score-0.211]
</p><p>72 This was done independently for the EEG measured at electrodes C3 and C4, the EEG components obtained by the CSP-algorithm and the estimated EEG components originating in the motor cortex as obtained by the ASFs. [sent-169, score-0.955]
</p><p>73 As can be seen in the ﬁrst column, an ERD-difference of about 3 dB can be measured over the contralateral motor cortex at electrodes C3 and C4 in two frequency bands, starting brieﬂy after the instruction to perform the motor imagery. [sent-173, score-1.238]
</p><p>74 The two reactive frequency bands are centered roughly around 12 and 25 Hz, agreeing well with the expected ERD in the µ- and β-band [3]. [sent-174, score-0.187]
</p><p>75 The second CSP (bottom row) on the other hand does not extract the ERD related to motor imagery, but focuses on a strong artifactual component above 15 Hz. [sent-179, score-0.505]
</p><p>76 1 shows the results obtained with the ASFs centered radially below electrodes C3 and C4. [sent-181, score-0.341]
</p><p>77 The observed ERD is similar to the one measured directly at electrodes C3 and C4 (ﬁrst column of Fig. [sent-182, score-0.265]
</p><p>78 While CSP 1 focuses on electrodes in the vicinity of electrode C3, CSP 2 focuses on frontal areas of the recorded EEG that are not related motor control. [sent-186, score-0.756]
</p><p>79 The ASFs on the other hand can be seen to focus on motor areas surrounding electrodes C3 and C4, with various minor patches distributed over the scalp that suppress electric activity originating outside the ROI. [sent-187, score-1.164]
</p><p>80 It is thus evident that the ASFs improve the SNR of the component of the EEG related to motor imagery relative to just measuring the ERD above the motor cortex, while the CSPs fail to extract the ERD related to motor imagery due to artifactual components. [sent-188, score-1.648]
</p><p>81 Similar ERS/ERD results were obtained for subject S2, while only a very weak ERS/ERD could be observed for subject S1 for all three evaluation schemes. [sent-189, score-0.108]
</p><p>82 The ERD plots at electrodes C3 and C4 of each subject were then used to heuristically determine the time window and two reactive frequency bands used for actual classiﬁcation. [sent-190, score-0.425]

</p><p>87 The CSP-algorithm on the other hand leads to worse classiﬁcation results compared to only using the ERS/ERD measured at electrodes C3/C4. [sent-221, score-0.312]
</p><p>88 In agreement with [7], the ERS/ERD as well as the CSP plots for subjects S1 and S2 (not shown here) indicate that this is due to the fact that the CSPs focus on artifactual components that are not related to motor imagery. [sent-223, score-0.526]
</p><p>89 This correlates with the personal report of the subjects, with S2 and S3 reporting that they considered their motor imagery to be successful, while S1 reported difﬁculties in imaging opening and closing his hands. [sent-227, score-0.669]
</p><p>90 We derived an adaptive spatial ﬁlter that maximizes the ratio of the variance of the electric ﬁeld originating in a speciﬁed ROI of cortex and the overall variance of the measured EEG. [sent-229, score-0.799]
</p><p>91 By designing two ASFs with the ROIs centered in the hand areas of the motor cortex, we showed that classiﬁcation accuracy of imaginary movements of the left and right hand increased between 3. [sent-230, score-0.771]
</p><p>92 4 % relative to using the EEG measured directly above motor areas at electrodes C3 and C4. [sent-232, score-0.681]
</p><p>93 In contrast, applying the CSP-algorithm to the same data sets lead to a classiﬁcation accuracy below that of only using recordings from electrodes C3 and C4 for feature extraction for one subject, and a classiﬁcation accuracy that was not above chance for the other two subjects. [sent-234, score-0.334]
</p><p>94 This was due to the lack of robustness of the CSP-algorithm, focusing on artifactual components of the EEG. [sent-235, score-0.113]
</p><p>95 Furthermore, the ROIs were heuristically chosen as spheres located radially below electrodes C3 and C4. [sent-240, score-0.295]

For BCIs employing imaginary movements of different limbs, the method of Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) has been shown to achieve excellent classiﬁcation results.

Since it is known that the component of the EEG used for discriminating imaginary movements originates in the motor cortex, we design two adaptive spatial ﬁlters with the ROIs centered in the hand areas of the left and right motor cortex. We then use these to classify EEG data recorded during imaginary movements of the right and left hand of three subjects, and show that the adaptive spatial ﬁlters outperform the CSP-algorithm, enabling classiﬁcation rates of up to 94.7 % without artifact rejection. 1</p><p>2 0.36102331 <a title="22-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2006-Logistic_Regression_for_Single_Trial_EEG_Classification.html">126 nips-2006-Logistic Regression for Single Trial EEG Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Kazuyuki Aihara, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for the classiﬁcation of single trial ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), based on regularized logistic regression. Framed in this robust statistical framework no prior feature extraction or outlier removal is required. We present two variations of parameterizing the regression function: (a) with a full rank symmetric matrix coeﬃcient and (b) as a diﬀerence of two rank=1 matrices. In the ﬁrst case, the problem is convex and the logistic regression is optimal under a generative model. The latter case is shown to be related to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm, which is a popular technique in Brain Computer Interfacing. The regression coeﬃcients can also be topographically mapped onto the scalp similarly to CSP projections, which allows neuro-physiological interpretation. Simulations on 162 BCI datasets demonstrate that classiﬁcation accuracy and robustness compares favorably against conventional CSP based classiﬁers. 1</p><p>3 0.31891742 <a title="22-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Reducing_Calibration_Time_For_Brain-Computer_Interfaces%3A_A_Clustering_Approach.html">168 nips-2006-Reducing Calibration Time For Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Clustering Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthias Krauledat, Michael Schröder, Benjamin Blankertz, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Up to now even subjects that are experts in the use of machine learning based BCI systems still have to undergo a calibration session of about 20-30 min. From this data their (movement) intentions are so far infered. We now propose a new paradigm that allows to completely omit such calibration and instead transfer knowledge from prior sessions. To achieve this goal we ﬁrst deﬁne normalized CSP features and distances in-between. Second, we derive prototypical features across sessions: (a) by clustering or (b) by feature concatenation methods. Finally, we construct a classiﬁer based on these individualized prototypes and show that, indeed, classiﬁers can be successfully transferred to a new session for a number of subjects.</p><p>4 0.26328042 <a title="22-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Aggregating_Classification_Accuracy_across_Time%3A_Application_to_Single_Trial_EEG.html">24 nips-2006-Aggregating Classification Accuracy across Time: Application to Single Trial EEG</a></p>
<p>Author: Steven Lemm, Christin Schäfer, Gabriel Curio</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for binary on-line classiﬁcation of triggered but temporally blurred events that are embedded in noisy time series in the context of on-line discrimination between left and right imaginary hand-movement. In particular the goal of the binary classiﬁcation problem is to obtain the decision, as fast and as reliably as possible from the recorded EEG single trials. To provide a probabilistic decision at every time-point t the presented method gathers information from two distinct sequences of features across time. In order to incorporate decisions from prior time-points we suggest an appropriate weighting scheme, that emphasizes time instances, providing a higher discriminatory power between the instantaneous class distributions of each feature, where the discriminatory power is quantiﬁed in terms of the Bayes error of misclassiﬁcation. The eﬀectiveness of this procedure is veriﬁed by its successful application in the 3rd BCI competition. Disclosure of the data after the competition revealed this approach to be superior with single trial error rates as low as 10.7, 11.5 and 16.7% for the three diﬀerent subjects under study. 1</p><p>5 0.17793776 <a title="22-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Nonlinear_physically-based_models_for_decoding_motor-cortical_population_activity.html">148 nips-2006-Nonlinear physically-based models for decoding motor-cortical population activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregory Shakhnarovich, Sung-phil Kim, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Neural motor prostheses (NMPs) require the accurate decoding of motor cortical population activity for the control of an artiﬁcial motor system. Previous work on cortical decoding for NMPs has focused on the recovery of hand kinematics. Human NMPs however may require the control of computer cursors or robotic devices with very different physical and dynamical properties. Here we show that the ﬁring rates of cells in the primary motor cortex of non-human primates can be used to control the parameters of an artiﬁcial physical system exhibiting realistic dynamics. The model represents 2D hand motion in terms of a point mass connected to a system of idealized springs. The nonlinear spring coefﬁcients are estimated from the ﬁring rates of neurons in the motor cortex. We evaluate linear and a nonlinear decoding algorithms using neural recordings from two monkeys performing two different tasks. We found that the decoded spring coefﬁcients produced accurate hand trajectories compared with state-of-the-art methods for direct decoding of hand kinematics. Furthermore, using a physically-based system produced decoded movements that were more “natural” in that their frequency spectrum more closely matched that of natural hand movements. 1</p><p>6 0.10786258 <a title="22-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_Integrating_Source_Localization_and_Noise_Suppression_of_MEG_and_EEG_data.html">12 nips-2006-A Probabilistic Algorithm Integrating Source Localization and Noise Suppression of MEG and EEG data</a></p>

<p>Author: Yonatan Amit, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe and analyze an algorithmic framework for online classiﬁcation where each online trial consists of multiple prediction tasks that are tied together. We tackle the problem of updating the online hypothesis by deﬁning a projection problem in which each prediction task corresponds to a single linear constraint. These constraints are tied together through a single slack parameter. We then introduce a general method for approximately solving the problem by projecting simultaneously and independently on each constraint which corresponds to a prediction sub-problem, and then averaging the individual solutions. We show that this approach constitutes a feasible, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution for the original projection problem. We derive concrete simultaneous projection schemes and analyze them in the mistake bound model. We demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm in experiments with online multiclass text categorization. Our experiments indicate that a combination of class-dependent features with the simultaneous projection method outperforms previously studied algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.41061023 <a title="22-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Reducing_Calibration_Time_For_Brain-Computer_Interfaces%3A_A_Clustering_Approach.html">168 nips-2006-Reducing Calibration Time For Brain-Computer Interfaces: A Clustering Approach</a></p>

We present two variations of parameterizing the regression function: (a) with a full rank symmetric matrix coeﬃcient and (b) as a diﬀerence of two rank=1 matrices. In the ﬁrst case, the problem is convex and the logistic regression is optimal under a generative model. The latter case is shown to be related to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm, which is a popular technique in Brain Computer Interfacing. The regression coeﬃcients can also be topographically mapped onto the scalp similarly to CSP projections, which allows neuro-physiological interpretation. Simulations on 162 BCI datasets demonstrate that classiﬁcation accuracy and robustness compares favorably against conventional CSP based classiﬁers. 1</p><p>5 0.38236254 <a title="22-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Aggregating_Classification_Accuracy_across_Time%3A_Application_to_Single_Trial_EEG.html">24 nips-2006-Aggregating Classification Accuracy across Time: Application to Single Trial EEG</a></p>
<p>Author: Steven Lemm, Christin Schäfer, Gabriel Curio</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for binary on-line classiﬁcation of triggered but temporally blurred events that are embedded in noisy time series in the context of on-line discrimination between left and right imaginary hand-movement. In particular the goal of the binary classiﬁcation problem is to obtain the decision, as fast and as reliably as possible from the recorded EEG single trials. To provide a probabilistic decision at every time-point t the presented method gathers information from two distinct sequences of features across time. In order to incorporate decisions from prior time-points we suggest an appropriate weighting scheme, that emphasizes time instances, providing a higher discriminatory power between the instantaneous class distributions of each feature, where the discriminatory power is quantiﬁed in terms of the Bayes error of misclassiﬁcation. The eﬀectiveness of this procedure is veriﬁed by its successful application in the 3rd BCI competition. Disclosure of the data after the competition revealed this approach to be superior with single trial error rates as low as 10.7, 11.5 and 16.7% for the three diﬀerent subjects under study. 1</p><p>6 0.34051609 <a title="22-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Graph_Laplacian_Regularization_for_Large-Scale_Semidefinite_Programming.html">87 nips-2006-Graph Laplacian Regularization for Large-Scale Semidefinite Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Olivier Chapelle, Vikas Sindhwani, S. S. Keerthi</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised SVMs (S3 VM) attempt to learn low-density separators by maximizing the margin over labeled and unlabeled examples. The associated optimization problem is non-convex. To examine the full potential of S3 VMs modulo local minima problems in current implementations, we apply branch and bound techniques for obtaining exact, globally optimal solutions. Empirical evidence suggests that the globally optimal solution can return excellent generalization performance in situations where other implementations fail completely. While our current implementation is only applicable to small datasets, we discuss variants that can potentially lead to practically useful algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.13197218 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Boosting_Structured_Prediction_for_Imitation_Learning.html">47 nips-2006-Boosting Structured Prediction for Imitation Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, Joel Chestnutt, David M. Bradley, Nathan D. Ratliff</p><p>Abstract: The Maximum Margin Planning (MMP) (Ratliff et al., 2006) algorithm solves imitation learning problems by learning linear mappings from features to cost functions in a planning domain. The learned policy is the result of minimum-cost planning using these cost functions. These mappings are chosen so that example policies (or trajectories) given by a teacher appear to be lower cost (with a lossscaled margin) than any other policy for a given planning domain. We provide a novel approach, M MP B OOST , based on the functional gradient descent view of boosting (Mason et al., 1999; Friedman, 1999a) that extends MMP by “boosting” in new features. This approach uses simple binary classiﬁcation or regression to improve performance of MMP imitation learning, and naturally extends to the class of structured maximum margin prediction problems. (Taskar et al., 2005) Our technique is applied to navigation and planning problems for outdoor mobile robots and robotic legged locomotion. 1</p><p>4 0.12885368 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-AdaBoost_is_Consistent.html">21 nips-2006-AdaBoost is Consistent</a></p>

<p>Author: Murat Dundar, Balaji Krishnapuram, R. B. Rao, Glenn M. Fung</p><p>Abstract: Many computer aided diagnosis (CAD) problems can be best modelled as a multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem with unbalanced data: i.e. , the training data typically consists of a few positive bags, and a very large number of negative instances. Existing MIL algorithms are much too computationally expensive for these datasets. We describe CH, a framework for learning a Convex Hull representation of multiple instances that is signiﬁcantly faster than existing MIL algorithms. Our CH framework applies to any standard hyperplane-based learning algorithm, and for some algorithms, is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimal solution. Experimental studies on two different CAD applications further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm signiﬁcantly improves diagnostic accuracy when compared to both MIL and traditional classiﬁers. Although not designed for standard MIL problems (which have both positive and negative bags and relatively balanced datasets), comparisons against other MIL methods on benchmark problems also indicate that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.053957161 <a title="136-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-On_Transductive_Regression.html">150 nips-2006-On Transductive Regression</a></p>

<p>Author: Stefan Klampfl, Wolfgang Maass, Robert A. Legenstein</p><p>Abstract: The extraction of statistically independent components from high-dimensional multi-sensory input streams is assumed to be an essential component of sensory processing in the brain. Such independent component analysis (or blind source separation) could provide a less redundant representation of information about the external world. Another powerful processing strategy is to extract preferentially those components from high-dimensional input streams that are related to other information sources, such as internal predictions or proprioceptive feedback. This strategy allows the optimization of internal representation according to the information bottleneck method. However, concrete learning rules that implement these general unsupervised learning principles for spiking neurons are still missing. We show how both information bottleneck optimization and the extraction of independent components can in principle be implemented with stochastically spiking neurons with refractoriness. The new learning rule that achieves this is derived from abstract information optimization principles. 1</p><p>3 0.4628545 <a title="136-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Tighter_PAC-Bayes_Bounds.html">193 nips-2006-Tighter PAC-Bayes Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Amiran Ambroladze, Emilio Parrado-hernández, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a PAC-Bayes bound to measure the performance of Support Vector Machine (SVM) classiﬁers. The bound is based on learning a prior over the distribution of classiﬁers with a part of the training samples. Experimental work shows that this bound is tighter than the original PAC-Bayes, resulting in an enhancement of the predictive capabilities of the PAC-Bayes bound. In addition, it is shown that the use of this bound as a means to estimate the hyperparameters of the classiﬁer compares favourably with cross validation in terms of accuracy of the model, while saving a lot of computational burden. 1</p><p>4 0.34692499 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Simplifying_Mixture_Models_through_Function_Approximation.html">175 nips-2006-Simplifying Mixture Models through Function Approximation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Zhang, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Finite mixture model is a powerful tool in many statistical learning problems. In this paper, we propose a general, structure-preserving approach to reduce its model complexity, which can bring signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts in many applications. The basic idea is to group the original mixture components into compact clusters, and then minimize an upper bound on the approximation error between the original and simpliﬁed models. By adopting the L2 norm as the distance measure between mixture models, we can derive closed-form solutions that are more robust and reliable than using the KL-based distance measure. Moreover, the complexity of our algorithm is only linear in the sample size and dimensionality. Experiments on density estimation and clustering-based image segmentation demonstrate its outstanding performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.34508765 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Motion_Style_Synthesis_from_Perceptual_Observations.html">111 nips-2006-Learning Motion Style Synthesis from Perceptual Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Peggy Hackney, Christoph Bregler</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for synthesis of human motion in speciﬁed styles. We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>6 0.3436397 <a title="136-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Theory_and_Dynamics_of_Perceptual_Bistability.html">192 nips-2006-Theory and Dynamics of Perceptual Bistability</a></p>

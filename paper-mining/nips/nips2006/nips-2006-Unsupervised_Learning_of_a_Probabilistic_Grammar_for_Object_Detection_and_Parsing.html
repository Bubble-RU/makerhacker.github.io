<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Yoram Singer, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce and experiment with a framework for learning local perceptual distance functions for visual recognition. We learn a distance function for each training image as a combination of elementary distances between patch-based visual features. We apply these combined local distance functions to the tasks of image retrieval and classiﬁcation of novel images. On the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark, we achieve 60.3% mean recognition across classes using 15 training images per class, which is better than the best published performance by Zhang, et al. 1</p><p>3 0.26157716 <a title="199-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Adaptor_Grammars%3A_A_Framework_for_Specifying_Compositional_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Models.html">23 nips-2006-Adaptor Grammars: A Framework for Specifying Compositional Nonparametric Bayesian Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>4 0.18390298 <a title="199-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Scalable_Discriminative_Learning_for_Natural_Language_Parsing_and_Translation.html">172 nips-2006-Scalable Discriminative Learning for Natural Language Parsing and Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Joseph Turian, Benjamin Wellington, I. D. Melamed</p><p>Abstract: Parsing and translating natural languages can be viewed as problems of predicting tree structures. For machine learning approaches to these predictions, the diversity and high dimensionality of the structures involved mandate very large training sets. This paper presents a purely discriminative learning method that scales up well to problems of this size. Its accuracy was at least as good as other comparable methods on a standard parsing task. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst purely discriminative learning algorithm for translation with treestructured models. Unlike other popular methods, this method does not require a great deal of feature engineering a priori, because it performs feature selection over a compound feature space as it learns.

<p>Author: Deva Ramanan</p><p>Abstract: We consider the machine vision task of pose estimation from static images, specifically for the case of articulated objects. This problem is hard because of the large number of degrees of freedom to be estimated. Following a established line of research, pose estimation is framed as inference in a probabilistic model. In our experience however, the success of many approaches often lie in the power of the features. Our primary contribution is a novel casting of visual inference as an iterative parsing process, where one sequentially learns better and better features tuned to a particular image. We show quantitative results for human pose estimation on a database of over 300 images that suggest our algorithm is competitive with or surpasses the state-of-the-art. Since our procedure is quite general (it does not rely on face or skin detection), we also use it to estimate the poses of horses in the Weizmann database. 1</p><p>6 0.14307283 <a title="199-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Structure_Learning_of_Markov_Networks_using_%24L_1%24-Regularization.html">74 nips-2006-Efficient Structure Learning of Markov Networks using $L 1$-Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp, Zhao Xu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) framework, stochastic relational models (SRM), for learning social, physical, and other relational phenomena where interactions between entities are observed. The key idea is to model the stochastic structure of entity relationships (i.e., links) via a tensor interaction of multiple GPs, each deﬁned on one type of entities. These models in fact deﬁne a set of nonparametric priors on inﬁnite dimensional tensor matrices, where each element represents a relationship between a tuple of entities. By maximizing the marginalized likelihood, information is exchanged between the participating GPs through the entire relational network, so that the dependency structure of links is messaged to the dependency of entities, reﬂected by the adapted GP kernels. The framework offers a discriminative approach to link prediction, namely, predicting the existences, strengths, or types of relationships based on the partially observed linkage network as well as the attributes of entities (if given). We discuss properties and variants of SRM and derive an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Very encouraging experimental results are achieved on a toy problem and a user-movie preference link prediction task. In the end we discuss extensions of SRM to general relational learning tasks. 1</p><p>2 0.78856468 <a title="199-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-TrueSkill%E2%84%A2%3A_A_Bayesian_Skill_Rating_System.html">196 nips-2006-TrueSkill™: A Bayesian Skill Rating System</a></p>

<p>Author: David B. Grimes, Daniel R. Rashid, Rajesh P. Rao</p><p>Abstract: Learning by imitation represents an important mechanism for rapid acquisition of new behaviors in humans and robots. A critical requirement for learning by imitation is the ability to handle uncertainty arising from the observation process as well as the imitator’s own dynamics and interactions with the environment. In this paper, we present a new probabilistic method for inferring imitative actions that takes into account both the observations of the teacher as well as the imitator’s dynamics. Our key contribution is a nonparametric learning method which generalizes to systems with very different dynamics. Rather than relying on a known forward model of the dynamics, our approach learns a nonparametric forward model via exploration. Leveraging advances in approximate inference in graphical models, we show how the learned forward model can be directly used to plan an imitating sequence. We provide experimental results for two systems: a biomechanical model of the human arm and a 25-degrees-of-freedom humanoid robot. We demonstrate that the proposed method can be used to learn appropriate motor inputs to the model arm which imitates the desired movements. A second set of results demonstrates dynamically stable full-body imitation of a human teacher by the humanoid robot. 1</p><p>5 0.64989322 <a title="199-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Theory_and_Dynamics_of_Perceptual_Bistability.html">192 nips-2006-Theory and Dynamics of Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>6 0.64921188 <a title="199-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Discriminative_Visual_Codebooks_using_Randomized_Clustering_Forests.html">78 nips-2006-Fast Discriminative Visual Codebooks using Randomized Clustering Forests</a></p>

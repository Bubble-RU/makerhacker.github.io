</p><p>3 We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. [sent-8, score-0.848]
</p><p>4 For example, in probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), structures are built up by applying a sequence of context-free rewrite rules, where each rule in the sequence is selected independently at random. [sent-11, score-0.24]
</p><p>5 In this paper, we introduce a class of probabilistic models that weaken the independence assumptions made in PCFGs, which we call adaptor grammars. [sent-12, score-0.843]
</p><p>6 Adaptor grammars insert additional stochastic processes called adaptors into the procedure for generating structures, allowing the expansion of a symbol to depend on the way in which that symbol has been rewritten in the past. [sent-13, score-0.502]
</p><p>7 Adaptor grammars provide a simple framework for deﬁning nonparametric Bayesian models of language. [sent-15, score-0.245]
</p><p>8 With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process [1, 2, 3], simple context-free grammars specify distributions commonly used in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, such as Dirichlet processes [4] and hierarchical Dirichlet processes [5]. [sent-16, score-0.346]
</p><p>9 As a consequence, many nonparametric Bayesian models that have been used in computational linguistics, such as models of morphology [6] and word segmentation [7], can be expressed as adaptor grammars. [sent-17, score-1.044]
</p><p>10 We introduce a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, which makes it easy to deﬁne nonparametric Bayesian models that generate different linguistic structures and perform inference in those models. [sent-18, score-0.888]
</p><p>11 Section 3 deﬁnes adaptor grammars, while Section 4 presents some examples. [sent-21, score-0.805]
</p><p>12 Section 5 describes the Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm we have developed to sample from the posterior  distribution over structures generated by an adaptor grammar. [sent-22, score-0.866]
</p><p>13 2  Background  In this section, we introduce the two technical ideas that are combined in the adaptor grammars discussed here: probabilistic context-free grammars, and the Pitman-Yor process. [sent-27, score-1.026]
</p><p>14 We adopt a nonstandard formulation of PCFGs in order to emphasize that they are a kind of recursive mixture, and to establish the formal devices we use to specify adaptor grammars. [sent-28, score-0.805]
</p><p>15 If A is a terminal symbol then TA is the singleton set consisting of a unit tree (i. [sent-32, score-0.133]
</p><p>16 The set of trees generated by the CFG is TS , and the language generated by the CFG is the set {Y IELD(t) : t ∈ TS } of terminal strings or yields of the trees TS . [sent-45, score-0.267]
</p><p>17 A probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) is a quintuple (N, W, R, S, θ), where (N, W, R, S) is a CFG and θ is a vector of non-negative real numbers indexed by productions R such that θA→β  =  1. [sent-46, score-0.366]
</p><p>18 θ is used to deﬁne a distribution GA over the trees TA for each symbol A. [sent-48, score-0.133]
</p><p>19 , Gn ) is a distribution over trees where the root node is labeled A and each subtree ti is generated independently from Gi ; it is this assumption that adaptor grammars relax. [sent-75, score-1.142]
</p><p>20 The distribution over trees generated by the PCFG is GS , and the probability of a string is the sum of the probabilities of all trees with that string as their yields. [sent-76, score-0.226]
</p><p>21 When a = 0, the distribution on the yi is that induced by the Dirichlet process [4], a stochastic process that is commonly used in nonparametric Bayesian statistics, with concentration parameter b and base distribution G. [sent-107, score-0.133]
</p><p>22 Let H be a discrete distribution produced by generating a set of atoms x from G and weights on those atoms from the two-parameter Poisson-Dirichlet distribution [2]. [sent-109, score-0.156]
</p><p>23 3  Adaptor grammars  In this section, we use the ideas introduced in the previous section to give a formal deﬁnition of adaptor grammars. [sent-112, score-1.007]
</p><p>24 We ﬁrst state this deﬁnition in full generality, allowing any choice of adaptor, and then consider the case where the adaptor is based on the Pitman-Yor process in more detail. [sent-113, score-0.831]
</p><p>25 1  A general deﬁnition of adaptor grammars  Adaptor grammars extend PCFGs by inserting an additional component called an adaptor into the PCFG recursion (Equation 1). [sent-115, score-2.014]
</p><p>26 An adaptor C is a function from a distribution G to a distribution over distributions with the same support as G. [sent-116, score-0.843]
</p><p>27 An adaptor grammar is a sextuple (N, W, R, S, θ, C) where (N, W, R, S, θ) is a PCFG and the adaptor vector C is a vector of (parameters specifying) adaptors indexed by N . [sent-117, score-1.938]
</p><p>28 An adaptor grammar associates each symbol with two distributions GA and HA over TA . [sent-119, score-1.062]
</p><p>29 If A is a terminal symbol then GA and HA are distributions that put all their mass on the unit tree labeled A, while GA and HA for nonterminal symbols are deﬁned as follows:1 GA  =  θA→B1 . [sent-120, score-0.264]
</p><p>30 If the adaptor is the identity function, with HA = GA , the result is just a PCFG. [sent-130, score-0.805]
</p><p>31 In practice, we integrate over HA , to deﬁne a single distribution on trees for any choice of adaptors C. [sent-132, score-0.18]
</p><p>32 1 This deﬁnition allows an adaptor grammar to include self-recursive or mutually recursive CFG productions (e. [sent-133, score-1.128]
</p><p>33 Such recursion complicates inference, so we restrict ourselves to grammars where the adapted nonterminals are not recursive. [sent-136, score-0.239]
</p><p>34 2  Pitman-Yor adaptor grammars  The deﬁnition given above allows the adaptors to be any appropriate process, but our focus in the remainder of the paper will be on the case where the adaptor is based on the Pitman-Yor process. [sent-138, score-1.924]
</p><p>35 The capacity to replace the independent selection of rewrite rules with an exchangeable stochastic process enables adaptor grammars based on the Pitman-Yor process to deﬁne probability distributions over trees that cannot be expressed using PCFGs. [sent-142, score-1.147]
</p><p>36 A Pitman-Yor adaptor grammar (PYAG) is an adaptor grammar where the adaptors C are based on the Pitman-Yor process. [sent-143, score-2.106]
</p><p>37 A Pitman-Yor adaptor CA (GA ) is the distribution obtained by generating a set of atoms from the distribution GA and weights on those atoms from the two-parameter PoissonDirichlet distribution. [sent-144, score-0.941]
</p><p>38 A PYAG has an adaptor CA with parameters aA and bA for each non-terminal A ∈ N . [sent-145, score-0.805]
</p><p>39 Each adaptor CA will also be associated with two vectors, xA and nA , that are needed to compute the probability distribution over trees. [sent-147, score-0.824]
</p><p>40 The adaptor state can thus be summarized as CA = (aA , bA , xA , nA ). [sent-151, score-0.805]
</p><p>41 A Pitman-Yor adaptor grammar analysis u = (t, ℓ) is a pair consisting of a parse tree t ∈ TS together with an index function ℓ(·). [sent-152, score-1.042]
</p><p>42 4  Examples of Pitman-Yor adaptor grammars  Pitman-Yor adaptor grammars provide a framework in which it is easy to deﬁne compositional nonparametric Bayesian models. [sent-162, score-2.081]
</p><p>43 The use of adaptors based on the Pitman-Yor process allows us to specify grammars that correspond to Dirichlet processes [4] and hierarchical Dirichlet processes [5]. [sent-163, score-0.415]
</p><p>44 In this section, we illustrate how existing nonparametric Bayesian models used for word segmentation [7] and morphological analysis [6] can be expressed as adaptor grammars, and describe the results of applying our inference algorithm in these models. [sent-165, score-1.109]
</p><p>45 1  Dirichlet processes and word segmentation  Adaptor grammars can be used to deﬁne Dirichlet processes with discrete base distributions. [sent-168, score-0.45]
</p><p>46 It is straightforward to write down an adaptor grammar that deﬁnes a Dirichlet process over all strings: Word Chars Chars  → → →  Chars Char Chars Char  (5)  The productions expanding Char to all possible characters are omitted to save space. [sent-169, score-1.154]
</p><p>47 The parameters aChar and aChars are set to 1, so the adaptors for Char and Chars are the identity function and HChars = GChars is the distribution over words produced by sampling each character independently (i. [sent-171, score-0.182]
</p><p>48 Finally, aWord is set to 0, so the adaptor for Word is a Dirichlet process with concentration parameter bWord . [sent-174, score-0.831]
</p><p>49 This grammar generates all possible strings of characters and assigns them simple right-branching structures of no particular interest, but the Word adaptor changes their distribution to one that reﬂects the frequencies of previously generated words. [sent-175, score-1.155]
</p><p>50 , xWord is empty), so the ﬁrst word s1 generated by the grammar is distributed according to GChars . [sent-178, score-0.38]
</p><p>51 However, the second word can be generated in two ways: either it is retrieved from the adaptor’s cache (and  hence is s1 ) with probability 1/(1 + bWord ), or else with probability bWord /(1 + bWord ) it is a new word generated by GChars . [sent-179, score-0.401]
</p><p>52 After n words have been emitted, Word puts mass n/(n + bWord ) on those words and reserves mass bWord /(n + bWord ) for new words (i. [sent-180, score-0.15]
</p><p>53 We can extend this grammar to a simple unigram word segmentation model by adding the following productions, changing the start label to Words and setting aWords = 1. [sent-183, score-0.388]
</p><p>54 Words Words  → →  Word Word Words  This grammar generates sequences of Word subtrees, so it implicitly segments strings of terminals into a sequence of words, and in fact implements the word segmentation model of [7]. [sent-184, score-0.485]
</p><p>55 We applied the grammar above with the algorithm described in Section 5 to a corpus of unsegmented child-directed speech [8]. [sent-185, score-0.192]
</p><p>56 2  Hierarchical Dirichlet processes and morphological analysis  An adaptor grammar with more than one adapted nonterminal can implement a hierarchical Dirichlet process. [sent-193, score-1.184]
</p><p>57 A slightly more elaborate grammar can implement the morphological analysis described in [6]. [sent-197, score-0.257]
</p><p>58 Words are analysed into stem and sufﬁx substrings; e. [sent-198, score-0.158]
</p><p>59 , the word jumping is analysed as a stem jump and a sufﬁx ing. [sent-200, score-0.345]
</p><p>60 That paper used a Pitman-Yor process to effectively dampen this frequency variation, and the adaptor grammar described here does exactly the same thing. [sent-202, score-1.023]
</p><p>61 The productions of the adaptor grammar are as follows, where Chars is “monkeys at typewriters” once again: Word Word Stem Suﬃx  → → → →  Stem Suﬃx Stem Chars Chars  We now give an informal description of how samples might be generated by this grammar. [sent-203, score-1.151]
</p><p>62 Figure 1 depicts a possible state of the adaptors in this adaptor grammar after generating the three words walking, jumping and walked. [sent-206, score-1.194]
</p><p>63 Before any strings are generated all of the adaptors are empty. [sent-208, score-0.212]
</p><p>64 To generate the ﬁrst word we must sample from HWord , as there are no entries in the Word adaptor. [sent-209, score-0.165]
</p><p>65 Supposing that these return walk and ing as Stem and Suﬃx strings respectively, the adaptor entries after generating the ﬁrst word walking consist of the ﬁrst entries for Word, Stem and Suﬃx. [sent-211, score-1.1]
</p><p>66 In order to generate another Word we ﬁrst decide whether to select an existing word from the adaptor, or whether to generate the word using GWord . [sent-212, score-0.33]
</p><p>67 Suppose we choose to generate the new stem jump from GStem (resulting in the second entry in the Stem adaptor) but choose to reuse the existing Suﬃx adaptor entry, resulting in the word jumping. [sent-215, score-1.126]
</p><p>68 The third word walked is generated in a similar fashion: this time the stem is the ﬁrst entry in the Stem adaptor, but the sufﬁx ed is generated from GSuﬃx and becomes the second entry in the Suﬃx adaptor. [sent-216, score-0.385]
</p><p>69 Word  Word:  Stem  Word  Suffix  Stem  w a l k i n g  Word  Suffix  Stem  j u m p i n g  Stem  j u m p  Suffix  Suffix  i n g  w a l k e d  Stem  w a l k  Suffix  e d  Stem:  Suffix:  Figure 1: A depiction of a possible state of the Pitman-Yor adaptors in the adaptor grammar of Section 4. [sent-217, score-1.109]
</p><p>70 This can be expressed using an adaptor grammar with productions that instantiate the following schema: Word Wordc Wordc  → → →  Wordc Stemc Suﬃxc Stemc  Stemc Suﬃxc  → →  Chars Chars  Here c ranges over the hidden morphological classes, and the productions expanding Chars and Char are as before. [sent-223, score-1.324]
</p><p>71 We set the adaptor parameter aWord = 1 for the start nonterminal symbol Word, so we adapt the Wordc , Stemc and Suﬃxc nonterminals for each hidden class c. [sent-224, score-0.98]
</p><p>72 Following [6], we used this grammar with six hidden classes c to segment 170,015 orthographic verb tokens from the Penn Wall Street Journal corpus, and set a = 0 and b = 500 for the adapted nonterminals. [sent-225, score-0.235]
</p><p>73 , we evaluated skipping but ignored wrote, since its stem write is not a preﬁx). [sent-228, score-0.157]
</p><p>74 , eased was analysed as a stem eas followed by a sufﬁx ed, permitting the grammar to also generate easing as eas plus ing. [sent-232, score-0.35]
</p><p>75 5  Bayesian inference for Pitman-Yor adaptor grammars  The results presented in the previous section were obtained by using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to sample from the posterior distribution over PYAG analyses u = (u1 , . [sent-233, score-1.091]
</p><p>76 , sn ), where si ∈ W ⋆ and ui is the analysis of si . [sent-239, score-0.144]
</p><p>77 We assume we are given a CFG (N, W, R, S), vectors of Pitman-Yor adaptor parameters a and b, and a Dirichlet prior with hyperparameters α over production probabilities θ, i. [sent-240, score-0.853]
</p><p>78 Informally, the ﬁrst term in (6) is the probability of generating the topmost node in each analysis in adaptor CA (the rest of the tree is generated by another adaptor), while the second term (from Equation 3) is the probability of generating a Pitman-Yor adaptor with counts nA . [sent-246, score-1.719]
</p><p>79 The posterior distribution over analyses u given strings s is obtained by normalizing P(u | α, a, b) over all analyses u that have s as their yield. [sent-247, score-0.226]
</p><p>80 Instead, we draw samples from this distribution using a component-wise Metropolis-Hastings sampler, proposing changes to the analysis ui for each string si in turn. [sent-249, score-0.168]
</p><p>81 The proposal distribution is constructed to approximate the conditional distribution over ui given si and the analyses of all other strings u−i , P(ui |si , u−i ). [sent-250, score-0.306]
</p><p>82 The PCFG approximation G′ (u−i ) = (N, W, R′ , S, θ′ ) is a static snapshot of the adaptor grammar given the sentences s−i (i. [sent-254, score-0.997]
</p><p>83 Given an adaptor grammar H = (N, W, R, S, C), let: R′  = R∪  {A → Y IELD(x) : x ∈ xA } A∈N  ′ θA→β  =  mA aA + bA nA + bA  fA→β (xA ) + αA→β mA + A→β∈RA αA→β  + k: Y IELD(XAk )=β  nAk − aA nA + bA  where Y IELD(x) is the terminal string or yield of the tree x and mA is the length of xA . [sent-257, score-1.108]
</p><p>84 R′ contains all of the productions R, together with productions representing the adaptor entries xA for each A ∈ N . [sent-258, score-1.067]
</p><p>85 These additional productions rewrite directly to strings of terminal symbols, and their probability is the probability of the adaptor CA generating the corresponding value xAk . [sent-259, score-1.091]
</p><p>86 The two terms to the left of the summation specify the probability of selecting a production from the original productions R. [sent-260, score-0.179]
</p><p>87 The ﬁrst term is the probability of adaptor CA generating a new value, and the second term is the MAP estimate of the production’s probability, estimated from the root expansions of the trees xA . [sent-261, score-0.906]
</p><p>88 It is straightforward to map parses of a string s produced by G′ to corresponding adaptor analyses for the adaptor grammar H (it is possible for a single production of R′ to correspond to several adaptor entries so this mapping may be non-deterministic). [sent-262, score-2.783]
</p><p>89 This means that we can use the PCFG G′ with an efﬁcient PCFG sampling procedure [9] to generate possible adaptor grammar analyses for ui . [sent-263, score-1.13]
</p><p>90 2  A Metropolis-Hastings algorithm  The previous section described how to sample adaptor analyses u for a string s from a PCFG approximation G′ to an adaptor grammar H. [sent-265, score-1.91]
</p><p>91 In PYAGs, the probability of a subtree adapts dynamically depending on the other subtrees in u, including those in ui . [sent-267, score-0.144]
</p><p>92 Except when the number of training strings s is very small, we ﬁnd that only a tiny fraction (less than 1%) of proposals are rejected, presumably because the probability of an adaptor analysis does not change signiﬁcantly within a single string. [sent-270, score-0.882]
</p><p>93 Given a set of training strings s we choose an initial set of analyses for them at random. [sent-272, score-0.142]
</p><p>94 At each iteration we pick a string si from s at random, and sample a parse for si from the PCFG approximation G′ (u−i ), updating u when the Metropolis-Hastings procedure accepts the proposed analysis. [sent-273, score-0.142]
</p><p>95 At convergence the u produced by this procedure are samples from the posterior distribution over analyses given s, and samples from the posterior distribution over adaptor states C(u) and production probabilities θ can be computed from them. [sent-274, score-0.976]
</p><p>96 6  Conclusion  The strong independence assumptions of probabilistic context-free grammars tightly couple compositional structure with the probabilistic generative process that produces that structure. [sent-275, score-0.309]
</p><p>97 Adaptor grammars relax that coupling by inserting an additional stochastic component into the generative process. [sent-276, score-0.202]
</p><p>98 Pitman-Yor adaptor grammars use adaptors based on the Pitman-Yor process. [sent-277, score-1.119]
</p><p>99 We have proposed a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, which can be used to sample from the posterior distribution over analyses produced by any adaptor grammar. [sent-279, score-1.714]

Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars.

<p>Author: Yuanhao Chen, Long Zhu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised method for learning a probabilistic grammar of an object from a set of training examples. Our approach is invariant to the scale and rotation of the objects. We illustrate our approach using thirteen objects from the Caltech 101 database. In addition, we learn the model of a hybrid object class where we do not know the speciﬁc object or its position, scale or pose. This is illustrated by learning a hybrid class consisting of faces, motorbikes, and airplanes. The individual objects can be recovered as different aspects of the grammar for the object class. In all cases, we validate our results by learning the probability grammars from training datasets and evaluating them on the test datasets. We compare our method to alternative approaches. The advantages of our approach is the speed of inference (under one second), the parsing of the object, and increased accuracy of performance. Moreover, our approach is very general and can be applied to a large range of objects and structures. 1</p><p>3 0.086976409 <a title="23-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Single_Channel_Speech_Separation_Using_Factorial_Dynamics.html">176 nips-2006-Single Channel Speech Separation Using Factorial Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task. Human: average human error rate, IBM: our best result, Next Best: the best of the eight other published results on this task, and Chance: the theoretical error rate for random guessing. System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: Joseph Turian, Benjamin Wellington, I. D. Melamed</p><p>Abstract: Parsing and translating natural languages can be viewed as problems of predicting tree structures. For machine learning approaches to these predictions, the diversity and high dimensionality of the structures involved mandate very large training sets. This paper presents a purely discriminative learning method that scales up well to problems of this size. Its accuracy was at least as good as other comparable methods on a standard parsing task. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst purely discriminative learning algorithm for translation with treestructured models. Unlike other popular methods, this method does not require a great deal of feature engineering a priori, because it performs feature selection over a compound feature space as it learns.

<p>Author: Chaitanya Chemudugunta, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: Techniques such as probabilistic topic models and latent-semantic indexing have been shown to be broadly useful at automatically extracting the topical or semantic content of documents, or more generally for dimension-reduction of sparse count data. These types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an abstraction from the words in a document to a lower-dimensional latent variable representation that captures what the document is generally about beyond the speciﬁc words it contains. In this paper we propose a new probabilistic model that tempers this approach by representing each document as a combination of (a) a background distribution over common words, (b) a mixture distribution over general topics, and (c) a distribution over words that are treated as being speciﬁc to that document. We illustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval by matching documents both at a general topic level and at a speciﬁc word level, providing an advantage over techniques that only match documents at a general level (such as topic models or latent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the speciﬁc word level (such as TF-IDF). 1 Introduction and Motivation Reducing high-dimensional data vectors to robust and interpretable lower-dimensional representations has a long and successful history in data analysis, including recent innovations such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al, 1994) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003). These types of techniques have found broad application in modeling of sparse high-dimensional count data such as the “bag of words” representations for documents or transaction data for Web and retail applications. Approaches such as LSI and LDA have both been shown to be useful for “object matching” in their respective latent spaces. In information retrieval for example, both a query and a set of documents can be represented in the LSI or topic latent spaces, and the documents can be ranked in terms of how well they match the query based on distance or similarity in the latent space. The mapping to latent space represents a generalization or abstraction away from the sparse set of observed words, to a “higher-level” semantic representation in the latent space. These abstractions in principle lead to better generalization on new data compared to inferences carried out directly in the original sparse high-dimensional space. The capability of these models to provide improved generalization has been demonstrated empirically in a number of studies (e.g., Deerwester et al 1994; Hofmann 1999; Canny 2004; Buntine et al, 2005). However, while this type of generalization is broadly useful in terms of inference and prediction, there are situations where one can over-generalize. Consider trying to match the following query to a historical archive of news articles: election + campaign + Camejo. The query is intended to ﬁnd documents that are about US presidential campaigns and also about Peter Camejo (who ran as vice-presidential candidate alongside independent Ralph Nader in 2004). LSI and topic models are likely to highly rank articles that are related to presidential elections (even if they don’t necessarily contain the words election or campaign). However, a potential problem is that the documents that are highly ranked by LSI or topic models need not include any mention of the name Camejo. The reason is that the combination of words in this query is likely to activate one or more latent variables related to the concept of presidential campaigns. However, once this generalization is made the model has “lost” the information about the speciﬁc word Camejo and it will only show up in highly ranked documents if this word happens to frequently occur in these topics (unlikely in this case given that this candidate received relatively little media coverage compared to the coverage given to the candidates from the two main parties). But from the viewpoint of the original query, our preference would be to get documents that are about the general topic of US presidential elections with the speciﬁc constraint that they mention Peter Camejo. Word-based retrieval techniques, such as the widely-used term-frequency inverse-documentfrequency (TF-IDF) method, have the opposite problem in general. They tend to be overly speciﬁc in terms of matching words in the query to documents. In general of course one would like to have a balance between generality and speciﬁcity. One ad hoc approach is to combine scores from a general method such as LSI with those from a more speciﬁc method such as TF-IDF in some manner, and indeed this technique has been proposed in information retrieval (Vogt and Cottrell, 1999). Similarly, in the ad hoc LDA approach (Wei and Croft, 2006), the LDA model is linearly combined with document-speciﬁc word distributions to capture both general as well as speciﬁc information in documents. However, neither method is entirely satisfactory since it is not clear how to trade-off generality and speciﬁcity in a principled way. The contribution of this paper is a new graphical model based on latent topics that handles the tradeoff between generality and speciﬁcity in a fully probabilistic and automated manner. The model, which we call the special words with background (SWB) model, is an extension of the LDA model. The new model allows words in documents to be modeled as either originating from general topics, or from document-speciﬁc “special” word distributions, or from a corpus-wide background distribution. The idea is that words in a document such as election and campaign are likely to come from a general topic on presidential elections, whereas a name such as Camejo is much more likely to be treated as “non-topical” and speciﬁc to that document. Words in queries are automatically interpreted (in a probabilistic manner) as either being topical or special, in the context of each document, allowing for a data-driven document-speciﬁc trade-off between the beneﬁts of topic-based abstraction and speciﬁc word matching. Daum´ and Marcu (2006) independently proposed a probabilistic e model using similar concepts for handling different training and test distributions in classiﬁcation problems. Although we have focused primarily on documents in information retrieval in the discussion above, the model we propose can in principle be used on any large sparse matrix of count data. For example, transaction data sets where rows are individuals and columns correspond to items purchased or Web sites visited are ideally suited to this approach. The latent topics can capture broad patterns of population behavior and the “special word distributions” can capture the idiosyncracies of speciﬁc individuals. Section 2 reviews the basic principles of the LDA model and introduces the new SWB model. Section 3 illustrates how the model works in practice using examples from New York Times news articles. In Section 4 we describe a number of experiments with 4 different document sets, including perplexity experiments and information retrieval experiments, illustrating the trade-offs between generalization and speciﬁcity for different models. Section 5 contains a brief discussion and concluding comments. 2 A Topic Model for Special Words Figure 1(a) shows the graphical model for what we will refer to as the “standard topic model” or LDA. There are D documents and document d has Nd words. α and β are ﬁxed parameters of symmetric Dirichlet priors for the D document-topic multinomials represented by θ and the T topicword multinomials represented by φ. In the generative model, for each document d, the Nd words (a) β2 β1 α γ Ω ψ θ λ β0 z x φ w (b) α θ β z φ w Nd T T D Nd D Figure 1: Graphical models for (a) the standard LDA topic model (left) and (b) the proposed special words topic model with a background distribution (SWB) (right). are generated by drawing a topic t from the document-topic distribution p(z|θd ) and then drawing a word w from the topic-word distribution p(w|z = t, φt ). As shown in Grifﬁths and Steyvers (2004) the topic assignments z for each word token in the corpus can be efﬁciently sampled via Gibbs sampling (after marginalizing over θ and φ). Point estimates for the θ and φ distributions can be computed conditioned on a particular sample, and predictive distributions can be obtained by averaging over multiple samples. We will refer to the proposed model as the special words topic model with background distribution (SWB) (Figure 1(b)). SWB has a similar general structure to the LDA model (Figure 1(a)) but with additional machinery to handle special words and background words. In particular, associated with each word token is a latent random variable x, taking value x = 0 if the word w is generated via the topic route, value x = 1 if the word is generated as a special word (for that document) and value x = 2 if the word is generated from a background distribution speciﬁc for the corpus. The variable x acts as a switch: if x = 0, the previously described standard topic mechanism is used to generate the word, whereas if x = 1 or x = 2, words are sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial Ψ or a corpus speciﬁc multinomial Ω (with symmetric Dirichlet priors parametrized by β1 and β2 ) respectively. x is sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial λ, which in turn has a symmetric Dirichlet prior, γ. One could also use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to introduce another level of uncertainty about the Dirichlet priors (e.g., see Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003)—we have not investigated this option, primarily for computational reasons. In all our experiments, we set α = 0.1, β0 = β2 = 0.01, β1 = 0.0001 and γ = 0.3—all weak symmetric priors. The conditional probability of a word w given a document d can be written as: T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w) p(w|d) = p(x = 0|d) t=1 ′ where p (w|d) is the special word distribution for document d, and p′′ (w) is the background word distribution for the corpus. Note that when compared to the standard topic model the SWB model can explain words in three different ways, via topics, via a special word distribution, or via a background word distribution. Given the graphical model above, it is relatively straightforward to derive Gibbs sampling equations that allow joint sampling of the zi and xi latent variables for each word token wi , for xi = 0: p (xi = 0, zi = t |w, x−i , z−i , α, β0 , γ ) ∝ Nd0,−i + γ × Nd,−i + 3γ TD Ctd,−i + α t′ TD Ct′ d,−i + T α × WT Cwt,−i + β0 WT w ′ Cw ′ t,−i + W β0 and for xi = 1: p (xi = 1 |w, x−i , z−i , β1 , γ ) ∝ Nd1,−i + γ × Nd,−i + 3γ WD Cwd,−i + β1 w′ WD Cw′ d,−i + W β1 e mail krugman nytimes com memo to critics of the media s liberal bias the pinkos you really should be going after are those business reporters even i was startled by the tone of the jan 21 issue of investment news which describes itself as the weekly newspaper for financial advisers the headline was paul o neill s sweet deal the blurb was irs backs off closing loophole averting tax liability for execs and treasury chief it s not really news that the bush administration likes tax breaks for businessmen but two weeks later i learned from the wall street journal that this loophole is more than a tax break for businessmen it s a gift to biznesmen and it may be part of a larger pattern confused in the former soviet union the term biznesmen pronounced beeznessmen refers to the class of sudden new rich who emerged after the fall of communism and who generally got rich by using their connections to strip away the assets of public enterprises what we ve learned from enron and other players to be named later is that america has its own biznesmen and that we need to watch out for policies that make it easier for them to ply their trade it turns out that the sweet deal investment news was referring to the use of split premium life insurance policies to give executives largely tax free compensation you don t want to know the details is an even sweeter deal for executives of companies that go belly up it shields their wealth from creditors and even from lawsuits sure enough reports the wall street journal former enron c e o s kenneth lay and jeffrey skilling both had large split premium policies so what other pro biznes policies have been promulgated lately last year both houses of … john w snow was paid more than 50 million in salary bonus and stock in his nearly 12 years as chairman of the csx corporation the railroad company during that period the company s profits fell and its stock rose a bit more than half as much as that of the average big company mr snow s compensation amid csx s uneven performance has drawn criticism from union officials and some corporate governance specialists in 2000 for example after the stock had plunged csx decided to reverse a 25 million loan to him the move is likely to get more scrutiny after yesterday s announcement that mr snow has been chosen by president bush to replace paul o neill as the treasury secretary like mr o neill mr snow is an outsider on wall street but an insider in corporate america with long experience running an industrial company some wall street analysts who follow csx said yesterday that mr snow had ably led the company through a difficult period in the railroad industry and would make a good treasury secretary it s an excellent nomination said jill evans an analyst at j p morgan who has a neutral rating on csx stock i think john s a great person for the administration he as the c e o of a railroad has probably touched every sector of the economy union officials are less complimentary of mr snow s performance at csx last year the a f l c i o criticized him and csx for the company s decision to reverse the loan allowing him to return stock he had purchased with the borrowed money at a time when independent directors are in demand a corporate governance specialist said recently that mr snow had more business relationships with members of his own board than any other chief executive in addition mr snow is the third highest paid of 37 chief executives of transportation companies said ric marshall chief executive of the corporate library which provides specialized investment research into corporate boards his own compensation levels have been pretty high mr marshall said he could afford to take a public service job a csx program in 1996 allowed mr snow and other top csx executives to buy… Figure 2: Examples of two news articles with special words (as inferred by the model) shaded in gray.

Note that when there is not strong supporting evidence for xi = 0 (i.e., the conditional probability of this event is low), then the probability of the word being generated by the special words route, xi = 1, or background route, xi = 2 increases. One iteration of the Gibbs sampler corresponds to a sampling pass through all word tokens in the corpus. In practice we have found that around 500 iterations are often sufﬁcient for the in-sample perplexity (or log-likelihood) and the topic distributions to stabilize. We also pursued a variant of SWB, the special words (SW) model that excludes the background distribution Ω and has a symmetric Beta prior, γ, on λ (which in SW is a document-speciﬁc Bernoulli distribution). In all our SW model runs, we set γ = 0.5 resulting in a weak symmetric prior that is equivalent to adding one pseudo-word to each document. Experimental results (not shown) indicate that the ﬁnal word-topic assignments are not sensitive to either the value of the prior or the initial assignments to the latent variables, x and z. 3 Illustrative Examples We illustrate the operation of the SW model with a data set consisting of 3104 articles from the New York Times (NYT) with a total of 1,399,488 word tokens. This small set of NYT articles was formed by selecting all NYT articles that mention the word “Enron.” The SW topic model was run with T = 100 topics. In total, 10 Gibbs samples were collected from the model. Figure 2 shows two short fragments of articles from this NYT dataset. The background color of words indicates the probability of assigning words to the special words topic—darker colors are associated with higher probability that over the 10 Gibbs samples a word was assigned to the special topic. The words with gray foreground colors were treated as stopwords and were not included in the analysis.

Figure 2(b) shows how a last name such as “Snow” and the corporation name “CSX” that are speciﬁc to the document are likely to be assigned to the special topic. The words “Snow” and “CSX” do not occur often in other documents but are mentioned several times in the example document. This combination of low document-frequency and high term-frequency within the document is one factor that makes these words more likely to be treated as “special” words. 4 Experimental Results: Perplexity and Precision We use 4 different document sets in our experiments, as summarized in Table 1. The NIPS and PATENTS document sets are used for perplexity experiments and the AP and FR data sets for retrieval experiments. The NIPS data set is available online1 and PATENTS, AP, and FR consist of documents from the U.S. Patents collection (TREC Vol-3), Associated Press news articles from 1998 (TREC Vol-2), and articles from the Federal Register (TREC Vol-1, 2) respectively. To create the sampled AP and FR data sets, all documents relevant to queries were included ﬁrst and the rest of the documents were chosen randomly. In the results below all LDA/SWB/SW models were ﬁt using T = 200 topics. Figure 3 demonstrates the background component learned by the SWB model on the 4 different document data sets. The background distributions learned for each set of documents are quite intuitive, with words that are commonly used across a broad range of documents within each corpus. The ratio of words assigned to the special words distribution and the background distribution are (respectively for each data set), 25%:10% (NIPS), 58%:5% (PATENTS), 11%:6% (AP), 50%:11% (FR). Of note is the fact that a much larger fraction of words are treated as special in collections containing long documents (NIPS, PATENTS, and FR) than in short “abstract-like” collections (such as AP)—this makes sense since short documents are more likely to contain general summary information while longer documents will have more speciﬁc details. 4.1 Perplexity Comparisons The NIPS and PATENTS documents sets do not have queries and relevance judgments, but nonetheless are useful for evaluating perplexity. We compare the predictive performance of the SW and SWB topic models with the standard topic model by computing the perplexity of unseen words in test documents. Perplexity of a test set under a model is deﬁned as follows: 1 From http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜roweis/data.html 1900 550 LDA SW SWB 1800 500 1700 450 LDA SW SWB Perplexity Perplexity 1600 1500 1400 400 350 300 1300 250 1200 200 1100 1000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 150 10 90 20 Percentage of Words Observed 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Percentage of Words Observed Figure 4: Average perplexity of the two special words models and the standard topics model as a function of the percentage of words observed in test documents on the NIPS data set (left) and the PATENTS data set (right). Perplexity(wtest |Dtrain ) = exp − Dtest d=1 log p(wd |Dtrain ) Dtest d=1 Nd where wtest is a vector of words in the test data set, wd is a vector of words in document d of the test set, and Dtrain is the training set. For the SWB model, we approximate p(wd |Dtrain ) as follows: p(wd |Dtrain ) ≈ 1 S S p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) s=1 where Θs , Φs , Ψs , Ωs and λs are point estimates from s = 1:S different Gibbs sampling runs. The probability of the words wd in a test document d, given its parameters, can be computed as follows: Nd p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) = T s s φs i t θtd + λs ψwi d + λs Ωs i 3d w w 2d λs 1d i=1 t=1 where Nd is the number of words in test document d and wi is the ith word being predicted in the s s test document. θtd , φs i t , ψwi d , Ωs i and λs are point estimates from sample s. w w d When a fraction of words of a test document d is observed, a Gibbs sampler is run on the observed words to update the document-speciﬁc parameters, θd , ψd and λd and these updated parameters are used in the computation of perplexity. For the NIPS data set, documents from the last year of the data set were held out to compute perplexity (Dtest = 150), and for the PATENTS data set 500 documents were randomly selected as test documents. From the perplexity ﬁgures, it can be seen that once a small fraction of the test document words is observed (20% for NIPS and 10% for PATENTS), the SW and SWB models have signiﬁcantly lower perplexity values than LDA indicating that the SW and SWB models are using the special words “route” to better learn predictive models for individual documents. 4.2 Information Retrieval Results Returning to the point of capturing both speciﬁc and general aspects of documents as discussed in the introduction of the paper, we generated 500 queries of length 3-5 using randomly selected lowfrequency words from the NIPS corpus and then ranked documents relative to these queries using several different methods. Table 2 shows for the top k-ranked documents (k = 1, 10, 50, 100) how many of the retrieved documents contained at least one of the words in the query. Note that we are not assessing relevance here in a traditional information retrieval sense, but instead are assessing how Method TF-IDF LSI LDA SW SWB 1 Ret Doc 100.0 97.6 90.0 99.2 99.4 10 Ret Docs 100.0 82.7 80.6 97.1 96.6 50 Ret Docs 100.0 64.6 67.0 79.1 78.7 100 Ret Docs 100.0 54.3 58.7 67.3 67.2 Table 2: Percentage of retrieved documents containing at least one query word (NIPS corpus).

TF-IDF has 100% matches, as one would expect, and the techniques that generalize (such as LSI and LDA) have far fewer exact matches. The SWB and SW models have more speciﬁc matches than either LDA or LSI, indicating that they have the ability to match at the level of speciﬁc words. Of course this is not of much utility unless the SWB and SW models can also perform well in terms of retrieving relevant documents (not just documents containing the query words), which we investigate next. For the AP and FR documents sets, 3 types of query sets were constructed from TREC Topics 1150, based on the T itle (short), Desc (sentence-length) and Concepts (long list of keywords) ﬁelds. Queries that have no relevance judgments for a collection were removed from the query set for that collection. The score for a document d relative to a query q for the SW and standard topic models can be computed as the probability of q given d (known as the query-likelihood model in the IR community). For the SWB topic model, we have T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w)] [p(x = 0|d) p(q|d) ≈ w∈q t=1 We compare SW and SWB models with the standard topic model (LDA), LSI and TF-IDF. The TFCW D D wd IDF score for a word w in a document d is computed as TF-IDF(w, d) = Nd × log2 Dw . For LSI, the TF-IDF weight matrix is reduced to a K-dimensional latent space using SVD, K = 200. A given query is ﬁrst mapped into the LSI latent space or the TF-IDF space (known as query folding), and documents are scored based on their cosine distances to the mapped queries. To measure the performance of each algorithm we used 2 metrics that are widely used in IR research: the mean average precision (MAP) and the precision for the top 10 documents retrieved (pr@10d). The main difference between the AP and FR documents is that the latter documents are considerably longer on average and there are fewer queries for the FR data set. Figure 5 summarizes the results, broken down by algorithm, query type, document set, and metric. The maximum score for each query experiment is shown in bold: in all cases (query-type/data set/metric) the SW or SWB model produced the highest scores. To determine statistical signiﬁcance, we performed a t-test at the 0.05 level between the scores of each of the SW and SWB models, and the scores of the LDA model (as LDA has the best scores overall among TF-IDF, LSI and LDA). Differences between SW and SWB are not signiﬁcant. In ﬁgure 5, we use the symbol * to indicate scores where the SW and SWB models showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference (always an improvement) relative to the LDA model. The differences for the “non-starred” query and metric scores of SW and SWB are not statistically signiﬁcant but nonetheless always favor SW and SWB over LDA. 5 Discussion and Conclusions Wei and Croft (2006) have recently proposed an ad hoc LDA approach that models p(q|d) as a weighted combination of a multinomial over the entire corpus (the background model), a multinomial over the document, and an LDA model. Wei and Croft showed that this combination provides excellent retrieval performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods. In a number of experiments (not shown) comparing the SWB and ad hoc LDA models we found that the two techniques produced comparable precision performance, with small but systematic performance gains being achieved by an ad hoc combination where the standard LDA model in ad hoc LDA was replaced with the SWB model. An interesting direction for future work is to investigate fully generative models that can achieve the performance of ad hoc approaches. In conclusion, we have proposed a new probabilistic model that accounts for both general and speciﬁc aspects of documents or individual behavior. The model extends existing latent variable probabilistic approaches such as LDA by allowing these models to take into account speciﬁc aspects of documents (or individuals) that are exceptions to the broader structure of the data. This allows, for example, documents to be modeled as a mixture of words generated by general topics and words generated in a manner speciﬁc to that document. Experimental results on information retrieval tasks indicate that the SWB topic model does not suffer from the weakness of techniques such as LSI and LDA when faced with very speciﬁc query words, nor does it suffer the limitations of TF-IDF in terms of its ability to generalize.

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>2 0.54698902 <a title="23-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-Single_Channel_Speech_Separation_Using_Factorial_Dynamics.html">176 nips-2006-Single Channel Speech Separation Using Factorial Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task. Human: average human error rate, IBM: our best result, Next Best: the best of the eight other published results on this task, and Chance: the theoretical error rate for random guessing. System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: Joseph Turian, Benjamin Wellington, I. D. Melamed</p><p>Abstract: Parsing and translating natural languages can be viewed as problems of predicting tree structures. For machine learning approaches to these predictions, the diversity and high dimensionality of the structures involved mandate very large training sets. This paper presents a purely discriminative learning method that scales up well to problems of this size. Its accuracy was at least as good as other comparable methods on a standard parsing task. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst purely discriminative learning algorithm for translation with treestructured models. Unlike other popular methods, this method does not require a great deal of feature engineering a priori, because it performs feature selection over a compound feature space as it learns. Experiments demonstrate the method’s versatility, accuracy, and eﬃciency.

<p>Author: T. F. Jaeger, Roger P. Levy</p><p>Abstract: If language users are rational, they might choose to structure their utterances so as to optimize communicative properties. In particular, information-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may include maximizing the uniformity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic reduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control variables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.</p><p>5 0.43081346 <a title="23-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Unsupervised_Learning_of_a_Probabilistic_Grammar_for_Object_Detection_and_Parsing.html">199 nips-2006-Unsupervised Learning of a Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanhao Chen, Long Zhu, Alan L. Yuille</p><p>Abstract: We describe an unsupervised method for learning a probabilistic grammar of an object from a set of training examples. Our approach is invariant to the scale and rotation of the objects. We illustrate our approach using thirteen objects from the Caltech 101 database. In addition, we learn the model of a hybrid object class where we do not know the speciﬁc object or its position, scale or pose. This is illustrated by learning a hybrid class consisting of faces, motorbikes, and airplanes. The individual objects can be recovered as different aspects of the grammar for the object class. In all cases, we validate our results by learning the probability grammars from training datasets and evaluating them on the test datasets. We compare our method to alternative approaches. The advantages of our approach is the speed of inference (under one second), the parsing of the object, and increased accuracy of performance. Moreover, our approach is very general and can be applied to a large range of objects and structures. 1</p><p>6 0.39440557 <a title="23-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Multi-dynamic_Bayesian_Networks.html">139 nips-2006-Multi-dynamic Bayesian Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>2 0.82380277 <a title="23-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Dyadic_Data_with_Binary_Latent_Factors.html">132 nips-2006-Modeling Dyadic Data with Binary Latent Factors</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Meeds, Zoubin Ghahramani, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We introduce binary matrix factorization, a novel model for unsupervised matrix decomposition. The decomposition is learned by ﬁtting a non-parametric Bayesian probabilistic model with binary latent variables to a matrix of dyadic data. Unlike bi-clustering models, which assign each row or column to a single cluster based on a categorical hidden feature, our binary feature model reﬂects the prior belief that items and attributes can be associated with more than one latent cluster at a time. We provide simple learning and inference rules for this new model and show how to extend it to an inﬁnite model in which the number of features is not a priori ﬁxed but is allowed to grow with the size of the data. 1 Distributed representations for dyadic data One of the major goals of probabilistic unsupervised learning is to discover underlying or hidden structure in a dataset by using latent variables to describe a complex data generation process. In this paper we focus on dyadic data: our domains have two ﬁnite sets of objects/entities and observations are made on dyads (pairs with one element from each set). Examples include sparse matrices of movie-viewer ratings, word-document counts or product-customer purchases. A simple way to capture structure in this kind of data is to do “bi-clustering” (possibly using mixture models) by grouping the rows and (independently or simultaneously) the columns[6, 13, 9]. The modelling assumption in such a case is that movies come in Ã types and viewers in Ä types and that knowing the type of movie and type of viewer is sufﬁcient to predict the response. Clustering or mixture models are quite restrictive – their major disadvantage is that they do not admit a componential or distributed representation because items cannot simultaneously belong to several classes. (A movie, for example, might be explained as coming from a cluster of “dramas” or “comedies”; a viewer as a “single male” or as a “young mother”.) We might instead prefer a model (e.g. [10, 5]) in which objects can be assigned to multiple latent clusters: a movie might be a drama and have won an Oscar and have subtitles; a viewer might be single and female and a university graduate. Inference in such models falls under the broad area of factorial learning (e.g. [7, 1, 3, 12]), in which multiple interacting latent causes explain each observed datum. In this paper, we assume that both data items (rows) and attributes (columns) have this kind of componential structure: each item (row) has associated with it an unobserved vector of Ã binary features; similarly each attribute (column) has a hidden vector of Ä binary features. Knowing the features of the item and the features of the attribute are sufﬁcient to generate (before noise) the response at that location in the matrix. In effect, we are factorizing a real-valued data (response) , where and are binary feature matrix into (a distribution deﬁned by) the product is a real-valued weight matrix. Below, we develop this binary matrix factorization matrices, and Ï ÍÏÎ Í Î , ÛÓ « K L ÛÐ Ü Ù I Ð ÚÐ =f Ï Í Î J (A) (B) Figure 1: (A) The graphical model representation of the linear-Gaussian BMF model.

Associated with each row is a latent binary feature vector ; similarly each column has an unobserved binary vector . The primary parameters are represented of interaction weights. is generated by a ﬁxed observation process ´¡µ applied by a matrix (elementwise) to the linear inner product of the features and weights, which is the “factorization” or approximation of the data: Ù Ú Ï ÍÎÏ ´ÍÏÎ ¢µ (1) where ¢ are extra parameters speciﬁc to the model variant. Three possible parametric forms for and covariance ´½ µ ; the noise (observation) distribution are: Gaussian, with mean logistic, with mean ½ ´½ · ÜÔ´  µµ; and Poisson, with mean (and variance) . Other parametric forms are also possible. For illustrative purposes, we will use the linear-Gaussian model throughout this paper; this can be thought of as a two-sided version of the linear-Gaussian model found in [5]. ÍÏÎ ÍÏÎ ÍÏÎ Á To complete the description of the model, we need to specify prior distributions over the feature matrices and the weights . We adopt the same priors over binary matrices as previously described in [5]. For ﬁnite sized matrices with Á rows and Ã columns, we generate a bias independently for each column using a Beta prior (denoted ) and then conditioned on this bias generate the entries in column independently from a Bernoulli with mean .

The hyperprior on the concentration « is a Gamma distribution (denoted ), whose shape and scale hyperparameters control the expected fraction of zeros/ones in the matrix. The biases are easily integrated out, which creates dependencies between the rows, although they remain exchangeable. The resulting prior depends only on the number Ò of active features in each column. An identical prior is used on , with Â rows and Ä columns, but with different concentration prior . The variable ¬ was set to ½ for all experiments. Î The appropriate prior distribution over weights depends on the observation distribution is a matrix normal with prior mean the linear-Gaussian variant, a convenient prior on Ï ´¡µ. For ÏÓ and µ Á. covariance ´½ hyperpriors: The scale of the weights and output precision Ï ÏÓ (if needed) have Gamma Æ ´ÏÓ ´½ µ Áµ ´ µ ´ µ In certain cases, when the prior on the weights is conjugate to the output distribution model , the weights may be analytically integrated out, expressing the marginal distribution of the data only in terms of the binary features. This is true, for example, when we place a Gaussian prior on the weights and use a linear-Gaussian output process. ÍÎ Í Î Remarkably, the Beta-Bernoulli prior distribution over (and similarly ) can easily be extended to the case where Ã ½, creating a distribution over binary matrices with a ﬁxed number Á of exchangeable rows and a potentially inﬁnite number of columns (although the expected number of columns which are not entirely zero remains ﬁnite). Such a distribution, the Indian Buffet Process (IBP) was described by [5] and is analogous to the Dirichlet process and the associated Chinese restaurant process (CRP) [11]. Fortunately, as we will see, inference with this inﬁnite prior is not only tractable, but is also nearly as efﬁcient as the ﬁnite version. 3 Inference of features and parameters Í As with many other complex hierarchical Bayesian models, exact inference of the latent variables and in the BMF model is intractable (ie there is no efﬁcient way to sample exactly from the posterior nor to compute its exact marginals). However, as with many other non-parametric Bayesian models, we can employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to create an iterative procedure which, if run for sufﬁciently long, will produce correct posterior samples. Î 3.1 Finite binary latent feature matrices Í Î The posterior distribution of a single entry in (or ) given all other model parameters is proportional to the product of the conditional prior and the data likelihood. The conditional prior comes from integrating out the biases in the Beta-Bernoulli model and is proportional the number of active entries in other rows of the same column plus a term for new activations. Gibbs sampling for single entries of (or ) can be done using the following updates: È ´Ù È ´Ù where Ò  on « Ã and Í Î ½ Í  Î Ï µ ´ « Ã · Ò   µ È ´ Í  Ù ½ Î Ï µ (2) ¼ Í  Î Ï µ ´¬ · ´Á   ½µ   Ò  µ È ´ Í  Ù ¼ Î Ïµ (3) È Ù , Í  excludes entry , and is a normalizing constant. (Conditioning is implicit.) When conditioning on Ï, we only need to calculate the ratio of likeli- hoods corresponding to row . (Note that this is not the case when the weights are integrated out.)

To simplify the presentation, we consider a “vectorized” representation of our variables. Let be an ÁÂ column vector taken column-wise from , be a ÃÄ column vector taken column-wise from and be a ÁÂ ¢ ÃÄ binary matrix which is the kronecker product ª . (In “Matlab notation”, ´µ ´ µ and ÖÓÒ´ µ.) In this notation, the data distribution is written as: Æ´ ´½ µ µ.

For computing the posterior of linearGaussian weights, the matrix can be computed as ÖÓÒ´ µ. Similarly, the expression is constructed by computing and taking the elements column-wise. Ü Î ÎÍ Í Í Î 3.2 Inﬁnite binary latent feature matrices One of the most elegant aspects of non-parametric Bayesian modeling is the ability to use a prior which allows a countably inﬁnite number of latent features. The number of instantiated features is automatically adjusted during inference and depends on the amount of data and how many features it supports. Remarkably, we can do MCMC sampling using such inﬁnite priors with essentially no computational penalty over the ﬁnite case. To derive these updates (e.g. for row of the matrix ), it is useful to consider partitioning the columns of into two sets as shown below. Let set A have at least one non-zero entry in rows other than . Let set B be all other set A set B columns, including the set of columns where 0 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ the only non-zero entries are found in row 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ and the countably inﬁnite number of all-zero 1 1 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ columns. Sampling values for elements in row 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 row of set A given everything else is straightfor0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ ward, and involves Gibbs updates almost iden0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ tical to those in the ﬁnite case handled by equa1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ¡¡¡ tions (2) and (3); as Ã ½ and in set A we get: Í Í ½ Í  Î Ï µ ¼ Í  Î Ï µ È ´Ù È ´Ù ¡ Ò   È ´ Í  Ù ½ Î Ï µ ¡ ´¬ · Á   ½   Ò  µ È ´ Í  Ù ¼ Î Ïµ (4) (5) When sampling new values for set B, the columns are exchangeable, and so we are really only interested in the number of entries Ò in set B which will be turned on in row . Sampling the number of entries set to ½ can be done with Metropolis-Hastings updates. Let Â ´Ò Ò µ Poisson ´Ò « ´¬ · Á   ½µµ be the proposal distribution for a move which replaces the current Ò active entries with Ò active entries in set B. The reverse proposal is Â ´Ò Ò µ. The acceptance ¡ probability is Ñ Ò ½ ÖÒ Ò , where ÖÒ Ò is È ´Ò È ´Ò µ Â ´Ò Ò µ µ Â ´Ò Ò µ È´ Ò È´ Ò µ Poisson´Ò « ´¬ · Á   ½µµÂ ´Ò Ò µ µ Poisson´Ò « ´¬ · Á   ½µµÂ ´Ò Ò µ Ï È´ Ò È´ Ò µ µ (6) This assumes a conjugate situation in which the weights are explicitly integrated out of the model to compute the marginal likelihood È ´ Ò µ. In the non-conjugate case, a more complicated proposal is required. Instead of proposing Ò , we jointly propose Ò and associated feature parameters from their prior distributions. In the linear-Gaussian model, where is a set of weights for features in set B, the proposal distribution is: Û Û « ´¬ · Á   ½µµ Normal ´Û Ò µ (7) We need actually sample only the ﬁnite portion of Û where Ù ½. As in the conjugate case, the Â ´Ò Û Ò Ûµ Poisson ´Ò acceptance ratio reduces to the ratio of data likelihoods: ÖÒ Û Ò Û È´ Ò È´ Ò Ûµ Ûµ ÍÎ Ï (8) 3.3 Faster mixing transition proposals are the simplest moves we could The Gibbs updates described above for the entries of , and make in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo inference procedure for the BMF model. However, these limited local updates may result in extremely slow mixing. In practice, we often implement larger moves in indicator space using, for example, Metropolis-Hastings proposals on multiple features for row simultaneously. For example, we can propose new values for several columns in row of matrix by sampling feature values independently from their conditional priors. To compute the reverse proposal, we imagine forgetting the current conﬁguration of those features for row and compute the probability under the conditional prior of proposing the current conﬁguration. The acceptance probability of such a proposal is (the maximum of unity and) the ratio of likelihoods between the new proposed conﬁguration and the current conﬁguration. Í Split-merge moves may also be useful for efﬁciently sampling from the posterior distribution of the binary feature matrices. Jain and Neal [8] describe split-merge algorithms for Dirichlet process mixture models with non-conjugate component distributions. We have developed and implemented similar split-merge proposals for binary matrices with IBP priors. Due to space limitations, we present here only a sketch of the procedure. Two nonzero entries in are selected uniformly at random. If they are in the same column, we propose splitting that column; if they are in different columns, we propose merging their columns. The key difference between this algorithm and the Jain and Neal algorithm is that the binary features are not constrained to sum to unity in each row. Our split-merge algorithm also performs restricted Gibbs scans on columns of to increase acceptance probability. Í Í 3.4 Predictions A major reason for building generative models of data is to be able to impute missing data values given some observations. In the linear-Gaussian model, the predictive distribution at each iteration of the Markov chain is a Gaussian distribution. The interaction weights can be analytically integrated out at each iteration, also resulting in a Gaussian posterior, removing sampling noise contributed by having the weights explicitly represented. Computing the exact predictive distribution, however, conditional only on the model hyperparameters, is analytically intractable: it requires integrating over all binary matrices and , and all other nuisance parameters (e.g., the weights and precisions). Instead we integrate over these parameters implicitly by averaging predictive distributions from many MCMC iterations. This posterior, which is conditional only on the observed data and hyperparameters, is highly complex, potentially multimodal, and non-linear function of the observed variables. Í Î Í Î and . In our By averaging predictive distributions, our algorithm implicitly integrates over experiments, we show samples from the posteriors of and to help explain what the model is doing, but we stress that the posterior may have signiﬁcant mass on many possible binary matrices. The number of features and their degrees of overlap will vary over MCMC iterations. Such variation will depend, for example, on the current value of « and (higher values will result in more features) and precision values (higher weight precision results in less variation in weights). Í Î 4 Experiments 4.1 Modiﬁed “bars” problem A toy problem commonly used to illustrate additive feature or multiple cause models is the bars problem ([2, 12, 1]). Vertical and horizontal bars are combined in some way to generate data samples. The goal of the illustration is to show recovery of the latent structure in the form of bars. We have modiﬁed the typical usage of bars to accommodate the linear-Gaussian BMF with inﬁnite features. Data consists of Á vectors of size ¾ where each vector can be reshaped into a square image. The generation process is as follows: since has the same number of rows as the dimension of the images, is ﬁxed to be a set of vertical and horizontal bars (when reshaped into an image). is sampled from the IBP, and global precisions and are set to ½ ¾. The weights are sampled from zero mean Gaussians. Model estimates of and were initialized from an IBP prior. Î Î Í Ï Î Í In Figure 2 we demonstrate the performance of the linear-Gaussian BMF on the bars data. We train the BMF with 200 training examples of the type shown in the top row in Figure 2. Some examples have their bottom halves labeled missing and are shown in the Figure with constant grey values. To handle this, we resample their values at each iteration of the Markov chain. The bottom row shows . Despite the relatively high the expected reconstruction using MCMC samples of , , and ÍÎ Ï noise levels in the data, the model is able to capture the complex relationships between bars and weights. The reconstruction of vertical bars is very good. The reconstruction of horizontal bars is good as well, considering that the model has no information regarding the existence of horizontal bars on the bottom half.

Î ÏÎ ÏÎ Í By examining the features captured by the model, we can understand the performance just described. In Figure 3 we show the generating, or true, values of and along with one sample of those basis features from the Markov chain. Because the model is generated by adding multiple images shown on the right of Figure 3, multiple bars are used in each image. This is reﬂected in the captured features. The learned are fairly similar to the generating , but the former are composed of overlapping bar structure (learned ). Î ÏÎ ÏÎ ÏÎ ÏÎ Î 4.2 Digits In Section 2 we brieﬂy stated that BMF can be applied to data models other than the linear-Gaussian model. We demonstrate this with a logistic BMF applied to binarized images of handwritten digits. We train logistic BMF with 100 examples each of digits ½, ¾, and ¿ from the USPS dataset. In the ﬁrst ﬁve rows of Figure 4 we again illustrate the ability of BMF to impute missing data values. The top row shows all 16 samples from the dataset which had their bottom halves labeled missing. Missing values are ﬁlled-in at each iteration of the Markov chain. In the third and fourth rows we show the mean and mode (È ´Ü ½µ ¼ ) of the BMF reconstruction. In the bottom row we have shown the nearest neighbors, in pixel space, to the training examples based only on the top halves of the original digits. In the last three rows of Figure 4 we show the features captured by the model. In row F, we show the average image of the data which have each feature in on. It is clear that some row features are shown. have distinct digit forms and others are overlapping. In row G, the basis images By adjusting the features that are non-zero in each row of , images are composed by adding basis images together. Finally, in row H we show . These pixel features mask out different regions in Î Í Í ÏÎ pixel space, which are weighted together to create the basis images. Note that there are Ã features in rows F and G, and Ä features in row H. (A) (B) (C) (D) (E) (F) (G) (H) Figure 4: Digits reconstruction. (A) Digits randomly sampled from the complete dataset.

ÏÎ Í Î Í 4.3 Gene expression data Gene expression data is able to exhibit multiple and overlapping clusters simultaneously; ﬁnding models for such complex data is an interesting and active research area ([10], [13]). The plaid model[10], originally introduced for analysis of gene expression data, can be thought of as a nonBayesian special case of our model in which the matrix is diagonal and the number of binary features is ﬁxed. Our goal in this experiment is merely to illustrate qualitatively the ability of BMF to ﬁnd multiple clusters in gene expression data, some of which are overlapping, others non-overlapping. The data in this experiment consists of rows corresponding to genes and columns corresponding to patients; the patients suffer from one of two types of acute Leukemia [4]. In Figure 5 we show the factorization produced by the ﬁnal state in the Markov chain. The rows and columns of the data and its expected reconstruction are ordered such that contiguous regions in were observable. Some of the many feature pairings are highlighted. The BMF clusters consist of broad, overlapping clusters, and small, non-overlapping clusters. One of the interesting possibilities of using BMF to model gene expression data would be to ﬁx certain columns of or with knowledge gained from experiments or literature, and to allow the model to add new features that help explain the data in more detail. Ï Í Î 5 Conclusion We have introduced a new model, binary matrix factorization, for unsupervised decomposition of dyadic data matrices. BMF makes use of non-parametric Bayesian methods to simultaneously discover binary distributed representations of both rows and columns of dyadic data. The model explains each row and column entity using a componential code composed of multiple binary latent features along with a set of parameters describing how the features interact to create the observed responses at each position in the matrix. BMF is based on a hierarchical Bayesian model and can be naturally extended to make use of a prior distribution which permits an inﬁnite number of features, at very little extra computational cost. We have given MCMC algorithms for posterior inference of both the binary factors and the interaction parameters conditioned on some observed data, and (A) (B) Figure 5: Gene expression results. (A) The top-left is sorted according to contiguous features in the ﬁnal and in the Markov chain. The bottom-left is and the top-right is . The bottomright is . (B) The same as (A), but the expected value of , . We have highlighted regions that have both Ù and Ú Ð on. For clarity, we have only shown the (at most) two largest contiguous regions for each feature pair. Í Ï Î Î ÍÏÎ Í demonstrated the model’s ability to capture overlapping structure and model complex joint distributions on a variety of data. BMF is fundamentally different from bi-clustering algorithms because of its distributed latent representation and from factorial models with continuous latent variables which interact linearly to produce the observations. This allows a much richer latent structure, which we believe makes BMF useful for many applications beyond the ones we outlined in this paper. References [1] P. Dayan and R. S. Zemel.

<p>Author: Daniel J. Navarro, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The additive clustering model is widely used to infer the features of a set of stimuli from their similarities, on the assumption that similarity is a weighted linear function of common features. This paper develops a fully Bayesian formulation of the additive clustering model, using methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to allow the number of features to vary. We use this to explore several approaches to parameter estimation, showing that the nonparametric Bayesian approach provides a straightforward way to obtain estimates of both the number of features used in producing similarity judgments and their importance. 1</p><p>4 0.62139106 <a title="23-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Particle_Filtering_for_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Matrix_Factorization.html">161 nips-2006-Particle Filtering for Nonparametric Bayesian Matrix Factorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Wood, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: Many unsupervised learning problems can be expressed as a form of matrix factorization, reconstructing an observed data matrix as the product of two matrices of latent variables. A standard challenge in solving these problems is determining the dimensionality of the latent matrices. Nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization is one way of dealing with this challenge, yielding a posterior distribution over possible factorizations of unbounded dimensionality. A drawback to this approach is that posterior estimation is typically done using Gibbs sampling, which can be slow for large problems and when conjugate priors cannot be used. As an alternative, we present a particle ﬁlter for posterior estimation in nonparametric Bayesian matrix factorization models. We illustrate this approach with two matrix factorization models and show favorable performance relative to Gibbs sampling.</p><p>5 0.41767442 <a title="23-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Ensemble_Learning.html">41 nips-2006-Bayesian Ensemble Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Hugh A. Chipman, Edward I. George, Robert E. Mcculloch</p><p>Abstract: We develop a Bayesian “sum-of-trees” model, named BART, where each tree is constrained by a prior to be a weak learner. Fitting and inference are accomplished via an iterative backﬁtting MCMC algorithm. This model is motivated by ensemble methods in general, and boosting algorithms in particular. Like boosting, each weak learner (i.e., each weak tree) contributes a small amount to the overall model. However, our procedure is deﬁned by a statistical model: a prior and a likelihood, while boosting is deﬁned by an algorithm. This model-based approach enables a full and accurate assessment of uncertainty in model predictions, while remaining highly competitive in terms of predictive accuracy. 1</p><p>6 0.39831549 <a title="23-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Inducing_Metric_Violations_in_Human_Similarity_Judgements.html">97 nips-2006-Inducing Metric Violations in Human Similarity Judgements</a></p>

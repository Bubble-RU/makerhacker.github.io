<p>Author: Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N (100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of signiﬁcance α = 1 − ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the inﬂuence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efﬁciently detect outliers at a given level of signiﬁcance and compute their empirical p-values. We illustrate GEM for several simulated and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces. 1</p><p>3 0.12520692 <a title="96-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Natural_Actor-Critic_for_Road_Traffic_Optimisation.html">143 nips-2006-Natural Actor-Critic for Road Traffic Optimisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvia Richter, Douglas Aberdeen, Jin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Current road-trafﬁc optimisation practice around the world is a combination of hand tuned policies with a small degree of automatic adaption. Even state-ofthe-art research controllers need good models of the road trafﬁc, which cannot be obtained directly from existing sensors. We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the trafﬁc signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the trafﬁc system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison. Along the way we extend natural-actor critic approaches to work for distributed and online inﬁnite-horizon problems. 1</p><p>4 0.089342542 <a title="96-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Detection_of_Infrequent_Differences_in_Sets_of_Time_Series_with_Shared_Structure.html">40 nips-2006-Bayesian Detection of Infrequent Differences in Sets of Time Series with Shared Structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Rachel Puckrin, Sean Cutler</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for sets of related, but different, classes of time series data. Our model performs alignment simultaneously across all classes, while detecting and characterizing class-speciﬁc differences. During inference the model produces, for each class, a distribution over a canonical representation of the class. These class-speciﬁc canonical representations are automatically aligned to one another — preserving common sub-structures, and highlighting differences. We apply our model to compare and contrast solenoid valve current data, and also, liquid-chromatography-ultraviolet-diode array data from a study of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 1 Aligning Time Series From Different Classes Many practical problems over a wide range of domains require synthesizing information from several noisy examples of one or more categories in order to build a model which captures common structure and also learns the patterns of variability between categories. In time series analysis, these modeling goals manifest themselves in the tasks of alignment and difference detection. These tasks have diverse applicability, spanning speech & music processing, equipment & industrial plant diagnosis/monitoring, and analysis of biological time series such as microarray & liquid/gas chromatography-based laboratory data (including mass spectrometry and ultraviolet diode arrays). Although alignment and difference detection have been extensively studied as separate problems in the signal processing and statistical pattern recognition communities, to our knowledge, no existing model performs both tasks in a uniﬁed way. Single class alignment algorithms attempt to align a set of time series all together, assuming that variability across different time series is attributable purely to noise. In many real-world situations, however, we have time series from multiple classes (categories) and our prior belief is that there is both substantial shared structure between the class distributions and, simultaneously, systematic (although often rare) differences between them. While in some circumstances (if differences are small and infrequent), single class alignment can be applied to multi-class data, it is much more desirable to have a model which performs true multi-class alignment in a principled way, allowing for more reﬁned and accurate modeling of the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical Bayesian model which simultaneously solves the multi-class alignment and difference detection tasks in a uniﬁed manner, as illustrated in Figure 1. The single-class alignment shown in this ﬁgure coerces the feature in region A for class 1 to be inappropriately collapsed in time, and the overall width of the main broad peak in class 2 to be inappropriately narrowed. In contrast, our multi-class model handles these features correctly. Furthermore, because our algorithm does inference for a fully probabilistic model, we are able to obtain quantitative measures of the posterior uncertainty in our results, which, unlike the point estimates produced by most current approaches, allow us to assess our relative conﬁdence in differences learned by the model. Our basic setup for multi-class alignment assumes the class labels are known for each time series, as is the case for most difference detection problems. However, as we discuss at the end of the paper, our model can be extended to the completely unsupervised case. normal abnormal 3 common structure 3 1 1 20 0 3 −20 class−specific differences 20 1 0 −20 3 class−specific models 3 A 1 1 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 Figure 1: Nine time series from the NASA valve solenoid current data set [4].

Note that if one generates more HB-CPM MCMC samples, the parent cycles between the two classes since the model has no preference for which class is seen as a modiﬁcation of the other; the child classes remain stable however. 2 A Hierarchical Bayesian Continuous Proﬁle Model Building on our previous Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) [7], we propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Continuous Proﬁle Model (HB-CPM) to address the problems of multi-class alignment and difference detection, together, for sets of sibling time series data — that is, replicate time series from several distinct, but related classes. The HB-CPM is a generative model that allows simultaneous alignment of time series and also provides aligned canonical representations of each class along with measures of uncertainty on these representations. Inference in the model can be used, for example, to detect and quantify similarities and differences in class composition. The HB-CPM extends the basic CPM in two signiﬁcant ways: i) it addresses the multi-class rather than the single-class alignment problem, and ii) it uses a fully Bayesian framework rather than a maximum likelihood approach, allowing us to estimate uncertainty in both the alignments and the canonical representations. Our model, depicted in Figure 2, assumes that each observed time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single, class-speciﬁc latent trace. Each latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series belonging to a single class. An observed time series is generated from this latent trace exactly as in the original CPM, by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as with an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a ‘latent time’ in the latent trace. Thus different choices of hidden state sequences result in different nonlinear transformations of the underlying trace. The HB-CPM uses a separate latent trace for each class, which we call child traces. Crucially, each of these child traces is generated from a single parent trace (also unobserved), which 250 captures the common structure among all of the classes. The joint prior distribution for the child traces in the HB-CPM model can be realized by ﬁrst sampling a parent trace, and then, for each class, sampling a sparse ‘difference vector’ which dictates how and where each child trace should differ from the common parent. z Figure 2: Core elements of the HB-CPM, illustrated with two-class data (hidden and observed) drawn from the model’s prior. parent r1 r2 z1 impulse z2 child trace child trace x1 x2 x3 class 1 observed time series 2.1 impulse x4 x5 x6 class 2 observed time series The Prior on Latent Traces Let the vector xk = (xk , xk , ..., xk ) represent the k th observed scalar time series, and w k ∈ 1..C 1 2 N be the class label of this time series. Also, let z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ) be the parent trace, and c c c z c = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ) be the child trace for the cth class. During inference, posterior samples of c z form a canonical representation of the observed times series in class c, and z contains their common sub-structure. Ideally, the length of the latent traces, M , would be very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments, and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent traces is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made to effectively speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. As mentioned previously, the child traces in the HB-CPM inherit most of their structure from a common parent trace. The differences between child and parent are encoded in a difference vector for each class, dc = (dc , dc , ..., dc ); normally, most elements of dc are close to zero. Child traces 1 2 M are obtained by adding this difference vector to the parent trace: z c = z + dc . We model both the parent trace and class-speciﬁc difference vectors with what we call an energy impulse chain, which is an undirected Markov chain in which neighbouring nodes are encouraged to be similar (i.e., smooth), and where this smoothness is perturbed by a set of marginally independent energy impulse nodes, with one energy impulse node attached to each node in the chain. For the difc c c ference vector of the cth class, the corresponding energy impulses are denoted r c = (r1 , r2 , ..., rM ), and for the parent trace the energy impulses are denoted r = (r1 , r2 , ..., rM ). Conditioned on the energy impulses, the probability of a difference vector is p(dc |r c , αc , ρc ) = 1 1 exp − Zr c 2 M −1 i=1 M c (dc − dc )2 (dc − ri )2 i i+1 i + c c α ρ i=1 . (1) Here, Zrc is the normalizing constant for this probability density, αc controls the smoothness of the chain, and ρc controls the inﬂuence of the energy impulses. Together, αc and ρc also control the overall tightness of the distribution for dc . Presently, we set all αc = α , and similarly ρc = ρ — that is, these do not differ between classes. Similarly, the conditional probability of the parent trace is p(z|r, α, ρ) = 1 1 exp − Zr 2 M −1 i=1 M (zi − zi+1 )2 (zi − ri )2 + α ρ i=1 . (2) These probability densities are each multivariate Gaussian with tridiagonal precision matrixes (corresponding to the Markov nature of the interactions). Each component of each energy impulse for the parent, rj , is drawn independently from a single univariate Gaussian, N (ri |µpar , spar ), whose mean and variance are in turn drawn from a Gaussian and inverse-gamma, respectively. The class-speciﬁc difference vector impulses, however, are drawn from a mixture of two zero-mean Gaussians — one ‘no difference’ (inlier) Gaussian, and one ‘classdifference’ (outlier) Gaussian. The means are zero so as to encourage difference vectors to be near c zero (and thus child traces to be similar to the parent trace). Letting δi denote the binary latent c mixture component indicator variables for each rj , c c c c p(δj ) = Multinomial(δj |mc , mc ) = (mc )δj (mc )1−δj in out in out c c p(rj |δj ) = c N (rj |0, s2 ), in c N (rj |0, s2 ), out if if c δj c δj =1 . =0 (3) (4) Each Gaussian mixture variance has an Inverse-Gamma prior, which for the ‘no difference’ variance, s2 , is set to have very low mean (and not overly dispersed) so that ‘no difference’ regions truly have in little difference from the parent class, while for the ‘class-difference’ variance, s 2 , the prior is out set to have a larger mean, so as to model our belief that substantial class-speciﬁc differences do occasionally exist. The priors for αc , ρc , α, ρ are each log-normal (inverse-gamma priors would not be conjugate in this model, so we use log-normals which are easier to specify). Additionally, the mixing proportions, mc , mc , have a Dirichlet prior, which typically encodes our belief that the out in proportion that are ‘class differences’ is likely to be small. 2.2 The HMM Portion of the Model Each observed xk is modeled as being generated by an HMM conditioned on the appropriate child k trace, z w . The probability of an observed time series conditioned on a path of hidden time states, k N wk τ k , and the child trace, is given by p(xk |z w , τ k ) = i=1 N (xk |zτ k uk , ξ k ), where ξ k is the i i emission variance for time series k, and the scale factor, uk , allows for constant, global, multiplicak tive rescaling. The HMM transition probabilities T k (τi−1 → τik ) are multinomial within a limited k k range, with p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = κ(a−b) for (a − b) ∈ [1, Jτ ] and pk (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = 0 for (a − b) < 1 or (a − b) > Jτ where Jτ is the maximum allowable number of consecutive time Jτ states that can be advanced in a single transition. (Of course, i=1 κk = 1.) This multinomial disi tribution, in turn, has a Dirichlet prior. The HMM emission variances, ξ k , have an inverse-gamma prior. Additionally, the prior over the ﬁrst hidden time state is a uniform distribution over a constant number of states, 1..Q, where Q deﬁnes how large a shift can exist between any two observed time series. The prior over each global scaling parameter, uk , is a log-normal with ﬁxed variance and mean of zero, which encourages the scaling factors to remain near unity. 3 Posterior Inference of Alignments and Parameters by MCMC Given a set of observed time series (and their associated class labels), the main computational operation to be performed in the HB-CPM is inference of the latent traces, alignment state paths and other model parameters. Exact inference is analytically intractable, but we are able to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to create an iterative algorithm which, if run for sufﬁciently long, produces samples from the correct posterior distribution. This posterior provides simultaneous alignments of all observed time series in all classes, and also, crucially, aligned canonical representations of each class, along with error bars on these representations, allowing for a principled approach to difference detection in time series data from different classes. We may also wish to obtain a posterior estimate of some of our parameters conditioned on the data, and marginalized over the other parameters. In particular, we might be interested in obtaining the posterior over hidden time state vectors for each time series, τ k , which together provide a simultaneous, multi-class alignment of our data. We may, in addition, or, alternatively, be interested in the posterior of the child traces, z c , which together characterize how the classes agree and disagree. The former may be more of interest for visualizing aligned observed time series, or in expanding out aligned scalar time series to a related vector time series, while the latter would be more of interest when looking to characterize differences in multi-class, scalar time series data. We group our parameters into blocks, and sample these blocks conditioned on the values of the other parameters (as in Gibbs sampling) — however, when certain conditional distributions are not amenable to direct sampling, we use slice sampling [8]. The scalar conditional distributions for each c of µpar , spar , mc , mc , δj , κk are known distributions, amenable to direct sampling. The conditional out i in distributions for the scalars αc , ρc , α, ρ and uk are not tractable, and for each of these we use slice sampling (doubling out and shrinking). The conditional distribution for each of r and r c is multivariate Gaussian, and we sample directly from each using a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. 1 p(r|z, α, ρ) = p(z|r, α, ρ)p(r) = N (r|c, C) (5) Z 1 p(r c |dc , αc , ρc ) = p(dc |r, αc , ρc )p(r) = N (r c |b, B), (6) Z where, using I to denote the identity matrix, −1 µpar z S + Ispar −1 +I (7) , c=C C= ρ2 ρ spar B= S† 2 (ρc ) −1 +v c −1 , b=B dc . ρc (8) −1 The diagonal matrix v c consists of mixture component variances (s2 or s2 ). S −1 [or S † ] is the out in tridiagonal precision matrix of the multivariate normal distribution p(z|r, α, ρ) [or p(d c |r c , αc , ρc )], −1 −1 2 1 1 1 and has entries Sj,j = α + ρ for j = 2..(M − 1), Sj,j = α + ρ for j = 1, M , and −1 −1 −1 1 Sj,j+1 = Sj+1,j = − α [or analogously for S † ]. The computation of C and B can be made more efﬁcient by using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix inversion lemma. For example, −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 B = (ρ1)2 (S † − S † (v c + S † )−1 S † ), and we have S −1 [or S † ] almost for free, and c no longer need to invert S [or S † ] to obtain it. The conditional distributions of each of z, z c are also multivariate Gaussians. However, because of the underlying Markov dependencies, their precision matrixes are tridiagonal, and hence we can use belief propagation, in the style of Kalman ﬁltering, followed by a stochastic traceback to sample from them efﬁciently. Thus each can be sampled in time proportional to M rather than M 3 , as required for a general multivariate Gaussian. Lastly, to sample from the conditional distribution of the hidden time vectors for each sample, τ k , we run belief propagation (analogous to the HMM forward-backward algorithm) followed by a stochastic traceback. In our experiments, the parent trace was initialized by averaging one smoothed example from each class. The child traces were initialized to the initial parent trace. The HMM states were initialized by a Viterbi decoding with respect to the initial values of the other parameters. The scaling factors were initialized to unity, and the child energy impulses to zero. MCMC was run for 5000 iterations, with convergence generally realized in less than 1000 iterations. 4 Experiments and Results We demonstrate use of the HB-CPM on two data sets. The ﬁrst data set is the part of the NASA shuttle valve data [4], which measures valve solenoid current against time for some ‘normal’ runs and some ‘abnormal’ runs. Measurements were taken at a rate of 1ms per sample, with 1000 samples per time series. We subsampled the data by a factor of 7 in time since it was extremely dense. The results of performing posterior inference in our model on this two-class data set are shown in Figure 1. They nicely match our intuition of what makes a good solution. In our experiments, we also compared our model to a simple “single-class” version of the HB-CPM in which we simply remove the child trace level of the model, letting all observed data in both classes depend directly on one single parent trace. The single-class alignment, while doing a reasonable job, does so by coercing the two classes to look more similar than they should. This is evident in one particular region labeled on the graph and discussed in the legend. Essentially a single class alignment causes us to lose class-speciﬁc ﬁne detail — the precise information we seek to retain for difference detection. The second data set is from a botany study which uses reverse-phase HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) as a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in xenobiotic uptake and metabolism in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Liquid-chromatography (LC) techniques are currently being developed and reﬁned with the aim of providing a robust platform with which to detect differences in biological organisms — be they plants, animals or humans. Detected differences can reveal new fundamental biological insight, or can be applied in more clinical settings. LC-mass spectrometry technology has recently undergone explosive growth in tackling the problem of biomarker discovery — for example, detecting biological markers that can predict treatment outcome or severity of disease, thereby providing the potential for improved health care and better understanding of the mechanisms of drug and disease. In botany, LC-UV data is used to help understand the uptake and metabolism of compounds in plants by looking for differences across experimental conditions, and it is this type of data that we use here. LC separates mixtures of analytes on the basis of some chemical property — hydrophobicity, for reverse-phase LC, used to generate our data. Components of the analyte in our data set were detected as they came off the LC column with a Diode Array Detector (DAD), yielding UV-visible spectra collected at 540 time points (we used the 280 nm band, which is informative for these experiments). We performed background subtraction [2] and then subsampled this data by a factor of four. This is a three-class data set, where the ﬁrst class is untreated plant extract, followed by two classes consisting of this same plant treated with compounds that were identiﬁed as possessing robust uptake in vivo, and, hence, when metabolized, provide a differential LC-UV signal of interest. Figure 3 gives an overview of the LC-UV results, while Figure 4 zooms in on a particular area of interest to highlight how subtle differences can be detected by the HB-CPM, but not by a singleclass alignment scheme. As with the NASA data set, a single-class alignment coerces features across classes that are in fact different to look the same, thereby preventing us from detecting them. Recall that this data set consists of a ‘no treatment’ plant extract, and two ‘treatments’ of this same plant. Though our model was not informed of these special relationships, it nevertheless elegantly captures this structure by giving almost no energy impulses to the ‘no treatment’ class, meaning that this class is essentially the parent trace, and allowing the ‘treatment’ classes to diverge from it, thereby nicely matching the reality of the situation. All averaging over MCMC runs shown is over 4000 samples, after a 1000 burn in period, which took around 3 hours for the NASA data, and 5 hours for the LC data set, on machines with dual 3 GHz Pentium 4 processors. 5 Related Work While much work has been done on time series alignment, and on comparison/clustering of time series, none of this work, to our knowledge, directly addresses the problem presented in this paper — simultaneously aligning and comparing sets of related time series in order to characterize how they differ from one another. The classical algorithm for aligning time series is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [10]. DTW works on pairs of time series, aligning one time series to a speciﬁed reference time, in a non-probabilistic way, without explicit allowance for differences in related time series. More recently, Gaffney et al [5] jointly clustered and aligned time series data from different classes. However, their model does not attempt to put time series from different classes into correspondence with one another — only time series within a class are aligned to one another. Ziv Bar-Joseph et al [1] use a similar approach to cluster and align microarray time series data. Ramsay et al [9] have introduced a curve clustering model, in which a time warping function, h(t), for each time series is learned by way of learning its relative curvature, parameterized with order one B-spline coefﬁcients. This model accounts for 5 5 3 3 9 0 5 −9 9 0 −9 9 3 0 −9 5 5 3 3 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 Figure 3: Seven time series from each of three classes of LC-UV data.

See Figure 4 for a zoom-in in around the arrow. systematic changes in the range and domain of time series in a way that aligns curves with the same fundamental shape. However, their method does not allow for class-speciﬁc differences between shapes to be taken into account. The anomaly detection (AD) literature deals with related, yet distinct problems. For example, Chan et al [3] build a model of one class of time series data (they use the same NASA valve data as in this paper), and then match test data, possibly belonging to another class (e.g. ‘abnormal’ shuttle valve data) to this model to obtain an anomaly score. Emphasis in the AD community is on detecting abnormal events relative to a normal baseline, in an on-line manner, rather than comparing and contrasting two or more classes from a dataset containing examples of all classes. The problem of ‘elastic curve matching‘ is addressed in [6], where a target time series that best matches a query series is found, by mapping the problem of ﬁnding the best matching subsequence to the problem of ﬁnding the cheapest path in a DAG (directed acyclic graph). 6 Discussion and Conclusion We have introduced a hierarchical, Bayesian model to perform detection of rare differences between sets of related time series, a problem which arises across a wide range of domains. By training our model, we obtain the posterior distribution over a set of class-speciﬁc canonical representations of each class, which are aligned in a way that preserves their common sub-structures, yet retains and highlights important differences. This model can be extended in several interesting and useful ways. One small modiﬁcation could be useful for the LC-UV data set presented in this paper, in which one of the classes was ‘no treatment’, while the other two were each a different ‘treatment’. We might model the ‘no treatment’ as the parent trace, and each of the treatments as a child trace, so that the direct comparison of interest would be made more explicit.

Lastly, one could use a model with cyclical latent traces to model cyclic data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and climate data. In such a model, an observed trace being generated by the model would be allowed to cycle back to the start of the latent trace, and the smoothness constraints on the trace would be extended to apply to beginning and end of the traces, coercing these to be similar. Such a model would allow one to do anomaly detection in cyclic data, as well as segmentation.

<p>Author: Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Survival in a non-stationary, potentially adversarial environment requires animals to detect sensory changes rapidly yet accurately, two oft competing desiderata. Neurons subserving such detections are faced with the corresponding challenge to discern “real” changes in inputs as quickly as possible, while ignoring noisy ﬂuctuations. Mathematically, this is an example of a change-detection problem that is actively researched in the controlled stochastic processes community. In this paper, we utilize sophisticated tools developed in that community to formalize an instantiation of the problem faced by the nervous system, and characterize the Bayes-optimal decision policy under certain assumptions. We will derive from this optimal strategy an information accumulation and decision process that remarkably resembles the dynamics of a leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron. This correspondence suggests that neurons are optimized for tracking input changes, and sheds new light on the computational import of intracellular properties such as resting membrane potential, voltage-dependent conductance, and post-spike reset voltage. We also explore the inﬂuence that factors such as timing, uncertainty, neuromodulation, and reward should and do have on neuronal dynamics and sensitivity, as the optimal decision strategy depends critically on these factors. 1</p><p>6 0.087070331 <a title="96-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Nonnegative_Sparse_PCA.html">149 nips-2006-Nonnegative Sparse PCA</a></p>

<p>Author: Ling Huang, Xuanlong Nguyen, Minos Garofalakis, Michael I. Jordan, Anthony Joseph, Nina Taft</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of network anomaly detection in large distributed systems. In this setting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a method for discovering anomalies by continuously tracking the projection of the data onto a residual subspace. This method was shown to work well empirically in highly aggregated networks, that is, those with a limited number of large nodes and at coarse time scales. This approach, however, has scalability limitations. To overcome these limitations, we develop a PCA-based anomaly detector in which adaptive local data ﬁlters send to a coordinator just enough data to enable accurate global detection. Our method is based on a stochastic matrix perturbation analysis that characterizes the tradeoff between the accuracy of anomaly detection and the amount of data communicated over the network.</p><p>2 0.84989268 <a title="96-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-Geometric_entropy_minimization_%28GEM%29_for_anomaly_detection_and_localization.html">85 nips-2006-Geometric entropy minimization (GEM) for anomaly detection and localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N (100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of signiﬁcance α = 1 − ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the inﬂuence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efﬁciently detect outliers at a given level of signiﬁcance and compute their empirical p-values. We illustrate GEM for several simulated and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces. 1</p><p>3 0.34543711 <a title="96-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Detection_of_Infrequent_Differences_in_Sets_of_Time_Series_with_Shared_Structure.html">40 nips-2006-Bayesian Detection of Infrequent Differences in Sets of Time Series with Shared Structure</a></p>
<p>Author: Jennifer Listgarten, Radford M. Neal, Sam T. Roweis, Rachel Puckrin, Sean Cutler</p><p>Abstract: We present a hierarchical Bayesian model for sets of related, but different, classes of time series data. Our model performs alignment simultaneously across all classes, while detecting and characterizing class-speciﬁc differences. During inference the model produces, for each class, a distribution over a canonical representation of the class. These class-speciﬁc canonical representations are automatically aligned to one another — preserving common sub-structures, and highlighting differences. We apply our model to compare and contrast solenoid valve current data, and also, liquid-chromatography-ultraviolet-diode array data from a study of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. 1 Aligning Time Series From Different Classes Many practical problems over a wide range of domains require synthesizing information from several noisy examples of one or more categories in order to build a model which captures common structure and also learns the patterns of variability between categories. In time series analysis, these modeling goals manifest themselves in the tasks of alignment and difference detection. These tasks have diverse applicability, spanning speech & music processing, equipment & industrial plant diagnosis/monitoring, and analysis of biological time series such as microarray & liquid/gas chromatography-based laboratory data (including mass spectrometry and ultraviolet diode arrays). Although alignment and difference detection have been extensively studied as separate problems in the signal processing and statistical pattern recognition communities, to our knowledge, no existing model performs both tasks in a uniﬁed way. Single class alignment algorithms attempt to align a set of time series all together, assuming that variability across different time series is attributable purely to noise. In many real-world situations, however, we have time series from multiple classes (categories) and our prior belief is that there is both substantial shared structure between the class distributions and, simultaneously, systematic (although often rare) differences between them. While in some circumstances (if differences are small and infrequent), single class alignment can be applied to multi-class data, it is much more desirable to have a model which performs true multi-class alignment in a principled way, allowing for more reﬁned and accurate modeling of the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel hierarchical Bayesian model which simultaneously solves the multi-class alignment and difference detection tasks in a uniﬁed manner, as illustrated in Figure 1. The single-class alignment shown in this ﬁgure coerces the feature in region A for class 1 to be inappropriately collapsed in time, and the overall width of the main broad peak in class 2 to be inappropriately narrowed. In contrast, our multi-class model handles these features correctly. Furthermore, because our algorithm does inference for a fully probabilistic model, we are able to obtain quantitative measures of the posterior uncertainty in our results, which, unlike the point estimates produced by most current approaches, allow us to assess our relative conﬁdence in differences learned by the model. Our basic setup for multi-class alignment assumes the class labels are known for each time series, as is the case for most difference detection problems. However, as we discuss at the end of the paper, our model can be extended to the completely unsupervised case. normal abnormal 3 common structure 3 1 1 20 0 3 −20 class−specific differences 20 1 0 −20 3 class−specific models 3 A 1 1 0 50 100 150 200 250 0 50 100 150 200 Figure 1: Nine time series from the NASA valve solenoid current data set [4].

Note that if one generates more HB-CPM MCMC samples, the parent cycles between the two classes since the model has no preference for which class is seen as a modiﬁcation of the other; the child classes remain stable however. 2 A Hierarchical Bayesian Continuous Proﬁle Model Building on our previous Continuous Proﬁle Model (CPM) [7], we propose a Hierarchical Bayesian Continuous Proﬁle Model (HB-CPM) to address the problems of multi-class alignment and difference detection, together, for sets of sibling time series data — that is, replicate time series from several distinct, but related classes. The HB-CPM is a generative model that allows simultaneous alignment of time series and also provides aligned canonical representations of each class along with measures of uncertainty on these representations. Inference in the model can be used, for example, to detect and quantify similarities and differences in class composition. The HB-CPM extends the basic CPM in two signiﬁcant ways: i) it addresses the multi-class rather than the single-class alignment problem, and ii) it uses a fully Bayesian framework rather than a maximum likelihood approach, allowing us to estimate uncertainty in both the alignments and the canonical representations. Our model, depicted in Figure 2, assumes that each observed time series is generated as a noisy transformation of a single, class-speciﬁc latent trace. Each latent trace is an underlying, noiseless representation of the set of replicated, observable time series belonging to a single class. An observed time series is generated from this latent trace exactly as in the original CPM, by moving through a sequence of hidden states in a Markovian manner and emitting an observable value at each step, as with an HMM. Each hidden state corresponds to a ‘latent time’ in the latent trace. Thus different choices of hidden state sequences result in different nonlinear transformations of the underlying trace. The HB-CPM uses a separate latent trace for each class, which we call child traces. Crucially, each of these child traces is generated from a single parent trace (also unobserved), which 250 captures the common structure among all of the classes. The joint prior distribution for the child traces in the HB-CPM model can be realized by ﬁrst sampling a parent trace, and then, for each class, sampling a sparse ‘difference vector’ which dictates how and where each child trace should differ from the common parent. z Figure 2: Core elements of the HB-CPM, illustrated with two-class data (hidden and observed) drawn from the model’s prior. parent r1 r2 z1 impulse z2 child trace child trace x1 x2 x3 class 1 observed time series 2.1 impulse x4 x5 x6 class 2 observed time series The Prior on Latent Traces Let the vector xk = (xk , xk , ..., xk ) represent the k th observed scalar time series, and w k ∈ 1..C 1 2 N be the class label of this time series. Also, let z = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ) be the parent trace, and c c c z c = (z1 , z2 , ..., zM ) be the child trace for the cth class. During inference, posterior samples of c z form a canonical representation of the observed times series in class c, and z contains their common sub-structure. Ideally, the length of the latent traces, M , would be very large relative to N so that any experimental data could be mapped precisely to the correct underlying trace point. Aside from the computational impracticalities this would pose, great care to avoid overﬁtting would have to be taken. Thus in practice, we have used M = (2 + )N (double the resolution, plus some slack on each end) in our experiments, and found this to be sufﬁcient with < 0.2. Because the resolution of the latent traces is higher than that of the observed time series, experimental time can be made to effectively speed up or slow down by advancing along the latent trace in larger or smaller jumps. As mentioned previously, the child traces in the HB-CPM inherit most of their structure from a common parent trace. The differences between child and parent are encoded in a difference vector for each class, dc = (dc , dc , ..., dc ); normally, most elements of dc are close to zero. Child traces 1 2 M are obtained by adding this difference vector to the parent trace: z c = z + dc . We model both the parent trace and class-speciﬁc difference vectors with what we call an energy impulse chain, which is an undirected Markov chain in which neighbouring nodes are encouraged to be similar (i.e., smooth), and where this smoothness is perturbed by a set of marginally independent energy impulse nodes, with one energy impulse node attached to each node in the chain. For the difc c c ference vector of the cth class, the corresponding energy impulses are denoted r c = (r1 , r2 , ..., rM ), and for the parent trace the energy impulses are denoted r = (r1 , r2 , ..., rM ). Conditioned on the energy impulses, the probability of a difference vector is p(dc |r c , αc , ρc ) = 1 1 exp − Zr c 2 M −1 i=1 M c (dc − dc )2 (dc − ri )2 i i+1 i + c c α ρ i=1 . (1) Here, Zrc is the normalizing constant for this probability density, αc controls the smoothness of the chain, and ρc controls the inﬂuence of the energy impulses. Together, αc and ρc also control the overall tightness of the distribution for dc . Presently, we set all αc = α , and similarly ρc = ρ — that is, these do not differ between classes. Similarly, the conditional probability of the parent trace is p(z|r, α, ρ) = 1 1 exp − Zr 2 M −1 i=1 M (zi − zi+1 )2 (zi − ri )2 + α ρ i=1 . (2) These probability densities are each multivariate Gaussian with tridiagonal precision matrixes (corresponding to the Markov nature of the interactions). Each component of each energy impulse for the parent, rj , is drawn independently from a single univariate Gaussian, N (ri |µpar , spar ), whose mean and variance are in turn drawn from a Gaussian and inverse-gamma, respectively. The class-speciﬁc difference vector impulses, however, are drawn from a mixture of two zero-mean Gaussians — one ‘no difference’ (inlier) Gaussian, and one ‘classdifference’ (outlier) Gaussian. The means are zero so as to encourage difference vectors to be near c zero (and thus child traces to be similar to the parent trace). Letting δi denote the binary latent c mixture component indicator variables for each rj , c c c c p(δj ) = Multinomial(δj |mc , mc ) = (mc )δj (mc )1−δj in out in out c c p(rj |δj ) = c N (rj |0, s2 ), in c N (rj |0, s2 ), out if if c δj c δj =1 . =0 (3) (4) Each Gaussian mixture variance has an Inverse-Gamma prior, which for the ‘no difference’ variance, s2 , is set to have very low mean (and not overly dispersed) so that ‘no difference’ regions truly have in little difference from the parent class, while for the ‘class-difference’ variance, s 2 , the prior is out set to have a larger mean, so as to model our belief that substantial class-speciﬁc differences do occasionally exist. The priors for αc , ρc , α, ρ are each log-normal (inverse-gamma priors would not be conjugate in this model, so we use log-normals which are easier to specify). Additionally, the mixing proportions, mc , mc , have a Dirichlet prior, which typically encodes our belief that the out in proportion that are ‘class differences’ is likely to be small. 2.2 The HMM Portion of the Model Each observed xk is modeled as being generated by an HMM conditioned on the appropriate child k trace, z w . The probability of an observed time series conditioned on a path of hidden time states, k N wk τ k , and the child trace, is given by p(xk |z w , τ k ) = i=1 N (xk |zτ k uk , ξ k ), where ξ k is the i i emission variance for time series k, and the scale factor, uk , allows for constant, global, multiplicak tive rescaling. The HMM transition probabilities T k (τi−1 → τik ) are multinomial within a limited k k range, with p (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = κ(a−b) for (a − b) ∈ [1, Jτ ] and pk (τi = a|τi−1 = b) = 0 for (a − b) < 1 or (a − b) > Jτ where Jτ is the maximum allowable number of consecutive time Jτ states that can be advanced in a single transition. (Of course, i=1 κk = 1.) This multinomial disi tribution, in turn, has a Dirichlet prior. The HMM emission variances, ξ k , have an inverse-gamma prior. Additionally, the prior over the ﬁrst hidden time state is a uniform distribution over a constant number of states, 1..Q, where Q deﬁnes how large a shift can exist between any two observed time series. The prior over each global scaling parameter, uk , is a log-normal with ﬁxed variance and mean of zero, which encourages the scaling factors to remain near unity. 3 Posterior Inference of Alignments and Parameters by MCMC Given a set of observed time series (and their associated class labels), the main computational operation to be performed in the HB-CPM is inference of the latent traces, alignment state paths and other model parameters. Exact inference is analytically intractable, but we are able to use Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods to create an iterative algorithm which, if run for sufﬁciently long, produces samples from the correct posterior distribution. This posterior provides simultaneous alignments of all observed time series in all classes, and also, crucially, aligned canonical representations of each class, along with error bars on these representations, allowing for a principled approach to difference detection in time series data from different classes. We may also wish to obtain a posterior estimate of some of our parameters conditioned on the data, and marginalized over the other parameters. In particular, we might be interested in obtaining the posterior over hidden time state vectors for each time series, τ k , which together provide a simultaneous, multi-class alignment of our data. We may, in addition, or, alternatively, be interested in the posterior of the child traces, z c , which together characterize how the classes agree and disagree. The former may be more of interest for visualizing aligned observed time series, or in expanding out aligned scalar time series to a related vector time series, while the latter would be more of interest when looking to characterize differences in multi-class, scalar time series data. We group our parameters into blocks, and sample these blocks conditioned on the values of the other parameters (as in Gibbs sampling) — however, when certain conditional distributions are not amenable to direct sampling, we use slice sampling [8]. The scalar conditional distributions for each c of µpar , spar , mc , mc , δj , κk are known distributions, amenable to direct sampling. The conditional out i in distributions for the scalars αc , ρc , α, ρ and uk are not tractable, and for each of these we use slice sampling (doubling out and shrinking). The conditional distribution for each of r and r c is multivariate Gaussian, and we sample directly from each using a Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix. 1 p(r|z, α, ρ) = p(z|r, α, ρ)p(r) = N (r|c, C) (5) Z 1 p(r c |dc , αc , ρc ) = p(dc |r, αc , ρc )p(r) = N (r c |b, B), (6) Z where, using I to denote the identity matrix, −1 µpar z S + Ispar −1 +I (7) , c=C C= ρ2 ρ spar B= S† 2 (ρc ) −1 +v c −1 , b=B dc . ρc (8) −1 The diagonal matrix v c consists of mixture component variances (s2 or s2 ). S −1 [or S † ] is the out in tridiagonal precision matrix of the multivariate normal distribution p(z|r, α, ρ) [or p(d c |r c , αc , ρc )], −1 −1 2 1 1 1 and has entries Sj,j = α + ρ for j = 2..(M − 1), Sj,j = α + ρ for j = 1, M , and −1 −1 −1 1 Sj,j+1 = Sj+1,j = − α [or analogously for S † ]. The computation of C and B can be made more efﬁcient by using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury matrix inversion lemma. For example, −1 −1 −1 −1 −1 B = (ρ1)2 (S † − S † (v c + S † )−1 S † ), and we have S −1 [or S † ] almost for free, and c no longer need to invert S [or S † ] to obtain it. The conditional distributions of each of z, z c are also multivariate Gaussians. However, because of the underlying Markov dependencies, their precision matrixes are tridiagonal, and hence we can use belief propagation, in the style of Kalman ﬁltering, followed by a stochastic traceback to sample from them efﬁciently. Thus each can be sampled in time proportional to M rather than M 3 , as required for a general multivariate Gaussian. Lastly, to sample from the conditional distribution of the hidden time vectors for each sample, τ k , we run belief propagation (analogous to the HMM forward-backward algorithm) followed by a stochastic traceback. In our experiments, the parent trace was initialized by averaging one smoothed example from each class. The child traces were initialized to the initial parent trace. The HMM states were initialized by a Viterbi decoding with respect to the initial values of the other parameters. The scaling factors were initialized to unity, and the child energy impulses to zero. MCMC was run for 5000 iterations, with convergence generally realized in less than 1000 iterations. 4 Experiments and Results We demonstrate use of the HB-CPM on two data sets. The ﬁrst data set is the part of the NASA shuttle valve data [4], which measures valve solenoid current against time for some ‘normal’ runs and some ‘abnormal’ runs. Measurements were taken at a rate of 1ms per sample, with 1000 samples per time series. We subsampled the data by a factor of 7 in time since it was extremely dense. The results of performing posterior inference in our model on this two-class data set are shown in Figure 1. They nicely match our intuition of what makes a good solution. In our experiments, we also compared our model to a simple “single-class” version of the HB-CPM in which we simply remove the child trace level of the model, letting all observed data in both classes depend directly on one single parent trace. The single-class alignment, while doing a reasonable job, does so by coercing the two classes to look more similar than they should. This is evident in one particular region labeled on the graph and discussed in the legend. Essentially a single class alignment causes us to lose class-speciﬁc ﬁne detail — the precise information we seek to retain for difference detection. The second data set is from a botany study which uses reverse-phase HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) as a high-throughput screening method to identify genes involved in xenobiotic uptake and metabolism in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Liquid-chromatography (LC) techniques are currently being developed and reﬁned with the aim of providing a robust platform with which to detect differences in biological organisms — be they plants, animals or humans. Detected differences can reveal new fundamental biological insight, or can be applied in more clinical settings. LC-mass spectrometry technology has recently undergone explosive growth in tackling the problem of biomarker discovery — for example, detecting biological markers that can predict treatment outcome or severity of disease, thereby providing the potential for improved health care and better understanding of the mechanisms of drug and disease. In botany, LC-UV data is used to help understand the uptake and metabolism of compounds in plants by looking for differences across experimental conditions, and it is this type of data that we use here. LC separates mixtures of analytes on the basis of some chemical property — hydrophobicity, for reverse-phase LC, used to generate our data. Components of the analyte in our data set were detected as they came off the LC column with a Diode Array Detector (DAD), yielding UV-visible spectra collected at 540 time points (we used the 280 nm band, which is informative for these experiments). We performed background subtraction [2] and then subsampled this data by a factor of four. This is a three-class data set, where the ﬁrst class is untreated plant extract, followed by two classes consisting of this same plant treated with compounds that were identiﬁed as possessing robust uptake in vivo, and, hence, when metabolized, provide a differential LC-UV signal of interest. Figure 3 gives an overview of the LC-UV results, while Figure 4 zooms in on a particular area of interest to highlight how subtle differences can be detected by the HB-CPM, but not by a singleclass alignment scheme. As with the NASA data set, a single-class alignment coerces features across classes that are in fact different to look the same, thereby preventing us from detecting them. Recall that this data set consists of a ‘no treatment’ plant extract, and two ‘treatments’ of this same plant. Though our model was not informed of these special relationships, it nevertheless elegantly captures this structure by giving almost no energy impulses to the ‘no treatment’ class, meaning that this class is essentially the parent trace, and allowing the ‘treatment’ classes to diverge from it, thereby nicely matching the reality of the situation. All averaging over MCMC runs shown is over 4000 samples, after a 1000 burn in period, which took around 3 hours for the NASA data, and 5 hours for the LC data set, on machines with dual 3 GHz Pentium 4 processors. 5 Related Work While much work has been done on time series alignment, and on comparison/clustering of time series, none of this work, to our knowledge, directly addresses the problem presented in this paper — simultaneously aligning and comparing sets of related time series in order to characterize how they differ from one another. The classical algorithm for aligning time series is Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) [10]. DTW works on pairs of time series, aligning one time series to a speciﬁed reference time, in a non-probabilistic way, without explicit allowance for differences in related time series. More recently, Gaffney et al [5] jointly clustered and aligned time series data from different classes. However, their model does not attempt to put time series from different classes into correspondence with one another — only time series within a class are aligned to one another. Ziv Bar-Joseph et al [1] use a similar approach to cluster and align microarray time series data. Ramsay et al [9] have introduced a curve clustering model, in which a time warping function, h(t), for each time series is learned by way of learning its relative curvature, parameterized with order one B-spline coefﬁcients. This model accounts for 5 5 3 3 9 0 5 −9 9 0 −9 9 3 0 −9 5 5 3 3 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 150 200 250 Figure 3: Seven time series from each of three classes of LC-UV data.

See Figure 4 for a zoom-in in around the arrow. systematic changes in the range and domain of time series in a way that aligns curves with the same fundamental shape. However, their method does not allow for class-speciﬁc differences between shapes to be taken into account. The anomaly detection (AD) literature deals with related, yet distinct problems. For example, Chan et al [3] build a model of one class of time series data (they use the same NASA valve data as in this paper), and then match test data, possibly belonging to another class (e.g. ‘abnormal’ shuttle valve data) to this model to obtain an anomaly score. Emphasis in the AD community is on detecting abnormal events relative to a normal baseline, in an on-line manner, rather than comparing and contrasting two or more classes from a dataset containing examples of all classes. The problem of ‘elastic curve matching‘ is addressed in [6], where a target time series that best matches a query series is found, by mapping the problem of ﬁnding the best matching subsequence to the problem of ﬁnding the cheapest path in a DAG (directed acyclic graph). 6 Discussion and Conclusion We have introduced a hierarchical, Bayesian model to perform detection of rare differences between sets of related time series, a problem which arises across a wide range of domains. By training our model, we obtain the posterior distribution over a set of class-speciﬁc canonical representations of each class, which are aligned in a way that preserves their common sub-structures, yet retains and highlights important differences. This model can be extended in several interesting and useful ways. One small modiﬁcation could be useful for the LC-UV data set presented in this paper, in which one of the classes was ‘no treatment’, while the other two were each a different ‘treatment’. We might model the ‘no treatment’ as the parent trace, and each of the treatments as a child trace, so that the direct comparison of interest would be made more explicit. Another direction would be to apply the HB-CPM in a completely 300 4 5 0 3 −5 4 5 0 3 −5 4 5 0 3 −5 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 100 105 110 115 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 Figure 4: Left: A zoom in of data displayed in Figure 3, from the region of time 100-150 (labeled in that ﬁgure in latent time, not observed time).

Lastly, one could use a model with cyclical latent traces to model cyclic data such as electrocardiogram (ECG) and climate data. In such a model, an observed trace being generated by the model would be allowed to cycle back to the start of the latent trace, and the smoothness constraints on the trace would be extended to apply to beginning and end of the traces, coercing these to be similar. Such a model would allow one to do anomaly detection in cyclic data, as well as segmentation.

<p>Author: Silvia Richter, Douglas Aberdeen, Jin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Current road-trafﬁc optimisation practice around the world is a combination of hand tuned policies with a small degree of automatic adaption. Even state-ofthe-art research controllers need good models of the road trafﬁc, which cannot be obtained directly from existing sensors. We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the trafﬁc signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the trafﬁc system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison. Along the way we extend natural-actor critic approaches to work for distributed and online inﬁnite-horizon problems. 1</p><p>5 0.29300535 <a title="96-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Chained_Boosting.html">50 nips-2006-Chained Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Wesley Huie, Kin F. Kan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to learn to make sequential stopping decisions, such as those made along a processing pipeline. We envision a scenario in which a series of decisions must be made as to whether to continue to process. Further processing costs time and resources, but may add value. Our goal is to create, based on historic data, a series of decision rules (one at each stage in the pipeline) that decide, based on information gathered up to that point, whether to continue processing the part. We demonstrate how our framework encompasses problems from manufacturing to vision processing. We derive a quadratic (in the number of decisions) bound on testing performance and provide empirical results on object detection. 1 Pipelined Decisions In many decision problems, all of the data do not arrive at the same time. Often further data collection can be expensive and we would like to make a decision without accruing the added cost. Consider silicon wafer manufacturing. The wafer is processed in a series of stages. After each stage some tests are performed to judge the quality of the wafer. If the wafer fails (due to ﬂaws), then the processing time, energy, and materials are wasted. So, we would like to detect such a failure as early as possible in the production pipeline. A similar problem can occur in vision processing. Consider the case of object detection in images. Often low-level pixel operations (such as downsampling an image) can be performed in parallel by dedicated hardware (on a video capture board, for example). However, searching each subimage patch of the whole image to test whether it is the object in question takes time that is proportional to the number of pixels. Therefore, we can imagine a image pipeline in which low resolution versions of the whole image are scanned ﬁrst. Subimages which are extremely unlikely to contain the desired object are rejected and only those which pass are processed at higher resolution. In this way, we save on many pixel operations and can reduce the cost in time to process an image. Even if downsampling is not possible through dedicated hardware, for most object detection schemes, the image must be downsampled to form an image pyramid in order to search for the object at different scales. Therefore, we can run the early stages of such a pipelined detector at the low resolution versions of the image and throw out large regions of the high resolution versions. Most of the processing is spent searching for small faces (at the high resolutions), so this method can save a lot of processing. Such chained decisions also occur if there is a human in the decision process (to ask further clarifying questions in database search, for instance). We propose a framework that can model all of these scenarios and allow such decision rules to be learned from historic data. We give a learning algorithm based on the minimization of the exponential loss and conclude with some experimental results. 1.1 Problem Formulation Let there be s stages to the processing pipeline. We assume that there is a static distribution from which the parts, objects, or units to be processed are drawn. Let p(x, c) represent this distribution in which x is a vector of the features of this unit and c represents the costs associated with this unit. In particular, let xi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the set of measurements (features) available to the decision maker immediately following stage i. Let c i (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the cost of rejecting (or stopping the processing of) this unit immediately following stage i. Finally, let c s+1 be the cost of allowing the part to pass through all processing stages. Note that ci need not be monotonic in i. To take our wafer manufacturing example, for wafers that are good we might let c i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, indicating that if a wafer is rejected at any stage, one unit of work has been invested for each stage of processing. For the same good wafers, we might let cs+1 = s − 1000, indicating that the value of a completed wafer is 1000 units and therefore the total cost is the processing cost minus the resulting value. For a ﬂawed wafer, the values might be the same, except for c s+1 which we would set to s, indicating that there is no value for a bad wafer. Note that the costs may be either positive or negative. However, only their relative values are important. Once a part has been drawn from the distribution, there is no way of affecting the “base level” for the value of the part. Therefore, we assume for the remainder of this paper that c i ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s + 1 and that ci = 0 for some value of i (between 1 and s + 1). Our goal is to produce a series of decision rules f i (xi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We let fi have a range of {0, 1} and let 0 indicate that processing should continue and 1 indicate that processing should be halted. We let f denote the collection of these s decision rules and augment the collection with an additional rule f s+1 which is identically 1 (for ease of notation). The cost of using these rules to halt processing an example is therefore s+1 i−1 ci fi (xi ) L(f (x), c) = i=1 (1 − fj (xj )) . j=1 We would like to ﬁnd a set of decision rules that minimize E p [L(f (x), c)]. While p(x, c) is not known, we do have a series of samples (training set) D = {(x1 , c1 ), (x2 , c2 ), . . . , (xn , cn )} of n examples drawn from the distribution p. We use superscripts to denote the example index and subscripts to denote the stage index. 2 Boosting Solution For this paper, we consider constructing the rules f i from simpler decision rules, much as in the Adaboost algorithm [1, 2]. We assume that each decision f i (xi ) is computed as the threshold of another function g i (xi ): fi (xi ) = I(gi (xi ) > 0).1 We bound the empirical risk: n n s+1 L(f (xk ), ck ) = i−1 ck I(gi (xk ) > 0) i i k=1 i=1 k=1 n s+1 j=1 k i−1 ck egi (xi ) i ≤ k=1 i=1 I(gj (xk ) ≤ 0) j k n s+1 j=1 k ck egi (xi )− i e−gj (xj ) = Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j . (1) k=1 i=1 Our decision to make all costs positive ensures that the bounds hold. Our decision to make the optimal cost zero helps to ensure that the bound is reasonably tight. As in boosting, we restrict g i (xi ) to take the form mi αi,l hi,l (xi ), the weighted sum of m i subl=1 classiﬁers, each of which returns either −1 or +1. We will construct these weighted sums incrementally and greedily, adding one additional subclassiﬁer and associated weight at each step. We will pick the stage, weight, and function of the subclassiﬁer in order to make the largest negative change in the exponential bound to the empirical risk. The subclassiﬁers, h i,l will be drawn from a small class of hypotheses, H. 1 I is the indicator function that equals 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. 1. Initialize gi (x) = 0 for all stages i k 2. Initialize wi = ck for all stages i and examples k. i 3. For each stage i: (a) Calculate targets for each training example, as shown in equation 5. (b) Let h be the result of running the base learner on this set. (c) Calculate the corresponding α as per equation 3. (d) Score this classiﬁcation as per equation 4 ¯ 4. Select the stage ¯ with the best (highest) score. Let h and α be the classiﬁer and ı ¯ weight found at that stage. ¯¯ 5. Let g¯(x) ← g¯(x) + αh(x). ı ı 6. Update the weights (see equation 2): ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, multiply w¯ by eαh(x¯ ) . ı ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, j > ¯, multiply wj by e−αh(x¯ ) . ı 7. Repeat from step 3 Figure 1: Chained Boosting Algorithm 2.1 Weight Optimization We ﬁrst assume that the stage at which to add a new subclassiﬁer and the subclassiﬁer to add have ¯ ¯ already been chosen: ¯ and h, respectively. That is, h will become h¯,m¯+1 but we simplify it for ı ı ı ease of expression. Our goal is to ﬁnd α ¯,m¯+1 which we similarly abbreviate to α. We ﬁrst deﬁne ¯ ı ı k k wi = ck egi (xi )− i Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j (2) + as the weight of example k at stage i, or its current contribution to our risk bound. If we let D h be ¯ − ¯ the set of indexes of the members of D for which h returns +1, and let D h be similarly deﬁned for ¯ ¯ returns −1, we can further deﬁne those for which h s+1 + W¯ = ı k w¯ + ı + k∈Dh ¯ s+1 k wi − W¯ = ı − ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ k w¯ + ı − k∈Dh ¯ k wi . + ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ + ¯ We interpret W¯ to be the sum of the weights which h will emphasize. That is, it corresponds to ı ¯ ¯ the weights along the path that h selects: For those examples for which h recommends termination, we add the current weight (related to the cost of stopping the processing at this stage). For those ¯ examples for which h recommends continued processing, we add in all future weights (related to all − future costs associated with this example). W¯ can be similarly interpreted to be the weights (or ı ¯ costs) that h recommends skipping. If we optimize the loss bound of Equation 1 with respect to α, we obtain ¯ α= ¯ 1 Wı− log ¯ . + 2 W¯ ı (3) The more weight (cost) that the rule recommends to skip, the higher its α coefﬁcient. 2.2 Full Optimization Using Equation 3 it is straight forward to show that the reduction in Equation 1 due to the addition of this new subclassiﬁer will be + ¯ − ¯ W¯ (1 − eα ) + W¯ (1 − e−α ) . ı ı (4) We know of no efﬁcient method for determining ¯, the stage at which to add a subclassiﬁer, except ı by exhaustive search. However, within a stage, the choice of which subclassiﬁer to use becomes one of maximizing n s+1 k¯ k k z¯ h(x¯ ) , where z¯ = ı ı ı k k wi − w¯ ı (5) i=¯+1 ı k=1 ¯ with respect to h. This is equivalent to an weighted empirical risk minimization where the training 1 2 n k k set is {x¯ , x¯ , . . . , x¯ }. The label of x¯ is the sign of z¯ , and the weight of the same example is the ı ı ı ı ı k magnitude of z¯ . ı 2.3 Algorithm The resulting algorithm is only slightly more complex than standard Adaboost. Instead of a weight vector (one weight for each data example), we now have a weight matrix (one weight for each data example for each stage). We initialize each weight to be the cost associated with halting the corresponding example at the corresponding stage. We start with all g i (x) = 0. The complete algorithm is as in Figure 1. Each time through steps 3 through 7, we complete one “round” and add one additional rule to one stage of the processing. We stop executing this loop when α ≤ 0 or when an iteration counter ¯ exceeds a preset threshold. Bottom-Up Variation In situations where information is only gained after each stage (such as in section 4), we can also train the classiﬁers “bottom-up.” That is, we can start by only adding classiﬁers to the last stage. Once ﬁnished with it, we proceed to the previous stage, and so on. Thus instead of selecting the best stage, i, in each round, we systematically work our way backward through the stages, never revisiting previously set stages. 3 Performance Bounds Using the bounds in [3] we can provide a risk bound for this problem. We let E denote the expectaˆ tion with respect to the true distribution p(x, c) and En denote the empirical average with respect to the n training samples. We ﬁrst bound the indicator function with a piece-wise linear function, b θ , 1 with a maximum slope of θ : z ,0 . I(z > 0) ≤ bθ (z) = max min 1, 1 + θ We then bound the loss: L(f (x), c) ≤ φ θ (f (x), c) where s+1 φθ (f (x), c) = ci min{bθ (gi (xi )), bθ (−gi−1 (xi−1 )), bθ (−gi−2 (xi−2 )), . . . , bθ (−g1 (x1 ))} i=1 s+1 i ci Bθ (gi (xi ), gi−1 (xi−1 ), . . . , g1 (x1 )) = i=1 We replaced the product of indicator functions with a minimization and then bounded each indicator i with bθ . Bθ is just a more compact presentation of the composition of the function b θ and the minimization. We assume that the weights α at each stage have been scaled to sum to 1. This has no affect on the resulting classiﬁcations, but is necessary for the derivation below. Before stating the theorem, for clarity, we state two standard deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 1. Let p(x) be a probability distribution on the set X and let {x 1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be n independent samples from p(x). Let σ 1 , σ 2 , . . . , σ n be n independent samples from a Rademacher random variable (a binary variable that takes on either +1 or −1 with equal probability). Let F be a class of functions mapping X to . Deﬁne the Rademacher Complexity of F to be Rn (F ) = E sup f ∈F n 1 n σ i f (xi ) i=1 1 where the expectation is over the random draws of x through xn and σ 1 through σ n . Deﬁnition 2. Let p(x), {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }, and F be as above. Let g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n be n independent samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Analogous to the above deﬁnition, deﬁne the Gaussian Complexity of G to be Gn (F ) = E sup f ∈F 1 n n g i f (xi ) . i=1 We can now state our theorem, bounding the true risk by a function of the empirical risk: Theorem 3. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hs be the sequence of the sets of functions from which the base classiﬁer draws for chain boosting. If H i is closed under negation for all i, all costs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the weights for the classiﬁers at each stage sum to 1, then with probability 1 − δ, k ˆ E [L(f (x), c)] ≤ En [φθ (f (x), c)] + θ s (i + 1)Gn (Hi ) + i=1 8 ln 2 δ n for some constant k. Proof. Theorem 8 of [3] states ˆ E [L(x, c)] ≤ En (φθ (f (x), c)) + 2Rn (φθ ◦ F ) + 8 ln 2 δ n and therefore we need only bound the R n (φθ ◦ F ) term to demonstrate our theorem. For our case, we have 1 Rn (φθ ◦ F ) = E sup n f ∈F = E sup f ∈F 1 n s+1 ≤ E sup j=1 f ∈F n n σ i φθ (f (xi ), ci ) i=1 s+1 σi i=1 1 n s ci Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) j j j−1 1 j=1 n s+1 s σ i Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) = j j−1 1 i=1 s Rn (Bθ ◦ G j ) j=1 where Gi is the space of convex combinations of functions from H i and G i is the cross product of G1 through Gi . The inequality comes from switching the expectation and the maximization and then from dropping the c i (see [4], lemma 5). j s s Lemma 4 of [3] states that there exists a k such that R n (Bθ ◦ G j ) ≤ kGn (Bθ ◦ G j ). Theorem 14 j 2 s j s of the same paper allows us to conclude that G n (Bθ ◦ G ) ≤ θ i=1 Gn (Gi ). (Because Bθ is the 1 s minimum over a set of functions with maximum slope of θ , the maximum slope of B θ is also 1 .) θ Theorem 12, part 2 states G n (Gi ) = Gn (Hi ). Taken together, this proves our result. Note that this bound has only quadratic dependence on s, the length of the chain and does not explicitly depend on the number of rounds of boosting (the number of rounds affects φ θ which, in turn, affects the bound). 4 Application We tested our algorithm on the MIT face database [5]. This database contains 19-by-19 gray-scale images of faces and non-faces. The training set has 2429 face images and 4548 non-face images. The testing set has 472 faces and 23573 non-faces. We weighted the training set images so that the ratio of the weight of face images to non-face images matched the ratio in the testing set. 0.4 0.4 CB Global CB Bottom−up SVM Boosting 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 150 0.2 100 0.1 False positive rate 0.3 50 Average number of pixels 0.35 average cost/error per example 200 training cost training error testing cost testing error 0.05 0 100 200 300 400 500 number of rounds 700 1000 (a) 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 False negative rate 0.8 0 1 (b) Figure 2: (a) Accuracy verses the number of rounds for a typical run, (b) Error rates and average costs for a variety of cost settings. 4.1 Object Detection as Chained Boosting Our goal is to produce a classiﬁer that can identify non-face images at very low resolutions, thereby allowing for quick processing of large images (as explained later). Most image patches (or subwindows) do not contain faces. We, therefore, built a multi-stage detection system where any early rejection is labeled as a non-face. The ﬁrst stage looks at image patches of size 3-by-3 (i.e. a lowerresolution version of the 19-by-19 original image). The next stage looks at the same image, but at a resolution of 6-by-6. The third stage considers the image at 12-by-12. We did not present the full 19-by-19 images as the classiﬁcation did not signiﬁcantly improve over the 12-by-12 versions. We employ a simple base classiﬁer: the set of all functions that look at a single pixel and predict the class by thresholding the pixel’s value. The total classiﬁer at any stage is a linear combination of these simple classiﬁers. For a given stage, all of the base classiﬁers that target a particular pixel are added together producing a complex function of the value of the pixel. Yet, this pixel can only take on a ﬁnite number of values (256 in this case). Therefore, we can compile this set of base classiﬁers into a single look-up function that maps the brightness of the pixel into a real number. The total classiﬁer for the whole stage is merely the sum of these look-up functions. Therefore, the total work necessary to compute the classiﬁcation at a stage is proportional to the number of pixels in the image considered at that stage, regardless of the number of base classiﬁers used. We therefore assign a cost to each stage of processing proportional to the number of pixels at that stage. If the image is a face, we add a negative cost (i.e. bonus) if the image is allowed to pass through all of the processing stages (and is therefore “accepted” as a face). If the image is a nonface, we add a bonus if the image is rejected at any stage before completion (i.e. correctly labelled). While this dataset has only segmented image patches, in a real application, the classiﬁer would be run on all sub-windows of an image. More importantly, it would also be run at multiple resolutions in order to detect faces of different sizes (or at different distances from the camera). The classiﬁer chain could be run simultaneously at each of these resolutions. To wit, while running the ﬁnal 12-by12 stage at one resolution of the image, the 6-by-6 (previous) stage could be run at the same image resolution. This 6-by-6 processing would be the necessary pre-processing step to running the 12-by12 stage at a higher resolution. As we run our ﬁnal scan for big faces (at a low resolution), we can already (at the same image resolution) be performing initial tests to throw out portions of the image as not worthy of testing for smaller faces (at a higher resolution). Most of the work of detecting objects must be done at the high resolutions because there are many more overlapping subwindows. This chained method allows the culling of most of this high-resolution image processing. 4.2 Experiments For each example, we construct a vector of stage costs as above. We add a constant to this vector to ensure that the minimal element is zero, as per section 1.1. We scale all vectors by the same amount to ensure that the maximal value is 1.This means that the number of misclassiﬁcations is an upper bound on the total cost that the learning algorithm is trying to minimize. There are three ﬂexible quantities in this problem formulation: the cost of a pixel evaluation, the bonus for a correct face classiﬁcation, and the bonus for a correct non-face classiﬁcation. Changing these quantities will control the trade-off between false positives and true positives, and between classiﬁcation error and speed. Figure 2(a) shows the result of a typical run of the algorithm. As a function of the number of rounds, it plots the cost (that which the algorithm is trying to minimize) and the error (number of misclassiﬁed image patches), for both the training and testing sets (where the training set has been reweighted to have the same proportion of faces to non-faces as the testing set). We compared our algorithm’s performance to the performance of support vector machines (SVM) [6] and Adaboost [1] trained and tested on the highest resolution, 12-by-12, image patches. We employed SVM-light [7] with a linear kernels. Figure 2(b) compares the error rates for the methods (solid lines, read against the left vertical axis). Note that the error rates are almost identical for the methods. The dashed lines (read against the right vertical axis) show the average number of pixels evaluated (or total processing cost) for each of the methods. The SVM and Adaboost algorithms have a constant processing cost. Our method (by either training scheme) produces lower processing cost for most error rates. 5 Related Work Cascade detectors for vision processing (see [8] or [9] for example) may appear to be similar to the work in this paper. Especially at ﬁrst glance for the area of object detection, they appear almost the same. However, cascade detection and this work (chained detection) are quite different. Cascade detectors are built one at a time. A coarse detector is ﬁrst trained. The examples which pass that detector are then passed to a ﬁner detector for training, and so on. A series of targets for false-positive rates deﬁne the increasing accuracy of the detector cascade. By contrast, our chain detectors are trained as an ensemble. This is necessary because of two differences in the problem formulation. First, we assume that the information available at each stage changes. Second, we assume there is an explicit cost model that dictates the cost of proceeding from stage to stage and the cost of rejection (or acceptance) at any particular stage. By contrast, cascade detectors are seeking to minimize computational power necessary for a ﬁxed decision. Therefore, the information available to all of the stages is the same, and there are no ﬁxed costs associated with each stage. The ability to train all of the classiﬁers at the same time is crucial to good performance in our framework. The ﬁrst classiﬁer in the chain cannot determine whether it is advantageous to send an example further along unless it knows how the later stages will process the example. Conversely, the later stages cannot construct optimal classiﬁcations until they know the distribution of examples that they will see. Section 4.1 may further confuse the matter. We demonstrated how chained boosting can be used to reduce the computational costs of object detection in images. Cascade detectors are often used for the same purpose. However, the reductions in computational time come from two different sources. In cascade detectors, the time taken to evaluate a given image patch is reduced. In our chained detector formulation, image patches are ignored completely based on analysis of lower resolution patches in the image pyramid. To further illustrate the difference, cascade detectors can always be used to speed up asymmetric classiﬁcation tasks (and are often applied to image detection). By contrast, in Section 4.1 we have exploited the fact that object detection in images is typically performed at multiple scales to turn the problem into a pipeline and apply our framework. Cascade detectors address situations in which prior class probabilities are not equal, while chained detectors address situations in which information is gained at a cost. Both are valid (and separate) ways of tackling image processing (and other tasks as well). In many ways, they are complementary approaches. Classic sequence analysis [10, 11] also addresses the problem of optimal stopping. However, it assumes that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from (usually) a known distribution. Our problem is quite different in that each consecutive sample is drawn from a different (and related) distribution and our goal is to ﬁnd a decision rule without producing a generative model. WaldBoost [12] is a boosting algorithm based on this. It builds a series of features and a ratio comparison test in order to decide when to stop. For WaldBoost, the available features (information) not change between stages. Rather, any feature is available for selection at any point in the chain. Again, this is a different problem than the one considered in this paper. 6 Conclusions We feel this framework of staged decision making is useful in a wide variety of areas. This paper demonstrated how the framework applies to one vision processing task. Obviously it also applies to manufacturing pipelines where errors can be introduced at different stages. It should also be applicable to scenarios where information gathering is costly. Our current formulation only allows for early negative detection. In the face detection example above, this means that in order to report “face,” the classiﬁer must process each stage, even if the result is assured earlier. In Figure 2(b), clearly the upper-left corner (100% false positives and 0% false negatives) is reachable with little effort: classify everything positive without looking at any features. We would like to extend this framework to cover such two-sided early decisions. While perhaps not useful in manufacturing (or even face detection, where the interesting part of the ROC curve is far from the upper-left), it would make the framework more applicable to informationgathering applications.

<p>Author: Ling Huang, Xuanlong Nguyen, Minos Garofalakis, Michael I. Jordan, Anthony Joseph, Nina Taft</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of network anomaly detection in large distributed systems. In this setting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a method for discovering anomalies by continuously tracking the projection of the data onto a residual subspace. This method was shown to work well empirically in highly aggregated networks, that is, those with a limited number of large nodes and at coarse time scales. This approach, however, has scalability limitations. To overcome these limitations, we develop a PCA-based anomaly detector in which adaptive local data ﬁlters send to a coordinator just enough data to enable accurate global detection. Our method is based on a stochastic matrix perturbation analysis that characterizes the tradeoff between the accuracy of anomaly detection and the amount of data communicated over the network.</p><p>2 0.68082905 <a title="96-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Scalable_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Go.html">13 nips-2006-A Scalable Machine Learning Approach to Go</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Wu, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for AI and machine learning. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 × 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 × 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are brieﬂy discussed. 1</p><p>3 0.5782243 <a title="96-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Convex_Repeated_Games_and_Fenchel_Duality.html">61 nips-2006-Convex Repeated Games and Fenchel Duality</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithmic framework for an abstract game which we term a convex repeated game. We show that various online learning and boosting algorithms can be all derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework. This uniﬁed view explains the properties of existing algorithms and also enables us to derive several new interesting algorithms. Our algorithmic framework stems from a connection that we build between the notions of regret in game theory and weak duality in convex optimization. 1 Introduction and Problem Setting Several problems arising in machine learning can be modeled as a convex repeated game. Convex repeated games are closely related to online convex programming (see [19, 9] and the discussion in the last section). A convex repeated game is a two players game that is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t of the repeated game, the ﬁrst player chooses a vector wt from a convex set S. Next, the second player responds with a convex function gt : S → R. Finally, the ﬁrst player suffers an instantaneous loss gt (wt ). We study the game from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player. The goal of the ﬁrst player is to minimize its cumulative loss, t gt (wt ). To motivate this rather abstract setting let us ﬁrst cast the more familiar setting of online learning as a convex repeated game. Online learning is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t, the learner ﬁrst receives a question, cast as a vector xt , and is required to provide an answer for this question. For example, xt can be an encoding of an email message and the question is whether the email is spam or not. The prediction of the learner is performed based on an hypothesis, ht : X → Y, where X is the set of questions and Y is the set of possible answers. In the aforementioned example, Y would be {+1, −1} where +1 stands for a spam email and −1 stands for a benign one. After predicting an answer, the learner receives the correct answer for the question, denoted yt , and suffers loss according to a loss function (ht , (xt , yt )). In most cases, the hypotheses used for prediction come from a parameterized set of hypotheses, H = {hw : w ∈ S}. For example, the set of linear classiﬁers, which is used for answering yes/no questions, is deﬁned as H = {hw (x) = sign( w, x ) : w ∈ Rn }. Thus, rather than saying that on round t the learner chooses a hypothesis, we can say that the learner chooses a vector wt and its hypothesis is hwt . Next, we note that once the environment chooses a question-answer pair (xt , yt ), the loss function becomes a function over the hypotheses space or equivalently over the set of parameter vectors S. We can therefore redeﬁne the online learning process as follows. On round t, the learner chooses a vector wt ∈ S, which deﬁnes a hypothesis hwt to be used for prediction. Then, the environment chooses a questionanswer pair (xt , yt ), which induces the following loss function over the set of parameter vectors, gt (w) = (hw , (xt , yt )). Finally, the learner suffers the loss gt (wt ) = (hwt , (xt , yt )). We have therefore described the process of online learning as a convex repeated game. In this paper we assess the performance of the ﬁrst player using the notion of regret. Given a number of rounds T and a ﬁxed vector u ∈ S, we deﬁne the regret of the ﬁrst player as the excess loss for not consistently playing the vector u, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) . t=1 Our main result is an algorithmic framework for the ﬁrst player which guarantees low regret with respect to any vector u ∈ S. Speciﬁcally, we derive regret bounds that take the following form ∀u ∈ S, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) ≤ t=1 f (u) + L √ , T (1) where f : S → R and L ∈ R+ . Informally, the function f measures the “complexity” of vectors in S and the scalar L is related to some generalized Lipschitz property of the functions g1 , . . . , gT . We defer the exact requirements we impose on f and L to later sections. Our algorithmic framework emerges from a representation of the regret bound given in Eq. (1) using an optimization problem. Speciﬁcally, we rewrite Eq. (1) as follows 1 T T gt (wt ) ≤ inf t=1 u∈S 1 T T gt (u) + t=1 f (u) + L √ . T (2) That is, the average loss of the ﬁrst player should be bounded above by the minimum value of an optimization problem in which we jointly minimize the average loss of u and the “complexity” of u as measured by the function f . Note that the optimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) can only be solved in hindsight after observing the entire sequence of loss functions. Nevertheless, writing the regret bound as in Eq. (2) implies that the average loss of the ﬁrst player forms a lower bound for a minimization problem. The notion of duality, commonly used in convex optimization theory, plays an important role in obtaining lower bounds for the minimal value of a minimization problem (see for example [14]). By generalizing the notion of Fenchel duality, we are able to derive a dual optimization problem, which can be optimized incrementally, as the game progresses. In order to derive explicit quantitative regret bounds we make an immediate use of the fact that dual objective lower bounds the primal objective. We therefore reduce the process of playing convex repeated games to the task of incrementally increasing the dual objective function. The amount by which the dual increases serves as a new and natural notion of progress. By doing so we are able to tie the primal objective value, the average loss of the ﬁrst player, and the increase in the dual. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we establish our notation and point to a few mathematical tools that we use throughout the paper. Our main tool for deriving algorithms for playing convex repeated games is a generalization of Fenchel duality, described in Sec. 3. Our algorithmic framework is given in Sec. 4 and analyzed in Sec. 5. The generality of our framework allows us to utilize it in different problems arising in machine learning. Speciﬁcally, in Sec. 6 we underscore the applicability of our framework for online learning and in Sec. 7 we outline and analyze boosting algorithms based on our framework. We conclude with a discussion and point to related work in Sec. 8. Due to the lack of space, some of the details are omitted from the paper and can be found in [16]. 2 Mathematical Background We denote scalars with lower case letters (e.g. x and w), and vectors with bold face letters (e.g. x and w). The inner product between vectors x and w is denoted by x, w . Sets are designated by upper case letters (e.g. S). The set of non-negative real numbers is denoted by R+ . For any k ≥ 1, the set of integers {1, . . . , k} is denoted by [k]. A norm of a vector x is denoted by x . The dual norm is deﬁned as λ = sup{ x, λ : x ≤ 1}. For example, the Euclidean norm, x 2 = ( x, x )1/2 is dual to itself and the 1 norm, x 1 = i |xi |, is dual to the ∞ norm, x ∞ = maxi |xi |. We next recall a few deﬁnitions from convex analysis. The reader familiar with convex analysis may proceed to Lemma 1 while for a more thorough introduction see for example [1]. A set S is convex if for any two vectors w1 , w2 in S, all the line between w1 and w2 is also within S. That is, for any α ∈ [0, 1] we have that αw1 + (1 − α)w2 ∈ S. A set S is open if every point in S has a neighborhood lying in S. A set S is closed if its complement is an open set. A function f : S → R is closed and convex if for any scalar α ∈ R, the level set {w : f (w) ≤ α} is closed and convex. The Fenchel conjugate of a function f : S → R is deﬁned as f (θ) = supw∈S w, θ − f (w) . If f is closed and convex then the Fenchel conjugate of f is f itself. The Fenchel-Young inequality states that for any w and θ we have that f (w) + f (θ) ≥ w, θ . A vector λ is a sub-gradient of a function f at w if for all w ∈ S we have that f (w ) − f (w) ≥ w − w, λ . The differential set of f at w, denoted ∂f (w), is the set of all sub-gradients of f at w. If f is differentiable at w then ∂f (w) consists of a single vector which amounts to the gradient of f at w and is denoted by f (w). Sub-gradients play an important role in the deﬁnition of Fenchel conjugate. In particular, the following lemma states that if λ ∈ ∂f (w) then Fenchel-Young inequality holds with equality. Lemma 1 Let f be a closed and convex function and let ∂f (w ) be its differential set at w . Then, for all λ ∈ ∂f (w ) we have, f (w ) + f (λ ) = λ , w . A continuous function f is σ-strongly convex over a convex set S with respect to a norm · if S is contained in the domain of f and for all v, u ∈ S and α ∈ [0, 1] we have 1 (3) f (α v + (1 − α) u) ≤ α f (v) + (1 − α) f (u) − σ α (1 − α) v − u 2 . 2 Strongly convex functions play an important role in our analysis primarily due to the following lemma. Lemma 2 Let · be a norm over Rn and let · be its dual norm. Let f be a σ-strongly convex function on S and let f be its Fenchel conjugate. Then, f is differentiable with f (θ) = arg maxx∈S θ, x − f (x). Furthermore, for any θ, λ ∈ Rn we have 1 f (θ + λ) − f (θ) ≤ f (θ), λ + λ 2 . 2σ Two notable examples of strongly convex functions which we use are as follows. 1 Example 1 The function f (w) = 2 w norm. Its conjugate function is f (θ) = 2 2 1 2 is 1-strongly convex over S = Rn with respect to the θ 2. 2 2 n 1 Example 2 The function f (w) = i=1 wi log(wi / n ) is 1-strongly convex over the probabilistic n simplex, S = {w ∈ R+ : w 1 = 1}, with respect to the 1 norm. Its conjugate function is n 1 f (θ) = log( n i=1 exp(θi )). 3 Generalized Fenchel Duality In this section we derive our main analysis tool. We start by considering the following optimization problem, T inf c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) , w∈S where c is a non-negative scalar. An equivalent problem is inf w0 ,w1 ,...,wT c f (w0 ) + T t=1 gt (wt ) s.t. w0 ∈ S and ∀t ∈ [T ], wt = w0 . Introducing T vectors λ1 , . . . , λT , each λt ∈ Rn is a vector of Lagrange multipliers for the equality constraint wt = w0 , we obtain the following Lagrangian T T L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) = c f (w0 ) + t=1 gt (wt ) + t=1 λt , w0 − wt . The dual problem is the task of maximizing the following dual objective value, D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = inf L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) w0 ∈S,w1 ,...,wT = − c sup w0 ∈S = −c f −1 c w0 , − 1 c T t=1 T t=1 λt − λt − f (w0 ) − T t=1 gt (λt ) , T t=1 sup ( wt , λt − gt (wt )) wt where, following the exposition of Sec. 2, f , g1 , . . . , gT are the Fenchel conjugate functions of f, g1 , . . . , gT . Therefore, the generalized Fenchel dual problem is sup − cf λ1 ,...,λT −1 c T t=1 λt − T t=1 gt (λt ) . (4) Note that when T = 1 and c = 1, the above duality is the so called Fenchel duality. 4 A Template Learning Algorithm for Convex Repeated Games In this section we describe a template learning algorithm for playing convex repeated games. As mentioned before, we study convex repeated games from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player which we shortly denote as P1. Recall that we would like our learning algorithm to achieve a regret bound of the form given in Eq. (2). We start by rewriting Eq. (2) as follows T m gt (wt ) − c L ≤ inf u∈S t=1 c f (u) + gt (u) , (5) t=1 √ where c = T . Thus, up to the sublinear term c L, the cumulative loss of P1 lower bounds the optimum of the minimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (5). In the previous section we derived the generalized Fenchel dual of the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Our construction is based on the weak duality theorem stating that any value of the dual problem is smaller than the optimum value of the primal problem. The algorithmic framework we propose is therefore derived by incrementally ascending the dual objective function. Intuitively, by ascending the dual objective we move closer to the optimal primal value and therefore our performance becomes similar to the performance of the best ﬁxed weight vector which minimizes the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Initially, we use the elementary dual solution λ1 = 0 for all t. We assume that inf w f (w) = 0 and t for all t inf w gt (w) = 0 which imply that D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 0. We assume in addition that f is 1 T σ-strongly convex. Therefore, based on Lemma 2, the function f is differentiable. At trial t, P1 uses for prediction the vector wt = f −1 c T i=1 λt i . (6) After predicting wt , P1 receives the function gt and suffers the loss gt (wt ). Then, P1 updates the dual variables as follows. Denote by ∂t the differential set of gt at wt , that is, ∂t = {λ : ∀w ∈ S, gt (w) − gt (wt ) ≥ λ, w − wt } . (7) The new dual variables (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) are set to be any set of vectors which satisfy the following 1 T two conditions: (i). ∃λ ∈ ∂t s.t. D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λ , λt , . . . , λt ) 1 1 t−1 t+1 T T (ii). ∀i > t, λt+1 = 0 i . (8) In the next section we show that condition (i) ensures that the increase of the dual at trial t is proportional to the loss gt (wt ). The second condition ensures that we can actually calculate the dual at trial t without any knowledge on the yet to be seen loss functions gt+1 , . . . , gT . We conclude this section with two update rules that trivially satisfy the above two conditions. The ﬁrst update scheme simply ﬁnds λ ∈ ∂t and set λt+1 = i λ λt i if i = t if i = t . (9) The second update deﬁnes (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) = argmax D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) 1 T λ1 ,...,λT s.t. ∀i = t, λi = λt . i (10) 5 Analysis In this section we analyze the performance of the template algorithm given in the previous section. Our proof technique is based on monitoring the value of the dual objective function. The main result is the following lemma which gives upper and lower bounds for the ﬁnal value of the dual objective function. Lemma 3 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function with respect to a norm · over a set S and assume that minw∈S f (w) = 0. Let g1 , . . . , gT be a sequence of convex and closed functions such that inf w gt (w) = 0 for all t ∈ [T ]. Suppose that a dual-incrementing algorithm which satisﬁes the conditions of Eq. (8) is run with f as a complexity function on the sequence g1 , . . . , gT . Let w1 , . . . , wT be the sequence of primal vectors that the algorithm generates and λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 1 T be its ﬁnal sequence of dual variables. Then, there exists a sequence of sub-gradients λ1 , . . . , λT , where λt ∈ ∂t for all t, such that T 1 gt (wt ) − 2σc t=1 T T λt 2 ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) 1 T t=1 ≤ inf c f (w) + w∈S gt (w) . t=1 Proof The second inequality follows directly from the weak duality theorem. Turning to the left most inequality, denote ∆t = D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) − D(λt , . . . , λt ) and note that 1 1 T T T D(λ1 +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) can be rewritten as T T t=1 D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) = 1 T T t=1 ∆t − D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 1 T ∆t , (11) where the last equality follows from the fact that f (0) = g1 (0) = . . . = gT (0) = 0. The deﬁnition of the update implies that ∆t ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λt , 0, . . . , 0) − D(λt , . . . , λt , 0, 0, . . . , 0) for 1 t−1 1 t−1 t−1 some subgradient λt ∈ ∂t . Denoting θ t = − 1 j=1 λj , we now rewrite the lower bound on ∆t as, c ∆t ≥ −c (f (θ t − λt /c) − f (θ t )) − gt (λt ) . Using Lemma 2 and the deﬁnition of wt we get that 1 (12) ∆t ≥ wt , λt − gt (λt ) − 2 σ c λt 2 . Since λt ∈ ∂t and since we assume that gt is closed and convex, we can apply Lemma 1 to get that wt , λt − gt (λt ) = gt (wt ). Plugging this equality into Eq. (12) and summing over t we obtain that T T T 1 2 . t=1 ∆t ≥ t=1 gt (wt ) − 2 σ c t=1 λt Combining the above inequality with Eq. (11) concludes our proof. The following regret bound follows as a direct corollary of Lemma 3. T 1 Theorem 1 Under the same conditions of Lemma 3. Denote L = T t=1 λt w ∈ S we have, T T c f (w) 1 1 + 2L c . t=1 gt (wt ) − T t=1 gt (w) ≤ T T σ √ In particular, if c = T , we obtain the bound, 1 T 6 T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (w) ≤ f (w)+L/(2 σ) √ T 2 . Then, for all . Application to Online learning In Sec. 1 we cast the task of online learning as a convex repeated game. We now demonstrate the applicability of our algorithmic framework for the problem of instance ranking. We analyze this setting since several prediction problems, including binary classiﬁcation, multiclass prediction, multilabel prediction, and label ranking, can be cast as special cases of the instance ranking problem. Recall that on each online round, the learner receives a question-answer pair. In instance ranking, the question is encoded by a matrix Xt of dimension kt × n and the answer is a vector yt ∈ Rkt . The semantic of yt is as follows. For any pair (i, j), if yt,i > yt,j then we say that yt ranks the i’th row of Xt ahead of the j’th row of Xt . We also interpret yt,i − yt,j as the conﬁdence in which the i’th row should be ranked ahead of the j’th row. For example, each row of Xt encompasses a representation of a movie while yt,i is the movie’s rating, expressed as the number of stars this movie has received by a movie reviewer. The predictions of the learner are determined ˆ based on a weight vector wt ∈ Rn and are deﬁned to be yt = Xt wt . Finally, let us deﬁne two loss functions for ranking, both generalize the hinge-loss used in binary classiﬁcation problems. Denote by Et the set {(i, j) : yt,i > yt,j }. For all (i, j) ∈ Et we deﬁne a pair-based hinge-loss i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) = [(yt,i − yt,j ) − w, xt,i − xt,j ]+ , where [a]+ = max{a, 0} and xt,i , xt,j are respectively the i’th and j’th rows of Xt . Note that i,j is zero if w ranks xt,i higher than xt,j with a sufﬁcient conﬁdence. Ideally, we would like i,j (wt ; (Xt , yt )) to be zero for all (i, j) ∈ Et . If this is not the case, we are being penalized according to some combination of the pair-based losses i,j . For example, we can set (w; (Xt , yt )) to be the average over the pair losses, 1 avg (w; (Xt , yt )) = |Et | (i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . This loss was suggested by several authors (see for example [18]). Another popular approach (see for example [5]) penalizes according to the maximal loss over the individual pairs, max (w; (Xt , yt )) = max(i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . We can apply our algorithmic framework given in Sec. 4 for ranking, using for gt (w) either avg (w; (Xt , yt )) or max (w; (Xt , yt )). The following theorem provides us with a sufﬁcient condition under which the regret bound from Thm. 1 holds for ranking as well. Theorem 2 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function over S with respect to a norm · . Denote by Lt the maximum over (i, j) ∈ Et of xt,i − xt,j 2 . Then, for both gt (w) = avg (w; (Xt , yt )) and ∗ gt (w) = max (w; (Xt , yt )), the following regret bound holds ∀u ∈ S, 7 1 T T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (u) ≤ 1 f (u)+ T PT t=1 Lt /(2 σ) √ T . The Boosting Game In this section we describe the applicability of our algorithmic framework to the analysis of boosting algorithms. A boosting algorithm uses a weak learning algorithm that generates weak-hypotheses whose performances are just slightly better than random guessing to build a strong-hypothesis which can attain an arbitrarily low error. The AdaBoost algorithm, proposed by Freund and Schapire [6], receives as input a training set of examples {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} where for all i ∈ [m], xi is taken from an instance domain X , and yi is a binary label, yi ∈ {+1, −1}. The boosting process proceeds in a sequence of consecutive trials. At trial t, the booster ﬁrst deﬁnes a distribution, denoted wt , over the set of examples. Then, the booster passes the training set along with the distribution wt to the weak learner. The weak learner is assumed to return a hypothesis ht : X → {+1, −1} whose average error is slightly smaller than 1 . That is, there exists a constant γ > 0 such that, 2 def m 1−yi ht (xi ) = ≤ 1 −γ . (13) i=1 wt,i 2 2 The goal of the boosting algorithm is to invoke the weak learner several times with different distributions, and to combine the hypotheses returned by the weak learner into a ﬁnal, so called strong, hypothesis whose error is small. The ﬁnal hypothesis combines linearly the T hypotheses returned by the weak learner with coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT , and is deﬁned to be the sign of hf (x) where T hf (x) = t=1 αt ht (x) . The coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT are determined by the booster. In Ad1 1 aBoost, the initial distribution is set to be the uniform distribution, w1 = ( m , . . . , m ). At iter1 ation t, the value of αt is set to be 2 log((1 − t )/ t ). The distribution is updated by the rule wt+1,i = wt,i exp(−αt yi ht (xi ))/Zt , where Zt is a normalization factor. Freund and Schapire [6] have shown that under the assumption given in Eq. (13), the error of the ﬁnal strong hypothesis is at most exp(−2 γ 2 T ). t Several authors [15, 13, 8, 4] have proposed to view boosting as a coordinate-wise greedy optimization process. To do so, note ﬁrst that hf errs on an example (x, y) iff y hf (x) ≤ 0. Therefore, the exp-loss function, deﬁned as exp(−y hf (x)), is a smooth upper bound of the zero-one error, which equals to 1 if y hf (x) ≤ 0 and to 0 otherwise. Thus, we can restate the goal of boosting as minimizing the average exp-loss of hf over the training set with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . To simplify our derivation in the sequel, we prefer to say that boosting maximizes the negation of the loss, that is, T m 1 (14) max − m i=1 exp −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) . α1 ,...,αT In this view, boosting is an optimization procedure which iteratively maximizes Eq. (14) with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . This view of boosting, enables the hypotheses returned by the weak learner to be general functions into the reals, ht : X → R (see for instance [15]). In this paper we view boosting as a convex repeated game between a booster and a weak learner. To motivate our construction, we would like to note that boosting algorithms deﬁne weights in two different domains: the vectors wt ∈ Rm which assign weights to examples and the weights {αt : t ∈ [T ]} over weak-hypotheses. In the terminology used throughout this paper, the weights wt ∈ Rm are primal vectors while (as we show in the sequel) each weight αt of the hypothesis ht is related to a dual vector λt . In particular, we show that Eq. (14) is exactly the Fenchel dual of a primal problem for a convex repeated game, thus the algorithmic framework described thus far for playing games naturally ﬁts the problem of iteratively solving Eq. (14). To derive the primal problem whose Fenchel dual is the problem given in Eq. (14) let us ﬁrst denote by vt the vector in Rm whose ith element is vt,i = yi ht (xi ). For all t, we set gt to be the function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Intuitively, gt penalizes vectors w which assign large weights to examples which are predicted accurately, that is yi ht (xi ) > 0. In particular, if ht (xi ) ∈ {+1, −1} and wt is a distribution over the m examples (as is the case in AdaBoost), gt (wt ) reduces to 1 − 2 t (see Eq. (13)). In this case, minimizing gt is equivalent to maximizing the error of the individual T hypothesis ht over the examples. Consider the problem of minimizing c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) where f (w) is the relative entropy given in Example 2 and c = 1/(2 γ) (see Eq. (13)). To derive its Fenchel dual, we note that gt (λt ) = 0 if there exists βt ∈ [0, 1] such that λt = βt vt and otherwise gt (λt ) = ∞ (see [16]). In addition, let us deﬁne αt = 2 γ βt . Since our goal is to maximize the αt dual, we can restrict λt to take the form λt = βt vt = 2 γ vt , and get that D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = −c f − 1 c T βt vt t=1 =− 1 log 2γ 1 m m e− PT t=1 αt yi ht (xi ) . (15) i=1 Minimizing the exp-loss of the strong hypothesis is therefore the dual problem of the following primal minimization problem: ﬁnd a distribution over the examples, whose relative entropy to the uniform distribution is as small as possible while the correlation of the distribution with each vt is as small as possible. Since the correlation of w with vt is inversely proportional to the error of ht with respect to w, we obtain that in the primal problem we are trying to maximize the error of each individual hypothesis, while in the dual problem we minimize the global error of the strong hypothesis. The intuition of ﬁnding distributions which in retrospect result in large error rates of individual hypotheses was also alluded in [15, 8]. We can now apply our algorithmic framework from Sec. 4 to boosting. We describe the game αt with the parameters αt , where αt ∈ [0, 2 γ], and underscore that in our case, λt = 2 γ vt . At the beginning of the game the booster sets all dual variables to be zero, ∀t αt = 0. At trial t of the boosting game, the booster ﬁrst constructs a primal weight vector wt ∈ Rm , which assigns importance weights to the examples in the training set. The primal vector wt is constructed as in Eq. (6), that is, wt = f (θ t ), where θ t = − i αi vi . Then, the weak learner responds by presenting the loss function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Finally, the booster updates the dual variables so as to increase the dual objective function. It is possible to show that if the range of ht is {+1, −1} 1 then the update given in Eq. (10) is equivalent to the update αt = min{2 γ, 2 log((1 − t )/ t )}. We have thus obtained a variant of AdaBoost in which the weights αt are capped above by 2 γ. A disadvantage of this variant is that we need to know the parameter γ. We would like to note in passing that this limitation can be lifted by a different deﬁnition of the functions gt . We omit the details due to the lack of space. To analyze our game of boosting, we note that the conditions given in Lemma 3 holds T and therefore the left-hand side inequality given in Lemma 3 tells us that t=1 gt (wt ) − T T +1 T +1 1 2 , . . . , λT ) . The deﬁnition of gt and the weak learnability ast=1 λt ∞ ≤ D(λ1 2c sumption given in Eq. (13) imply that wt , vt ≥ 2 γ for all t. Thus, gt (wt ) = wt , vt ≥ 2 γ which also implies that λt = vt . Recall that vt,i = yi ht (xi ). Assuming that the range of ht is [+1, −1] we get that λt ∞ ≤ 1. Combining all the above with the left-hand side inequality T given in Lemma 3 we get that 2 T γ − 2 c ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ). Using the deﬁnition of D (see 1 T Eq. (15)), the value c = 1/(2 γ), and rearranging terms we recover the original bound for AdaBoost PT 2 m 1 −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) ≤ e−2 γ T . i=1 e m 8 Related Work and Discussion We presented a new framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for playing convex repeated games. Our framework was used for the analysis of known algorithms for both online learning and boosting settings. The framework also paves the way to new algorithms. In a previous paper [17], we suggested the use of duality for the design of online algorithms in the context of mistake bound analysis. The contribution of this paper over [17] is three fold as we now brieﬂy discuss. First, we generalize the applicability of the framework beyond the speciﬁc setting of online learning with the hinge-loss to the general setting of convex repeated games. The setting of convex repeated games was formally termed “online convex programming” by Zinkevich [19] and was ﬁrst presented by Gordon in [9]. There is voluminous amount of work on unifying approaches for deriving online learning algorithms. We refer the reader to [11, 12, 3] for work closely related to the content of this paper. By generalizing our previously studied algorithmic framework [17] beyond online learning, we can automatically utilize well known online learning algorithms, such as the EG and p-norm algorithms [12, 11], to the setting of online convex programming. We would like to note that the algorithms presented in [19] can be derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework 1 by setting f (w) = 2 w 2 . Parallel and independently to this work, Gordon [10] described another algorithmic framework for online convex programming that is closely related to the potential based algorithms described by Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi [3]. Gordon also considered the problem of deﬁning appropriate potential functions. Our work generalizes some of the theorems in [10] while providing a somewhat simpler analysis. Second, the usage of generalized Fenchel duality rather than the Lagrange duality given in [17] enables us to analyze boosting algorithms based on the framework. Many authors derived unifying frameworks for boosting algorithms [13, 8, 4]. Nonetheless, our general framework and the connection between game playing and Fenchel duality underscores an interesting perspective of both online learning and boosting. We believe that this viewpoint has the potential of yielding new algorithms in both domains. Last, despite the generality of the framework introduced in this paper, the resulting analysis is more distilled than the earlier analysis given in [17] for two reasons. (i) The usage of Lagrange duality in [17] is somehow restricted while the notion of generalized Fenchel duality is more appropriate to the general and broader problems we consider in this paper. (ii) The strongly convex property we employ both simpliﬁes the analysis and enables more intuitive conditions in our theorems. There are various possible extensions of the work that we did not pursue here due to the lack of space. For instanc, our framework can naturally be used for the analysis of other settings such as repeated games (see [7, 19]). The applicability of our framework to online learning can also be extended to other prediction problems such as regression and sequence prediction. Last, we conjecture that our primal-dual view of boosting will lead to new methods for regularizing boosting algorithms, thus improving their generalization capabilities.

<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Wesley Huie, Kin F. Kan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to learn to make sequential stopping decisions, such as those made along a processing pipeline. We envision a scenario in which a series of decisions must be made as to whether to continue to process. Further processing costs time and resources, but may add value. Our goal is to create, based on historic data, a series of decision rules (one at each stage in the pipeline) that decide, based on information gathered up to that point, whether to continue processing the part. We demonstrate how our framework encompasses problems from manufacturing to vision processing. We derive a quadratic (in the number of decisions) bound on testing performance and provide empirical results on object detection. 1 Pipelined Decisions In many decision problems, all of the data do not arrive at the same time. Often further data collection can be expensive and we would like to make a decision without accruing the added cost. Consider silicon wafer manufacturing. The wafer is processed in a series of stages. After each stage some tests are performed to judge the quality of the wafer. If the wafer fails (due to ﬂaws), then the processing time, energy, and materials are wasted. So, we would like to detect such a failure as early as possible in the production pipeline. A similar problem can occur in vision processing. Consider the case of object detection in images. Often low-level pixel operations (such as downsampling an image) can be performed in parallel by dedicated hardware (on a video capture board, for example). However, searching each subimage patch of the whole image to test whether it is the object in question takes time that is proportional to the number of pixels. Therefore, we can imagine a image pipeline in which low resolution versions of the whole image are scanned ﬁrst. Subimages which are extremely unlikely to contain the desired object are rejected and only those which pass are processed at higher resolution. In this way, we save on many pixel operations and can reduce the cost in time to process an image. Even if downsampling is not possible through dedicated hardware, for most object detection schemes, the image must be downsampled to form an image pyramid in order to search for the object at different scales. Therefore, we can run the early stages of such a pipelined detector at the low resolution versions of the image and throw out large regions of the high resolution versions. Most of the processing is spent searching for small faces (at the high resolutions), so this method can save a lot of processing. Such chained decisions also occur if there is a human in the decision process (to ask further clarifying questions in database search, for instance). We propose a framework that can model all of these scenarios and allow such decision rules to be learned from historic data. We give a learning algorithm based on the minimization of the exponential loss and conclude with some experimental results. 1.1 Problem Formulation Let there be s stages to the processing pipeline. We assume that there is a static distribution from which the parts, objects, or units to be processed are drawn. Let p(x, c) represent this distribution in which x is a vector of the features of this unit and c represents the costs associated with this unit. In particular, let xi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the set of measurements (features) available to the decision maker immediately following stage i. Let c i (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the cost of rejecting (or stopping the processing of) this unit immediately following stage i. Finally, let c s+1 be the cost of allowing the part to pass through all processing stages. Note that ci need not be monotonic in i. To take our wafer manufacturing example, for wafers that are good we might let c i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, indicating that if a wafer is rejected at any stage, one unit of work has been invested for each stage of processing. For the same good wafers, we might let cs+1 = s − 1000, indicating that the value of a completed wafer is 1000 units and therefore the total cost is the processing cost minus the resulting value. For a ﬂawed wafer, the values might be the same, except for c s+1 which we would set to s, indicating that there is no value for a bad wafer. Note that the costs may be either positive or negative. However, only their relative values are important. Once a part has been drawn from the distribution, there is no way of affecting the “base level” for the value of the part. Therefore, we assume for the remainder of this paper that c i ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s + 1 and that ci = 0 for some value of i (between 1 and s + 1). Our goal is to produce a series of decision rules f i (xi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We let fi have a range of {0, 1} and let 0 indicate that processing should continue and 1 indicate that processing should be halted. We let f denote the collection of these s decision rules and augment the collection with an additional rule f s+1 which is identically 1 (for ease of notation). The cost of using these rules to halt processing an example is therefore s+1 i−1 ci fi (xi ) L(f (x), c) = i=1 (1 − fj (xj )) . j=1 We would like to ﬁnd a set of decision rules that minimize E p [L(f (x), c)]. While p(x, c) is not known, we do have a series of samples (training set) D = {(x1 , c1 ), (x2 , c2 ), . . . , (xn , cn )} of n examples drawn from the distribution p. We use superscripts to denote the example index and subscripts to denote the stage index. 2 Boosting Solution For this paper, we consider constructing the rules f i from simpler decision rules, much as in the Adaboost algorithm [1, 2]. We assume that each decision f i (xi ) is computed as the threshold of another function g i (xi ): fi (xi ) = I(gi (xi ) > 0).1 We bound the empirical risk: n n s+1 L(f (xk ), ck ) = i−1 ck I(gi (xk ) > 0) i i k=1 i=1 k=1 n s+1 j=1 k i−1 ck egi (xi ) i ≤ k=1 i=1 I(gj (xk ) ≤ 0) j k n s+1 j=1 k ck egi (xi )− i e−gj (xj ) = Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j . (1) k=1 i=1 Our decision to make all costs positive ensures that the bounds hold. Our decision to make the optimal cost zero helps to ensure that the bound is reasonably tight. As in boosting, we restrict g i (xi ) to take the form mi αi,l hi,l (xi ), the weighted sum of m i subl=1 classiﬁers, each of which returns either −1 or +1. We will construct these weighted sums incrementally and greedily, adding one additional subclassiﬁer and associated weight at each step. We will pick the stage, weight, and function of the subclassiﬁer in order to make the largest negative change in the exponential bound to the empirical risk. The subclassiﬁers, h i,l will be drawn from a small class of hypotheses, H. 1 I is the indicator function that equals 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. 1. Initialize gi (x) = 0 for all stages i k 2. Initialize wi = ck for all stages i and examples k. i 3. For each stage i: (a) Calculate targets for each training example, as shown in equation 5. (b) Let h be the result of running the base learner on this set. (c) Calculate the corresponding α as per equation 3. (d) Score this classiﬁcation as per equation 4 ¯ 4. Select the stage ¯ with the best (highest) score. Let h and α be the classiﬁer and ı ¯ weight found at that stage. ¯¯ 5. Let g¯(x) ← g¯(x) + αh(x). ı ı 6. Update the weights (see equation 2): ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, multiply w¯ by eαh(x¯ ) . ı ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, j > ¯, multiply wj by e−αh(x¯ ) . ı 7. Repeat from step 3 Figure 1: Chained Boosting Algorithm 2.1 Weight Optimization We ﬁrst assume that the stage at which to add a new subclassiﬁer and the subclassiﬁer to add have ¯ ¯ already been chosen: ¯ and h, respectively. That is, h will become h¯,m¯+1 but we simplify it for ı ı ı ease of expression. Our goal is to ﬁnd α ¯,m¯+1 which we similarly abbreviate to α. We ﬁrst deﬁne ¯ ı ı k k wi = ck egi (xi )− i Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j (2) + as the weight of example k at stage i, or its current contribution to our risk bound. If we let D h be ¯ − ¯ the set of indexes of the members of D for which h returns +1, and let D h be similarly deﬁned for ¯ ¯ returns −1, we can further deﬁne those for which h s+1 + W¯ = ı k w¯ + ı + k∈Dh ¯ s+1 k wi − W¯ = ı − ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ k w¯ + ı − k∈Dh ¯ k wi . + ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ + ¯ We interpret W¯ to be the sum of the weights which h will emphasize. That is, it corresponds to ı ¯ ¯ the weights along the path that h selects: For those examples for which h recommends termination, we add the current weight (related to the cost of stopping the processing at this stage). For those ¯ examples for which h recommends continued processing, we add in all future weights (related to all − future costs associated with this example). W¯ can be similarly interpreted to be the weights (or ı ¯ costs) that h recommends skipping. If we optimize the loss bound of Equation 1 with respect to α, we obtain ¯ α= ¯ 1 Wı− log ¯ . + 2 W¯ ı (3) The more weight (cost) that the rule recommends to skip, the higher its α coefﬁcient. 2.2 Full Optimization Using Equation 3 it is straight forward to show that the reduction in Equation 1 due to the addition of this new subclassiﬁer will be + ¯ − ¯ W¯ (1 − eα ) + W¯ (1 − e−α ) . ı ı (4) We know of no efﬁcient method for determining ¯, the stage at which to add a subclassiﬁer, except ı by exhaustive search. However, within a stage, the choice of which subclassiﬁer to use becomes one of maximizing n s+1 k¯ k k z¯ h(x¯ ) , where z¯ = ı ı ı k k wi − w¯ ı (5) i=¯+1 ı k=1 ¯ with respect to h. This is equivalent to an weighted empirical risk minimization where the training 1 2 n k k set is {x¯ , x¯ , . . . , x¯ }. The label of x¯ is the sign of z¯ , and the weight of the same example is the ı ı ı ı ı k magnitude of z¯ . ı 2.3 Algorithm The resulting algorithm is only slightly more complex than standard Adaboost. Instead of a weight vector (one weight for each data example), we now have a weight matrix (one weight for each data example for each stage). We initialize each weight to be the cost associated with halting the corresponding example at the corresponding stage. We start with all g i (x) = 0. The complete algorithm is as in Figure 1. Each time through steps 3 through 7, we complete one “round” and add one additional rule to one stage of the processing. We stop executing this loop when α ≤ 0 or when an iteration counter ¯ exceeds a preset threshold. Bottom-Up Variation In situations where information is only gained after each stage (such as in section 4), we can also train the classiﬁers “bottom-up.” That is, we can start by only adding classiﬁers to the last stage. Once ﬁnished with it, we proceed to the previous stage, and so on. Thus instead of selecting the best stage, i, in each round, we systematically work our way backward through the stages, never revisiting previously set stages. 3 Performance Bounds Using the bounds in [3] we can provide a risk bound for this problem. We let E denote the expectaˆ tion with respect to the true distribution p(x, c) and En denote the empirical average with respect to the n training samples. We ﬁrst bound the indicator function with a piece-wise linear function, b θ , 1 with a maximum slope of θ : z ,0 . I(z > 0) ≤ bθ (z) = max min 1, 1 + θ We then bound the loss: L(f (x), c) ≤ φ θ (f (x), c) where s+1 φθ (f (x), c) = ci min{bθ (gi (xi )), bθ (−gi−1 (xi−1 )), bθ (−gi−2 (xi−2 )), . . . , bθ (−g1 (x1 ))} i=1 s+1 i ci Bθ (gi (xi ), gi−1 (xi−1 ), . . . , g1 (x1 )) = i=1 We replaced the product of indicator functions with a minimization and then bounded each indicator i with bθ . Bθ is just a more compact presentation of the composition of the function b θ and the minimization. We assume that the weights α at each stage have been scaled to sum to 1. This has no affect on the resulting classiﬁcations, but is necessary for the derivation below. Before stating the theorem, for clarity, we state two standard deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 1. Let p(x) be a probability distribution on the set X and let {x 1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be n independent samples from p(x). Let σ 1 , σ 2 , . . . , σ n be n independent samples from a Rademacher random variable (a binary variable that takes on either +1 or −1 with equal probability). Let F be a class of functions mapping X to . Deﬁne the Rademacher Complexity of F to be Rn (F ) = E sup f ∈F n 1 n σ i f (xi ) i=1 1 where the expectation is over the random draws of x through xn and σ 1 through σ n . Deﬁnition 2. Let p(x), {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }, and F be as above. Let g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n be n independent samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Analogous to the above deﬁnition, deﬁne the Gaussian Complexity of G to be Gn (F ) = E sup f ∈F 1 n n g i f (xi ) . i=1 We can now state our theorem, bounding the true risk by a function of the empirical risk: Theorem 3. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hs be the sequence of the sets of functions from which the base classiﬁer draws for chain boosting. If H i is closed under negation for all i, all costs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the weights for the classiﬁers at each stage sum to 1, then with probability 1 − δ, k ˆ E [L(f (x), c)] ≤ En [φθ (f (x), c)] + θ s (i + 1)Gn (Hi ) + i=1 8 ln 2 δ n for some constant k. Proof. Theorem 8 of [3] states ˆ E [L(x, c)] ≤ En (φθ (f (x), c)) + 2Rn (φθ ◦ F ) + 8 ln 2 δ n and therefore we need only bound the R n (φθ ◦ F ) term to demonstrate our theorem. For our case, we have 1 Rn (φθ ◦ F ) = E sup n f ∈F = E sup f ∈F 1 n s+1 ≤ E sup j=1 f ∈F n n σ i φθ (f (xi ), ci ) i=1 s+1 σi i=1 1 n s ci Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) j j j−1 1 j=1 n s+1 s σ i Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) = j j−1 1 i=1 s Rn (Bθ ◦ G j ) j=1 where Gi is the space of convex combinations of functions from H i and G i is the cross product of G1 through Gi . The inequality comes from switching the expectation and the maximization and then from dropping the c i (see [4], lemma 5). j s s Lemma 4 of [3] states that there exists a k such that R n (Bθ ◦ G j ) ≤ kGn (Bθ ◦ G j ). Theorem 14 j 2 s j s of the same paper allows us to conclude that G n (Bθ ◦ G ) ≤ θ i=1 Gn (Gi ). (Because Bθ is the 1 s minimum over a set of functions with maximum slope of θ , the maximum slope of B θ is also 1 .) θ Theorem 12, part 2 states G n (Gi ) = Gn (Hi ). Taken together, this proves our result. Note that this bound has only quadratic dependence on s, the length of the chain and does not explicitly depend on the number of rounds of boosting (the number of rounds affects φ θ which, in turn, affects the bound). 4 Application We tested our algorithm on the MIT face database [5]. This database contains 19-by-19 gray-scale images of faces and non-faces. The training set has 2429 face images and 4548 non-face images. The testing set has 472 faces and 23573 non-faces. We weighted the training set images so that the ratio of the weight of face images to non-face images matched the ratio in the testing set. 0.4 0.4 CB Global CB Bottom−up SVM Boosting 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 150 0.2 100 0.1 False positive rate 0.3 50 Average number of pixels 0.35 average cost/error per example 200 training cost training error testing cost testing error 0.05 0 100 200 300 400 500 number of rounds 700 1000 (a) 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 False negative rate 0.8 0 1 (b) Figure 2: (a) Accuracy verses the number of rounds for a typical run, (b) Error rates and average costs for a variety of cost settings. 4.1 Object Detection as Chained Boosting Our goal is to produce a classiﬁer that can identify non-face images at very low resolutions, thereby allowing for quick processing of large images (as explained later). Most image patches (or subwindows) do not contain faces. We, therefore, built a multi-stage detection system where any early rejection is labeled as a non-face. The ﬁrst stage looks at image patches of size 3-by-3 (i.e. a lowerresolution version of the 19-by-19 original image). The next stage looks at the same image, but at a resolution of 6-by-6. The third stage considers the image at 12-by-12. We did not present the full 19-by-19 images as the classiﬁcation did not signiﬁcantly improve over the 12-by-12 versions. We employ a simple base classiﬁer: the set of all functions that look at a single pixel and predict the class by thresholding the pixel’s value. The total classiﬁer at any stage is a linear combination of these simple classiﬁers. For a given stage, all of the base classiﬁers that target a particular pixel are added together producing a complex function of the value of the pixel. Yet, this pixel can only take on a ﬁnite number of values (256 in this case). Therefore, we can compile this set of base classiﬁers into a single look-up function that maps the brightness of the pixel into a real number. The total classiﬁer for the whole stage is merely the sum of these look-up functions. Therefore, the total work necessary to compute the classiﬁcation at a stage is proportional to the number of pixels in the image considered at that stage, regardless of the number of base classiﬁers used. We therefore assign a cost to each stage of processing proportional to the number of pixels at that stage. If the image is a face, we add a negative cost (i.e. bonus) if the image is allowed to pass through all of the processing stages (and is therefore “accepted” as a face). If the image is a nonface, we add a bonus if the image is rejected at any stage before completion (i.e. correctly labelled). While this dataset has only segmented image patches, in a real application, the classiﬁer would be run on all sub-windows of an image. More importantly, it would also be run at multiple resolutions in order to detect faces of different sizes (or at different distances from the camera). The classiﬁer chain could be run simultaneously at each of these resolutions. To wit, while running the ﬁnal 12-by12 stage at one resolution of the image, the 6-by-6 (previous) stage could be run at the same image resolution. This 6-by-6 processing would be the necessary pre-processing step to running the 12-by12 stage at a higher resolution. As we run our ﬁnal scan for big faces (at a low resolution), we can already (at the same image resolution) be performing initial tests to throw out portions of the image as not worthy of testing for smaller faces (at a higher resolution). Most of the work of detecting objects must be done at the high resolutions because there are many more overlapping subwindows. This chained method allows the culling of most of this high-resolution image processing. 4.2 Experiments For each example, we construct a vector of stage costs as above. We add a constant to this vector to ensure that the minimal element is zero, as per section 1.1. We scale all vectors by the same amount to ensure that the maximal value is 1.This means that the number of misclassiﬁcations is an upper bound on the total cost that the learning algorithm is trying to minimize. There are three ﬂexible quantities in this problem formulation: the cost of a pixel evaluation, the bonus for a correct face classiﬁcation, and the bonus for a correct non-face classiﬁcation. Changing these quantities will control the trade-off between false positives and true positives, and between classiﬁcation error and speed. Figure 2(a) shows the result of a typical run of the algorithm. As a function of the number of rounds, it plots the cost (that which the algorithm is trying to minimize) and the error (number of misclassiﬁed image patches), for both the training and testing sets (where the training set has been reweighted to have the same proportion of faces to non-faces as the testing set). We compared our algorithm’s performance to the performance of support vector machines (SVM) [6] and Adaboost [1] trained and tested on the highest resolution, 12-by-12, image patches. We employed SVM-light [7] with a linear kernels. Figure 2(b) compares the error rates for the methods (solid lines, read against the left vertical axis). Note that the error rates are almost identical for the methods. The dashed lines (read against the right vertical axis) show the average number of pixels evaluated (or total processing cost) for each of the methods. The SVM and Adaboost algorithms have a constant processing cost. Our method (by either training scheme) produces lower processing cost for most error rates. 5 Related Work Cascade detectors for vision processing (see [8] or [9] for example) may appear to be similar to the work in this paper. Especially at ﬁrst glance for the area of object detection, they appear almost the same. However, cascade detection and this work (chained detection) are quite different. Cascade detectors are built one at a time. A coarse detector is ﬁrst trained. The examples which pass that detector are then passed to a ﬁner detector for training, and so on. A series of targets for false-positive rates deﬁne the increasing accuracy of the detector cascade. By contrast, our chain detectors are trained as an ensemble. This is necessary because of two differences in the problem formulation. First, we assume that the information available at each stage changes. Second, we assume there is an explicit cost model that dictates the cost of proceeding from stage to stage and the cost of rejection (or acceptance) at any particular stage. By contrast, cascade detectors are seeking to minimize computational power necessary for a ﬁxed decision. Therefore, the information available to all of the stages is the same, and there are no ﬁxed costs associated with each stage. The ability to train all of the classiﬁers at the same time is crucial to good performance in our framework. The ﬁrst classiﬁer in the chain cannot determine whether it is advantageous to send an example further along unless it knows how the later stages will process the example. Conversely, the later stages cannot construct optimal classiﬁcations until they know the distribution of examples that they will see. Section 4.1 may further confuse the matter. We demonstrated how chained boosting can be used to reduce the computational costs of object detection in images. Cascade detectors are often used for the same purpose. However, the reductions in computational time come from two different sources. In cascade detectors, the time taken to evaluate a given image patch is reduced. In our chained detector formulation, image patches are ignored completely based on analysis of lower resolution patches in the image pyramid. To further illustrate the difference, cascade detectors can always be used to speed up asymmetric classiﬁcation tasks (and are often applied to image detection). By contrast, in Section 4.1 we have exploited the fact that object detection in images is typically performed at multiple scales to turn the problem into a pipeline and apply our framework. Cascade detectors address situations in which prior class probabilities are not equal, while chained detectors address situations in which information is gained at a cost. Both are valid (and separate) ways of tackling image processing (and other tasks as well). In many ways, they are complementary approaches. Classic sequence analysis [10, 11] also addresses the problem of optimal stopping. However, it assumes that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from (usually) a known distribution. Our problem is quite different in that each consecutive sample is drawn from a different (and related) distribution and our goal is to ﬁnd a decision rule without producing a generative model. WaldBoost [12] is a boosting algorithm based on this. It builds a series of features and a ratio comparison test in order to decide when to stop. For WaldBoost, the available features (information) not change between stages. Rather, any feature is available for selection at any point in the chain. Again, this is a different problem than the one considered in this paper. 6 Conclusions We feel this framework of staged decision making is useful in a wide variety of areas. This paper demonstrated how the framework applies to one vision processing task. Obviously it also applies to manufacturing pipelines where errors can be introduced at different stages. It should also be applicable to scenarios where information gathering is costly. Our current formulation only allows for early negative detection. In the face detection example above, this means that in order to report “face,” the classiﬁer must process each stage, even if the result is assured earlier. In Figure 2(b), clearly the upper-left corner (100% false positives and 0% false negatives) is reachable with little effort: classify everything positive without looking at any features. We would like to extend this framework to cover such two-sided early decisions. While perhaps not useful in manufacturing (or even face detection, where the interesting part of the ROC curve is far from the upper-left), it would make the framework more applicable to informationgathering applications.

<p>Author: Kai Zhang, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Finite mixture model is a powerful tool in many statistical learning problems. In this paper, we propose a general, structure-preserving approach to reduce its model complexity, which can bring signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts in many applications. The basic idea is to group the original mixture components into compact clusters, and then minimize an upper bound on the approximation error between the original and simpliﬁed models. By adopting the L2 norm as the distance measure between mixture models, we can derive closed-form solutions that are more robust and reliable than using the KL-based distance measure. Moreover, the complexity of our algorithm is only linear in the sample size and dimensionality. Experiments on density estimation and clustering-based image segmentation demonstrate its outstanding performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>6 0.50316662 <a title="96-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>

<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Yoram Singer, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce and experiment with a framework for learning local perceptual distance functions for visual recognition. We learn a distance function for each training image as a combination of elementary distances between patch-based visual features. We apply these combined local distance functions to the tasks of image retrieval and classiﬁcation of novel images. On the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark, we achieve 60.3% mean recognition across classes using 15 training images per class, which is better than the best published performance by Zhang, et al. 1</p><p>4 0.17555445 <a title="8-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Method_for_Inferring_Features_From_Similarity_Judgments.html">9 nips-2006-A Nonparametric Bayesian Method for Inferring Features From Similarity Judgments</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel J. Navarro, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The additive clustering model is widely used to infer the features of a set of stimuli from their similarities, on the assumption that similarity is a weighted linear function of common features. This paper develops a fully Bayesian formulation of the additive clustering model, using methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to allow the number of features to vary. We use this to explore several approaches to parameter estimation, showing that the nonparametric Bayesian approach provides a straightforward way to obtain estimates of both the number of features used in producing similarity judgments and their importance. 1</p><p>5 0.17543325 <a title="8-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Discriminative_Visual_Codebooks_using_Randomized_Clustering_Forests.html">78 nips-2006-Fast Discriminative Visual Codebooks using Randomized Clustering Forests</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Moosmann, Bill Triggs, Frederic Jurie</p><p>Abstract: Some of the most effective recent methods for content-based image classiﬁcation work by extracting dense or sparse local image descriptors, quantizing them according to a coding rule such as k-means vector quantization, accumulating histograms of the resulting “visual word” codes over the image, and classifying these with a conventional classiﬁer such as an SVM. Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests – ensembles of randomly created clustering trees – and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.1693318 <a title="8-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Methods_for_Privacy_Preserving_Face_Detection.html">73 nips-2006-Efficient Methods for Privacy Preserving Face Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Oren Boiman, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for measuring similarity between two signals, which is applicable to many machine learning tasks, and to many signal types. We say that a signal S1 is “similar” to a signal S2 if it is “easy” to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2 . Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2 . This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2 . “Similarity by Composition” can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between different portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classiﬁcation, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples. 1</p><p>4 0.50714743 <a title="8-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Methods_for_Privacy_Preserving_Face_Detection.html">73 nips-2006-Efficient Methods for Privacy Preserving Face Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: Bob offers a face-detection web service where clients can submit their images for analysis. Alice would very much like to use the service, but is reluctant to reveal the content of her images to Bob. Bob, for his part, is reluctant to release his face detector, as he spent a lot of time, energy and money constructing it. Secure MultiParty computations use cryptographic tools to solve this problem without leaking any information. Unfortunately, these methods are slow to compute and we introduce a couple of machine learning techniques that allow the parties to solve the problem while leaking a controlled amount of information. The ﬁrst method is an information-bottleneck variant of AdaBoost that lets Bob ﬁnd a subset of features that are enough for classifying an image patch, but not enough to actually reconstruct it. The second machine learning technique is active learning that allows Alice to construct an online classiﬁer, based on a small number of calls to Bob’s face detector. She can then use her online classiﬁer as a fast rejector before using a cryptographically secure classiﬁer on the remaining image patches. 1</p><p>5 0.4892101 <a title="8-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_appearance_and_shape_by_learning_jigsaws.html">52 nips-2006-Clustering appearance and shape by learning jigsaws</a></p>
<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, John Winn, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Patch-based appearance models are used in a wide range of computer vision applications. To learn such models it has previously been necessary to specify a suitable set of patch sizes and shapes by hand. In the jigsaw model presented here, the shape, size and appearance of patches are learned automatically from the repeated structures in a set of training images. By learning such irregularly shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’, we are able to discover both the shape and the appearance of object parts without supervision. When applied to face images, for example, the learned jigsaw pieces are surprisingly strongly associated with face parts of different shapes and scales such as eyes, noses, eyebrows and cheeks, to name a few. We conclude that learning the shape of the patch not only improves the accuracy of appearance-based part detection but also allows for shape-based part detection. This enables parts of similar appearance but different shapes to be distinguished; for example, while foreheads and cheeks are both skin colored, they have markedly different shapes. 1</p><p>6 0.43330994 <a title="8-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Image_Super-resolution%2C_Continued.html">42 nips-2006-Bayesian Image Super-resolution, Continued</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Kazuyuki Aihara, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for the classiﬁcation of single trial ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), based on regularized logistic regression. Framed in this robust statistical framework no prior feature extraction or outlier removal is required. We present two variations of parameterizing the regression function: (a) with a full rank symmetric matrix coeﬃcient and (b) as a diﬀerence of two rank=1 matrices. In the ﬁrst case, the problem is convex and the logistic regression is optimal under a generative model. The latter case is shown to be related to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm, which is a popular technique in Brain Computer Interfacing. The regression coeﬃcients can also be topographically mapped onto the scalp similarly to CSP projections, which allows neuro-physiological interpretation. Simulations on 162 BCI datasets demonstrate that classiﬁcation accuracy and robustness compares favorably against conventional CSP based classiﬁers. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.92168814 <a title="8-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Bottom-Up_Visual_Saliency.html">8 nips-2006-A Nonparametric Approach to Bottom-Up Visual Saliency</a></p>

In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive ﬁelds in the early human visual system. 1</p><p>4 0.88535041 <a title="8-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-AdaBoost_is_Consistent.html">21 nips-2006-AdaBoost is Consistent</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Mikhail Traskin</p><p>Abstract: The risk, or probability of error, of the classiﬁer produced by the AdaBoost algorithm is investigated. In particular, we consider the stopping strategy to be used in AdaBoost to achieve universal consistency. We show that provided AdaBoost is stopped after nν iterations—for sample size n and ν < 1—the sequence of risks of the classiﬁers it produces approaches the Bayes risk if Bayes risk L∗ > 0. 1</p><p>5 0.87112355 <a title="8-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Approximate_Correspondences_in_High_Dimensions.html">34 nips-2006-Approximate Correspondences in High Dimensions</a></p>
<p>Author: Kristen Grauman, Trevor Darrell</p><p>Abstract: Pyramid intersection is an efﬁcient method for computing an approximate partial matching between two sets of feature vectors. We introduce a novel pyramid embedding based on a hierarchy of non-uniformly shaped bins that takes advantage of the underlying structure of the feature space and remains accurate even for sets with high-dimensional feature vectors. The matching similarity is computed in linear time and forms a Mercer kernel. Whereas previous matching approximation algorithms suffer from distortion factors that increase linearly with the feature dimension, we demonstrate that our approach can maintain constant accuracy even as the feature dimension increases. When used as a kernel in a discriminative classiﬁer, our approach achieves improved object recognition results over a state-of-the-art set kernel. 1</p><p>6 0.86915106 <a title="8-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Image_Super-resolution%2C_Continued.html">42 nips-2006-Bayesian Image Super-resolution, Continued</a></p>

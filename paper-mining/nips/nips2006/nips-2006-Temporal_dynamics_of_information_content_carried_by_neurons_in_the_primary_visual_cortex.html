<p>Author: Jason M. Samonds, Brian R. Potetz, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of stereopsis, how neurons interact in a network during stereo computation remains unclear. Computational models on stereopsis suggest local competition and long-range cooperation are important for resolving ambiguity during stereo matching. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded from multiple neurons in V1 of awake, behaving macaques while presenting surfaces of different depths rendered in dynamic random dot stereograms. We found that the interaction between pairs of neurons was a function of similarity in receptive fields, as well as of the input stimulus. Neurons coding the same depth experienced common inhibition early in their responses for stimuli presented at their nonpreferred disparities. They experienced mutual facilitation later in their responses for stimulation at their preferred disparity. These findings are consistent with a local competition mechanism that first removes gross mismatches, and a global cooperative mechanism that further refines depth estimates. 1 In trod u ction The human visual system is able to extract three-dimensional (3D) structures in random noise stereograms even when such images evoke no perceptible patterns when viewed monocularly [1]. Bela Julesz proposed that this is accomplished by a stereopsis mechanism that detects correlated shifts in 2D noise patterns between the two eyes. He also suggested that this mechanism likely involves cooperative neural processing early in the visual system. Marr and Poggio formalized the computational constraints for solving stereo matching (Fig. 1a) and devised an algorithm that can discover the underlying 3D structures in a variety of random dot stereogram patterns [2]. Their algorithm was based on two rules: (1) each element or feature is unique (i.e., can be assigned only one disparity) and (2) surfaces of objects are cohesive (i.e., depth changes gradually across space). To describe their algorithm in neurophysiological terms, we can consider neurons in primary visual cortex as simple element or feature detectors. The first rule is implemented by introducing competitive interactions (mutual inhibition) among neurons of different disparity tuning at each location (Fig. 1b, blue solid horizontal or vertical lines), allowing only one disparity to be detected at each location. The second rule is implemented by introducing cooperative interactions (mutual facilitation) among neurons tuned to the same depth (image disparity) across different spatial locations (Fig. 1b, along the red dashed diagonal lines). In other words, a disparity estimate at one location is more likely to be correct if neighboring locations have similar disparity estimates. A dynamic system under such constraints can relax to a stable global disparity map. Here, we present neurophysiological evidence of interactions between disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that is consistent with this general approach. We sampled from a variety of spatially distributed disparity tuned neurons (see electrodes Fig. 1b) while displaying DRDS stimuli defined at various disparities (see stimulus Fig.1b). We then measured the dynamics of interactions by assessing the temporal evolution of correlation in neural responses. a Left Image b Right Image Electrodes Disparity Left Image ?

We simultaneously recorded from 4-8 electrodes providing data from up to 10 neurons in a single recording session (some electrodes recorded from as many as 3 neurons). We collected data from 112 neurons that provided 224 pairs for cross-correlation analysis. For stimuli, we used 12 Hz dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS; 25% density black and white pixels on a mean luminance background) presented in a 3.5-degree aperture. Liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to present random dot patterns to each eye separately. Eleven horizontal disparities between the two eyes, ranging from ±0.9 degrees, were tested. Seventy-four neurons (66%) had significant disparity tuning and 99 pairs (44%) were comprised of neurons that both had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p<0.05). b 5mm Medial - Lateral 100µV 0.2ms 1° Figure 2: (a) Example recording session from five electrodes in V1.

<p>Author: Yingxue Wang, Rodney J. Douglas, Shih-Chii Liu</p><p>Abstract: The neurons of the neocortex communicate by asynchronous events called action potentials (or ’spikes’). However, for simplicity of simulation, most models of processing by cortical neural networks have assumed that the activations of their neurons can be approximated by event rates rather than taking account of individual spikes. The obstacle to exploring the more detailed spike processing of these networks has been reduced considerably in recent years by the development of hybrid analog-digital Very-Large Scale Integrated (hVLSI) neural networks composed of spiking neurons that are able to operate in real-time. In this paper we describe such a hVLSI neural network that performs an interesting task of selective attentional processing that was previously described for a simulated ’pointer-map’ rate model by Hahnloser and colleagues. We found that most of the computational features of their rate model can be reproduced in the spiking implementation; but, that spike-based processing requires a modiﬁcation of the original network architecture in order to memorize a previously attended target. 1</p><p>4 0.28717166 <a title="189-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Temporal_Coding_using_the_Response_Properties_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">187 nips-2006-Temporal Coding using the Response Properties of Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Voegtlin</p><p>Abstract: In biological neurons, the timing of a spike depends on the timing of synaptic currents, in a way that is classically described by the Phase Response Curve. This has implications for temporal coding: an action potential that arrives on a synapse has an implicit meaning, that depends on the position of the postsynaptic neuron on the ﬁring cycle. Here we show that this implicit code can be used to perform computations. Using theta neurons, we derive a spike-timing dependent learning rule from an error criterion. We demonstrate how to train an auto-encoder neural network using this rule. 1</p><p>5 0.27074078 <a title="189-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Context_dependent_amplification_of_both_rate_and_event-correlation_in_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">59 nips-2006-Context dependent amplification of both rate and event-correlation in a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>

We propose a VLSI implementation of a spiking cooperative competitive network and show how it can perform context dependent computation both in the mean ﬁring rate domain and in spike timing correlation space. In the mean rate case the network ampliﬁes the activity of neurons belonging to the selected stimulus and suppresses the activity of neurons receiving weaker stimuli. In the event correlation case, the recurrent network ampliﬁes with a higher gain the correlation between neurons which receive highly correlated inputs while leaving the mean ﬁring rate unaltered.

<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, population behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the ﬁring phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only ﬁre once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each neuron represents by its ﬁring phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it ﬁres. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system. 1</p><p>6 0.65477163 <a title="189-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Temporal_Coding_using_the_Response_Properties_of_Spiking_Neurons.html">187 nips-2006-Temporal Coding using the Response Properties of Spiking Neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Danko Nikolić, Stefan Haeusler, Wolf Singer, Wolfgang Maass</p><p>Abstract: We use multi-electrode recordings from cat primary visual cortex and investigate whether a simple linear classifier can extract information about the presented stimuli. We find that information is extractable and that it even lasts for several hundred milliseconds after the stimulus has been removed. In a fast sequence of stimulus presentation, information about both new and old stimuli is present simultaneously and nonlinear relations between these stimuli can be extracted. These results suggest nonlinear properties of cortical representations. The important implications of these properties for the nonlinear brain theory are discussed.</p><p>2 0.54491878 <a title="189-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Randomized_PCA_Algorithms_with_Regret_Bounds_that_are_Logarithmic_in_the_Dimension.html">164 nips-2006-Randomized PCA Algorithms with Regret Bounds that are Logarithmic in the Dimension</a></p>

<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Meirav Galun</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. Spectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. One contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. We show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. Based on these ﬁndings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. Our measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. We present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. In contrast, using this coherence measure ﬁnds the expected clusters at all scales.

<p>Author: Jason M. Samonds, Brian R. Potetz, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of stereopsis, how neurons interact in a network during stereo computation remains unclear. Computational models on stereopsis suggest local competition and long-range cooperation are important for resolving ambiguity during stereo matching. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded from multiple neurons in V1 of awake, behaving macaques while presenting surfaces of different depths rendered in dynamic random dot stereograms. We found that the interaction between pairs of neurons was a function of similarity in receptive fields, as well as of the input stimulus. Neurons coding the same depth experienced common inhibition early in their responses for stimuli presented at their nonpreferred disparities. They experienced mutual facilitation later in their responses for stimulation at their preferred disparity. These findings are consistent with a local competition mechanism that first removes gross mismatches, and a global cooperative mechanism that further refines depth estimates. 1 In trod u ction The human visual system is able to extract three-dimensional (3D) structures in random noise stereograms even when such images evoke no perceptible patterns when viewed monocularly [1]. Bela Julesz proposed that this is accomplished by a stereopsis mechanism that detects correlated shifts in 2D noise patterns between the two eyes. He also suggested that this mechanism likely involves cooperative neural processing early in the visual system. Marr and Poggio formalized the computational constraints for solving stereo matching (Fig. 1a) and devised an algorithm that can discover the underlying 3D structures in a variety of random dot stereogram patterns [2]. Their algorithm was based on two rules: (1) each element or feature is unique (i.e., can be assigned only one disparity) and (2) surfaces of objects are cohesive (i.e., depth changes gradually across space). To describe their algorithm in neurophysiological terms, we can consider neurons in primary visual cortex as simple element or feature detectors. The first rule is implemented by introducing competitive interactions (mutual inhibition) among neurons of different disparity tuning at each location (Fig. 1b, blue solid horizontal or vertical lines), allowing only one disparity to be detected at each location. The second rule is implemented by introducing cooperative interactions (mutual facilitation) among neurons tuned to the same depth (image disparity) across different spatial locations (Fig. 1b, along the red dashed diagonal lines). In other words, a disparity estimate at one location is more likely to be correct if neighboring locations have similar disparity estimates. A dynamic system under such constraints can relax to a stable global disparity map. Here, we present neurophysiological evidence of interactions between disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that is consistent with this general approach. We sampled from a variety of spatially distributed disparity tuned neurons (see electrodes Fig. 1b) while displaying DRDS stimuli defined at various disparities (see stimulus Fig.1b). We then measured the dynamics of interactions by assessing the temporal evolution of correlation in neural responses. a Left Image b Right Image Electrodes Disparity Left Image ?

We simultaneously recorded from 4-8 electrodes providing data from up to 10 neurons in a single recording session (some electrodes recorded from as many as 3 neurons). We collected data from 112 neurons that provided 224 pairs for cross-correlation analysis. For stimuli, we used 12 Hz dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS; 25% density black and white pixels on a mean luminance background) presented in a 3.5-degree aperture. Liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to present random dot patterns to each eye separately. Eleven horizontal disparities between the two eyes, ranging from ±0.9 degrees, were tested. Seventy-four neurons (66%) had significant disparity tuning and 99 pairs (44%) were comprised of neurons that both had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p<0.05). b 5mm Medial - Lateral 100µV 0.2ms 1° Figure 2: (a) Example recording session from five electrodes in V1.

<p>Author: Amit Gore, Shantanu Chakrabartty</p><p>Abstract: A key challenge in designing analog-to-digital converters for cortically implanted prosthesis is to sense and process high-dimensional neural signals recorded by the micro-electrode arrays. In this paper, we describe a novel architecture for analog-to-digital (A/D) conversion that combines Σ∆ conversion with spatial de-correlation within a single module. The architecture called multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) Σ∆ is based on a min-max gradient descent optimization of a regularized linear cost function that naturally lends to an A/D formulation. Using an online formulation, the architecture can adapt to slow variations in cross-channel correlations, observed due to relative motion of the microelectrodes with respect to the signal sources. Experimental results with real recorded multi-channel neural data demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in alleviating cross-channel redundancy across electrodes and performing data-compression directly at the A/D converter. 1</p><p>6 0.45143864 <a title="189-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Attentional_Processing_on_a_Spike-Based_VLSI_Neural_Network.html">36 nips-2006-Attentional Processing on a Spike-Based VLSI Neural Network</a></p>

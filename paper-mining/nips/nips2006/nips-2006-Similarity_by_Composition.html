<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Felix A. Wichmann, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the bottom-up inﬂuence of local image information on human eye movements. Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear ﬁlters, e.g., Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians ﬁlters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end ﬁlters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justiﬁed. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the ﬁeld that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble ﬁndings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive ﬁelds in the early human visual system. 1</p><p>3 0.070411786 <a title="174-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Image_Super-resolution%2C_Continued.html">42 nips-2006-Bayesian Image Super-resolution, Continued</a></p>
<p>Author: Lyndsey C. Pickup, David P. Capel, Stephen J. Roberts, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a multi-frame image super-resolution approach from a Bayesian view-point by marginalizing over the unknown registration parameters relating the set of input low-resolution views. In Tipping and Bishop’s Bayesian image super-resolution approach [16], the marginalization was over the superresolution image, necessitating the use of an unfavorable image prior. By integrating over the registration parameters rather than the high-resolution image, our method allows for more realistic prior distributions, and also reduces the dimension of the integral considerably, removing the main computational bottleneck of the other algorithm. In addition to the motion model used by Tipping and Bishop, illumination components are introduced into the generative model, allowing us to handle changes in lighting as well as motion. We show results on real and synthetic datasets to illustrate the efﬁcacy of this approach.</p><p>4 0.066310167 <a title="174-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Discriminative_Visual_Codebooks_using_Randomized_Clustering_Forests.html">78 nips-2006-Fast Discriminative Visual Codebooks using Randomized Clustering Forests</a></p>
<p>Author: Frank Moosmann, Bill Triggs, Frederic Jurie</p><p>Abstract: Some of the most effective recent methods for content-based image classiﬁcation work by extracting dense or sparse local image descriptors, quantizing them according to a coding rule such as k-means vector quantization, accumulating histograms of the resulting “visual word” codes over the image, and classifying these with a conventional classiﬁer such as an SVM. Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests – ensembles of randomly created clustering trees – and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.061949447 <a title="174-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Image_Retrieval_and_Classification_Using_Local_Distance_Functions.html">94 nips-2006-Image Retrieval and Classification Using Local Distance Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Yoram Singer, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce and experiment with a framework for learning local perceptual distance functions for visual recognition. We learn a distance function for each training image as a combination of elementary distances between patch-based visual features. We apply these combined local distance functions to the tasks of image retrieval and classiﬁcation of novel images. On the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark, we achieve 60.3% mean recognition across classes using 15 training images per class, which is better than the best published performance by Zhang, et al. 1</p><p>6 0.055765778 <a title="174-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Methods_for_Privacy_Preserving_Face_Detection.html">73 nips-2006-Efficient Methods for Privacy Preserving Face Detection</a></p>

<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, John Winn, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Patch-based appearance models are used in a wide range of computer vision applications. To learn such models it has previously been necessary to specify a suitable set of patch sizes and shapes by hand. In the jigsaw model presented here, the shape, size and appearance of patches are learned automatically from the repeated structures in a set of training images. By learning such irregularly shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’, we are able to discover both the shape and the appearance of object parts without supervision. When applied to face images, for example, the learned jigsaw pieces are surprisingly strongly associated with face parts of different shapes and scales such as eyes, noses, eyebrows and cheeks, to name a few. We conclude that learning the shape of the patch not only improves the accuracy of appearance-based part detection but also allows for shape-based part detection. This enables parts of similar appearance but different shapes to be distinguished; for example, while foreheads and cheeks are both skin colored, they have markedly different shapes. 1</p><p>3 0.56896442 <a title="174-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Methods_for_Privacy_Preserving_Face_Detection.html">73 nips-2006-Efficient Methods for Privacy Preserving Face Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: Bob offers a face-detection web service where clients can submit their images for analysis. Alice would very much like to use the service, but is reluctant to reveal the content of her images to Bob. Bob, for his part, is reluctant to release his face detector, as he spent a lot of time, energy and money constructing it. Secure MultiParty computations use cryptographic tools to solve this problem without leaking any information. Unfortunately, these methods are slow to compute and we introduce a couple of machine learning techniques that allow the parties to solve the problem while leaking a controlled amount of information. The ﬁrst method is an information-bottleneck variant of AdaBoost that lets Bob ﬁnd a subset of features that are enough for classifying an image patch, but not enough to actually reconstruct it. The second machine learning technique is active learning that allows Alice to construct an online classiﬁer, based on a small number of calls to Bob’s face detector. She can then use her online classiﬁer as a fast rejector before using a cryptographically secure classiﬁer on the remaining image patches. 1</p><p>4 0.54051048 <a title="174-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Image_Super-resolution%2C_Continued.html">42 nips-2006-Bayesian Image Super-resolution, Continued</a></p>

<p>Author: Steven Lemm, Christin Schäfer, Gabriel Curio</p><p>Abstract: We present a method for binary on-line classiﬁcation of triggered but temporally blurred events that are embedded in noisy time series in the context of on-line discrimination between left and right imaginary hand-movement. In particular the goal of the binary classiﬁcation problem is to obtain the decision, as fast and as reliably as possible from the recorded EEG single trials. To provide a probabilistic decision at every time-point t the presented method gathers information from two distinct sequences of features across time. In order to incorporate decisions from prior time-points we suggest an appropriate weighting scheme, that emphasizes time instances, providing a higher discriminatory power between the instantaneous class distributions of each feature, where the discriminatory power is quantiﬁed in terms of the Bayes error of misclassiﬁcation. The eﬀectiveness of this procedure is veriﬁed by its successful application in the 3rd BCI competition. Disclosure of the data after the competition revealed this approach to be superior with single trial error rates as low as 10.7, 11.5 and 16.7% for the three diﬀerent subjects under study. 1</p><p>2 0.74432594 <a title="174-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Sparse_Kernel_Orthonormalized_PLS_for_feature_extraction_in_large_data_sets.html">177 nips-2006-Sparse Kernel Orthonormalized PLS for feature extraction in large data sets</a></p>
<p>Author: Jerónimo Arenas-garcía, Kaare B. Petersen, Lars K. Hansen</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we are presenting a novel multivariate analysis method. Our scheme is based on a novel kernel orthonormalized partial least squares (PLS) variant for feature extraction, imposing sparsity constrains in the solution to improve scalability. The algorithm is tested on a benchmark of UCI data sets, and on the analysis of integrated short-time music features for genre prediction. The upshot is that the method has strong expressive power even with rather few features, is clearly outperforming the ordinary kernel PLS, and therefore is an appealing method for feature extraction of labelled data. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.71797502 <a title="174-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Similarity_by_Composition.html">174 nips-2006-Similarity by Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Boiman, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for measuring similarity between two signals, which is applicable to many machine learning tasks, and to many signal types. We say that a signal S1 is “similar” to a signal S2 if it is “easy” to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2 . Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2 . This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2 . “Similarity by Composition” can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between different portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classiﬁcation, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples. 1</p><p>4 0.61458081 <a title="174-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Balanced_Graph_Matching.html">39 nips-2006-Balanced Graph Matching</a></p>
<p>Author: Timothee Cour, Praveen Srinivasan, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Graph matching is a fundamental problem in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. We present two contributions. First, we give a new spectral relaxation technique for approximate solutions to matching problems, that naturally incorporates one-to-one or one-to-many constraints within the relaxation scheme. The second is a normalization procedure for existing graph matching scoring functions that can dramatically improve the matching accuracy. It is based on a reinterpretation of the graph matching compatibility matrix as a bipartite graph on edges for which we seek a bistochastic normalization. We evaluate our two contributions on a comprehensive test set of random graph matching problems, as well as on image correspondence problem. Our normalization procedure can be used to improve the performance of many existing graph matching algorithms, including spectral matching, graduated assignment and semideﬁnite programming. 1</p><p>5 0.61413896 <a title="174-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Sparse_Multinomial_Logistic_Regression_via_Bayesian_L1_Regularisation.html">178 nips-2006-Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression via Bayesian L1 Regularisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. Talbot, Mark Girolami</p><p>Abstract: Multinomial logistic regression provides the standard penalised maximumlikelihood solution to multi-class pattern recognition problems. More recently, the development of sparse multinomial logistic regression models has found application in text processing and microarray classiﬁcation, where explicit identiﬁcation of the most informative features is of value. In this paper, we propose a sparse multinomial logistic regression method, in which the sparsity arises from the use of a Laplace prior, but where the usual regularisation parameter is integrated out analytically. Evaluation over a range of benchmark datasets reveals this approach results in similar generalisation performance to that obtained using cross-validation, but at greatly reduced computational expense. 1</p><p>6 0.61324102 <a title="174-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Support_Vector_Machines_on_a_Budget.html">186 nips-2006-Support Vector Machines on a Budget</a></p>

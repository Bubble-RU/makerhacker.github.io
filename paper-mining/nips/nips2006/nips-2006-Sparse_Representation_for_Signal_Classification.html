<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>3 0.14482398 <a title="179-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms.html">75 nips-2006-Efficient sparse coding algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Alexis Battle, Rajat Raina, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for ﬁnding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, ﬁnding sparse codes remains a very difﬁcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efﬁcient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1 -regularized least squares problem and an L2 -constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a signiﬁcant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive ﬁeld surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1</p><p>4 0.1078448 <a title="179-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Nonnegative_Sparse_PCA.html">149 nips-2006-Nonnegative Sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Zass, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: We describe a nonnegative variant of the ”Sparse PCA” problem. The goal is to create a low dimensional representation from a collection of points which on the one hand maximizes the variance of the projected points and on the other uses only parts of the original coordinates, and thereby creating a sparse representation. What distinguishes our problem from other Sparse PCA formulations is that the projection involves only nonnegative weights of the original coordinates — a desired quality in various ﬁelds, including economics, bioinformatics and computer vision. Adding nonnegativity contributes to sparseness, where it enforces a partitioning of the original coordinates among the new axes. We describe a simple yet efﬁcient iterative coordinate-descent type of scheme which converges to a local optimum of our optimization criteria, giving good results on large real world datasets. 1</p><p>5 0.091585882 <a title="179-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_Under_Prior_Knowledge_with_Application_to_Image_Segmentation.html">51 nips-2006-Clustering Under Prior Knowledge with Application to Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>6 0.086237013 <a title="179-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Sparse_Multinomial_Logistic_Regression_via_Bayesian_L1_Regularisation.html">178 nips-2006-Sparse Multinomial Logistic Regression via Bayesian L1 Regularisation</a></p>

<p>Author: Gavin C. Cawley, Nicola L. Talbot, Mark Girolami</p><p>Abstract: Multinomial logistic regression provides the standard penalised maximumlikelihood solution to multi-class pattern recognition problems. More recently, the development of sparse multinomial logistic regression models has found application in text processing and microarray classiﬁcation, where explicit identiﬁcation of the most informative features is of value. In this paper, we propose a sparse multinomial logistic regression method, in which the sparsity arises from the use of a Laplace prior, but where the usual regularisation parameter is integrated out analytically. Evaluation over a range of benchmark datasets reveals this approach results in similar generalisation performance to that obtained using cross-validation, but at greatly reduced computational expense. 1</p><p>6 0.46043378 <a title="179-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Statistical_Modeling_of_Images_with_Fields_of_Gaussian_Scale_Mixtures.html">182 nips-2006-Statistical Modeling of Images with Fields of Gaussian Scale Mixtures</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>3 0.62168348 <a title="179-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Real-time_adaptive_information-theoretic_optimization_of_neurophysiology_experiments.html">165 nips-2006-Real-time adaptive information-theoretic optimization of neurophysiology experiments</a></p>
<p>Author: Jeremy Lewi, Robert Butera, Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: Adaptively optimizing experiments can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of trials needed to characterize neural responses using parametric statistical models. However, the potential for these methods has been limited to date by severe computational challenges: choosing the stimulus which will provide the most information about the (typically high-dimensional) model parameters requires evaluating a high-dimensional integration and optimization in near-real time. Here we present a fast algorithm for choosing the optimal (most informative) stimulus based on a Fisher approximation of the Shannon information and specialized numerical linear algebra techniques. This algorithm requires only low-rank matrix manipulations and a one-dimensional linesearch to choose the stimulus and is therefore efﬁcient even for high-dimensional stimulus and parameter spaces; for example, we require just 15 milliseconds on a desktop computer to optimize a 100-dimensional stimulus. Our algorithm therefore makes real-time adaptive experimental design feasible. Simulation results show that model parameters can be estimated much more efﬁciently using these adaptive techniques than by using random (nonadaptive) stimuli. Finally, we generalize the algorithm to efﬁciently handle both fast adaptation due to spike-history effects and slow, non-systematic drifts in the model parameters. Maximizing the efﬁciency of data collection is important in any experimental setting. In neurophysiology experiments, minimizing the number of trials needed to characterize a neural system is essential for maintaining the viability of a preparation and ensuring robust results. As a result, various approaches have been developed to optimize neurophysiology experiments online in order to choose the “best” stimuli given prior knowledge of the system and the observed history of the cell’s responses. The “best” stimulus can be deﬁned a number of different ways depending on the experimental objectives. One reasonable choice, if we are interested in ﬁnding a neuron’s “preferred stimulus,” is the stimulus which maximizes the ﬁring rate of the neuron [1, 2, 3, 4]. Alternatively, when investigating the coding properties of sensory cells it makes sense to deﬁne the optimal stimulus in terms of the mutual information between the stimulus and response [5]. Here we take a system identiﬁcation approach: we deﬁne the optimal stimulus as the one which tells us the most about how a neural system responds to its inputs [6, 7]. We consider neural systems in † ‡ http://www.prism.gatech.edu/∼gtg120z http://www.stat.columbia.edu/∼liam which the probability p(rt |{xt , xt−1 , ..., xt−tk }, {rt−1 , . . . , rt−ta }) of the neural response rt given the current and past stimuli {xt , xt−1 , ..., xt−tk }, and the observed recent history of the neuron’s activity, {rt−1 , . . . , rt−ta }, can be described by a model p(rt |{xt }, {rt−1 }, θ), speciﬁed by a ﬁnite vector of parameters θ. Since we estimate these parameters from experimental trials, we want to choose our stimuli so as to minimize the number of trials needed to robustly estimate θ. Two inconvenient facts make it difﬁcult to realize this goal in a computationally efﬁcient manner: 1) model complexity — we typically need a large number of parameters to accurately model a system’s response p(rt |{xt }, {rt−1 }, θ); and 2) stimulus complexity — we are typically interested in neural responses to stimuli xt which are themselves very high-dimensional (e.g., spatiotemporal movies if we are dealing with visual neurons). In particular, it is computationally challenging to 1) update our a posteriori beliefs about the model parameters p(θ|{rt }, {xt }) given new stimulus-response data, and 2) ﬁnd the optimal stimulus quickly enough to be useful in an online experimental context. In this work we present methods for solving these problems using generalized linear models (GLM) for the input-output relationship p(rt |{xt }, {rt−1 }, θ) and certain Gaussian approximations of the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Our emphasis is on ﬁnding solutions which scale well in high dimensions. We solve problem (1) by using efﬁcient rank-one update methods to update the Gaussian approximation to the posterior, and problem (2) by a reduction to a highly tractable onedimensional optimization problem. Simulation results show that the resulting algorithm produces a set of stimulus-response pairs which is much more informative than the set produced by random sampling. Moreover, the algorithm is efﬁcient enough that it could feasibly run in real-time. Neural systems are highly adaptive and more generally nonstatic. A robust approach to optimal experimental design must be able to cope with changes in θ. We emphasize that the model framework analyzed here can account for three key types of changes: stimulus adaptation, spike rate adaptation, and random non-systematic changes. Adaptation which is completely stimulus dependent can be accounted for by including enough stimulus history terms in the model p(rt |{xt , ..., xt−tk }, {rt−1 , ..., rt−ta }). Spike-rate adaptation effects, and more generally spike history-dependent effects, are accounted for explicitly in the model (1) below. Finally, we consider slow, non-systematic changes which could potentially be due to changes in the health, arousal, or attentive state of the preparation. Methods We model a neuron as a point process whose conditional intensity function (instantaneous ﬁring rate) is given as the output of a generalized linear model (GLM) [8, 9]. This model class has been discussed extensively elsewhere; brieﬂy, this class is fairly natural from a physiological point of view [10], with close connections to biophysical models such as the integrate-and-ﬁre cell [9], and has been applied in a wide variety of experimental settings [11, 12, 13, 14]. The model is summarized as: tk λt = E(rt ) = f ta aj rt−j ki,t−l xi,t−l + i l=1 (1) j=1 In the above summation the ﬁlter coefﬁcients ki,t−l capture the dependence of the neuron’s instantaneous ﬁring rate λt on the ith component of the vector stimulus at time t − l, xt−l ; the model therefore allows for spatiotemporal receptive ﬁelds. For convenience, we arrange all the stimulus coefﬁcients in a vector, k, which allows for a uniform treatment of the spatial and temporal components of the receptive ﬁeld. The coefﬁcients aj model the dependence on the observed recent activity r at time t − j (these terms may reﬂect e.g. refractory effects, burstiness, ﬁring-rate adaptation, etc., depending on the value of the vector a [9]). For convenience we denote the unknown parameter vector as θ = {k; a}. The experimental objective is the estimation of the unknown ﬁlter coefﬁcients, θ, given knowledge of the stimuli, xt , and the resulting responses rt . We chose the nonlinear stage of the GLM, the link function f (), to be the exponential function for simplicity. This choice ensures that the log likelihood of the observed data is a concave function of θ [9]. Representing and updating the posterior. As emphasized above, our ﬁrst key task is to efﬁciently update the posterior distribution of θ after t trials, p(θt |xt , rt ), as new stimulus-response pairs are trial 100 trial 500 trial 2500 trial 5000 θ true 1 info. max. trial 0 0 random −1 (a) random info. max. 2000 Time(Seconds) Entropy 1500 1000 500 0 −500 0 1000 2000 3000 Iteration (b) 4000 5000 0.1 total time diagonalization posterior update 1d line Search 0.01 0.001 0 200 400 Dimensionality 600 (c) Figure 1: A) Plots of the estimated receptive ﬁeld for a simulated visual neuron. The neuron’s receptive ﬁeld θ has the Gabor structure shown in the last panel (spike history effects were set to zero for simplicity here, a = 0). The estimate of θ is taken as the mean of the posterior, µt . The images compare the accuracy of the estimates using information maximizing stimuli and random stimuli. B) Plots of the posterior entropies for θ in these two cases; note that the information-maximizing stimuli constrain the posterior of θ much more effectively than do random stimuli. C) A plot of the timing of the three steps performed on each iteration as a function of the dimensionality of θ. The timing for each step was well-ﬁt by a polynomial of degree 2 for the diagonalization, posterior update and total time, and degree 1 for the line search. The times are an average over many iterations. The error-bars for the total time indicate ±1 std. observed. (We use xt and rt to abbreviate the sequences {xt , . . . , x0 } and {rt , . . . , r0 }.) To solve this problem, we approximate this posterior as a Gaussian; this approximation may be justiﬁed by the fact that the posterior is the product of two smooth, log-concave terms, the GLM likelihood function and the prior (which we assume to be Gaussian, for simplicity). Furthermore, the main theorem of [7] indicates that a Gaussian approximation of the posterior will be asymptotically accurate. We use a Laplace approximation to construct the Gaussian approximation of the posterior, p(θt |xt , rt ): we set µt to the peak of the posterior (i.e. the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate of θ), and the covariance matrix Ct to the negative inverse of the Hessian of the log posterior at µt . In general, computing these terms directly requires O(td2 + d3 ) time (where d = dim(θ); the time-complexity increases with t because to compute the posterior we must form a product of t likelihood terms, and the d3 term is due to the inverse of the Hessian matrix), which is unfortunately too slow when t or d becomes large. Therefore we further approximate p(θt−1 |xt−1 , rt−1 ) as Gaussian; to see how this simpliﬁes matters, we use Bayes to write out the posterior: 1 −1 log p(θ|rt , xt ) = − (θ − µt−1 )T Ct−1 (θ − µt−1 ) + − exp {xt ; rt−1 }T θ 2 + rt {xt ; rt−1 }T θ + const d log p(θ|rt , xt ) −1 = −(θ − µt−1 )T Ct−1 + (2) − exp({xt ; rt−1 }T θ) + rt {xt ; rt−1 }T dθ d2 log p(θ|rt , xt ) −1 = −Ct−1 − exp({xt ; rt−1 }T θ){xt ; rt−1 }{xt ; rt−1 }T dθi dθj (3) Now, to update µt we only need to ﬁnd the peak of a one-dimensional function (as opposed to a d-dimensional function); this follows by noting that that the likelihood only varies along a single direction, {xt ; rt−1 }, as a function of θ. At the peak of the posterior, µt , the ﬁrst term in the gradient must be parallel to {xt ; rt−1 } because the gradient is zero. Since Ct−1 is non-singular, µt − µt−1 must be parallel to Ct−1 {xt ; rt−1 }. Therefore we just need to solve a one dimensional problem now to determine how much the mean changes in the direction Ct−1 {xt ; rt−1 }; this requires only O(d2 ) time. Moreover, from the second derivative term above it is clear that computing Ct requires just a rank-one matrix update of Ct−1 , which can be evaluated in O(d2 ) time via the Woodbury matrix lemma. Thus this Gaussian approximation of p(θt−1 |xt−1 , rt−1 ) provides a large gain in efﬁciency; our simulations (data not shown) showed that, despite this improved efﬁciency, the loss in accuracy due to this approximation was minimal. Deriving the (approximately) optimal stimulus. To simplify the derivation of our maximization strategy, we start by considering models in which the ﬁring rate does not depend on past spiking, so θ = {k}. To choose the optimal stimulus for trial t + 1, we want to maximize the conditional mutual information I(θ; rt+1 |xt+1 , xt , rt ) = H(θ|xt , rt ) − H(θ|xt+1 , rt+1 ) (4) with respect to the stimulus xt+1 . The ﬁrst term does not depend on xt+1 , so maximizing the information requires minimizing the conditional entropy H(θ|xt+1 , rt+1 ) = p(rt+1 |xt+1 ) −p(θ|rt+1 , xt+1 ) log p(θ|rt+1 , xt+1 )dθ = Ert+1 |xt+1 log det[Ct+1 ] + const. rt+1 (5) We do not average the entropy of p(θ|rt+1 , xt+1 ) over xt+1 because we are only interested in the conditional entropy for the particular xt+1 which will be presented next. The equality above is due to our Gaussian approximation of p(θ|xt+1 , rt+1 ). Therefore, we need to minimize Ert+1 |xt+1 log det[Ct+1 ] with respect to xt+1 . Since we set Ct+1 to be the negative inverse Hessian of the log-posterior, we have: −1 Ct+1 = Ct + Jobs (rt+1 , xt+1 ) −1 , (6) Jobs is the observed Fisher information. Jobs (rt+1 , xt+1 ) = −∂ 2 log p(rt+1 |ε = xt θ)/∂ε2 xt+1 xt t+1 t+1 (7) Here we use the fact that for the GLM, the likelihood depends only on the dot product, ε = xt θ. t+1 We can use the Woodbury lemma to evaluate the inverse: Ct+1 = Ct I + D(rt+1 , ε)(1 − D(rt+1 , ε)xt Ct xt+1 )−1 xt+1 xt Ct t+1 t+1 (8) where D(rt+1 , ε) = ∂ 2 log p(rt+1 |ε)/∂ε2 . Using some basic matrix identities, log det[Ct+1 ] = log det[Ct ] − log(1 − D(rt+1 , ε)xt Ct xt+1 ) t+1 = log det[Ct ] + D(rt+1 , ε)xt Ct xt+1 t+1 + o(D(rt+1 , ε)xt Ct xt+1 ) t+1 (9) (10) Ignoring the higher order terms, we need to minimize Ert+1 |xt+1 D(rt+1 , ε)xt Ct xt+1 . In our case, t+1 with f (θt xt+1 ) = exp(θt xt+1 ), we can use the moment-generating function of the multivariate Trial info. max. i.i.d 2 400 −10−4 0 0.05 −10−1 −2 ai 800 2 0 −2 −7 −10 i i.i.d k info. max. 1 1 50 i 1 50 i 1 10 1 i (a) i 100 0 −0.05 10 1 1 (b) i 10 (c) Figure 2: A comparison of parameter estimates using information-maximizing versus random stimuli for a model neuron whose conditional intensity depends on both the stimulus and the spike history.

After some algebra, we ﬁnd that to maximize I(θ; rt+1 |xt+1 , xt , rt ), we need to maximize 1 F (xt+1 ) = exp(xT µt ) exp( xT Ct xt+1 )xT Ct xt+1 . t+1 t+1 2 t+1 (11) Computing the optimal stimulus. For the GLM the most informative stimulus is undeﬁned, since increasing the stimulus power ||xt+1 ||2 increases the informativeness of any putatively “optimal” stimulus. To obtain a well-posed problem, we optimize the stimulus under the usual power constraint ||xt+1 ||2 ≤ e < ∞. We maximize Eqn. 11 under this constraint using Lagrange multipliers and an eigendecomposition to reduce our original d-dimensional optimization problem to a onedimensional problem. Expressing Eqn. 11 in terms of the eigenvectors of Ct yields: 1 2 2 F (xt+1 ) = exp( u i yi + ci yi ) ci yi (12) 2 i i i = g( 2 ci yi ) ui yi )h( i (13) i where ui and yi represent the projection of µt and xt+1 onto the ith eigenvector and ci is the corresponding eigenvalue. To simplify notation we also introduce the functions g() and h() which are monotonically strictly increasing functions implicitly deﬁned by Eqn. 12. We maximize F (xt+1 ) by breaking the problem into an inner and outer problem by ﬁxing the value of i ui yi and maximizing h() subject to that constraint. A single line search over all possible values of i ui yi will then ﬁnd the global maximum of F (.). This approach is summarized by the equation: max F (y) = max g(b) · y:||y||2 =e b max y:||y||2 =e,y t u=b 2 ci yi ) h( i Since h() is increasing, to solve the inner problem we only need to solve: 2 ci yi max y:||y||2 =e,y t u=b (14) i This last expression is a quadratic function with quadratic and linear constraints and we can solve it using the Lagrange method for constrained optimization.

A) The posterior means µt and true θt plotted after each trial. θ was 100 dimensional, with its components following a Gabor function. To simulate nonsystematic changes in the response function, the center of the Gabor function was moved according to a random walk in between trials. We modeled the changes in θ as a random walk with a white covariance matrix, Q, with variance .01. In addition to the results for random and information-maximizing stimuli, we also show the µt given stimuli chosen to maximize the information under the (mistaken) assumption that θ was constant. Each row of the images plots θ using intensity to indicate the value of the different components. B) Details of the posterior means µt on selected trials. C) Plots of the posterior entropies as a function of trial number; once again, we see that information-maximizing stimuli constrain the posterior of θt more effectively. equations for the optimal yi as a function of the Lagrange multiplier λ1 . ui e yi (λ1 ) = ||y||2 2(ci − λ1 ) (15) Thus to ﬁnd the global optimum we simply vary λ1 (this is equivalent to performing a search over b), and compute the corresponding y(λ1 ). For each value of λ1 we compute F (y(λ1 )) and choose the stimulus y(λ1 ) which maximizes F (). It is possible to show (details omitted) that the maximum of F () must occur on the interval λ1 ≥ c0 , where c0 is the largest eigenvalue. This restriction on the optimal λ1 makes the implementation of the linesearch signiﬁcantly faster and more stable. To summarize, updating the posterior and ﬁnding the optimal stimulus requires three steps: 1) a rankone matrix update and one-dimensional search to compute µt and Ct ; 2) an eigendecomposition of Ct ; 3) a one-dimensional search over λ1 ≥ c0 to compute the optimal stimulus. The most expensive step here is the eigendecomposition of Ct ; in principle this step is O(d3 ), while the other steps, as discussed above, are O(d2 ). Here our Gaussian approximation of p(θt−1 |xt−1 , rt−1 ) is once again quite useful: recall that in this setting Ct is just a rank-one modiﬁcation of Ct−1 , and there exist efﬁcient algorithms for rank-one eigendecomposition updates [15]. While the worst-case running time of this rank-one modiﬁcation of the eigendecomposition is still O(d3 ), we found the average running time in our case to be O(d2 ) (Fig. 1(c)), due to deﬂation which reduces the cost of matrix multiplications associated with ﬁnding the eigenvectors of repeated eigenvalues. Therefore the total time complexity of our algorithm is empirically O(d2 ) on average. Spike history terms. The preceding derivation ignored the spike-history components of the GLM model; that is, we ﬁxed a = 0 in equation (1). Incorporating spike history terms only affects the optimization step of our algorithm; updating the posterior of θ = {k; a} proceeds exactly as before. The derivation of the optimization strategy proceeds in a similar fashion and leads to an analogous optimization strategy, albeit with a few slight differences in detail which we omit due to space constraints. The main difference is that instead of maximizing the quadratic expression in Eqn. 14 to ﬁnd the maximum of h(), we need to maximize a quadratic expression which includes a linear term due to the correlation between the stimulus coefﬁcients, k, and the spike history coefﬁcients,a. The results of our simulations with spike history terms are shown in Fig. 2. Dynamic θ. In addition to fast changes due to adaptation and spike-history effects, animal preparations often change slowly and nonsystematically over the course of an experiment [16]. We model these effects by letting θ experience diffusion: θt+1 = θt + wt (16) Here wt is a normally distributed random variable with mean zero and known covariance matrix Q. This means that p(θt+1 |xt , rt ) is Gaussian with mean µt and covariance Ct + Q. To update the posterior and choose the optimal stimulus, we use the same procedure as described above1 . Results Our ﬁrst simulation considered the use of our algorithm for learning the receptive ﬁeld of a visually sensitive neuron. We took the neuron’s receptive ﬁeld to be a Gabor function, as a proxy model of a V1 simple cell. We generated synthetic responses by sampling Eqn. 1 with θ set to a 25x33 Gabor function. We used this synthetic data to compare how well θ could be estimated using information maximizing stimuli compared to using random stimuli. The stimuli were 2-d images which were rasterized in order to express x as a vector. The plots of the posterior means µt in Fig. 1 (recall these are equivalent to the MAP estimate of θ) show that the information maximizing strategy converges an order of magnitude more rapidly to the true θ. These results are supported by the conclusion of [7] that the information maximization strategy is asymptotically never worse than using random stimuli and is in general more efﬁcient. The running time for each step of the algorithm as a function of the dimensionality of θ is plotted in Fig. 1(c). These results were obtained on a machine with a dual core Intel 2.80GHz XEON processor running Matlab. The solid lines indicate ﬁtted polynomials of degree 1 for the 1d line search and degree 2 for the remaining curves; the total running time for each trial scaled as O(d2 ), as predicted. When θ was less than 200 dimensions, the total running time was roughly 50 ms (and for dim(θ) ≈ 100, the runtime was close to 15 ms), well within the range of tolerable latencies for many experiments. In Fig. 2 we apply our algorithm to characterize the receptive ﬁeld of a neuron whose response depends on its past spiking. Here, the stimulus coefﬁcients k were chosen to follow a sine-wave; 1 The one difference is that the covariance matrix of p(θt+1 |xt+1 , rt+1 ) is in general no longer just a rankone modiﬁcation of the covariance matrix of p(θt |xt , rt ); thus, we cannot use the rank-one update to compute the eigendecomposition. However, it is often reasonable to take Q to be white, Q = cI; in this case the eigenvectors of Ct + Q are those of Ct and the eigenvalues are ci + c where ci is the ith eigenvalue of Ct ; thus in this case, our methods may be applied without modiﬁcation. the spike history coefﬁcients a were inhibitory and followed an exponential function. When choosing stimuli we updated the posterior for the full θ = {k; a} simultaneously and maximized the information about both the stimulus coefﬁcients and the spike history coefﬁcients. The information maximizing strategy outperformed random sampling for estimating both the spike history and stimulus coefﬁcients. Our ﬁnal set of results, Fig. 3, considers a neuron whose receptive ﬁeld drifts non-systematically with time. We take the receptive ﬁeld to be a Gabor function whose center moves according to a random walk (we have in mind a slow random drift of eye position during a visual experiment). The results demonstrate the feasibility of the information-maximization strategy in the presence of nonstationary response properties θ, and emphasize the superiority of adaptive methods in this context. Conclusion We have developed an efﬁcient implementation of an algorithm for online optimization of neurophysiology experiments based on information-theoretic criterion. Reasonable approximations based on a GLM framework allow the algorithm to run in near-real time even for high dimensional parameter and stimulus spaces, and in the presence of spike-rate adaptation and time-varying neural response properties. Despite these approximations the algorithm consistently provides signiﬁcant improvements over random sampling; indeed, the differences in efﬁciency are large enough that the information-optimization strategy may permit robust system identiﬁcation in cases where it is simply not otherwise feasible to estimate the neuron’s parameters using random stimuli. Thus, in a sense, the proposed stimulus-optimization technique signiﬁcantly extends the reach and power of classical neurophysiology methods.

Our goal is to predict a time series of subjective, semantic ratings of a movie given functional MRI data acquired during viewing by three subjects. Our method uses conditionally trained Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds, which model both the relationships between the subjects’ fMRI voxel measurements and the ratings, as well as the dependencies of the ratings across time steps and between subjects. We also employed non-traditional methods for feature selection and regularization that exploit the spatial structure of voxel activity in the brain. The model displayed good performance in predicting the scored ratings for the three subjects in test data sets, and a variant of this model was the third place entrant to the 2006 PBAIC. 1</p><p>5 0.61484039 <a title="179-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-A_Theory_of_Retinal_Population_Coding.html">16 nips-2006-A Theory of Retinal Population Coding</a></p>
<p>Author: Eizaburo Doi, Michael S. Lewicki</p><p>Abstract: Efﬁcient coding models predict that the optimal code for natural images is a population of oriented Gabor receptive ﬁelds. These results match response properties of neurons in primary visual cortex, but not those in the retina. Does the retina use an optimal code, and if so, what is it optimized for? Previous theories of retinal coding have assumed that the goal is to encode the maximal amount of information about the sensory signal. However, the image sampled by retinal photoreceptors is degraded both by the optics of the eye and by the photoreceptor noise. Therefore, de-blurring and de-noising of the retinal signal should be important aspects of retinal coding. Furthermore, the ideal retinal code should be robust to neural noise and make optimal use of all available neurons. Here we present a theoretical framework to derive codes that simultaneously satisfy all of these desiderata. When optimized for natural images, the model yields ﬁlters that show strong similarities to retinal ganglion cell (RGC) receptive ﬁelds. Importantly, the characteristics of receptive ﬁelds vary with retinal eccentricities where the optical blur and the number of RGCs are signiﬁcantly different. The proposed model provides a uniﬁed account of retinal coding, and more generally, it may be viewed as an extension of the Wiener ﬁlter with an arbitrary number of noisy units. 1</p><p>6 0.61456978 <a title="179-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Logistic_Regression_for_Single_Trial_EEG_Classification.html">126 nips-2006-Logistic Regression for Single Trial EEG Classification</a></p>

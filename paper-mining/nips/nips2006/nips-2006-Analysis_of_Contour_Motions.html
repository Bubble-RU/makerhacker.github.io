<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Peggy Hackney, Christoph Bregler</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for synthesis of human motion in speciﬁed styles. We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>3 0.10193773 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Bottom-Up_Visual_Saliency.html">8 nips-2006-A Nonparametric Approach to Bottom-Up Visual Saliency</a></p>
<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Felix A. Wichmann, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the bottom-up inﬂuence of local image information on human eye movements. Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear ﬁlters, e.g., Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians ﬁlters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end ﬁlters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justiﬁed. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the ﬁeld that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble ﬁndings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive ﬁelds in the early human visual system. 1</p><p>4 0.093087792 <a title="31-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Complexity-Distortion_Approach_to_Joint_Pattern_Alignment.html">3 nips-2006-A Complexity-Distortion Approach to Joint Pattern Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off ﬁdelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational beneﬁts of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.085901357 <a title="31-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Graph-Based_Visual_Saliency.html">86 nips-2006-Graph-Based Visual Saliency</a></p>

<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model ﬁnds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during motion capture.

<p>Author: René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefﬁcients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The ﬁnal result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird ﬂoating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefﬁcients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.</p><p>5 0.38731351 <a title="31-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Graph-Based_Visual_Saliency.html">86 nips-2006-Graph-Based Visual Saliency</a></p>

<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>3 0.54129696 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>4 0.53883529 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Logistic_Regression_for_Single_Trial_EEG_Classification.html">126 nips-2006-Logistic Regression for Single Trial EEG Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Tomioka, Kazuyuki Aihara, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel framework for the classiﬁcation of single trial ElectroEncephaloGraphy (EEG), based on regularized logistic regression. Framed in this robust statistical framework no prior feature extraction or outlier removal is required. We present two variations of parameterizing the regression function: (a) with a full rank symmetric matrix coeﬃcient and (b) as a diﬀerence of two rank=1 matrices. In the ﬁrst case, the problem is convex and the logistic regression is optimal under a generative model. The latter case is shown to be related to the Common Spatial Pattern (CSP) algorithm, which is a popular technique in Brain Computer Interfacing. The regression coeﬃcients can also be topographically mapped onto the scalp similarly to CSP projections, which allows neuro-physiological interpretation. Simulations on 162 BCI datasets demonstrate that classiﬁcation accuracy and robustness compares favorably against conventional CSP based classiﬁers. 1</p><p>5 0.53213727 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Motion_Style_Synthesis_from_Perceptual_Observations.html">111 nips-2006-Learning Motion Style Synthesis from Perceptual Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Peggy Hackney, Christoph Bregler</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for synthesis of human motion in speciﬁed styles. We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>6 0.5314976 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Dyadic_Data_with_Binary_Latent_Factors.html">132 nips-2006-Modeling Dyadic Data with Binary Latent Factors</a></p>

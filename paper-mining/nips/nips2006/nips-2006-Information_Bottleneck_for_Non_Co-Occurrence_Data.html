<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum margin clustering was proposed lately and has shown promising performance in recent studies [1, 2]. It extends the theory of support vector machine to unsupervised learning. Despite its good performance, there are three major problems with maximum margin clustering that question its eﬃciency for real-world applications. First, it is computationally expensive and diﬃcult to scale to large-scale datasets because the number of parameters in maximum margin clustering is quadratic in the number of examples. Second, it requires data preprocessing to ensure that any clustering boundary will pass through the origins, which makes it unsuitable for clustering unbalanced dataset. Third, it is sensitive to the choice of kernel functions, and requires external procedure to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose “generalized maximum margin clustering” framework that addresses the above three problems simultaneously. The new framework generalizes the maximum margin clustering algorithm by allowing any clustering boundaries including those not passing through the origins. It signiﬁcantly improves the computational eﬃciency by reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the new framework is able to automatically determine the appropriate kernel matrix without any labeled data. Finally, we show a formal connection between maximum margin clustering and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the eﬃciency of the generalized maximum margin clustering algorithm using both synthetic datasets and real datasets from the UCI repository. 1</p><p>3 0.19280058 <a title="100-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Differential_Entropic_Clustering_of_Multivariate_Gaussians.html">67 nips-2006-Differential Entropic Clustering of Multivariate Gaussians</a></p>
<p>Author: Jason V. Davis, Inderjit S. Dhillon</p><p>Abstract: Gaussian data is pervasive and many learning algorithms (e.g., k-means) model their inputs as a single sample drawn from a multivariate Gaussian. However, in many real-life settings, each input object is best described by multiple samples drawn from a multivariate Gaussian. Such data can arise, for example, in a movie review database where each movie is rated by several users, or in time-series domains such as sensor networks. Here, each input can be naturally described by both a mean vector and covariance matrix which parameterize the Gaussian distribution. In this paper, we consider the problem of clustering such input objects, each represented as a multivariate Gaussian. We formulate the problem using an information theoretic approach and draw several interesting theoretical connections to Bregman divergences and also Bregman matrix divergences. We evaluate our method across several domains, including synthetic data, sensor network data, and a statistical debugging application. 1</p><p>4 0.18888055 <a title="100-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Fundamental_Limitations_of_Spectral_Clustering.html">80 nips-2006-Fundamental Limitations of Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Meirav Galun</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. Spectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. One contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. We show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. Based on these ﬁndings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. Our measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. We present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. In contrast, using this coherence measure ﬁnds the expected clusters at all scales.

<p>Author: Mingrui Wu, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We present a local learning approach for clustering. The basic idea is that a good clustering result should have the property that the cluster label of each data point can be well predicted based on its neighboring data and their cluster labels, using current supervised learning methods. An optimization problem is formulated such that its solution has the above property. Relaxation and eigen-decomposition are applied to solve this optimization problem. We also brieﬂy investigate the parameter selection issue and provide a simple parameter selection method for the proposed algorithm. Experimental results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. 1</p><p>6 0.13377687 <a title="100-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Dyadic_Data_with_Binary_Latent_Factors.html">132 nips-2006-Modeling Dyadic Data with Binary Latent Factors</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Feng, Greg Hamerly</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm called PG-means which is able to learn the number of clusters in a classical Gaussian mixture model. Our method is robust and efﬁcient; it uses statistical hypothesis tests on one-dimensional projections of the data and model to determine if the examples are well represented by the model. In so doing, we are applying a statistical test for the entire model at once, not just on a per-cluster basis. We show that our method works well in difﬁcult cases such as non-Gaussian data, overlapping clusters, eccentric clusters, high dimension, and many true clusters. Further, our new method provides a much more stable estimate of the number of clusters than existing methods. 1</p><p>4 0.6986531 <a title="100-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Local_Learning_Approach_for_Clustering.html">7 nips-2006-A Local Learning Approach for Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Ron Zass, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we focus on the issue of normalization of the afﬁnity matrix in spectral clustering. We show that the difference between N-cuts and Ratio-cuts is in the error measure being used (relative-entropy versus L1 norm) in ﬁnding the closest doubly-stochastic matrix to the input afﬁnity matrix. We then develop a scheme for ﬁnding the optimal, under Frobenius norm, doubly-stochastic approximation using Von-Neumann’s successive projections lemma. The new normalization scheme is simple and efﬁcient and provides superior clustering performance over many of the standardized tests. 1</p><p>2 0.94579136 <a title="100-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Implicit_Surfaces_with_Globally_Regularised_and_Compactly_Supported_Basis_Functions.html">95 nips-2006-Implicit Surfaces with Globally Regularised and Compactly Supported Basis Functions</a></p>

The contributions include a novel means of regularising multi-scale compactly supported basis functions that leads to the desirable properties previously only associated with fully supported bases, and show equivalence to a Gaussian process with modiﬁed covariance function. We also provide a regularisation framework for simpler and more direct treatment of surface normals, along with a corresponding generalisation of the representer theorem.

For example, in gene expression data, the expression level Z is a function of gene X and condition Y ; or in movie ratings data the rating Z is a function of viewer X and movie Y . The approach represents a consistent extension of the Information Bottleneck method that has previously relied on the availability of co-occurrence statistics. By altering the relevance variable we eliminate the need in the sample of joint distribution of all input variables. This new formulation also enables simple MDL-like model complexity control and prediction of missing values of Z. The approach is analyzed and shown to be on a par with the best known clustering algorithms for a wide range of domains. For the prediction of missing values (collaborative ﬁltering) it improves the currently best known results. 1</p><p>4 0.90606529 <a title="100-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Analysis_of_Empirical_Bayesian_Methods_for_Neuroelectromagnetic_Source_Localization.html">32 nips-2006-Analysis of Empirical Bayesian Methods for Neuroelectromagnetic Source Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Rey Ramírez, Jason Palmer, Scott Makeig, Bhaskar D. Rao, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The ill-posed nature of the MEG/EEG source localization problem requires the incorporation of prior assumptions when choosing an appropriate solution out of an inﬁnite set of candidates. Bayesian methods are useful in this capacity because they allow these assumptions to be explicitly quantiﬁed. Recently, a number of empirical Bayesian approaches have been proposed that attempt a form of model selection by using the data to guide the search for an appropriate prior. While seemingly quite different in many respects, we apply a unifying framework based on automatic relevance determination (ARD) that elucidates various attributes of these methods and suggests directions for improvement. We also derive theoretical properties of this methodology related to convergence, local minima, and localization bias and explore connections with established algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.8637889 <a title="100-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Causal_inference_in_sensorimotor_integration.html">49 nips-2006-Causal inference in sensorimotor integration</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad P. Körding, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: Many recent studies analyze how data from different modalities can be combined. Often this is modeled as a system that optimally combines several sources of information about the same variable. However, it has long been realized that this information combining depends on the interpretation of the data. Two cues that are perceived by different modalities can have different causal relationships: (1) They can both have the same cause, in this case we should fully integrate both cues into a joint estimate. (2) They can have distinct causes, in which case information should be processed independently. In many cases we will not know if there is one joint cause or two independent causes that are responsible for the cues. Here we model this situation as a Bayesian estimation problem. We are thus able to explain some experiments on visual auditory cue combination as well as some experiments on visual proprioceptive cue integration. Our analysis shows that the problem solved by people when they combine cues to produce a movement is much more complicated than is usually assumed, because they need to infer the causal structure that is underlying their sensory experience.</p><p>6 0.80227274 <a title="100-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-A_Local_Learning_Approach_for_Clustering.html">7 nips-2006-A Local Learning Approach for Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Eli Ben-sasson, Ehud Kalai, Adam Kalai</p><p>Abstract: A central question in game theory and artiﬁcial intelligence is how a rational agent should behave in a complex environment, given that it cannot perform unbounded computations. We study strategic aspects of this question by formulating a simple model of a game with additional costs (computational or otherwise) for each strategy. First we connect this to zero-sum games, proving a counter-intuitive generalization of the classic min-max theorem to zero-sum games with the addition of strategy costs. We then show that potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. Both zero-sum and potential games with strategy costs maintain a very appealing property: simple learning dynamics converge to equilibrium. 1 The Approach and Basic Model How should an intelligent agent play a complicated game like chess, given that it does not have unlimited time to think? This question reﬂects one fundamental aspect of “bounded rationality,” a term coined by Herbert Simon [1]. However, bounded rationality has proven to be a slippery concept to formalize (prior work has focused largely on ﬁnite automata playing simple repeated games such as prisoner’s dilemma, e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5]). This paper focuses on the strategic aspects of decisionmaking in complex multi-agent environments, i.e., on how a player should choose among strategies of varying complexity, given that its opponents are making similar decisions. Our model applies to general strategic games and allows for a variety of complexities that arise in real-world applications. For this reason, it is applicable to one-shot games, to extensive games, and to repeated games, and it generalizes existing models such as repeated games played by ﬁnite automata. To easily see that bounded rationality can drastically affect the outcome of a game, consider the following factoring game. Player 1 chooses an n-bit number and sends it to Player 2, who attempts to ﬁnd its prime factorization. If Player 2 is correct, he is paid 1 by Player 1, otherwise he pays 1 to Player 1. Ignoring complexity costs, the game is a trivial win for Player 2. However, for large n, the game should is essentially a win for Player 1, who can easily output a large random number that Player 2 cannot factor (under appropriate complexity assumptions). In general, the outcome of a game (even a zero-sum game like chess) with bounded rationality is not so clear. To concretely model such games, we consider a set of available strategies along with strategy costs. Consider an example of two players preparing to play a computerized chess game for $100K prize. Suppose the players simultaneously choose among two available options: to use a $10K program A or an advanced program B, which costs $50K. We refer to the row chooser as white and to the column chooser as black, with the corresponding advantages reﬂected by the win probabilities of white described in Table 1a. For example, when both players use program A, white wins 55% of the time and black wins 45% of the time (we ignore draws). The players naturally want to choose strategies to maximize their expected net payoffs, i.e., their expected payoff minus their cost. Each cell in Table 1b contains a pair of payoffs in units of thousands of dollars; the ﬁrst is white’s net expected payoff and the second is black’s. a) A B A 55% 93% B 13% 51% b) A (-10) B (-50) A (-10) 45, 35 43,-3 B (-50) 3, 37 1,-1 Figure 1: a) Table of ﬁrst-player winning probabilities based on program choices. b) Table of expected net earnings in thousands of dollars. The unique equilibrium is (A,B) which strongly favors the second player. A surprising property is evident in the above game. Everything about the game seems to favor white. Yet due to the (symmetric) costs, at the unique Nash equilibrium (A,B) of Table 1b, black wins 87% of the time and nets $34K more than white. In fact, it is a dominant strategy for white to play A and for black to play B. To see this, note that playing B increases white’s probability of winning by 38%, independent of what black chooses. Since the pot is $100K, this is worth $38K in expectation, but B costs $40K more than A. On the other hand, black enjoys a 42% increase in probability of winning due to B, independent of what white does, and hence is willing to pay the extra $40K. Before formulating the general model, we comment on some important aspects of the chess example. First, traditional game theory states that chess can be solved in “only” two rounds of elimination of dominated strategies [10], and the outcome with optimal play should always be the same: either a win for white or a win for black. This theoretical prediction fails in practice: in top play, the outcome is very nondeterministic with white winning roughly twice as often as black. The game is too large and complex to be solved by brute force. Second, we have been able to analyze the above chess program selection example exactly because we formulated as a game with a small number of available strategies per player. Another formulation that would ﬁt into our model would be to include all strategies of chess, with some reasonable computational costs. However, it is beyond our means to analyze such a large game. Third, in the example above we used monetary software cost to illustrate a type of strategy cost. But the same analysis could accommodate many other types of costs that can be measured numerically and subtracted from the payoffs, such as time or effort involved in the development or execution of a strategy, and other resource costs. Additional examples in this paper include the number of states in a ﬁnite automaton, the number of gates in a circuit, and the number of turns on a commuter’s route. Our analysis is limited, however, to cost functions that depend only on the strategy of the player and not the strategy chosen by its opponent. For example, if our players above were renting computers A or B and paying for the time of actual usage, then the cost of using A would depend on the choice of computer made by the opponent. Generalizing the example above, we consider a normal form game with the addition of strategy costs, a player-dependent cost for playing each available strategy. Our main results regard two important classes of games: constant-sum and potential games. Potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. While two-person constant-sum games are no longer constant, we give a basic structural description of optimal play in these games. Lastly, we show that known learning dynamics converge in both classes of games. 2 Deﬁnition of strategy costs We ﬁrst deﬁne an N -person normal-form game G = (N, S, p) consisting of ﬁnite sets of (available) pure strategies S = (S1 , . . . , SN ) for the N players, and a payoff function p : S1 × . . . × SN → RN . Players simultaneously choose strategies si ∈ Si after which player i is rewarded with pi (s1 , . . . , sN ). A randomized or mixed strategy σi for player i is a probability distribution over its pure strategies Si , σi ∈ ∆i = x ∈ R|Si | : xj = 1, xj ≥ 0 . We extend p to ∆1 × . . . × ∆N in the natural way, i.e., pi (σ1 , . . . , σN ) = E[pi (s1 , . . . , sN )] where each si is drawn from σi , independently. Denote by s−i = (s1 , s2 , . . . , si−1 , si+1 , . . . , sN ) and similarly for σ−i . A best response by player i to σ−i is σi ∈ ∆i such that pi (σi , σ−i ) = maxσi ∈∆i pi (σi , σ−i ). A (mixed strategy) Nash equilibrium of G is a vector of strategies (σ1 , . . . , σN ) ∈ ∆1 × . . . × ∆N such that each σi is a best response to σ−i . We now deﬁne G−c , the game G with strategy costs c = (c1 , . . . , cN ), where ci : Si → R. It is simply an N -person normal-form game G−c = (N, S, p−c ) with the same sets of pure strategies as G, but with a new payoff function p−c : S1 × . . . × SN → RN where, p−c (s1 , . . . , sN ) = pi (s1 , . . . , sN ) − ci (si ), for i = 1, . . . , N. i We similarly extend ci to ∆i in the natural way. 3 Two-person constant-sum games with strategy costs Recall that a game is constant-sum (k-sum for short) if at every combination of individual strategies, the players’ payoffs sum to some constant k. Two-person k-sum games have some important properties, not shared by general sum games, which result in more effective game-theoretic analysis. In particular, every k-sum game has a unique value v ∈ R. A mixed strategy for player 1 is called optimal if it guarantees payoff ≥ v against any strategy of player 2. A mixed strategy for player 2 is optimal if it guarantees ≥ k − v against any strategy of player 1. The term optimal is used because optimal strategies guarantee as much as possible (v + k − v = k) and playing anything that is not optimal can result in a lesser payoff, if the opponent responds appropriately. (This fact is easily illustrated in the game rock-paper-scissors – randomizing uniformly among the strategies guarantees each player 50% of the pot, while playing anything other than uniformly random enables the opponent to win strictly more often.) The existence of optimal strategies for both players follows from the min-max theorem. An easy corollary is that the Nash equilibria of a k-sum game are exchangeable: they are simply the cross-product of the sets of optimal mixed strategies for both players. Lastly, it is well-known that equilibria in two-person k-sum games can be learned in repeated play by simple dynamics that are guaranteed to converge [17]. With the addition of strategy costs, a k-sum game is no longer k-sum and hence it is not clear, at ﬁrst, what optimal strategies there are, if any. (Many examples of general-sum games do not have optimal strategies.) We show the following generalization of the above properties for zero-sum games with strategies costs. Theorem 1. Let G be a ﬁnite two-person k-sum game and G−c be the game with strategy costs c = (c1 , c2 ). 1. There is a value v ∈ R for G−c and nonempty sets OPT1 and OPT2 of optimal mixed strategies for the two players. OPT1 is the set of strategies that guarantee player 1 payoff ≥ v − c2 (σ2 ), against any strategy σ2 chosen by player 2. Similarly, OPT2 is the set of strategies that guarantee player 2 payoff ≥ k − v − c1 (σ1 ) against any σ1 . 2. The Nash equilibria of G−c are exchangeable: the set of Nash equilibria is OPT1 ×OPT2 . 3. The set of net payoffs possible at equilibrium is an axis-parallel rectangle in R2 . For zero-sum games, the term optimal strategy was natural: the players could guarantee v and k − v, respectively, and this is all that there was to share. Moreover, it is easy to see that only pairs of optimal strategies can have the Nash equilibria property, being best responses to each other. In the case of zero-sum games with strategy costs, the optimal structure is somewhat counterintuitive. First, it is strange that the amount guaranteed by either player depends on the cost of the other player’s action, when in reality each player pays the cost of its own action. Second, it is not even clear why we call these optimal strategies. To get a feel for this latter issue, notice that the sum of the net payoffs to the two players is always k − c1 (σ1 ) − c2 (σ2 ), which is exactly the total of what optimal strategies guarantee, v − c2 (σ2 ) + k − v − c1 (σ1 ). Hence, if both players play what we call optimal strategies, then neither player can improve and they are at Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, suppose player 1 selects a strategy σ1 that does not guarantee him payoff at least v − c2 (σ2 ). This means that there is some response σ2 by player 2 for which player 1’s payoff is < v − c2 (σ2 ) and hence player 2’s payoff is > k − v − c1 (σ1 ). Thus player 2’s best response to σ1 must give player 2 payoff > k − v − c1 (σ1 ) and leave player 1 with < v − c2 (σ2 ). The proof of the theorem (the above reasoning only implies part 2 from part 1) is based on the following simple observation. Consider the k-sum game H = (N, S, q) with the following payoffs: q1 (s1 , s2 ) = p1 (s1 , s2 ) − c1 (s1 ) + c2 (s2 ) = p−c (s1 , s2 ) + c2 (s2 ) 1 q2 (s1 , s2 ) = p2 (s1 , s2 ) − c2 (s1 ) + c1 (s1 ) = p−c (s1 , s2 ) + c1 (s1 ) 2 That is to say, Player 1 pays its strategy cost to Player 2 and vice versa. It is easy to verify that, ∀σ1 , σ1 ∈ ∆1 , σ2 ∈ ∆2 q1 (σ1 , σ2 ) − q1 (σ1 , σ2 ) = p−c (σ1 , σ2 ) − p−c (σ1 , σ2 ) 1 1 (1) This means that the relative advantage in switching strategies in games G−c and H are the same. In particular, σ1 is a best response to σ2 in G−c if and only if it is in H. A similar equality holds for player 2’s payoffs. Note that these conditions imply that the games G−c and H are strategically equivalent in the sense deﬁned by Moulin and Vial [16]. Proof of Theorem 1. Let v be the value of the game H. For any strategy σ1 that guarantees player 1 payoff ≥ v in H, σ1 guarantees player 1 ≥ v − c2 (σ2 ) in G−c . This follows from the deﬁnition of H. Similarly, any strategy σ2 that guarantees player 2 payoff ≥ k − v in H will guarantee ≥ k − v − c1 (σ1 ) in G−c . Thus the sets OPT1 and OPT2 are non-empty. Since v − c2 (σ2 ) + k − v − c1 (σ1 ) = k − c1 (σ1 ) − c2 (σ2 ) is the sum of the payoffs in G−c , nothing greater can be guaranteed by either player. Since the best responses of G−c and H are the same, the Nash equilibria of the two games are the same. Since H is a k-sum game, its Nash equilibria are exchangeable, and thus we have part 2. (This holds for any game that is strategically equivalent to k-sum.) Finally, the optimal mixed strategies OPT1 , OPT2 of any k-sum game are convex sets. If we look at the achievable costs of the mixed strategies in OPTi , by the deﬁnition of the cost of a mixed strategy, this will be a convex subset of R, i.e., an interval. By parts 1 and 2, the set of achievable net payoffs at equilibria of G−c are therefore the cross-product of intervals. To illustrate Theorem 1 graphically, Figure 2 gives a 4 × 4 example with costs of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It illustrates a situation with multiple optimal strategies. Notice that player 1 is completely indifferent between its optimal choices A and B, and player 2 is completely indifferent between C and D. Thus the only question is how kind they would like to be to their opponent. The (A,C) equilibrium is perhaps most natural as it is yields the highest payoffs for both parties. Note that the proof of the above theorem actually shows that zero-sum games with costs share additional appealing properties of zero-sum games. For example, computing optimal strategies is a polynomial time-computation in an n × n game, as it amounts to computing the equilibria of H. We next show that they also have appealing learning properties, though they do not share all properties of zero-sum games.1 3.1 Learning in repeated two-person k-sum games with strategy costs Another desirable property of k-sum games is that, in repeated play, natural learning dynamics converge to the set of Nash equilibria. Before we state the analogous conditions for k-sum games with costs, we brieﬂy give a few deﬁnitions. A repeated game is one in which players chooses a sequence of strategies vectors s1 , s2 , . . ., where each st = (st , . . . , st ) is a strategy vector of some 1 N ﬁxed stage game G = (N, S, p). Under perfect monitoring, when selecting an action in any period the players know all the previous selected actions.As we shall discuss, it is possible to learn to play without perfect monitoring as well. 1 One property that is violated by the chess example is the “advantage of an advantage” property. Say Player 1 has the advantage over Player 2 in a square game if p1 (s1 , s2 ) ≥ p2 (s2 , s1 ) for all strategies s1 , s2 . At equilibrium of a k-sum game, a player with the advantage must have a payoff at least as large as its opponent. This is no longer the case after incorporating strategy costs, as seen in the chess example, where Player 1 has the advantage (even including strategy costs), yet his equilibrium payoff is smaller than 2’s. a) A B C D A 6, 4 7, 3 7.5, 2.5 8.5, 1.5 B 5, 5 6, 4 6.5, 3.5 7, 3 C 3, 7 4, 6 4.5, 5.5 5.5, 4.5 D 2, 8 3, 7 3.5, 6.5 4.5, 5.5 b) A (-1) B (-2) C (-3) D (-4) A (-1) 5, 3 5, 2 4.5, 1.5 4.5, 0.5 B (-2) 4, 3 4, 2 3.5, 1.5 3, 1 C (-3) 2, 4 2, 3 1.5, 2.5 1.5, 1.5 D (-4) 1, 4 1, 3 0.5, 2.5 0.5, 1.5 PLAYER 2 NET PAYOFF Nash Eq.

The shaded region shows the rectangular set of payoffs achievable at mixed strategy Nash equilibria. Perhaps the most intuitive dynamics are best-response: at each stage, each player selects a best response to the opponent’s previous stage play. Unfortunately, these naive dynamics fails to converge to equilibrium in very simple examples. The ﬁctitious play dynamics prescribe, at stage t, selecting any strategy that is a best response to the empirical distribution of opponent’s play during the ﬁrst t − 1 stages. It has been shown that ﬁctitious play converges to equilibrium (of the stage game G) in k-sum games [17]. However, ﬁctitious play requires perfect monitoring. One can learn to play a two-person k-sum game with no knowledge of the payoff table or anything about the other players actions. Using experimentation, the only observations required by each player are its own payoffs in each period (in addition to the number of available actions). So-called bandit algorithms [7] must manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The proof of their convergence follows from the fact that they are no-regret algorithms. (No-regret algorithms date back to Hannan in the 1950’s [12], but his required perfect monitoring). The regret of a player i at stage T is deﬁned to be, T regret of i at T = 1 max pi (si , st ) − pi (st , st ) , −i i −i T si ∈Si t=1 that is, how much better in hindsight player i could have done on the ﬁrst T stages had it used one ﬁxed strategy the whole time (and had the opponents not changed their strategies). Note that regret can be positive or negative. A no-regret algorithm is one in which each player’s asymptotic regret converges to (−∞, 0], i.e., is guaranteed to approach 0 or less. It is well-known that noregret condition in two-person k-sum games implies convergence to equilibrium (see, e.g., [13]). In particular, the pair of mixed strategies which are the empirical distributions of play over time approaches the set of Nash equilibrium of the stage game. Inverse-polynomial rates of convergence (that are polynomial also in the size of the game) can be given for such algorithms. Hence no-regret algorithms provide arguably reasonable ways to play a k-sum game of moderate size. Note that in general-sum games, no such dynamics are known. Fortunately, the same algorithm that works for learning in k-sum games seem to work for learning in such games with strategy costs. Theorem 2. Fictitious play converges to the set of Nash equilibria of the stage game in a two-person k-sum game with strategy costs, as do no-regret learning dynamics. Proof. The proof again follows from equation (1) regarding the game H. Fictitious play dynamics are deﬁned only in terms of best response play. Since G−c and H share the same best responses, ﬁctitious play dynamics are identical for the two games. Since they share the same equilibria and ﬁctitious play converges to equilibria in H, it must converge in G−c as well. For no-regret algorithms, equation (1) again implies that for any play sequence, the regret of each player i with respect to game G−c is the same as its regret with respect to the game H. Hence, no regret in G−c implies no regret in H. Since no-regret algorithms converge to the set of equilibria in k-sum games, they converge to the set of equilibria in H and therefore in G−c as well. 4 Potential games with strategic costs Let us begin with an example of a potential game, called a routing game [18]. There is a ﬁxed directed graph with n nodes and m edges. Commuters i = 1, 2, . . . , N each decide on a route πi , to take from their home si to their work ti , where si and ti are nodes in the graph. For each edge, uv, let nuv be the number of commuters whose path πi contains edge uv. Let fuv : Z → R be a nonnegative monotonically increasing congestion function. Player i’s payoff is − uv∈πi fuv (nuv ), i.e., the negative sum of the congestions on the edges in its path. An N -person normal form game G is said to be a potential game [15] if there is some potential function Φ : S1 × . . . SN → R such that changing a single player’s action changes its payoff by the change in the potential function. That is, there exists a single function Φ, such that for all players i and all pure strategy vectors s, s ∈ S1 × . . . × SN that differ only in the ith coordinate, pi (s) − pi (s ) = Φ(s) − Φ(s ). (2) Potential games have appealing learning properties: simple better-reply dynamics converge to purestrategy Nash equilibria, as do the more sophisticated ﬁctitious-play dynamics described earlier [15]. In our example, this means that if players change their individual paths so as to selﬁshly reduce the sum of congestions on their path, this will eventually lead to an equilibrium where no one can improve. (This is easy to see because Φ keeps increasing.) The absence of similar learning properties for general games presents a frustrating hole in learning and game theory. It is clear that the theoretically clean commuting example above misses some realistic considerations. One issue regarding complexity is that most commuters would not be willing to take a very complicated route just to save a short amount of time. To model this, we consider potential games with strategy costs. In our example, this would be a cost associated with every path. For example, suppose the graph represented streets in a given city. We consider a natural strategy complexity cost associated with a route π, say λ(#turns(π))2 , where there is a parameter λ ∈ R and #turns(π) is deﬁned as the number of times that a commuter has to turn on a route. (To be more precise, say each edge in the graph is annotated with a street name, and a turn is deﬁned to be a pair of consecutive edges in the graph with different street names.) Hence, a best response for player i would minimize: π min (total congestion of π) + λ(#turns(π))2 . from si to ti While adding strategy costs to potential games allows for much more ﬂexibility in model design, one might worry that appealing properties of potential games, such as having pure strategy equilibria and easy learning dynamics, no longer hold. This is not the case. We show that strategic costs ﬁt easily into the potential game framework: Theorem 3. For any potential game G and any cost functions c, G−c is also a potential game. Proof. Let Φ be a potential function for G. It is straightforward to verify that the G−c admits the following potential function Φ : Φ (s1 , . . . , sN ) = Φ(s1 , . . . , sN ) − c1 (s1 ) − . . . − cN (sN ). 5 Additional remarks Part of the reason that the notion of bounded rationality is so difﬁcult to formalize is that understanding enormous games like chess is a daunting proposition. That is why we have narrowed it down to choosing among a small number of available programs. A game theorist might begin by examining the complete payoff table of Figure 1a, which is prohibitively large. Instead of considering only the choices of programs A and B, each player considers all possible chess strategies. In that sense, our payoff table in 1a would be viewed as a reduction of the “real” normal form game. A computer scientist, on the other hand, may consider it reasonable to begin with the existing strategies that one has access to. Regardless of how you view the process, it is clear that for practical purposes players in real life do simplify and analyze “smaller” sets of strategies. Even if the players consider the option of engineering new chess-playing software, this can be viewed as a third strategy in the game, with its own cost and expected payoffs. Again, when considering small number of available strategies, like the two programs above, it may still be difﬁcult to assess the expected payoffs that result when (possibly randomized) strategies play against each other. An additional assumption made throughout the paper is that the players share the same assessments about these expected payoffs. Like other common-knowledge assumptions made in game theory, it would be desirable to weaken this assumption. In the special families of games studied in this paper, and perhaps in additional cases, learning algorithms may be employed to reach equilibrium without knowledge of payoffs. 5.1 Finite automata playing repeated games There has been a large body of interesting work on repeated games played by ﬁnite automata (see [14] for a survey). Much of this work is on achieving cooperation in the classic prisoner’s dilemma game (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5]). Many of these models can be incorporated into the general model outlined in this paper. For example, to view the Abreu and Rubinstein model [6] as such, consider the normal form of an inﬁnitely repeated game with discounting, but restricted to strategies that can be described by ﬁnite automata (the payoffs in every cell of the payoff table are the discounted sums of the inﬁnite streams of payoffs obtained in the repeated game). Let the cost of a strategy be an increasing function of the number of states it employs. For Neyman’s model [3], consider the normal form of a ﬁnitely repeated game with a known number of repetitions. You may consider strategies in this normal form to be only ones with a bounded number of states, as required by Neyman, and assign zero cost to all strategies. Alternatively, you may allow all strategies but assign zero cost to ones that employ number of states below Neyman’s bounds, and an inﬁnite cost to strategies that employ a number of states that exceeds Neyman’s bounds. The structure of equilibria proven in Theorem 1 applies to all the above models when dealing with repeated k-sum games, as in [2]. 6 Future work There are very interesting questions to answer about bounded rationality in truly large games that we did not touch upon. For example, consider the factoring game from the introduction. A pure strategy for Player 1 would be outputting a single n-bit number. A pure strategy for Player 2 would be any factoring program, described by a circuit that takes as input an n-bit number and attempts to output a representation of its prime factorization. The complexity of such a strategy would be an increasing function of the number of gates in the circuit. It would be interesting to make connections between asymptotic algorithm complexity and games. Another direction regards an elegant line of work on learning to play correlated equilibria by repeated play [11]. It would be natural to consider how strategy costs affect correlated equilibria. Finally, it would also be interesting to see how strategy costs affect the so-called “price of anarchy” [19] in congestion games.

<p>Author: Chris Murray, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: In real-world planning problems, we must reason not only about our own goals, but about the goals of other agents with which we may interact. Often these agents’ goals are neither completely aligned with our own nor directly opposed to them. Instead there are opportunities for cooperation: by joining forces, the agents can all achieve higher utility than they could separately. But, in order to cooperate, the agents must negotiate a mutually acceptable plan from among the many possible ones, and each agent must trust that the others will follow their parts of the deal. Research in multi-agent planning has often avoided the problem of making sure that all agents have an incentive to follow a proposed joint plan. On the other hand, while game theoretic algorithms handle incentives correctly, they often don’t scale to large planning problems. In this paper we attempt to bridge the gap between these two lines of research: we present an eﬃcient game-theoretic approximate planning algorithm, along with a negotiation protocol which encourages agents to compute and agree on joint plans that are fair and optimal in a sense deﬁned below. We demonstrate our algorithm and protocol on two simple robotic planning problems.1 1 INTRODUCTION We model the multi-agent planning problem as a general-sum stochastic game with cheap talk: the agents observe the state of the world, discuss their plans with each other, and then simultaneously select their actions. The state and actions determine a one-step reward for each player and a distribution over the world’s next state, and the process repeats. While talking allows the agents to coordinate their actions, it cannot by itself solve the problem of trust: the agents might lie or make false promises. So, we are interested in planning algorithms that ﬁnd subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, every deviation from the plan is deterred by the threat of a suitable punishment, and every threatened punishment is believable. To ﬁnd these equilibria, planners must reason about their own and other agents’ incentives to deviate: if other agents have incentives to deviate then I can’t trust them, while if I have an incentive to deviate, they can’t trust me. In a given game there may be many subgame-perfect equilibria with widely diﬀering payoﬀs: some will be better for some agents, and others will be better for other agents. It is generally not feasible to compute all equilibria [1], and even if it were, there would be no obvious way 1 We gratefully acknowledge help and comments from Ron Parr on this research. This work was supported in part by DARPA contracts HR0011-06-0023 (the CS2P program) and 55-00069 (the RADAR program). All opinions, conclusions, and errors are our own. to select one to implement. It does not make sense for the agents to select an equilibrium without consulting one another: there is no reason that agent A’s part of one joint plan would be compatible with agent B’s part of another joint plan. Instead the agents must negotiate, computing and proposing equilibria until they ﬁnd one which is acceptable to all parties. This paper describes a planning algorithm and a negotiation protocol which work together to ensure that the agents compute and select a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium which is both approximately Pareto-optimal (that is, its value to any single agent cannot be improved very much without lowering the value to another another agent) and approximately fair (that is, near the so-called Nash bargaining point). Neither the algorithm nor the protocol is guaranteed to work in all games; however, they are guaranteed correct when they are applicable, and applicability is easy to check. In addition, our experiments show that they work well in some realistic situations. Together, these properties of fairness, enforceability, and Pareto optimality form a strong solution concept for a stochastic game. The use of this deﬁnition is one characteristic that distinguishes our work from previous research: ours is the ﬁrst eﬃcient algorithm that we know of to use such a strong solution concept for stochastic games. Our planning algorithm performs dynamic programming on a set-based value function: for P players, at a state s, V ∈ V(s) ⊂ RP is an estimate of the value the players can achieve. We represent V(s) by sampling points on its convex hull. This representation is conservative, i.e., guarantees that we ﬁnd a subset of the true V∗ (s). Based on the sampled points we can eﬃciently compute one-step backups by checking which joint actions are enforceable in an equilibrium. Our negotiation protocol is based on a multi-player version of Rubinstein’s bargaining game. Players together enumerate a set of equilibria, and then take turns proposing an equilibrium from the set. Until the players agree, the protocol ends with a small probability after each step and defaults to a low-payoﬀ equilibrium; the fear of this outcome forces players to make reasonable oﬀers. 2 2.1 BACKGROUND STOCHASTIC GAMES A stochastic game represents a multi-agent planning problem in the same way that a Markov Decision Process [2] represents a single-agent planning problem. As in an MDP, transitions in a stochastic game depend on the current state and action. Unlike MDPs, the current (joint) action is a vector of individual actions, one for each player. More formally, a generalsum stochastic game G is a tuple (S, sstart , P, A, T, R, γ). S is a set of states, and sstart ∈ S is the start state. P is the number of players. A = A1 ×A2 ×. . .×AP is the ﬁnite set of joint actions. We deal with fully observable stochastic games with perfect monitoring, where all players can observe previous joint actions. T : S × A → P (S) is the transition function, where P (S) is the set of probability distributions over S. R : S × A → RP is the reward function. We will write Rp (s, a) for the pth component of R(s, a). γ ∈ [0, 1) is the discount factor. Player p wants to maximize her discounted total value for the observed sequence ∞ of states and joint actions s1 , a1 , s2 , a2 , . . ., Vp = t=1 γ t−1 Rp (st , at ). A stationary policy for player p is a function πp : S → P (Ap ). A stationary joint policy is a vector of policies π = (π1 , . . . , πP ), one for each player. A nonstationary policy for player p is a function πp : (∪∞ (S × A)t × S) → P (Ap ) which takes a history of states and joint actions and t=0 produces a distribution over player p’s actions; we can deﬁne a nonstationary joint policy analogously. For any nonstationary joint policy, there is a stationary policy that achieves the same value at every state [3]. The value function Vpπ : S → R gives expected values for player p under joint policy π. The value vector at state s, Vπ (s), is the vector with components Vpπ (s). (For a nonstationary policy π we will deﬁne Vpπ (s) to be the value if s were the start state, and Vpπ (h) to be the value after observing history h.) A vector V is feasible at state s if there is a π for which Vπ (s) = V, and we will say that π achieves V. We will assume public randomization: the agents can sample from a desired joint action distribution in such a way that everyone can verify the outcome. If public randomization is not directly available, there are cryptographic protocols which can simulate it [4]. This assumption means that the set of feasible value vectors is convex, since we can roll a die at the ﬁrst time step to choose from a set of feasible policies. 2.2 EQUILIBRIA While optimal policies for MDPs can be determined exactly via various algorithms such as linear programming [2], it isn’t clear what it means to ﬁnd an optimal policy for a general sum stochastic game. So, rather than trying to determine a unique optimal policy, we will deﬁne a set of reasonable policies: the Pareto-dominant subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. A (possibly nonstationary) joint policy π is a Nash equilibrium if, for each individual player, no unilateral deviation from the policy would increase that player’s expected value for playing the game. Nash equilibria can contain incredible threats, that is, threats which the agents have no intention of following through on. To remove this possibility, we can deﬁne the subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. A policy π is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibrium in every possible subgame: that is, if there is no incentive for any player to deviate after observing any history of joint actions. Finally, consider two policies π and φ. If Vpπ (sstart ) ≥ Vpφ (sstart ) for all players p, and if Vpπ (sstart ) > Vpφ (sstart ) for at least one p, then we will say that π Pareto dominates φ. A policy which is not Pareto dominated by any other policy is Pareto optimal. 2.3 RELATED WORK Littman and Stone [5] give an algorithm for ﬁnding Nash equilibria in two-player repeated games. Hansen et al. [6] show how to eliminate very-weakly-dominated strategies in partially observable stochastic games. Doraszelski and Judd [7] show how to compute Markov perfect equilibria in continuous-time stochastic games. The above papers use solution concepts much weaker than Pareto-dominant subgame-perfect equilibrium, and do not address negotiation and coordination. Perhaps the closest work to the current paper is by Brafman and Tennenholtz [8]: they present learning algorithms which, in repeated self-play, ﬁnd Pareto-dominant (but not subgame-perfect) Nash equilibria in matrix and stochastic games. By contrast, we consider a single play of our game, but allow “cheap talk” beforehand. And, our protocol encourages arbitrary algorithms to agree on Pareto-dominant equilibria, while their result depends strongly on the self-play assumption. 2.3.1 FOLK THEOREMS In any game, each player can guarantee herself an expected discounted value regardless of what actions the other players takes. We call this value the safety value. Suppose that there is a stationary subgame-perfect equilibrium which achieves the safety value for both players; call this the safety equilibrium policy. Suppose that, in a repeated game, some stationary policy π is better for both players than the safety equilibrium policy. Then we can build a subgame-perfect equilibrium with the same payoﬀ as π: start playing π, and if someone deviates, switch to the safety equilibrium policy. So long as γ is suﬃciently large, no rational player will want to deviate. This is the folk theorem for repeated games: any feasible value vector which is strictly better than the safety values corresponds to a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium [9]. (The proof is slightly more complicated if there is no safety equilibrium policy, but the theorem holds for any repeated game.) There is also a folk theorem for general stochastic games [3]. This theorem, while useful, is not strong enough for our purposes: it only covers discount factors γ which are so close to 1 that the players don’t care which state they wind up in after a possible deviation. In most practical stochastic games, discount factors this high are unreasonably patient. When γ is signiﬁcantly less than 1, the set of equilibrium vectors can change in strange ways as we change γ [10]. Value to player 2 1 0.5 0 0 0.5 1 1.5 2 Value to player 1 2.5 3 Figure 1: Equilibria of a Rubinstein game with γ = 0.8. Shaded area shows feasible value vectors (U1 (x), U2 (x)) for outcomes x. Right-hand circle corresponds to equilibrium when player 1 moves ﬁrst, left-hand circle when player 2 moves ﬁrst. The Nash point is at 3. 2.3.2 RUBINSTEIN’S GAME Rubinstein [11] considered a game where two players divide a slice of pie. The ﬁrst player oﬀers a division x, 1 − x to the second; the second player either accepts the division, or refuses and oﬀers her own division 1 − y, y. The game repeats until some player accepts an oﬀer or until either player gives up. In the latter case neither player gets any pie. Rubinstein showed that if player p’s utility for receiving a fraction x at time t is Up (x, t) = γ t Up (x) for a discount factor 0 ≤ γ < 1 and an appropriate time-independent utility function Up (x) ≥ 0, then rational players will agree on a division near the so-called Nash bargaining point. This is the point which maximizes the product of the utilities that the players gain by cooperating, U1 (x)U2 (1 − x). As γ ↑ 1, the equilibrium will approach the Nash point. See Fig. 1 for an illustration. For three or more players, a similar result holds where agents take turns proposing multi-way divisions of the pie [12]. See the technical report [13] for more detail on the multi-player version of Rubinstein’s game and the Nash bargaining point. 3 NEGOTIATION PROTOCOL The Rubinstein game implicitly assumes that the result of a failure to cooperate is known to all players: nobody gets any pie. The multi-player version of the game assumes in addition that giving one player a share of the pie doesn’t force us to give a share to any other player. Neither of these properties holds for general stochastic games. They are, however, easy to check, and often hold or can be made to hold for planning domains of interest. So, we will assume that the players have agreed beforehand on a subgame-perfect equilibrium π dis , called the disagreement policy, that they will follow in the event of a negotiation failure. In addition, for games with three or more players, we will assume that each player can unilaterally reduce her own utility by any desired amount without aﬀecting other players’ utilities. Given these assumptions, our protocol proceeds in two phases (pseudocode is given in the technical report [13]. In the ﬁrst phase agents compute subgame-perfect equilibria and take turns revealing them. On an agent’s turn she either reveals an equilibrium or passes; if all agents pass consecutively, the protocol proceeds to the second phase. When an agent states a policy π, the other agents verify that π is a subgame-perfect equilibrium and calculate its payoﬀ vector Vπ (sstart ); players who state non-equilibrium policies miss their turn. At the end of the ﬁrst phase, suppose the players have revealed a set Π of policies. Deﬁne Xp (π) = Vpπ (sstart ) − Vpdis (sstart ) U = convhull {X(π) | π ∈ Π} U = {u ≥ 0 | (∃v ∈ U | u ≤ v)} where Vdis is the value function of π dis , Xp (π) is the excess of policy π for player p, and U is the set of feasible excess vectors. In the second phase, players take turns proposing points u ∈ U along with policies or mixtures of policies in Π that achieve them. After each proposal, all agents except the pro- poser decide whether to accept or reject. If everyone accepts, the proposal is implemented: everyone starts executing the agreed equilibrium. Otherwise, the players who accepted are removed from future negotiation and have their utilities ﬁxed at the proposed levels. Fixing player p’s utility at up means that all future proposals must give p exactly up . Invalid proposals cause the proposer to lose her turn. To achieve this, the proposal may require p to voluntarily lower her own utility; this requirement is enforced by the threat that all players will revert to π dis if p fails to act as required. If at some point we hit the chance of having the current round of communication end, all remaining players are assigned their disagreement values. The players execute the last proposed policy π (or π dis if there has been no valid proposal), and any player p for whom Vpπ (sstart ) is greater than her assigned utility up voluntarily lowers her utility to the correct level. (Again, failure to do so results in all players reverting to π dis .) Under the above protocol, player’s preferences are the same as in a Rubinstein game with utility set U: because we have assumed that negotiation ends with probability after each message, agreeing on u after t additional steps is exactly as good as agreeing on u(1− )t now. So with suﬃciently small, the Rubinstein or Krishna-Serrano results show that rational players will agree on a vector u ∈ U which is close to the Nash point argmaxu∈U Πp up . 4 COMPUTING EQUILIBRIA In order to use the protocol of Sec. 3 for bargaining in a stochastic game, the players must be able to compute some subgame-perfect equilibria. Computing equilibria is a hard problem, so we cannot expect real agents to ﬁnd the entire set of equilibria. Fortunately, each player will want to ﬁnd the equilibria which are most advantageous to herself to inﬂuence the negotiation process in her favor. But equilibria which oﬀer other players reasonably high reward have a higher chance of being accepted in negotiation. So, self interest will naturally distribute the computational burden among all the players. In this section we describe an eﬃcient dynamic-programming algorithm for computing equilibria. The algorithm takes some low-payoﬀ equilibria as input and (usually) outputs higherpayoﬀ equilibria. It is based on the intuition that we can use low-payoﬀ equilibria as enforcement tools: by threatening to switch to an equilibrium that has low value to player p, we can deter p from deviating from a cooperative policy. pun pun In more detail, we will assume that we are given P diﬀerent equilibria π1 , . . . , πP ; we pun pun dis will use πp to punish player p if she deviates. We can set πp = π for all p if π dis is the only equilibrium we know; or, we can use any other equilibrium policies that we happen pun to have discovered. The algorithm will be most eﬀective when the value of πp to player p is as low as possible in all states. pun We will then search for cooperative policies that we can enforce with the given threats πp . We will ﬁrst present an algorithm which pretends that we can eﬃciently take direct sums and convex hulls of arbitrary sets. This algorithm is impractical, but ﬁnds all enforceable value vectors. We will then turn it into an approximate algorithm which uses ﬁnite data structures to represent the set-valued variables. As we allow more and more storage for each set, the approximate algorithm will approach the exact one; and in any case the result will be a set of equilibria which the agents can execute. 4.1 THE EXACT ALGORITHM Our algorithm maintains a set of value vectors V(s) for each state s. It initializes V(s) to a set which we know contains the value vectors for all equilibrium policies. It then reﬁnes V by dynamic programming: it repeatedly attempts to improve the set of values at each state by backing up all of the joint actions, excluding joint actions from which some agent has an incentive to deviate. In more detail, we will compute Vpdis (s) ≡ Vpπdis (s) for all s and p and use the vector Vdis (s) in our initialization. (Recall that we have deﬁned Vpπ (s) for a nonstationary policy π as the value of π if s were the start state.) We also need the values of the punishment policies for Initialization for s ∈ S V(s) ← {V | Vpdis (s) ≤ Vp ≤ Rmax /(1 − γ)} end Repeat until converged for iteration ← 1, 2, . . . for s ∈ S Compute value vector set for each joint action, then throw away unenforceable vectors for a ∈ A Q(s, a) ← {R(s, a)} + γ s ∈S T (s, a)(s )V(s ) Q(s, a) ← {Q ∈ Q(s, a) | Q ≥ Vdev (s, a)} end We can now randomize among joint actions V(s) ← convhull a Q(s, a) end end Figure 2: Dynamic programming using exact operations on sets of value vectors π pun their corresponding players, Vppun (s) ≡ Vp p (s) for all p and s. Given these values, deﬁne Qdev (s, a) = Rp (s, a) + γ p T (s, a)(s )Vppun (s ) (1) s ∈S pun to be the value to player p of playing joint action a from state s and then following πp forever after. From the above Qdev values we can compute player p’s value for deviating from an equilibp rium which recommends action a in state s: it is Qdev (s, a ) for the best possible deviation p a , since p will get the one-step payoﬀ for a but be punished by the rest of the players starting on the following time step. That is, Vpdev (s, a) = max Qdev (s, a1 × . . . × ap × . . . × aP ) p ap ∈Ap (2) Vpdev (s, a) is the value we must achieve for player p in state s if we are planning to recommend pun action a and punish deviations with πp : if we do not achieve this value, player p would rather deviate and be punished. Our algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. After k iterations, each vector in V(s) corresponds to a k-step policy in which no agent ever has an incentive to deviate. In the k + 1st iteration, the ﬁrst assignment to Q(s, a) computes the value of performing action a followed by any k-step policy. The second assignment throws out the pairs (a, π) for which some agent would want to deviate from a given that the agents plan to follow π in the future. And the convex hull accounts for the fact that, on reaching state s, we can select an action a and future policy π at random from the feasible pairs.2 Proofs of convergence and correctness of the exact algorithm are in the technical report [13]. Of course, we cannot actually implement the algorithm of Fig. 2, since it requires variables whose values are convex sets of vectors. But, we can approximate V(s) by choosing a ﬁnite set of witness vectors W ⊂ RP and storing V(s, w) = arg maxv∈V(s) (v·w) for each w ∈ W. V(s) is then approximated by the convex hull of {V(s, w) | w ∈ W}. If W samples the P dimensional unit hypersphere densely enough, the maximum possible approximation error will be small. (In practice, each agent will probably want to pick W diﬀerently, to focus her computation on policies in the portion of the Pareto frontier where her own utility is relatively high.) As |W| increases, the error introduced at each step will go to zero. The approximate algorithm is given in more detail in the technical report [13]. 2 It is important for this randomization to occur after reaching state s to avoid introducing incentives to deviate, and it is also important for the randomization to be public.

In our motion planning problem (Fig. 3), two players together control a two-wheeled robot, with each player picking the rotational velocity for one wheel. Each player has a list of goal landmarks which she wants to cycle through, but the two players can have diﬀerent lists of goals. We discretized states based on X, Y, θ and the current goals, and discretized actions into stop, slow (0.45 m ), and fast (0.9 m ), for 9 joint actions and about 25,000 states. s s We discretized time at ∆t = 1s, and set γ = 0.99. For both the disagreement policy and all punishment policies, we used “always stop,” since by keeping her wheel stopped either player can prevent the robot from moving. Planning took a few hours of wall clock time on a desktop workstation for 32 witnesses per state. Based on the planner’s output, we ran our negotiation protocol to select an equilibrium. Fig. 3 shows the results: with limited computation the players pick two selﬁsh paths and randomize equally between them, while with more computation they ﬁnd the cooperative path. Our experiments also showed that limiting the computation available to one player allows the unrestricted player to reveal only some of the equilibria she knows about, tilting the outcome of the negotiation in her favor (see the technical report [13] for details). For our second experiment we examined a more realistic supply-chain problem. Here each player is a parts supplier competing for the business of an engine manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn’t store items and will only pay for parts which can be used immediately. Each player controls a truck which moves parts from warehouses to the assembly shop; she pays for parts when she picks them up, and receives payment on delivery. Each player gets parts from diﬀerent locations at diﬀerent prices and no one player can provide all of the parts the manufacturer needs. Each player’s truck can be at six locations along a line: four warehouse locations (each of which provides a diﬀerent type of part), one empty location, and the assembly shop. Building an engine requires ﬁve parts, delivered in the order A, {B, C}, D, E (parts B and C can arrive in either order). After E, the manufacturer needs A again. Players can move left or right along the line at a small cost, or wait for free. They can also buy parts at a warehouse (dropping any previous cargo), or sell their cargo if they are at the shop and the manufacturer wants it. Each player can only carry one part at a time and only one player can make a delivery at a time. Finally, any player can retire and sell her truck; in this case the game ends and all players get the value of their truck plus any cargo. The disagreement policy is for all players to retire at all states. Fig. 4 shows the computed sets V(sstart ) for various numbers of witnesses. The more witnesses we use, the more accurately we represent the frontier, and the closer our ﬁnal policy is to the true Nash point. All of the policies computed are “intelligent” and “cooperative”: a human observer would not see obvious ways to improve them, and in fact would say that they look similar despite their diﬀering payoﬀs. Players coordinate their motions, so that one player will drive out to buy part E while the other delivers part D. They sit idle only in order to delay the purchase of a part which would otherwise be delivered too soon. 6 CONCLUSION Real-world planning problems involve negotiation among multiple agents with varying goals. To take all agents incentives into account, the agents should ﬁnd and agree on Paretodominant subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. For this purpose, we presented eﬃcient planning and negotiation algorithms for general-sum stochastic games, and tested them on two robotic planning problems. References [1] V. Conitzer and T.

<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithmic framework for an abstract game which we term a convex repeated game. We show that various online learning and boosting algorithms can be all derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework. This uniﬁed view explains the properties of existing algorithms and also enables us to derive several new interesting algorithms. Our algorithmic framework stems from a connection that we build between the notions of regret in game theory and weak duality in convex optimization. 1 Introduction and Problem Setting Several problems arising in machine learning can be modeled as a convex repeated game. Convex repeated games are closely related to online convex programming (see [19, 9] and the discussion in the last section). A convex repeated game is a two players game that is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t of the repeated game, the ﬁrst player chooses a vector wt from a convex set S. Next, the second player responds with a convex function gt : S → R. Finally, the ﬁrst player suffers an instantaneous loss gt (wt ). We study the game from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player. The goal of the ﬁrst player is to minimize its cumulative loss, t gt (wt ). To motivate this rather abstract setting let us ﬁrst cast the more familiar setting of online learning as a convex repeated game. Online learning is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t, the learner ﬁrst receives a question, cast as a vector xt , and is required to provide an answer for this question. For example, xt can be an encoding of an email message and the question is whether the email is spam or not. The prediction of the learner is performed based on an hypothesis, ht : X → Y, where X is the set of questions and Y is the set of possible answers. In the aforementioned example, Y would be {+1, −1} where +1 stands for a spam email and −1 stands for a benign one. After predicting an answer, the learner receives the correct answer for the question, denoted yt , and suffers loss according to a loss function (ht , (xt , yt )). In most cases, the hypotheses used for prediction come from a parameterized set of hypotheses, H = {hw : w ∈ S}. For example, the set of linear classiﬁers, which is used for answering yes/no questions, is deﬁned as H = {hw (x) = sign( w, x ) : w ∈ Rn }. Thus, rather than saying that on round t the learner chooses a hypothesis, we can say that the learner chooses a vector wt and its hypothesis is hwt . Next, we note that once the environment chooses a question-answer pair (xt , yt ), the loss function becomes a function over the hypotheses space or equivalently over the set of parameter vectors S. We can therefore redeﬁne the online learning process as follows. On round t, the learner chooses a vector wt ∈ S, which deﬁnes a hypothesis hwt to be used for prediction. Then, the environment chooses a questionanswer pair (xt , yt ), which induces the following loss function over the set of parameter vectors, gt (w) = (hw , (xt , yt )). Finally, the learner suffers the loss gt (wt ) = (hwt , (xt , yt )). We have therefore described the process of online learning as a convex repeated game. In this paper we assess the performance of the ﬁrst player using the notion of regret. Given a number of rounds T and a ﬁxed vector u ∈ S, we deﬁne the regret of the ﬁrst player as the excess loss for not consistently playing the vector u, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) . t=1 Our main result is an algorithmic framework for the ﬁrst player which guarantees low regret with respect to any vector u ∈ S. Speciﬁcally, we derive regret bounds that take the following form ∀u ∈ S, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) ≤ t=1 f (u) + L √ , T (1) where f : S → R and L ∈ R+ . Informally, the function f measures the “complexity” of vectors in S and the scalar L is related to some generalized Lipschitz property of the functions g1 , . . . , gT . We defer the exact requirements we impose on f and L to later sections. Our algorithmic framework emerges from a representation of the regret bound given in Eq. (1) using an optimization problem. Speciﬁcally, we rewrite Eq. (1) as follows 1 T T gt (wt ) ≤ inf t=1 u∈S 1 T T gt (u) + t=1 f (u) + L √ . T (2) That is, the average loss of the ﬁrst player should be bounded above by the minimum value of an optimization problem in which we jointly minimize the average loss of u and the “complexity” of u as measured by the function f . Note that the optimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) can only be solved in hindsight after observing the entire sequence of loss functions. Nevertheless, writing the regret bound as in Eq. (2) implies that the average loss of the ﬁrst player forms a lower bound for a minimization problem. The notion of duality, commonly used in convex optimization theory, plays an important role in obtaining lower bounds for the minimal value of a minimization problem (see for example [14]). By generalizing the notion of Fenchel duality, we are able to derive a dual optimization problem, which can be optimized incrementally, as the game progresses. In order to derive explicit quantitative regret bounds we make an immediate use of the fact that dual objective lower bounds the primal objective. We therefore reduce the process of playing convex repeated games to the task of incrementally increasing the dual objective function. The amount by which the dual increases serves as a new and natural notion of progress. By doing so we are able to tie the primal objective value, the average loss of the ﬁrst player, and the increase in the dual. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we establish our notation and point to a few mathematical tools that we use throughout the paper. Our main tool for deriving algorithms for playing convex repeated games is a generalization of Fenchel duality, described in Sec. 3. Our algorithmic framework is given in Sec. 4 and analyzed in Sec. 5. The generality of our framework allows us to utilize it in different problems arising in machine learning. Speciﬁcally, in Sec. 6 we underscore the applicability of our framework for online learning and in Sec. 7 we outline and analyze boosting algorithms based on our framework. We conclude with a discussion and point to related work in Sec. 8. Due to the lack of space, some of the details are omitted from the paper and can be found in [16]. 2 Mathematical Background We denote scalars with lower case letters (e.g. x and w), and vectors with bold face letters (e.g. x and w). The inner product between vectors x and w is denoted by x, w . Sets are designated by upper case letters (e.g. S). The set of non-negative real numbers is denoted by R+ . For any k ≥ 1, the set of integers {1, . . . , k} is denoted by [k]. A norm of a vector x is denoted by x . The dual norm is deﬁned as λ = sup{ x, λ : x ≤ 1}. For example, the Euclidean norm, x 2 = ( x, x )1/2 is dual to itself and the 1 norm, x 1 = i |xi |, is dual to the ∞ norm, x ∞ = maxi |xi |. We next recall a few deﬁnitions from convex analysis. The reader familiar with convex analysis may proceed to Lemma 1 while for a more thorough introduction see for example [1]. A set S is convex if for any two vectors w1 , w2 in S, all the line between w1 and w2 is also within S. That is, for any α ∈ [0, 1] we have that αw1 + (1 − α)w2 ∈ S. A set S is open if every point in S has a neighborhood lying in S. A set S is closed if its complement is an open set. A function f : S → R is closed and convex if for any scalar α ∈ R, the level set {w : f (w) ≤ α} is closed and convex. The Fenchel conjugate of a function f : S → R is deﬁned as f (θ) = supw∈S w, θ − f (w) . If f is closed and convex then the Fenchel conjugate of f is f itself. The Fenchel-Young inequality states that for any w and θ we have that f (w) + f (θ) ≥ w, θ . A vector λ is a sub-gradient of a function f at w if for all w ∈ S we have that f (w ) − f (w) ≥ w − w, λ . The differential set of f at w, denoted ∂f (w), is the set of all sub-gradients of f at w. If f is differentiable at w then ∂f (w) consists of a single vector which amounts to the gradient of f at w and is denoted by f (w). Sub-gradients play an important role in the deﬁnition of Fenchel conjugate. In particular, the following lemma states that if λ ∈ ∂f (w) then Fenchel-Young inequality holds with equality. Lemma 1 Let f be a closed and convex function and let ∂f (w ) be its differential set at w . Then, for all λ ∈ ∂f (w ) we have, f (w ) + f (λ ) = λ , w . A continuous function f is σ-strongly convex over a convex set S with respect to a norm · if S is contained in the domain of f and for all v, u ∈ S and α ∈ [0, 1] we have 1 (3) f (α v + (1 − α) u) ≤ α f (v) + (1 − α) f (u) − σ α (1 − α) v − u 2 . 2 Strongly convex functions play an important role in our analysis primarily due to the following lemma. Lemma 2 Let · be a norm over Rn and let · be its dual norm. Let f be a σ-strongly convex function on S and let f be its Fenchel conjugate. Then, f is differentiable with f (θ) = arg maxx∈S θ, x − f (x). Furthermore, for any θ, λ ∈ Rn we have 1 f (θ + λ) − f (θ) ≤ f (θ), λ + λ 2 . 2σ Two notable examples of strongly convex functions which we use are as follows. 1 Example 1 The function f (w) = 2 w norm. Its conjugate function is f (θ) = 2 2 1 2 is 1-strongly convex over S = Rn with respect to the θ 2. 2 2 n 1 Example 2 The function f (w) = i=1 wi log(wi / n ) is 1-strongly convex over the probabilistic n simplex, S = {w ∈ R+ : w 1 = 1}, with respect to the 1 norm. Its conjugate function is n 1 f (θ) = log( n i=1 exp(θi )). 3 Generalized Fenchel Duality In this section we derive our main analysis tool. We start by considering the following optimization problem, T inf c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) , w∈S where c is a non-negative scalar. An equivalent problem is inf w0 ,w1 ,...,wT c f (w0 ) + T t=1 gt (wt ) s.t. w0 ∈ S and ∀t ∈ [T ], wt = w0 . Introducing T vectors λ1 , . . . , λT , each λt ∈ Rn is a vector of Lagrange multipliers for the equality constraint wt = w0 , we obtain the following Lagrangian T T L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) = c f (w0 ) + t=1 gt (wt ) + t=1 λt , w0 − wt . The dual problem is the task of maximizing the following dual objective value, D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = inf L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) w0 ∈S,w1 ,...,wT = − c sup w0 ∈S = −c f −1 c w0 , − 1 c T t=1 T t=1 λt − λt − f (w0 ) − T t=1 gt (λt ) , T t=1 sup ( wt , λt − gt (wt )) wt where, following the exposition of Sec. 2, f , g1 , . . . , gT are the Fenchel conjugate functions of f, g1 , . . . , gT . Therefore, the generalized Fenchel dual problem is sup − cf λ1 ,...,λT −1 c T t=1 λt − T t=1 gt (λt ) . (4) Note that when T = 1 and c = 1, the above duality is the so called Fenchel duality. 4 A Template Learning Algorithm for Convex Repeated Games In this section we describe a template learning algorithm for playing convex repeated games. As mentioned before, we study convex repeated games from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player which we shortly denote as P1. Recall that we would like our learning algorithm to achieve a regret bound of the form given in Eq. (2). We start by rewriting Eq. (2) as follows T m gt (wt ) − c L ≤ inf u∈S t=1 c f (u) + gt (u) , (5) t=1 √ where c = T . Thus, up to the sublinear term c L, the cumulative loss of P1 lower bounds the optimum of the minimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (5). In the previous section we derived the generalized Fenchel dual of the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Our construction is based on the weak duality theorem stating that any value of the dual problem is smaller than the optimum value of the primal problem. The algorithmic framework we propose is therefore derived by incrementally ascending the dual objective function. Intuitively, by ascending the dual objective we move closer to the optimal primal value and therefore our performance becomes similar to the performance of the best ﬁxed weight vector which minimizes the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Initially, we use the elementary dual solution λ1 = 0 for all t. We assume that inf w f (w) = 0 and t for all t inf w gt (w) = 0 which imply that D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 0. We assume in addition that f is 1 T σ-strongly convex. Therefore, based on Lemma 2, the function f is differentiable. At trial t, P1 uses for prediction the vector wt = f −1 c T i=1 λt i . (6) After predicting wt , P1 receives the function gt and suffers the loss gt (wt ). Then, P1 updates the dual variables as follows. Denote by ∂t the differential set of gt at wt , that is, ∂t = {λ : ∀w ∈ S, gt (w) − gt (wt ) ≥ λ, w − wt } . (7) The new dual variables (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) are set to be any set of vectors which satisfy the following 1 T two conditions: (i). ∃λ ∈ ∂t s.t. D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λ , λt , . . . , λt ) 1 1 t−1 t+1 T T (ii). ∀i > t, λt+1 = 0 i . (8) In the next section we show that condition (i) ensures that the increase of the dual at trial t is proportional to the loss gt (wt ). The second condition ensures that we can actually calculate the dual at trial t without any knowledge on the yet to be seen loss functions gt+1 , . . . , gT . We conclude this section with two update rules that trivially satisfy the above two conditions. The ﬁrst update scheme simply ﬁnds λ ∈ ∂t and set λt+1 = i λ λt i if i = t if i = t . (9) The second update deﬁnes (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) = argmax D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) 1 T λ1 ,...,λT s.t. ∀i = t, λi = λt . i (10) 5 Analysis In this section we analyze the performance of the template algorithm given in the previous section. Our proof technique is based on monitoring the value of the dual objective function. The main result is the following lemma which gives upper and lower bounds for the ﬁnal value of the dual objective function. Lemma 3 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function with respect to a norm · over a set S and assume that minw∈S f (w) = 0. Let g1 , . . . , gT be a sequence of convex and closed functions such that inf w gt (w) = 0 for all t ∈ [T ]. Suppose that a dual-incrementing algorithm which satisﬁes the conditions of Eq. (8) is run with f as a complexity function on the sequence g1 , . . . , gT . Let w1 , . . . , wT be the sequence of primal vectors that the algorithm generates and λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 1 T be its ﬁnal sequence of dual variables. Then, there exists a sequence of sub-gradients λ1 , . . . , λT , where λt ∈ ∂t for all t, such that T 1 gt (wt ) − 2σc t=1 T T λt 2 ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) 1 T t=1 ≤ inf c f (w) + w∈S gt (w) . t=1 Proof The second inequality follows directly from the weak duality theorem. Turning to the left most inequality, denote ∆t = D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) − D(λt , . . . , λt ) and note that 1 1 T T T D(λ1 +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) can be rewritten as T T t=1 D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) = 1 T T t=1 ∆t − D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 1 T ∆t , (11) where the last equality follows from the fact that f (0) = g1 (0) = . . . = gT (0) = 0. The deﬁnition of the update implies that ∆t ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λt , 0, . . . , 0) − D(λt , . . . , λt , 0, 0, . . . , 0) for 1 t−1 1 t−1 t−1 some subgradient λt ∈ ∂t . Denoting θ t = − 1 j=1 λj , we now rewrite the lower bound on ∆t as, c ∆t ≥ −c (f (θ t − λt /c) − f (θ t )) − gt (λt ) . Using Lemma 2 and the deﬁnition of wt we get that 1 (12) ∆t ≥ wt , λt − gt (λt ) − 2 σ c λt 2 . Since λt ∈ ∂t and since we assume that gt is closed and convex, we can apply Lemma 1 to get that wt , λt − gt (λt ) = gt (wt ). Plugging this equality into Eq. (12) and summing over t we obtain that T T T 1 2 . t=1 ∆t ≥ t=1 gt (wt ) − 2 σ c t=1 λt Combining the above inequality with Eq. (11) concludes our proof. The following regret bound follows as a direct corollary of Lemma 3. T 1 Theorem 1 Under the same conditions of Lemma 3. Denote L = T t=1 λt w ∈ S we have, T T c f (w) 1 1 + 2L c . t=1 gt (wt ) − T t=1 gt (w) ≤ T T σ √ In particular, if c = T , we obtain the bound, 1 T 6 T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (w) ≤ f (w)+L/(2 σ) √ T 2 . Then, for all . Application to Online learning In Sec. 1 we cast the task of online learning as a convex repeated game. We now demonstrate the applicability of our algorithmic framework for the problem of instance ranking. We analyze this setting since several prediction problems, including binary classiﬁcation, multiclass prediction, multilabel prediction, and label ranking, can be cast as special cases of the instance ranking problem. Recall that on each online round, the learner receives a question-answer pair. In instance ranking, the question is encoded by a matrix Xt of dimension kt × n and the answer is a vector yt ∈ Rkt . The semantic of yt is as follows. For any pair (i, j), if yt,i > yt,j then we say that yt ranks the i’th row of Xt ahead of the j’th row of Xt . We also interpret yt,i − yt,j as the conﬁdence in which the i’th row should be ranked ahead of the j’th row. For example, each row of Xt encompasses a representation of a movie while yt,i is the movie’s rating, expressed as the number of stars this movie has received by a movie reviewer. The predictions of the learner are determined ˆ based on a weight vector wt ∈ Rn and are deﬁned to be yt = Xt wt . Finally, let us deﬁne two loss functions for ranking, both generalize the hinge-loss used in binary classiﬁcation problems. Denote by Et the set {(i, j) : yt,i > yt,j }. For all (i, j) ∈ Et we deﬁne a pair-based hinge-loss i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) = [(yt,i − yt,j ) − w, xt,i − xt,j ]+ , where [a]+ = max{a, 0} and xt,i , xt,j are respectively the i’th and j’th rows of Xt . Note that i,j is zero if w ranks xt,i higher than xt,j with a sufﬁcient conﬁdence. Ideally, we would like i,j (wt ; (Xt , yt )) to be zero for all (i, j) ∈ Et . If this is not the case, we are being penalized according to some combination of the pair-based losses i,j . For example, we can set (w; (Xt , yt )) to be the average over the pair losses, 1 avg (w; (Xt , yt )) = |Et | (i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . This loss was suggested by several authors (see for example [18]). Another popular approach (see for example [5]) penalizes according to the maximal loss over the individual pairs, max (w; (Xt , yt )) = max(i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . We can apply our algorithmic framework given in Sec. 4 for ranking, using for gt (w) either avg (w; (Xt , yt )) or max (w; (Xt , yt )). The following theorem provides us with a sufﬁcient condition under which the regret bound from Thm. 1 holds for ranking as well. Theorem 2 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function over S with respect to a norm · . Denote by Lt the maximum over (i, j) ∈ Et of xt,i − xt,j 2 . Then, for both gt (w) = avg (w; (Xt , yt )) and ∗ gt (w) = max (w; (Xt , yt )), the following regret bound holds ∀u ∈ S, 7 1 T T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (u) ≤ 1 f (u)+ T PT t=1 Lt /(2 σ) √ T . The Boosting Game In this section we describe the applicability of our algorithmic framework to the analysis of boosting algorithms. A boosting algorithm uses a weak learning algorithm that generates weak-hypotheses whose performances are just slightly better than random guessing to build a strong-hypothesis which can attain an arbitrarily low error. The AdaBoost algorithm, proposed by Freund and Schapire [6], receives as input a training set of examples {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} where for all i ∈ [m], xi is taken from an instance domain X , and yi is a binary label, yi ∈ {+1, −1}. The boosting process proceeds in a sequence of consecutive trials. At trial t, the booster ﬁrst deﬁnes a distribution, denoted wt , over the set of examples. Then, the booster passes the training set along with the distribution wt to the weak learner. The weak learner is assumed to return a hypothesis ht : X → {+1, −1} whose average error is slightly smaller than 1 . That is, there exists a constant γ > 0 such that, 2 def m 1−yi ht (xi ) = ≤ 1 −γ . (13) i=1 wt,i 2 2 The goal of the boosting algorithm is to invoke the weak learner several times with different distributions, and to combine the hypotheses returned by the weak learner into a ﬁnal, so called strong, hypothesis whose error is small. The ﬁnal hypothesis combines linearly the T hypotheses returned by the weak learner with coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT , and is deﬁned to be the sign of hf (x) where T hf (x) = t=1 αt ht (x) . The coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT are determined by the booster. In Ad1 1 aBoost, the initial distribution is set to be the uniform distribution, w1 = ( m , . . . , m ). At iter1 ation t, the value of αt is set to be 2 log((1 − t )/ t ). The distribution is updated by the rule wt+1,i = wt,i exp(−αt yi ht (xi ))/Zt , where Zt is a normalization factor. Freund and Schapire [6] have shown that under the assumption given in Eq. (13), the error of the ﬁnal strong hypothesis is at most exp(−2 γ 2 T ). t Several authors [15, 13, 8, 4] have proposed to view boosting as a coordinate-wise greedy optimization process. To do so, note ﬁrst that hf errs on an example (x, y) iff y hf (x) ≤ 0. Therefore, the exp-loss function, deﬁned as exp(−y hf (x)), is a smooth upper bound of the zero-one error, which equals to 1 if y hf (x) ≤ 0 and to 0 otherwise. Thus, we can restate the goal of boosting as minimizing the average exp-loss of hf over the training set with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . To simplify our derivation in the sequel, we prefer to say that boosting maximizes the negation of the loss, that is, T m 1 (14) max − m i=1 exp −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) . α1 ,...,αT In this view, boosting is an optimization procedure which iteratively maximizes Eq. (14) with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . This view of boosting, enables the hypotheses returned by the weak learner to be general functions into the reals, ht : X → R (see for instance [15]). In this paper we view boosting as a convex repeated game between a booster and a weak learner. To motivate our construction, we would like to note that boosting algorithms deﬁne weights in two different domains: the vectors wt ∈ Rm which assign weights to examples and the weights {αt : t ∈ [T ]} over weak-hypotheses. In the terminology used throughout this paper, the weights wt ∈ Rm are primal vectors while (as we show in the sequel) each weight αt of the hypothesis ht is related to a dual vector λt . In particular, we show that Eq. (14) is exactly the Fenchel dual of a primal problem for a convex repeated game, thus the algorithmic framework described thus far for playing games naturally ﬁts the problem of iteratively solving Eq. (14). To derive the primal problem whose Fenchel dual is the problem given in Eq. (14) let us ﬁrst denote by vt the vector in Rm whose ith element is vt,i = yi ht (xi ). For all t, we set gt to be the function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Intuitively, gt penalizes vectors w which assign large weights to examples which are predicted accurately, that is yi ht (xi ) > 0. In particular, if ht (xi ) ∈ {+1, −1} and wt is a distribution over the m examples (as is the case in AdaBoost), gt (wt ) reduces to 1 − 2 t (see Eq. (13)). In this case, minimizing gt is equivalent to maximizing the error of the individual T hypothesis ht over the examples. Consider the problem of minimizing c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) where f (w) is the relative entropy given in Example 2 and c = 1/(2 γ) (see Eq. (13)). To derive its Fenchel dual, we note that gt (λt ) = 0 if there exists βt ∈ [0, 1] such that λt = βt vt and otherwise gt (λt ) = ∞ (see [16]). In addition, let us deﬁne αt = 2 γ βt . Since our goal is to maximize the αt dual, we can restrict λt to take the form λt = βt vt = 2 γ vt , and get that D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = −c f − 1 c T βt vt t=1 =− 1 log 2γ 1 m m e− PT t=1 αt yi ht (xi ) . (15) i=1 Minimizing the exp-loss of the strong hypothesis is therefore the dual problem of the following primal minimization problem: ﬁnd a distribution over the examples, whose relative entropy to the uniform distribution is as small as possible while the correlation of the distribution with each vt is as small as possible. Since the correlation of w with vt is inversely proportional to the error of ht with respect to w, we obtain that in the primal problem we are trying to maximize the error of each individual hypothesis, while in the dual problem we minimize the global error of the strong hypothesis. The intuition of ﬁnding distributions which in retrospect result in large error rates of individual hypotheses was also alluded in [15, 8]. We can now apply our algorithmic framework from Sec. 4 to boosting. We describe the game αt with the parameters αt , where αt ∈ [0, 2 γ], and underscore that in our case, λt = 2 γ vt . At the beginning of the game the booster sets all dual variables to be zero, ∀t αt = 0. At trial t of the boosting game, the booster ﬁrst constructs a primal weight vector wt ∈ Rm , which assigns importance weights to the examples in the training set. The primal vector wt is constructed as in Eq. (6), that is, wt = f (θ t ), where θ t = − i αi vi . Then, the weak learner responds by presenting the loss function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Finally, the booster updates the dual variables so as to increase the dual objective function. It is possible to show that if the range of ht is {+1, −1} 1 then the update given in Eq. (10) is equivalent to the update αt = min{2 γ, 2 log((1 − t )/ t )}. We have thus obtained a variant of AdaBoost in which the weights αt are capped above by 2 γ. A disadvantage of this variant is that we need to know the parameter γ. We would like to note in passing that this limitation can be lifted by a different deﬁnition of the functions gt . We omit the details due to the lack of space. To analyze our game of boosting, we note that the conditions given in Lemma 3 holds T and therefore the left-hand side inequality given in Lemma 3 tells us that t=1 gt (wt ) − T T +1 T +1 1 2 , . . . , λT ) . The deﬁnition of gt and the weak learnability ast=1 λt ∞ ≤ D(λ1 2c sumption given in Eq. (13) imply that wt , vt ≥ 2 γ for all t. Thus, gt (wt ) = wt , vt ≥ 2 γ which also implies that λt = vt . Recall that vt,i = yi ht (xi ). Assuming that the range of ht is [+1, −1] we get that λt ∞ ≤ 1. Combining all the above with the left-hand side inequality T given in Lemma 3 we get that 2 T γ − 2 c ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ). Using the deﬁnition of D (see 1 T Eq. (15)), the value c = 1/(2 γ), and rearranging terms we recover the original bound for AdaBoost PT 2 m 1 −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) ≤ e−2 γ T . i=1 e m 8 Related Work and Discussion We presented a new framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for playing convex repeated games. Our framework was used for the analysis of known algorithms for both online learning and boosting settings. The framework also paves the way to new algorithms. In a previous paper [17], we suggested the use of duality for the design of online algorithms in the context of mistake bound analysis. The contribution of this paper over [17] is three fold as we now brieﬂy discuss. First, we generalize the applicability of the framework beyond the speciﬁc setting of online learning with the hinge-loss to the general setting of convex repeated games. The setting of convex repeated games was formally termed “online convex programming” by Zinkevich [19] and was ﬁrst presented by Gordon in [9]. There is voluminous amount of work on unifying approaches for deriving online learning algorithms. We refer the reader to [11, 12, 3] for work closely related to the content of this paper. By generalizing our previously studied algorithmic framework [17] beyond online learning, we can automatically utilize well known online learning algorithms, such as the EG and p-norm algorithms [12, 11], to the setting of online convex programming. We would like to note that the algorithms presented in [19] can be derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework 1 by setting f (w) = 2 w 2 . Parallel and independently to this work, Gordon [10] described another algorithmic framework for online convex programming that is closely related to the potential based algorithms described by Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi [3]. Gordon also considered the problem of deﬁning appropriate potential functions. Our work generalizes some of the theorems in [10] while providing a somewhat simpler analysis. Second, the usage of generalized Fenchel duality rather than the Lagrange duality given in [17] enables us to analyze boosting algorithms based on the framework. Many authors derived unifying frameworks for boosting algorithms [13, 8, 4]. Nonetheless, our general framework and the connection between game playing and Fenchel duality underscores an interesting perspective of both online learning and boosting. We believe that this viewpoint has the potential of yielding new algorithms in both domains. Last, despite the generality of the framework introduced in this paper, the resulting analysis is more distilled than the earlier analysis given in [17] for two reasons. (i) The usage of Lagrange duality in [17] is somehow restricted while the notion of generalized Fenchel duality is more appropriate to the general and broader problems we consider in this paper. (ii) The strongly convex property we employ both simpliﬁes the analysis and enables more intuitive conditions in our theorems. There are various possible extensions of the work that we did not pursue here due to the lack of space. For instanc, our framework can naturally be used for the analysis of other settings such as repeated games (see [7, 19]). The applicability of our framework to online learning can also be extended to other prediction problems such as regression and sequence prediction. Last, we conjecture that our primal-dual view of boosting will lead to new methods for regularizing boosting algorithms, thus improving their generalization capabilities.

<p>Author: Lin Wu, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for AI and machine learning. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 × 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 × 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are brieﬂy discussed. 1</p><p>2 0.92217541 <a title="13-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-TrueSkill%E2%84%A2%3A_A_Bayesian_Skill_Rating_System.html">196 nips-2006-TrueSkill™: A Bayesian Skill Rating System</a></p>

<p>Author: Eli Ben-sasson, Ehud Kalai, Adam Kalai</p><p>Abstract: A central question in game theory and artiﬁcial intelligence is how a rational agent should behave in a complex environment, given that it cannot perform unbounded computations. We study strategic aspects of this question by formulating a simple model of a game with additional costs (computational or otherwise) for each strategy. First we connect this to zero-sum games, proving a counter-intuitive generalization of the classic min-max theorem to zero-sum games with the addition of strategy costs. We then show that potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. Both zero-sum and potential games with strategy costs maintain a very appealing property: simple learning dynamics converge to equilibrium. 1 The Approach and Basic Model How should an intelligent agent play a complicated game like chess, given that it does not have unlimited time to think? This question reﬂects one fundamental aspect of “bounded rationality,” a term coined by Herbert Simon [1]. However, bounded rationality has proven to be a slippery concept to formalize (prior work has focused largely on ﬁnite automata playing simple repeated games such as prisoner’s dilemma, e.g. [2, 3, 4, 5]). This paper focuses on the strategic aspects of decisionmaking in complex multi-agent environments, i.e., on how a player should choose among strategies of varying complexity, given that its opponents are making similar decisions. Our model applies to general strategic games and allows for a variety of complexities that arise in real-world applications. For this reason, it is applicable to one-shot games, to extensive games, and to repeated games, and it generalizes existing models such as repeated games played by ﬁnite automata. To easily see that bounded rationality can drastically affect the outcome of a game, consider the following factoring game. Player 1 chooses an n-bit number and sends it to Player 2, who attempts to ﬁnd its prime factorization. If Player 2 is correct, he is paid 1 by Player 1, otherwise he pays 1 to Player 1. Ignoring complexity costs, the game is a trivial win for Player 2. However, for large n, the game should is essentially a win for Player 1, who can easily output a large random number that Player 2 cannot factor (under appropriate complexity assumptions). In general, the outcome of a game (even a zero-sum game like chess) with bounded rationality is not so clear. To concretely model such games, we consider a set of available strategies along with strategy costs. Consider an example of two players preparing to play a computerized chess game for $100K prize. Suppose the players simultaneously choose among two available options: to use a $10K program A or an advanced program B, which costs $50K. We refer to the row chooser as white and to the column chooser as black, with the corresponding advantages reﬂected by the win probabilities of white described in Table 1a. For example, when both players use program A, white wins 55% of the time and black wins 45% of the time (we ignore draws). The players naturally want to choose strategies to maximize their expected net payoffs, i.e., their expected payoff minus their cost. Each cell in Table 1b contains a pair of payoffs in units of thousands of dollars; the ﬁrst is white’s net expected payoff and the second is black’s. a) A B A 55% 93% B 13% 51% b) A (-10) B (-50) A (-10) 45, 35 43,-3 B (-50) 3, 37 1,-1 Figure 1: a) Table of ﬁrst-player winning probabilities based on program choices. b) Table of expected net earnings in thousands of dollars. The unique equilibrium is (A,B) which strongly favors the second player. A surprising property is evident in the above game. Everything about the game seems to favor white. Yet due to the (symmetric) costs, at the unique Nash equilibrium (A,B) of Table 1b, black wins 87% of the time and nets $34K more than white. In fact, it is a dominant strategy for white to play A and for black to play B. To see this, note that playing B increases white’s probability of winning by 38%, independent of what black chooses. Since the pot is $100K, this is worth $38K in expectation, but B costs $40K more than A. On the other hand, black enjoys a 42% increase in probability of winning due to B, independent of what white does, and hence is willing to pay the extra $40K. Before formulating the general model, we comment on some important aspects of the chess example. First, traditional game theory states that chess can be solved in “only” two rounds of elimination of dominated strategies [10], and the outcome with optimal play should always be the same: either a win for white or a win for black. This theoretical prediction fails in practice: in top play, the outcome is very nondeterministic with white winning roughly twice as often as black. The game is too large and complex to be solved by brute force. Second, we have been able to analyze the above chess program selection example exactly because we formulated as a game with a small number of available strategies per player. Another formulation that would ﬁt into our model would be to include all strategies of chess, with some reasonable computational costs. However, it is beyond our means to analyze such a large game. Third, in the example above we used monetary software cost to illustrate a type of strategy cost. But the same analysis could accommodate many other types of costs that can be measured numerically and subtracted from the payoffs, such as time or effort involved in the development or execution of a strategy, and other resource costs. Additional examples in this paper include the number of states in a ﬁnite automaton, the number of gates in a circuit, and the number of turns on a commuter’s route. Our analysis is limited, however, to cost functions that depend only on the strategy of the player and not the strategy chosen by its opponent. For example, if our players above were renting computers A or B and paying for the time of actual usage, then the cost of using A would depend on the choice of computer made by the opponent. Generalizing the example above, we consider a normal form game with the addition of strategy costs, a player-dependent cost for playing each available strategy. Our main results regard two important classes of games: constant-sum and potential games. Potential games with strategy costs remain potential games. While two-person constant-sum games are no longer constant, we give a basic structural description of optimal play in these games. Lastly, we show that known learning dynamics converge in both classes of games. 2 Deﬁnition of strategy costs We ﬁrst deﬁne an N -person normal-form game G = (N, S, p) consisting of ﬁnite sets of (available) pure strategies S = (S1 , . . . , SN ) for the N players, and a payoff function p : S1 × . . . × SN → RN . Players simultaneously choose strategies si ∈ Si after which player i is rewarded with pi (s1 , . . . , sN ). A randomized or mixed strategy σi for player i is a probability distribution over its pure strategies Si , σi ∈ ∆i = x ∈ R|Si | : xj = 1, xj ≥ 0 . We extend p to ∆1 × . . . × ∆N in the natural way, i.e., pi (σ1 , . . . , σN ) = E[pi (s1 , . . . , sN )] where each si is drawn from σi , independently. Denote by s−i = (s1 , s2 , . . . , si−1 , si+1 , . . . , sN ) and similarly for σ−i . A best response by player i to σ−i is σi ∈ ∆i such that pi (σi , σ−i ) = maxσi ∈∆i pi (σi , σ−i ). A (mixed strategy) Nash equilibrium of G is a vector of strategies (σ1 , . . . , σN ) ∈ ∆1 × . . . × ∆N such that each σi is a best response to σ−i . We now deﬁne G−c , the game G with strategy costs c = (c1 , . . . , cN ), where ci : Si → R. It is simply an N -person normal-form game G−c = (N, S, p−c ) with the same sets of pure strategies as G, but with a new payoff function p−c : S1 × . . . × SN → RN where, p−c (s1 , . . . , sN ) = pi (s1 , . . . , sN ) − ci (si ), for i = 1, . . . , N. i We similarly extend ci to ∆i in the natural way. 3 Two-person constant-sum games with strategy costs Recall that a game is constant-sum (k-sum for short) if at every combination of individual strategies, the players’ payoffs sum to some constant k. Two-person k-sum games have some important properties, not shared by general sum games, which result in more effective game-theoretic analysis. In particular, every k-sum game has a unique value v ∈ R. A mixed strategy for player 1 is called optimal if it guarantees payoff ≥ v against any strategy of player 2. A mixed strategy for player 2 is optimal if it guarantees ≥ k − v against any strategy of player 1. The term optimal is used because optimal strategies guarantee as much as possible (v + k − v = k) and playing anything that is not optimal can result in a lesser payoff, if the opponent responds appropriately. (This fact is easily illustrated in the game rock-paper-scissors – randomizing uniformly among the strategies guarantees each player 50% of the pot, while playing anything other than uniformly random enables the opponent to win strictly more often.) The existence of optimal strategies for both players follows from the min-max theorem. An easy corollary is that the Nash equilibria of a k-sum game are exchangeable: they are simply the cross-product of the sets of optimal mixed strategies for both players. Lastly, it is well-known that equilibria in two-person k-sum games can be learned in repeated play by simple dynamics that are guaranteed to converge [17]. With the addition of strategy costs, a k-sum game is no longer k-sum and hence it is not clear, at ﬁrst, what optimal strategies there are, if any. (Many examples of general-sum games do not have optimal strategies.) We show the following generalization of the above properties for zero-sum games with strategies costs. Theorem 1. Let G be a ﬁnite two-person k-sum game and G−c be the game with strategy costs c = (c1 , c2 ). 1. There is a value v ∈ R for G−c and nonempty sets OPT1 and OPT2 of optimal mixed strategies for the two players. OPT1 is the set of strategies that guarantee player 1 payoff ≥ v − c2 (σ2 ), against any strategy σ2 chosen by player 2. Similarly, OPT2 is the set of strategies that guarantee player 2 payoff ≥ k − v − c1 (σ1 ) against any σ1 . 2. The Nash equilibria of G−c are exchangeable: the set of Nash equilibria is OPT1 ×OPT2 . 3. The set of net payoffs possible at equilibrium is an axis-parallel rectangle in R2 . For zero-sum games, the term optimal strategy was natural: the players could guarantee v and k − v, respectively, and this is all that there was to share. Moreover, it is easy to see that only pairs of optimal strategies can have the Nash equilibria property, being best responses to each other. In the case of zero-sum games with strategy costs, the optimal structure is somewhat counterintuitive. First, it is strange that the amount guaranteed by either player depends on the cost of the other player’s action, when in reality each player pays the cost of its own action. Second, it is not even clear why we call these optimal strategies. To get a feel for this latter issue, notice that the sum of the net payoffs to the two players is always k − c1 (σ1 ) − c2 (σ2 ), which is exactly the total of what optimal strategies guarantee, v − c2 (σ2 ) + k − v − c1 (σ1 ). Hence, if both players play what we call optimal strategies, then neither player can improve and they are at Nash equilibrium. On the other hand, suppose player 1 selects a strategy σ1 that does not guarantee him payoff at least v − c2 (σ2 ). This means that there is some response σ2 by player 2 for which player 1’s payoff is < v − c2 (σ2 ) and hence player 2’s payoff is > k − v − c1 (σ1 ). Thus player 2’s best response to σ1 must give player 2 payoff > k − v − c1 (σ1 ) and leave player 1 with < v − c2 (σ2 ). The proof of the theorem (the above reasoning only implies part 2 from part 1) is based on the following simple observation. Consider the k-sum game H = (N, S, q) with the following payoffs: q1 (s1 , s2 ) = p1 (s1 , s2 ) − c1 (s1 ) + c2 (s2 ) = p−c (s1 , s2 ) + c2 (s2 ) 1 q2 (s1 , s2 ) = p2 (s1 , s2 ) − c2 (s1 ) + c1 (s1 ) = p−c (s1 , s2 ) + c1 (s1 ) 2 That is to say, Player 1 pays its strategy cost to Player 2 and vice versa. It is easy to verify that, ∀σ1 , σ1 ∈ ∆1 , σ2 ∈ ∆2 q1 (σ1 , σ2 ) − q1 (σ1 , σ2 ) = p−c (σ1 , σ2 ) − p−c (σ1 , σ2 ) 1 1 (1) This means that the relative advantage in switching strategies in games G−c and H are the same. In particular, σ1 is a best response to σ2 in G−c if and only if it is in H. A similar equality holds for player 2’s payoffs. Note that these conditions imply that the games G−c and H are strategically equivalent in the sense deﬁned by Moulin and Vial [16]. Proof of Theorem 1. Let v be the value of the game H. For any strategy σ1 that guarantees player 1 payoff ≥ v in H, σ1 guarantees player 1 ≥ v − c2 (σ2 ) in G−c . This follows from the deﬁnition of H. Similarly, any strategy σ2 that guarantees player 2 payoff ≥ k − v in H will guarantee ≥ k − v − c1 (σ1 ) in G−c . Thus the sets OPT1 and OPT2 are non-empty. Since v − c2 (σ2 ) + k − v − c1 (σ1 ) = k − c1 (σ1 ) − c2 (σ2 ) is the sum of the payoffs in G−c , nothing greater can be guaranteed by either player. Since the best responses of G−c and H are the same, the Nash equilibria of the two games are the same. Since H is a k-sum game, its Nash equilibria are exchangeable, and thus we have part 2. (This holds for any game that is strategically equivalent to k-sum.) Finally, the optimal mixed strategies OPT1 , OPT2 of any k-sum game are convex sets. If we look at the achievable costs of the mixed strategies in OPTi , by the deﬁnition of the cost of a mixed strategy, this will be a convex subset of R, i.e., an interval. By parts 1 and 2, the set of achievable net payoffs at equilibria of G−c are therefore the cross-product of intervals. To illustrate Theorem 1 graphically, Figure 2 gives a 4 × 4 example with costs of 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively. It illustrates a situation with multiple optimal strategies. Notice that player 1 is completely indifferent between its optimal choices A and B, and player 2 is completely indifferent between C and D. Thus the only question is how kind they would like to be to their opponent. The (A,C) equilibrium is perhaps most natural as it is yields the highest payoffs for both parties. Note that the proof of the above theorem actually shows that zero-sum games with costs share additional appealing properties of zero-sum games. For example, computing optimal strategies is a polynomial time-computation in an n × n game, as it amounts to computing the equilibria of H. We next show that they also have appealing learning properties, though they do not share all properties of zero-sum games.1 3.1 Learning in repeated two-person k-sum games with strategy costs Another desirable property of k-sum games is that, in repeated play, natural learning dynamics converge to the set of Nash equilibria. Before we state the analogous conditions for k-sum games with costs, we brieﬂy give a few deﬁnitions. A repeated game is one in which players chooses a sequence of strategies vectors s1 , s2 , . . ., where each st = (st , . . . , st ) is a strategy vector of some 1 N ﬁxed stage game G = (N, S, p). Under perfect monitoring, when selecting an action in any period the players know all the previous selected actions.As we shall discuss, it is possible to learn to play without perfect monitoring as well. 1 One property that is violated by the chess example is the “advantage of an advantage” property. Say Player 1 has the advantage over Player 2 in a square game if p1 (s1 , s2 ) ≥ p2 (s2 , s1 ) for all strategies s1 , s2 . At equilibrium of a k-sum game, a player with the advantage must have a payoff at least as large as its opponent. This is no longer the case after incorporating strategy costs, as seen in the chess example, where Player 1 has the advantage (even including strategy costs), yet his equilibrium payoff is smaller than 2’s. a) A B C D A 6, 4 7, 3 7.5, 2.5 8.5, 1.5 B 5, 5 6, 4 6.5, 3.5 7, 3 C 3, 7 4, 6 4.5, 5.5 5.5, 4.5 D 2, 8 3, 7 3.5, 6.5 4.5, 5.5 b) A (-1) B (-2) C (-3) D (-4) A (-1) 5, 3 5, 2 4.5, 1.5 4.5, 0.5 B (-2) 4, 3 4, 2 3.5, 1.5 3, 1 C (-3) 2, 4 2, 3 1.5, 2.5 1.5, 1.5 D (-4) 1, 4 1, 3 0.5, 2.5 0.5, 1.5 PLAYER 2 NET PAYOFF Nash Eq.

The shaded region shows the rectangular set of payoffs achievable at mixed strategy Nash equilibria. Perhaps the most intuitive dynamics are best-response: at each stage, each player selects a best response to the opponent’s previous stage play. Unfortunately, these naive dynamics fails to converge to equilibrium in very simple examples. The ﬁctitious play dynamics prescribe, at stage t, selecting any strategy that is a best response to the empirical distribution of opponent’s play during the ﬁrst t − 1 stages. It has been shown that ﬁctitious play converges to equilibrium (of the stage game G) in k-sum games [17]. However, ﬁctitious play requires perfect monitoring. One can learn to play a two-person k-sum game with no knowledge of the payoff table or anything about the other players actions. Using experimentation, the only observations required by each player are its own payoffs in each period (in addition to the number of available actions). So-called bandit algorithms [7] must manage the exploration-exploitation tradeoff. The proof of their convergence follows from the fact that they are no-regret algorithms. (No-regret algorithms date back to Hannan in the 1950’s [12], but his required perfect monitoring). The regret of a player i at stage T is deﬁned to be, T regret of i at T = 1 max pi (si , st ) − pi (st , st ) , −i i −i T si ∈Si t=1 that is, how much better in hindsight player i could have done on the ﬁrst T stages had it used one ﬁxed strategy the whole time (and had the opponents not changed their strategies). Note that regret can be positive or negative. A no-regret algorithm is one in which each player’s asymptotic regret converges to (−∞, 0], i.e., is guaranteed to approach 0 or less. It is well-known that noregret condition in two-person k-sum games implies convergence to equilibrium (see, e.g., [13]). In particular, the pair of mixed strategies which are the empirical distributions of play over time approaches the set of Nash equilibrium of the stage game. Inverse-polynomial rates of convergence (that are polynomial also in the size of the game) can be given for such algorithms. Hence no-regret algorithms provide arguably reasonable ways to play a k-sum game of moderate size. Note that in general-sum games, no such dynamics are known. Fortunately, the same algorithm that works for learning in k-sum games seem to work for learning in such games with strategy costs. Theorem 2. Fictitious play converges to the set of Nash equilibria of the stage game in a two-person k-sum game with strategy costs, as do no-regret learning dynamics. Proof. The proof again follows from equation (1) regarding the game H. Fictitious play dynamics are deﬁned only in terms of best response play. Since G−c and H share the same best responses, ﬁctitious play dynamics are identical for the two games. Since they share the same equilibria and ﬁctitious play converges to equilibria in H, it must converge in G−c as well. For no-regret algorithms, equation (1) again implies that for any play sequence, the regret of each player i with respect to game G−c is the same as its regret with respect to the game H. Hence, no regret in G−c implies no regret in H. Since no-regret algorithms converge to the set of equilibria in k-sum games, they converge to the set of equilibria in H and therefore in G−c as well. 4 Potential games with strategic costs Let us begin with an example of a potential game, called a routing game [18]. There is a ﬁxed directed graph with n nodes and m edges. Commuters i = 1, 2, . . . , N each decide on a route πi , to take from their home si to their work ti , where si and ti are nodes in the graph. For each edge, uv, let nuv be the number of commuters whose path πi contains edge uv. Let fuv : Z → R be a nonnegative monotonically increasing congestion function. Player i’s payoff is − uv∈πi fuv (nuv ), i.e., the negative sum of the congestions on the edges in its path. An N -person normal form game G is said to be a potential game [15] if there is some potential function Φ : S1 × . . . SN → R such that changing a single player’s action changes its payoff by the change in the potential function. That is, there exists a single function Φ, such that for all players i and all pure strategy vectors s, s ∈ S1 × . . . × SN that differ only in the ith coordinate, pi (s) − pi (s ) = Φ(s) − Φ(s ). (2) Potential games have appealing learning properties: simple better-reply dynamics converge to purestrategy Nash equilibria, as do the more sophisticated ﬁctitious-play dynamics described earlier [15]. In our example, this means that if players change their individual paths so as to selﬁshly reduce the sum of congestions on their path, this will eventually lead to an equilibrium where no one can improve. (This is easy to see because Φ keeps increasing.) The absence of similar learning properties for general games presents a frustrating hole in learning and game theory. It is clear that the theoretically clean commuting example above misses some realistic considerations. One issue regarding complexity is that most commuters would not be willing to take a very complicated route just to save a short amount of time. To model this, we consider potential games with strategy costs. In our example, this would be a cost associated with every path. For example, suppose the graph represented streets in a given city. We consider a natural strategy complexity cost associated with a route π, say λ(#turns(π))2 , where there is a parameter λ ∈ R and #turns(π) is deﬁned as the number of times that a commuter has to turn on a route. (To be more precise, say each edge in the graph is annotated with a street name, and a turn is deﬁned to be a pair of consecutive edges in the graph with different street names.) Hence, a best response for player i would minimize: π min (total congestion of π) + λ(#turns(π))2 . from si to ti While adding strategy costs to potential games allows for much more ﬂexibility in model design, one might worry that appealing properties of potential games, such as having pure strategy equilibria and easy learning dynamics, no longer hold. This is not the case. We show that strategic costs ﬁt easily into the potential game framework: Theorem 3. For any potential game G and any cost functions c, G−c is also a potential game. Proof. Let Φ be a potential function for G. It is straightforward to verify that the G−c admits the following potential function Φ : Φ (s1 , . . . , sN ) = Φ(s1 , . . . , sN ) − c1 (s1 ) − . . . − cN (sN ). 5 Additional remarks Part of the reason that the notion of bounded rationality is so difﬁcult to formalize is that understanding enormous games like chess is a daunting proposition. That is why we have narrowed it down to choosing among a small number of available programs. A game theorist might begin by examining the complete payoff table of Figure 1a, which is prohibitively large. Instead of considering only the choices of programs A and B, each player considers all possible chess strategies. In that sense, our payoff table in 1a would be viewed as a reduction of the “real” normal form game. A computer scientist, on the other hand, may consider it reasonable to begin with the existing strategies that one has access to. Regardless of how you view the process, it is clear that for practical purposes players in real life do simplify and analyze “smaller” sets of strategies. Even if the players consider the option of engineering new chess-playing software, this can be viewed as a third strategy in the game, with its own cost and expected payoffs. Again, when considering small number of available strategies, like the two programs above, it may still be difﬁcult to assess the expected payoffs that result when (possibly randomized) strategies play against each other. An additional assumption made throughout the paper is that the players share the same assessments about these expected payoffs. Like other common-knowledge assumptions made in game theory, it would be desirable to weaken this assumption. In the special families of games studied in this paper, and perhaps in additional cases, learning algorithms may be employed to reach equilibrium without knowledge of payoffs. 5.1 Finite automata playing repeated games There has been a large body of interesting work on repeated games played by ﬁnite automata (see [14] for a survey). Much of this work is on achieving cooperation in the classic prisoner’s dilemma game (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5]). Many of these models can be incorporated into the general model outlined in this paper. For example, to view the Abreu and Rubinstein model [6] as such, consider the normal form of an inﬁnitely repeated game with discounting, but restricted to strategies that can be described by ﬁnite automata (the payoffs in every cell of the payoff table are the discounted sums of the inﬁnite streams of payoffs obtained in the repeated game). Let the cost of a strategy be an increasing function of the number of states it employs. For Neyman’s model [3], consider the normal form of a ﬁnitely repeated game with a known number of repetitions. You may consider strategies in this normal form to be only ones with a bounded number of states, as required by Neyman, and assign zero cost to all strategies. Alternatively, you may allow all strategies but assign zero cost to ones that employ number of states below Neyman’s bounds, and an inﬁnite cost to strategies that employ a number of states that exceeds Neyman’s bounds. The structure of equilibria proven in Theorem 1 applies to all the above models when dealing with repeated k-sum games, as in [2]. 6 Future work There are very interesting questions to answer about bounded rationality in truly large games that we did not touch upon. For example, consider the factoring game from the introduction. A pure strategy for Player 1 would be outputting a single n-bit number. A pure strategy for Player 2 would be any factoring program, described by a circuit that takes as input an n-bit number and attempts to output a representation of its prime factorization. The complexity of such a strategy would be an increasing function of the number of gates in the circuit. It would be interesting to make connections between asymptotic algorithm complexity and games. Another direction regards an elegant line of work on learning to play correlated equilibria by repeated play [11]. It would be natural to consider how strategy costs affect correlated equilibria. Finally, it would also be interesting to see how strategy costs affect the so-called “price of anarchy” [19] in congestion games.

<p>Author: Chris Murray, Geoffrey J. Gordon</p><p>Abstract: In real-world planning problems, we must reason not only about our own goals, but about the goals of other agents with which we may interact. Often these agents’ goals are neither completely aligned with our own nor directly opposed to them. Instead there are opportunities for cooperation: by joining forces, the agents can all achieve higher utility than they could separately. But, in order to cooperate, the agents must negotiate a mutually acceptable plan from among the many possible ones, and each agent must trust that the others will follow their parts of the deal. Research in multi-agent planning has often avoided the problem of making sure that all agents have an incentive to follow a proposed joint plan. On the other hand, while game theoretic algorithms handle incentives correctly, they often don’t scale to large planning problems. In this paper we attempt to bridge the gap between these two lines of research: we present an eﬃcient game-theoretic approximate planning algorithm, along with a negotiation protocol which encourages agents to compute and agree on joint plans that are fair and optimal in a sense deﬁned below. We demonstrate our algorithm and protocol on two simple robotic planning problems.1 1 INTRODUCTION We model the multi-agent planning problem as a general-sum stochastic game with cheap talk: the agents observe the state of the world, discuss their plans with each other, and then simultaneously select their actions. The state and actions determine a one-step reward for each player and a distribution over the world’s next state, and the process repeats. While talking allows the agents to coordinate their actions, it cannot by itself solve the problem of trust: the agents might lie or make false promises. So, we are interested in planning algorithms that ﬁnd subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. In a subgame-perfect equilibrium, every deviation from the plan is deterred by the threat of a suitable punishment, and every threatened punishment is believable. To ﬁnd these equilibria, planners must reason about their own and other agents’ incentives to deviate: if other agents have incentives to deviate then I can’t trust them, while if I have an incentive to deviate, they can’t trust me. In a given game there may be many subgame-perfect equilibria with widely diﬀering payoﬀs: some will be better for some agents, and others will be better for other agents. It is generally not feasible to compute all equilibria [1], and even if it were, there would be no obvious way 1 We gratefully acknowledge help and comments from Ron Parr on this research. This work was supported in part by DARPA contracts HR0011-06-0023 (the CS2P program) and 55-00069 (the RADAR program). All opinions, conclusions, and errors are our own. to select one to implement. It does not make sense for the agents to select an equilibrium without consulting one another: there is no reason that agent A’s part of one joint plan would be compatible with agent B’s part of another joint plan. Instead the agents must negotiate, computing and proposing equilibria until they ﬁnd one which is acceptable to all parties. This paper describes a planning algorithm and a negotiation protocol which work together to ensure that the agents compute and select a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium which is both approximately Pareto-optimal (that is, its value to any single agent cannot be improved very much without lowering the value to another another agent) and approximately fair (that is, near the so-called Nash bargaining point). Neither the algorithm nor the protocol is guaranteed to work in all games; however, they are guaranteed correct when they are applicable, and applicability is easy to check. In addition, our experiments show that they work well in some realistic situations. Together, these properties of fairness, enforceability, and Pareto optimality form a strong solution concept for a stochastic game. The use of this deﬁnition is one characteristic that distinguishes our work from previous research: ours is the ﬁrst eﬃcient algorithm that we know of to use such a strong solution concept for stochastic games. Our planning algorithm performs dynamic programming on a set-based value function: for P players, at a state s, V ∈ V(s) ⊂ RP is an estimate of the value the players can achieve. We represent V(s) by sampling points on its convex hull. This representation is conservative, i.e., guarantees that we ﬁnd a subset of the true V∗ (s). Based on the sampled points we can eﬃciently compute one-step backups by checking which joint actions are enforceable in an equilibrium. Our negotiation protocol is based on a multi-player version of Rubinstein’s bargaining game. Players together enumerate a set of equilibria, and then take turns proposing an equilibrium from the set. Until the players agree, the protocol ends with a small probability after each step and defaults to a low-payoﬀ equilibrium; the fear of this outcome forces players to make reasonable oﬀers. 2 2.1 BACKGROUND STOCHASTIC GAMES A stochastic game represents a multi-agent planning problem in the same way that a Markov Decision Process [2] represents a single-agent planning problem. As in an MDP, transitions in a stochastic game depend on the current state and action. Unlike MDPs, the current (joint) action is a vector of individual actions, one for each player. More formally, a generalsum stochastic game G is a tuple (S, sstart , P, A, T, R, γ). S is a set of states, and sstart ∈ S is the start state. P is the number of players. A = A1 ×A2 ×. . .×AP is the ﬁnite set of joint actions. We deal with fully observable stochastic games with perfect monitoring, where all players can observe previous joint actions. T : S × A → P (S) is the transition function, where P (S) is the set of probability distributions over S. R : S × A → RP is the reward function. We will write Rp (s, a) for the pth component of R(s, a). γ ∈ [0, 1) is the discount factor. Player p wants to maximize her discounted total value for the observed sequence ∞ of states and joint actions s1 , a1 , s2 , a2 , . . ., Vp = t=1 γ t−1 Rp (st , at ). A stationary policy for player p is a function πp : S → P (Ap ). A stationary joint policy is a vector of policies π = (π1 , . . . , πP ), one for each player. A nonstationary policy for player p is a function πp : (∪∞ (S × A)t × S) → P (Ap ) which takes a history of states and joint actions and t=0 produces a distribution over player p’s actions; we can deﬁne a nonstationary joint policy analogously. For any nonstationary joint policy, there is a stationary policy that achieves the same value at every state [3]. The value function Vpπ : S → R gives expected values for player p under joint policy π. The value vector at state s, Vπ (s), is the vector with components Vpπ (s). (For a nonstationary policy π we will deﬁne Vpπ (s) to be the value if s were the start state, and Vpπ (h) to be the value after observing history h.) A vector V is feasible at state s if there is a π for which Vπ (s) = V, and we will say that π achieves V. We will assume public randomization: the agents can sample from a desired joint action distribution in such a way that everyone can verify the outcome. If public randomization is not directly available, there are cryptographic protocols which can simulate it [4]. This assumption means that the set of feasible value vectors is convex, since we can roll a die at the ﬁrst time step to choose from a set of feasible policies. 2.2 EQUILIBRIA While optimal policies for MDPs can be determined exactly via various algorithms such as linear programming [2], it isn’t clear what it means to ﬁnd an optimal policy for a general sum stochastic game. So, rather than trying to determine a unique optimal policy, we will deﬁne a set of reasonable policies: the Pareto-dominant subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. A (possibly nonstationary) joint policy π is a Nash equilibrium if, for each individual player, no unilateral deviation from the policy would increase that player’s expected value for playing the game. Nash equilibria can contain incredible threats, that is, threats which the agents have no intention of following through on. To remove this possibility, we can deﬁne the subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. A policy π is a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium if it is a Nash equilibrium in every possible subgame: that is, if there is no incentive for any player to deviate after observing any history of joint actions. Finally, consider two policies π and φ. If Vpπ (sstart ) ≥ Vpφ (sstart ) for all players p, and if Vpπ (sstart ) > Vpφ (sstart ) for at least one p, then we will say that π Pareto dominates φ. A policy which is not Pareto dominated by any other policy is Pareto optimal. 2.3 RELATED WORK Littman and Stone [5] give an algorithm for ﬁnding Nash equilibria in two-player repeated games. Hansen et al. [6] show how to eliminate very-weakly-dominated strategies in partially observable stochastic games. Doraszelski and Judd [7] show how to compute Markov perfect equilibria in continuous-time stochastic games. The above papers use solution concepts much weaker than Pareto-dominant subgame-perfect equilibrium, and do not address negotiation and coordination. Perhaps the closest work to the current paper is by Brafman and Tennenholtz [8]: they present learning algorithms which, in repeated self-play, ﬁnd Pareto-dominant (but not subgame-perfect) Nash equilibria in matrix and stochastic games. By contrast, we consider a single play of our game, but allow “cheap talk” beforehand. And, our protocol encourages arbitrary algorithms to agree on Pareto-dominant equilibria, while their result depends strongly on the self-play assumption. 2.3.1 FOLK THEOREMS In any game, each player can guarantee herself an expected discounted value regardless of what actions the other players takes. We call this value the safety value. Suppose that there is a stationary subgame-perfect equilibrium which achieves the safety value for both players; call this the safety equilibrium policy. Suppose that, in a repeated game, some stationary policy π is better for both players than the safety equilibrium policy. Then we can build a subgame-perfect equilibrium with the same payoﬀ as π: start playing π, and if someone deviates, switch to the safety equilibrium policy. So long as γ is suﬃciently large, no rational player will want to deviate. This is the folk theorem for repeated games: any feasible value vector which is strictly better than the safety values corresponds to a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium [9]. (The proof is slightly more complicated if there is no safety equilibrium policy, but the theorem holds for any repeated game.) There is also a folk theorem for general stochastic games [3]. This theorem, while useful, is not strong enough for our purposes: it only covers discount factors γ which are so close to 1 that the players don’t care which state they wind up in after a possible deviation. In most practical stochastic games, discount factors this high are unreasonably patient. When γ is signiﬁcantly less than 1, the set of equilibrium vectors can change in strange ways as we change γ [10].

Right-hand circle corresponds to equilibrium when player 1 moves ﬁrst, left-hand circle when player 2 moves ﬁrst. The Nash point is at 3. 2.3.2 RUBINSTEIN’S GAME Rubinstein [11] considered a game where two players divide a slice of pie. The ﬁrst player oﬀers a division x, 1 − x to the second; the second player either accepts the division, or refuses and oﬀers her own division 1 − y, y. The game repeats until some player accepts an oﬀer or until either player gives up. In the latter case neither player gets any pie. Rubinstein showed that if player p’s utility for receiving a fraction x at time t is Up (x, t) = γ t Up (x) for a discount factor 0 ≤ γ < 1 and an appropriate time-independent utility function Up (x) ≥ 0, then rational players will agree on a division near the so-called Nash bargaining point. This is the point which maximizes the product of the utilities that the players gain by cooperating, U1 (x)U2 (1 − x). As γ ↑ 1, the equilibrium will approach the Nash point. See Fig. 1 for an illustration. For three or more players, a similar result holds where agents take turns proposing multi-way divisions of the pie [12]. See the technical report [13] for more detail on the multi-player version of Rubinstein’s game and the Nash bargaining point. 3 NEGOTIATION PROTOCOL The Rubinstein game implicitly assumes that the result of a failure to cooperate is known to all players: nobody gets any pie. The multi-player version of the game assumes in addition that giving one player a share of the pie doesn’t force us to give a share to any other player. Neither of these properties holds for general stochastic games. They are, however, easy to check, and often hold or can be made to hold for planning domains of interest. So, we will assume that the players have agreed beforehand on a subgame-perfect equilibrium π dis , called the disagreement policy, that they will follow in the event of a negotiation failure. In addition, for games with three or more players, we will assume that each player can unilaterally reduce her own utility by any desired amount without aﬀecting other players’ utilities. Given these assumptions, our protocol proceeds in two phases (pseudocode is given in the technical report [13]. In the ﬁrst phase agents compute subgame-perfect equilibria and take turns revealing them. On an agent’s turn she either reveals an equilibrium or passes; if all agents pass consecutively, the protocol proceeds to the second phase. When an agent states a policy π, the other agents verify that π is a subgame-perfect equilibrium and calculate its payoﬀ vector Vπ (sstart ); players who state non-equilibrium policies miss their turn. At the end of the ﬁrst phase, suppose the players have revealed a set Π of policies. Deﬁne Xp (π) = Vpπ (sstart ) − Vpdis (sstart ) U = convhull {X(π) | π ∈ Π} U = {u ≥ 0 | (∃v ∈ U | u ≤ v)} where Vdis is the value function of π dis , Xp (π) is the excess of policy π for player p, and U is the set of feasible excess vectors. In the second phase, players take turns proposing points u ∈ U along with policies or mixtures of policies in Π that achieve them. After each proposal, all agents except the pro- poser decide whether to accept or reject. If everyone accepts, the proposal is implemented: everyone starts executing the agreed equilibrium. Otherwise, the players who accepted are removed from future negotiation and have their utilities ﬁxed at the proposed levels. Fixing player p’s utility at up means that all future proposals must give p exactly up . Invalid proposals cause the proposer to lose her turn. To achieve this, the proposal may require p to voluntarily lower her own utility; this requirement is enforced by the threat that all players will revert to π dis if p fails to act as required. If at some point we hit the chance of having the current round of communication end, all remaining players are assigned their disagreement values. The players execute the last proposed policy π (or π dis if there has been no valid proposal), and any player p for whom Vpπ (sstart ) is greater than her assigned utility up voluntarily lowers her utility to the correct level. (Again, failure to do so results in all players reverting to π dis .) Under the above protocol, player’s preferences are the same as in a Rubinstein game with utility set U: because we have assumed that negotiation ends with probability after each message, agreeing on u after t additional steps is exactly as good as agreeing on u(1− )t now. So with suﬃciently small, the Rubinstein or Krishna-Serrano results show that rational players will agree on a vector u ∈ U which is close to the Nash point argmaxu∈U Πp up . 4 COMPUTING EQUILIBRIA In order to use the protocol of Sec. 3 for bargaining in a stochastic game, the players must be able to compute some subgame-perfect equilibria. Computing equilibria is a hard problem, so we cannot expect real agents to ﬁnd the entire set of equilibria. Fortunately, each player will want to ﬁnd the equilibria which are most advantageous to herself to inﬂuence the negotiation process in her favor. But equilibria which oﬀer other players reasonably high reward have a higher chance of being accepted in negotiation. So, self interest will naturally distribute the computational burden among all the players. In this section we describe an eﬃcient dynamic-programming algorithm for computing equilibria. The algorithm takes some low-payoﬀ equilibria as input and (usually) outputs higherpayoﬀ equilibria. It is based on the intuition that we can use low-payoﬀ equilibria as enforcement tools: by threatening to switch to an equilibrium that has low value to player p, we can deter p from deviating from a cooperative policy. pun pun In more detail, we will assume that we are given P diﬀerent equilibria π1 , . . . , πP ; we pun pun dis will use πp to punish player p if she deviates. We can set πp = π for all p if π dis is the only equilibrium we know; or, we can use any other equilibrium policies that we happen pun to have discovered. The algorithm will be most eﬀective when the value of πp to player p is as low as possible in all states. pun We will then search for cooperative policies that we can enforce with the given threats πp . We will ﬁrst present an algorithm which pretends that we can eﬃciently take direct sums and convex hulls of arbitrary sets. This algorithm is impractical, but ﬁnds all enforceable value vectors. We will then turn it into an approximate algorithm which uses ﬁnite data structures to represent the set-valued variables. As we allow more and more storage for each set, the approximate algorithm will approach the exact one; and in any case the result will be a set of equilibria which the agents can execute. 4.1 THE EXACT ALGORITHM Our algorithm maintains a set of value vectors V(s) for each state s. It initializes V(s) to a set which we know contains the value vectors for all equilibrium policies. It then reﬁnes V by dynamic programming: it repeatedly attempts to improve the set of values at each state by backing up all of the joint actions, excluding joint actions from which some agent has an incentive to deviate. In more detail, we will compute Vpdis (s) ≡ Vpπdis (s) for all s and p and use the vector Vdis (s) in our initialization. (Recall that we have deﬁned Vpπ (s) for a nonstationary policy π as the value of π if s were the start state.) We also need the values of the punishment policies for Initialization for s ∈ S V(s) ← {V | Vpdis (s) ≤ Vp ≤ Rmax /(1 − γ)} end Repeat until converged for iteration ← 1, 2, . . . for s ∈ S Compute value vector set for each joint action, then throw away unenforceable vectors for a ∈ A Q(s, a) ← {R(s, a)} + γ s ∈S T (s, a)(s )V(s ) Q(s, a) ← {Q ∈ Q(s, a) | Q ≥ Vdev (s, a)} end We can now randomize among joint actions V(s) ← convhull a Q(s, a) end end Figure 2: Dynamic programming using exact operations on sets of value vectors π pun their corresponding players, Vppun (s) ≡ Vp p (s) for all p and s. Given these values, deﬁne Qdev (s, a) = Rp (s, a) + γ p T (s, a)(s )Vppun (s ) (1) s ∈S pun to be the value to player p of playing joint action a from state s and then following πp forever after. From the above Qdev values we can compute player p’s value for deviating from an equilibp rium which recommends action a in state s: it is Qdev (s, a ) for the best possible deviation p a , since p will get the one-step payoﬀ for a but be punished by the rest of the players starting on the following time step. That is, Vpdev (s, a) = max Qdev (s, a1 × . . . × ap × . . . × aP ) p ap ∈Ap (2) Vpdev (s, a) is the value we must achieve for player p in state s if we are planning to recommend pun action a and punish deviations with πp : if we do not achieve this value, player p would rather deviate and be punished. Our algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. After k iterations, each vector in V(s) corresponds to a k-step policy in which no agent ever has an incentive to deviate. In the k + 1st iteration, the ﬁrst assignment to Q(s, a) computes the value of performing action a followed by any k-step policy. The second assignment throws out the pairs (a, π) for which some agent would want to deviate from a given that the agents plan to follow π in the future. And the convex hull accounts for the fact that, on reaching state s, we can select an action a and future policy π at random from the feasible pairs.2 Proofs of convergence and correctness of the exact algorithm are in the technical report [13]. Of course, we cannot actually implement the algorithm of Fig. 2, since it requires variables whose values are convex sets of vectors. But, we can approximate V(s) by choosing a ﬁnite set of witness vectors W ⊂ RP and storing V(s, w) = arg maxv∈V(s) (v·w) for each w ∈ W. V(s) is then approximated by the convex hull of {V(s, w) | w ∈ W}. If W samples the P dimensional unit hypersphere densely enough, the maximum possible approximation error will be small. (In practice, each agent will probably want to pick W diﬀerently, to focus her computation on policies in the portion of the Pareto frontier where her own utility is relatively high.) As |W| increases, the error introduced at each step will go to zero. The approximate algorithm is given in more detail in the technical report [13]. 2 It is important for this randomization to occur after reaching state s to avoid introducing incentives to deviate, and it is also important for the randomization to be public.

In our motion planning problem (Fig. 3), two players together control a two-wheeled robot, with each player picking the rotational velocity for one wheel. Each player has a list of goal landmarks which she wants to cycle through, but the two players can have diﬀerent lists of goals. We discretized states based on X, Y, θ and the current goals, and discretized actions into stop, slow (0.45 m ), and fast (0.9 m ), for 9 joint actions and about 25,000 states. s s We discretized time at ∆t = 1s, and set γ = 0.99. For both the disagreement policy and all punishment policies, we used “always stop,” since by keeping her wheel stopped either player can prevent the robot from moving. Planning took a few hours of wall clock time on a desktop workstation for 32 witnesses per state. Based on the planner’s output, we ran our negotiation protocol to select an equilibrium. Fig. 3 shows the results: with limited computation the players pick two selﬁsh paths and randomize equally between them, while with more computation they ﬁnd the cooperative path. Our experiments also showed that limiting the computation available to one player allows the unrestricted player to reveal only some of the equilibria she knows about, tilting the outcome of the negotiation in her favor (see the technical report [13] for details). For our second experiment we examined a more realistic supply-chain problem. Here each player is a parts supplier competing for the business of an engine manufacturer. The manufacturer doesn’t store items and will only pay for parts which can be used immediately. Each player controls a truck which moves parts from warehouses to the assembly shop; she pays for parts when she picks them up, and receives payment on delivery. Each player gets parts from diﬀerent locations at diﬀerent prices and no one player can provide all of the parts the manufacturer needs. Each player’s truck can be at six locations along a line: four warehouse locations (each of which provides a diﬀerent type of part), one empty location, and the assembly shop. Building an engine requires ﬁve parts, delivered in the order A, {B, C}, D, E (parts B and C can arrive in either order). After E, the manufacturer needs A again. Players can move left or right along the line at a small cost, or wait for free. They can also buy parts at a warehouse (dropping any previous cargo), or sell their cargo if they are at the shop and the manufacturer wants it. Each player can only carry one part at a time and only one player can make a delivery at a time. Finally, any player can retire and sell her truck; in this case the game ends and all players get the value of their truck plus any cargo. The disagreement policy is for all players to retire at all states. Fig. 4 shows the computed sets V(sstart ) for various numbers of witnesses. The more witnesses we use, the more accurately we represent the frontier, and the closer our ﬁnal policy is to the true Nash point. All of the policies computed are “intelligent” and “cooperative”: a human observer would not see obvious ways to improve them, and in fact would say that they look similar despite their diﬀering payoﬀs. Players coordinate their motions, so that one player will drive out to buy part E while the other delivers part D. They sit idle only in order to delay the purchase of a part which would otherwise be delivered too soon. 6 CONCLUSION Real-world planning problems involve negotiation among multiple agents with varying goals. To take all agents incentives into account, the agents should ﬁnd and agree on Paretodominant subgame-perfect Nash equilibria. For this purpose, we presented eﬃcient planning and negotiation algorithms for general-sum stochastic games, and tested them on two robotic planning problems. References [1] V. Conitzer and T.

In this setting, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been proposed as a method for discovering anomalies by continuously tracking the projection of the data onto a residual subspace. This method was shown to work well empirically in highly aggregated networks, that is, those with a limited number of large nodes and at coarse time scales. This approach, however, has scalability limitations. To overcome these limitations, we develop a PCA-based anomaly detector in which adaptive local data ﬁlters send to a coordinator just enough data to enable accurate global detection. Our method is based on a stochastic matrix perturbation analysis that characterizes the tradeoff between the accuracy of anomaly detection and the amount of data communicated over the network.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75381911 <a title="13-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Scalable_Machine_Learning_Approach_to_Go.html">13 nips-2006-A Scalable Machine Learning Approach to Go</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Wu, Pierre F. Baldi</p><p>Abstract: Go is an ancient board game that poses unique opportunities and challenges for AI and machine learning. Here we develop a machine learning approach to Go, and related board games, focusing primarily on the problem of learning a good evaluation function in a scalable way. Scalability is essential at multiple levels, from the library of local tactical patterns, to the integration of patterns across the board, to the size of the board itself. The system we propose is capable of automatically learning the propensity of local patterns from a library of games. Propensity and other local tactical information are fed into a recursive neural network, derived from a Bayesian network architecture. The network integrates local information across the board and produces local outputs that represent local territory ownership probabilities. The aggregation of these probabilities provides an effective strategic evaluation function that is an estimate of the expected area at the end (or at other stages) of the game. Local area targets for training can be derived from datasets of human games. A system trained using only 9 × 9 amateur game data performs surprisingly well on a test set derived from 19 × 19 professional game data. Possible directions for further improvements are brieﬂy discussed. 1</p><p>3 0.66630745 <a title="13-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Convex_Repeated_Games_and_Fenchel_Duality.html">61 nips-2006-Convex Repeated Games and Fenchel Duality</a></p>
<p>Author: Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe an algorithmic framework for an abstract game which we term a convex repeated game. We show that various online learning and boosting algorithms can be all derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework. This uniﬁed view explains the properties of existing algorithms and also enables us to derive several new interesting algorithms. Our algorithmic framework stems from a connection that we build between the notions of regret in game theory and weak duality in convex optimization. 1 Introduction and Problem Setting Several problems arising in machine learning can be modeled as a convex repeated game. Convex repeated games are closely related to online convex programming (see [19, 9] and the discussion in the last section). A convex repeated game is a two players game that is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t of the repeated game, the ﬁrst player chooses a vector wt from a convex set S. Next, the second player responds with a convex function gt : S → R. Finally, the ﬁrst player suffers an instantaneous loss gt (wt ). We study the game from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player. The goal of the ﬁrst player is to minimize its cumulative loss, t gt (wt ). To motivate this rather abstract setting let us ﬁrst cast the more familiar setting of online learning as a convex repeated game. Online learning is performed in a sequence of consecutive rounds. On round t, the learner ﬁrst receives a question, cast as a vector xt , and is required to provide an answer for this question. For example, xt can be an encoding of an email message and the question is whether the email is spam or not. The prediction of the learner is performed based on an hypothesis, ht : X → Y, where X is the set of questions and Y is the set of possible answers. In the aforementioned example, Y would be {+1, −1} where +1 stands for a spam email and −1 stands for a benign one. After predicting an answer, the learner receives the correct answer for the question, denoted yt , and suffers loss according to a loss function (ht , (xt , yt )). In most cases, the hypotheses used for prediction come from a parameterized set of hypotheses, H = {hw : w ∈ S}. For example, the set of linear classiﬁers, which is used for answering yes/no questions, is deﬁned as H = {hw (x) = sign( w, x ) : w ∈ Rn }. Thus, rather than saying that on round t the learner chooses a hypothesis, we can say that the learner chooses a vector wt and its hypothesis is hwt . Next, we note that once the environment chooses a question-answer pair (xt , yt ), the loss function becomes a function over the hypotheses space or equivalently over the set of parameter vectors S. We can therefore redeﬁne the online learning process as follows. On round t, the learner chooses a vector wt ∈ S, which deﬁnes a hypothesis hwt to be used for prediction. Then, the environment chooses a questionanswer pair (xt , yt ), which induces the following loss function over the set of parameter vectors, gt (w) = (hw , (xt , yt )). Finally, the learner suffers the loss gt (wt ) = (hwt , (xt , yt )). We have therefore described the process of online learning as a convex repeated game. In this paper we assess the performance of the ﬁrst player using the notion of regret. Given a number of rounds T and a ﬁxed vector u ∈ S, we deﬁne the regret of the ﬁrst player as the excess loss for not consistently playing the vector u, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) . t=1 Our main result is an algorithmic framework for the ﬁrst player which guarantees low regret with respect to any vector u ∈ S. Speciﬁcally, we derive regret bounds that take the following form ∀u ∈ S, 1 T T gt (wt ) − t=1 1 T T gt (u) ≤ t=1 f (u) + L √ , T (1) where f : S → R and L ∈ R+ . Informally, the function f measures the “complexity” of vectors in S and the scalar L is related to some generalized Lipschitz property of the functions g1 , . . . , gT . We defer the exact requirements we impose on f and L to later sections. Our algorithmic framework emerges from a representation of the regret bound given in Eq. (1) using an optimization problem. Speciﬁcally, we rewrite Eq. (1) as follows 1 T T gt (wt ) ≤ inf t=1 u∈S 1 T T gt (u) + t=1 f (u) + L √ . T (2) That is, the average loss of the ﬁrst player should be bounded above by the minimum value of an optimization problem in which we jointly minimize the average loss of u and the “complexity” of u as measured by the function f . Note that the optimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) can only be solved in hindsight after observing the entire sequence of loss functions. Nevertheless, writing the regret bound as in Eq. (2) implies that the average loss of the ﬁrst player forms a lower bound for a minimization problem. The notion of duality, commonly used in convex optimization theory, plays an important role in obtaining lower bounds for the minimal value of a minimization problem (see for example [14]). By generalizing the notion of Fenchel duality, we are able to derive a dual optimization problem, which can be optimized incrementally, as the game progresses. In order to derive explicit quantitative regret bounds we make an immediate use of the fact that dual objective lower bounds the primal objective. We therefore reduce the process of playing convex repeated games to the task of incrementally increasing the dual objective function. The amount by which the dual increases serves as a new and natural notion of progress. By doing so we are able to tie the primal objective value, the average loss of the ﬁrst player, and the increase in the dual. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we establish our notation and point to a few mathematical tools that we use throughout the paper. Our main tool for deriving algorithms for playing convex repeated games is a generalization of Fenchel duality, described in Sec. 3. Our algorithmic framework is given in Sec. 4 and analyzed in Sec. 5. The generality of our framework allows us to utilize it in different problems arising in machine learning. Speciﬁcally, in Sec. 6 we underscore the applicability of our framework for online learning and in Sec. 7 we outline and analyze boosting algorithms based on our framework. We conclude with a discussion and point to related work in Sec. 8. Due to the lack of space, some of the details are omitted from the paper and can be found in [16]. 2 Mathematical Background We denote scalars with lower case letters (e.g. x and w), and vectors with bold face letters (e.g. x and w). The inner product between vectors x and w is denoted by x, w . Sets are designated by upper case letters (e.g. S). The set of non-negative real numbers is denoted by R+ . For any k ≥ 1, the set of integers {1, . . . , k} is denoted by [k]. A norm of a vector x is denoted by x . The dual norm is deﬁned as λ = sup{ x, λ : x ≤ 1}. For example, the Euclidean norm, x 2 = ( x, x )1/2 is dual to itself and the 1 norm, x 1 = i |xi |, is dual to the ∞ norm, x ∞ = maxi |xi |. We next recall a few deﬁnitions from convex analysis. The reader familiar with convex analysis may proceed to Lemma 1 while for a more thorough introduction see for example [1]. A set S is convex if for any two vectors w1 , w2 in S, all the line between w1 and w2 is also within S. That is, for any α ∈ [0, 1] we have that αw1 + (1 − α)w2 ∈ S. A set S is open if every point in S has a neighborhood lying in S. A set S is closed if its complement is an open set. A function f : S → R is closed and convex if for any scalar α ∈ R, the level set {w : f (w) ≤ α} is closed and convex. The Fenchel conjugate of a function f : S → R is deﬁned as f (θ) = supw∈S w, θ − f (w) . If f is closed and convex then the Fenchel conjugate of f is f itself. The Fenchel-Young inequality states that for any w and θ we have that f (w) + f (θ) ≥ w, θ . A vector λ is a sub-gradient of a function f at w if for all w ∈ S we have that f (w ) − f (w) ≥ w − w, λ . The differential set of f at w, denoted ∂f (w), is the set of all sub-gradients of f at w. If f is differentiable at w then ∂f (w) consists of a single vector which amounts to the gradient of f at w and is denoted by f (w). Sub-gradients play an important role in the deﬁnition of Fenchel conjugate. In particular, the following lemma states that if λ ∈ ∂f (w) then Fenchel-Young inequality holds with equality. Lemma 1 Let f be a closed and convex function and let ∂f (w ) be its differential set at w . Then, for all λ ∈ ∂f (w ) we have, f (w ) + f (λ ) = λ , w . A continuous function f is σ-strongly convex over a convex set S with respect to a norm · if S is contained in the domain of f and for all v, u ∈ S and α ∈ [0, 1] we have 1 (3) f (α v + (1 − α) u) ≤ α f (v) + (1 − α) f (u) − σ α (1 − α) v − u 2 . 2 Strongly convex functions play an important role in our analysis primarily due to the following lemma. Lemma 2 Let · be a norm over Rn and let · be its dual norm. Let f be a σ-strongly convex function on S and let f be its Fenchel conjugate. Then, f is differentiable with f (θ) = arg maxx∈S θ, x − f (x). Furthermore, for any θ, λ ∈ Rn we have 1 f (θ + λ) − f (θ) ≤ f (θ), λ + λ 2 . 2σ Two notable examples of strongly convex functions which we use are as follows. 1 Example 1 The function f (w) = 2 w norm. Its conjugate function is f (θ) = 2 2 1 2 is 1-strongly convex over S = Rn with respect to the θ 2. 2 2 n 1 Example 2 The function f (w) = i=1 wi log(wi / n ) is 1-strongly convex over the probabilistic n simplex, S = {w ∈ R+ : w 1 = 1}, with respect to the 1 norm. Its conjugate function is n 1 f (θ) = log( n i=1 exp(θi )). 3 Generalized Fenchel Duality In this section we derive our main analysis tool. We start by considering the following optimization problem, T inf c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) , w∈S where c is a non-negative scalar. An equivalent problem is inf w0 ,w1 ,...,wT c f (w0 ) + T t=1 gt (wt ) s.t. w0 ∈ S and ∀t ∈ [T ], wt = w0 . Introducing T vectors λ1 , . . . , λT , each λt ∈ Rn is a vector of Lagrange multipliers for the equality constraint wt = w0 , we obtain the following Lagrangian T T L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) = c f (w0 ) + t=1 gt (wt ) + t=1 λt , w0 − wt . The dual problem is the task of maximizing the following dual objective value, D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = inf L(w0 , w1 , . . . , wT , λ1 , . . . , λT ) w0 ∈S,w1 ,...,wT = − c sup w0 ∈S = −c f −1 c w0 , − 1 c T t=1 T t=1 λt − λt − f (w0 ) − T t=1 gt (λt ) , T t=1 sup ( wt , λt − gt (wt )) wt where, following the exposition of Sec. 2, f , g1 , . . . , gT are the Fenchel conjugate functions of f, g1 , . . . , gT . Therefore, the generalized Fenchel dual problem is sup − cf λ1 ,...,λT −1 c T t=1 λt − T t=1 gt (λt ) . (4) Note that when T = 1 and c = 1, the above duality is the so called Fenchel duality. 4 A Template Learning Algorithm for Convex Repeated Games In this section we describe a template learning algorithm for playing convex repeated games. As mentioned before, we study convex repeated games from the viewpoint of the ﬁrst player which we shortly denote as P1. Recall that we would like our learning algorithm to achieve a regret bound of the form given in Eq. (2). We start by rewriting Eq. (2) as follows T m gt (wt ) − c L ≤ inf u∈S t=1 c f (u) + gt (u) , (5) t=1 √ where c = T . Thus, up to the sublinear term c L, the cumulative loss of P1 lower bounds the optimum of the minimization problem on the right-hand side of Eq. (5). In the previous section we derived the generalized Fenchel dual of the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Our construction is based on the weak duality theorem stating that any value of the dual problem is smaller than the optimum value of the primal problem. The algorithmic framework we propose is therefore derived by incrementally ascending the dual objective function. Intuitively, by ascending the dual objective we move closer to the optimal primal value and therefore our performance becomes similar to the performance of the best ﬁxed weight vector which minimizes the right-hand side of Eq. (5). Initially, we use the elementary dual solution λ1 = 0 for all t. We assume that inf w f (w) = 0 and t for all t inf w gt (w) = 0 which imply that D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 0. We assume in addition that f is 1 T σ-strongly convex. Therefore, based on Lemma 2, the function f is differentiable. At trial t, P1 uses for prediction the vector wt = f −1 c T i=1 λt i . (6) After predicting wt , P1 receives the function gt and suffers the loss gt (wt ). Then, P1 updates the dual variables as follows. Denote by ∂t the differential set of gt at wt , that is, ∂t = {λ : ∀w ∈ S, gt (w) − gt (wt ) ≥ λ, w − wt } . (7) The new dual variables (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) are set to be any set of vectors which satisfy the following 1 T two conditions: (i). ∃λ ∈ ∂t s.t. D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λ , λt , . . . , λt ) 1 1 t−1 t+1 T T (ii). ∀i > t, λt+1 = 0 i . (8) In the next section we show that condition (i) ensures that the increase of the dual at trial t is proportional to the loss gt (wt ). The second condition ensures that we can actually calculate the dual at trial t without any knowledge on the yet to be seen loss functions gt+1 , . . . , gT . We conclude this section with two update rules that trivially satisfy the above two conditions. The ﬁrst update scheme simply ﬁnds λ ∈ ∂t and set λt+1 = i λ λt i if i = t if i = t . (9) The second update deﬁnes (λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) = argmax D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) 1 T λ1 ,...,λT s.t. ∀i = t, λi = λt . i (10) 5 Analysis In this section we analyze the performance of the template algorithm given in the previous section. Our proof technique is based on monitoring the value of the dual objective function. The main result is the following lemma which gives upper and lower bounds for the ﬁnal value of the dual objective function. Lemma 3 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function with respect to a norm · over a set S and assume that minw∈S f (w) = 0. Let g1 , . . . , gT be a sequence of convex and closed functions such that inf w gt (w) = 0 for all t ∈ [T ]. Suppose that a dual-incrementing algorithm which satisﬁes the conditions of Eq. (8) is run with f as a complexity function on the sequence g1 , . . . , gT . Let w1 , . . . , wT be the sequence of primal vectors that the algorithm generates and λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 1 T be its ﬁnal sequence of dual variables. Then, there exists a sequence of sub-gradients λ1 , . . . , λT , where λt ∈ ∂t for all t, such that T 1 gt (wt ) − 2σc t=1 T T λt 2 ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) 1 T t=1 ≤ inf c f (w) + w∈S gt (w) . t=1 Proof The second inequality follows directly from the weak duality theorem. Turning to the left most inequality, denote ∆t = D(λt+1 , . . . , λt+1 ) − D(λt , . . . , λt ) and note that 1 1 T T T D(λ1 +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) can be rewritten as T T t=1 D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ) = 1 T T t=1 ∆t − D(λ1 , . . . , λ1 ) = 1 T ∆t , (11) where the last equality follows from the fact that f (0) = g1 (0) = . . . = gT (0) = 0. The deﬁnition of the update implies that ∆t ≥ D(λt , . . . , λt , λt , 0, . . . , 0) − D(λt , . . . , λt , 0, 0, . . . , 0) for 1 t−1 1 t−1 t−1 some subgradient λt ∈ ∂t . Denoting θ t = − 1 j=1 λj , we now rewrite the lower bound on ∆t as, c ∆t ≥ −c (f (θ t − λt /c) − f (θ t )) − gt (λt ) . Using Lemma 2 and the deﬁnition of wt we get that 1 (12) ∆t ≥ wt , λt − gt (λt ) − 2 σ c λt 2 . Since λt ∈ ∂t and since we assume that gt is closed and convex, we can apply Lemma 1 to get that wt , λt − gt (λt ) = gt (wt ). Plugging this equality into Eq. (12) and summing over t we obtain that T T T 1 2 . t=1 ∆t ≥ t=1 gt (wt ) − 2 σ c t=1 λt Combining the above inequality with Eq. (11) concludes our proof. The following regret bound follows as a direct corollary of Lemma 3. T 1 Theorem 1 Under the same conditions of Lemma 3. Denote L = T t=1 λt w ∈ S we have, T T c f (w) 1 1 + 2L c . t=1 gt (wt ) − T t=1 gt (w) ≤ T T σ √ In particular, if c = T , we obtain the bound, 1 T 6 T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (w) ≤ f (w)+L/(2 σ) √ T 2 . Then, for all . Application to Online learning In Sec. 1 we cast the task of online learning as a convex repeated game. We now demonstrate the applicability of our algorithmic framework for the problem of instance ranking. We analyze this setting since several prediction problems, including binary classiﬁcation, multiclass prediction, multilabel prediction, and label ranking, can be cast as special cases of the instance ranking problem. Recall that on each online round, the learner receives a question-answer pair. In instance ranking, the question is encoded by a matrix Xt of dimension kt × n and the answer is a vector yt ∈ Rkt . The semantic of yt is as follows. For any pair (i, j), if yt,i > yt,j then we say that yt ranks the i’th row of Xt ahead of the j’th row of Xt . We also interpret yt,i − yt,j as the conﬁdence in which the i’th row should be ranked ahead of the j’th row. For example, each row of Xt encompasses a representation of a movie while yt,i is the movie’s rating, expressed as the number of stars this movie has received by a movie reviewer. The predictions of the learner are determined ˆ based on a weight vector wt ∈ Rn and are deﬁned to be yt = Xt wt . Finally, let us deﬁne two loss functions for ranking, both generalize the hinge-loss used in binary classiﬁcation problems. Denote by Et the set {(i, j) : yt,i > yt,j }. For all (i, j) ∈ Et we deﬁne a pair-based hinge-loss i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) = [(yt,i − yt,j ) − w, xt,i − xt,j ]+ , where [a]+ = max{a, 0} and xt,i , xt,j are respectively the i’th and j’th rows of Xt . Note that i,j is zero if w ranks xt,i higher than xt,j with a sufﬁcient conﬁdence. Ideally, we would like i,j (wt ; (Xt , yt )) to be zero for all (i, j) ∈ Et . If this is not the case, we are being penalized according to some combination of the pair-based losses i,j . For example, we can set (w; (Xt , yt )) to be the average over the pair losses, 1 avg (w; (Xt , yt )) = |Et | (i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . This loss was suggested by several authors (see for example [18]). Another popular approach (see for example [5]) penalizes according to the maximal loss over the individual pairs, max (w; (Xt , yt )) = max(i,j)∈Et i,j (w; (Xt , yt )) . We can apply our algorithmic framework given in Sec. 4 for ranking, using for gt (w) either avg (w; (Xt , yt )) or max (w; (Xt , yt )). The following theorem provides us with a sufﬁcient condition under which the regret bound from Thm. 1 holds for ranking as well. Theorem 2 Let f be a σ-strongly convex function over S with respect to a norm · . Denote by Lt the maximum over (i, j) ∈ Et of xt,i − xt,j 2 . Then, for both gt (w) = avg (w; (Xt , yt )) and ∗ gt (w) = max (w; (Xt , yt )), the following regret bound holds ∀u ∈ S, 7 1 T T t=1 gt (wt ) − 1 T T t=1 gt (u) ≤ 1 f (u)+ T PT t=1 Lt /(2 σ) √ T . The Boosting Game In this section we describe the applicability of our algorithmic framework to the analysis of boosting algorithms. A boosting algorithm uses a weak learning algorithm that generates weak-hypotheses whose performances are just slightly better than random guessing to build a strong-hypothesis which can attain an arbitrarily low error. The AdaBoost algorithm, proposed by Freund and Schapire [6], receives as input a training set of examples {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} where for all i ∈ [m], xi is taken from an instance domain X , and yi is a binary label, yi ∈ {+1, −1}. The boosting process proceeds in a sequence of consecutive trials. At trial t, the booster ﬁrst deﬁnes a distribution, denoted wt , over the set of examples. Then, the booster passes the training set along with the distribution wt to the weak learner. The weak learner is assumed to return a hypothesis ht : X → {+1, −1} whose average error is slightly smaller than 1 . That is, there exists a constant γ > 0 such that, 2 def m 1−yi ht (xi ) = ≤ 1 −γ . (13) i=1 wt,i 2 2 The goal of the boosting algorithm is to invoke the weak learner several times with different distributions, and to combine the hypotheses returned by the weak learner into a ﬁnal, so called strong, hypothesis whose error is small. The ﬁnal hypothesis combines linearly the T hypotheses returned by the weak learner with coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT , and is deﬁned to be the sign of hf (x) where T hf (x) = t=1 αt ht (x) . The coefﬁcients α1 , . . . , αT are determined by the booster. In Ad1 1 aBoost, the initial distribution is set to be the uniform distribution, w1 = ( m , . . . , m ). At iter1 ation t, the value of αt is set to be 2 log((1 − t )/ t ). The distribution is updated by the rule wt+1,i = wt,i exp(−αt yi ht (xi ))/Zt , where Zt is a normalization factor. Freund and Schapire [6] have shown that under the assumption given in Eq. (13), the error of the ﬁnal strong hypothesis is at most exp(−2 γ 2 T ). t Several authors [15, 13, 8, 4] have proposed to view boosting as a coordinate-wise greedy optimization process. To do so, note ﬁrst that hf errs on an example (x, y) iff y hf (x) ≤ 0. Therefore, the exp-loss function, deﬁned as exp(−y hf (x)), is a smooth upper bound of the zero-one error, which equals to 1 if y hf (x) ≤ 0 and to 0 otherwise. Thus, we can restate the goal of boosting as minimizing the average exp-loss of hf over the training set with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . To simplify our derivation in the sequel, we prefer to say that boosting maximizes the negation of the loss, that is, T m 1 (14) max − m i=1 exp −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) . α1 ,...,αT In this view, boosting is an optimization procedure which iteratively maximizes Eq. (14) with respect to the variables α1 , . . . , αT . This view of boosting, enables the hypotheses returned by the weak learner to be general functions into the reals, ht : X → R (see for instance [15]). In this paper we view boosting as a convex repeated game between a booster and a weak learner. To motivate our construction, we would like to note that boosting algorithms deﬁne weights in two different domains: the vectors wt ∈ Rm which assign weights to examples and the weights {αt : t ∈ [T ]} over weak-hypotheses. In the terminology used throughout this paper, the weights wt ∈ Rm are primal vectors while (as we show in the sequel) each weight αt of the hypothesis ht is related to a dual vector λt . In particular, we show that Eq. (14) is exactly the Fenchel dual of a primal problem for a convex repeated game, thus the algorithmic framework described thus far for playing games naturally ﬁts the problem of iteratively solving Eq. (14). To derive the primal problem whose Fenchel dual is the problem given in Eq. (14) let us ﬁrst denote by vt the vector in Rm whose ith element is vt,i = yi ht (xi ). For all t, we set gt to be the function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Intuitively, gt penalizes vectors w which assign large weights to examples which are predicted accurately, that is yi ht (xi ) > 0. In particular, if ht (xi ) ∈ {+1, −1} and wt is a distribution over the m examples (as is the case in AdaBoost), gt (wt ) reduces to 1 − 2 t (see Eq. (13)). In this case, minimizing gt is equivalent to maximizing the error of the individual T hypothesis ht over the examples. Consider the problem of minimizing c f (w) + t=1 gt (w) where f (w) is the relative entropy given in Example 2 and c = 1/(2 γ) (see Eq. (13)). To derive its Fenchel dual, we note that gt (λt ) = 0 if there exists βt ∈ [0, 1] such that λt = βt vt and otherwise gt (λt ) = ∞ (see [16]). In addition, let us deﬁne αt = 2 γ βt . Since our goal is to maximize the αt dual, we can restrict λt to take the form λt = βt vt = 2 γ vt , and get that D(λ1 , . . . , λT ) = −c f − 1 c T βt vt t=1 =− 1 log 2γ 1 m m e− PT t=1 αt yi ht (xi ) . (15) i=1 Minimizing the exp-loss of the strong hypothesis is therefore the dual problem of the following primal minimization problem: ﬁnd a distribution over the examples, whose relative entropy to the uniform distribution is as small as possible while the correlation of the distribution with each vt is as small as possible. Since the correlation of w with vt is inversely proportional to the error of ht with respect to w, we obtain that in the primal problem we are trying to maximize the error of each individual hypothesis, while in the dual problem we minimize the global error of the strong hypothesis. The intuition of ﬁnding distributions which in retrospect result in large error rates of individual hypotheses was also alluded in [15, 8]. We can now apply our algorithmic framework from Sec. 4 to boosting. We describe the game αt with the parameters αt , where αt ∈ [0, 2 γ], and underscore that in our case, λt = 2 γ vt . At the beginning of the game the booster sets all dual variables to be zero, ∀t αt = 0. At trial t of the boosting game, the booster ﬁrst constructs a primal weight vector wt ∈ Rm , which assigns importance weights to the examples in the training set. The primal vector wt is constructed as in Eq. (6), that is, wt = f (θ t ), where θ t = − i αi vi . Then, the weak learner responds by presenting the loss function gt (w) = [ w, vt ]+ . Finally, the booster updates the dual variables so as to increase the dual objective function. It is possible to show that if the range of ht is {+1, −1} 1 then the update given in Eq. (10) is equivalent to the update αt = min{2 γ, 2 log((1 − t )/ t )}. We have thus obtained a variant of AdaBoost in which the weights αt are capped above by 2 γ. A disadvantage of this variant is that we need to know the parameter γ. We would like to note in passing that this limitation can be lifted by a different deﬁnition of the functions gt . We omit the details due to the lack of space. To analyze our game of boosting, we note that the conditions given in Lemma 3 holds T and therefore the left-hand side inequality given in Lemma 3 tells us that t=1 gt (wt ) − T T +1 T +1 1 2 , . . . , λT ) . The deﬁnition of gt and the weak learnability ast=1 λt ∞ ≤ D(λ1 2c sumption given in Eq. (13) imply that wt , vt ≥ 2 γ for all t. Thus, gt (wt ) = wt , vt ≥ 2 γ which also implies that λt = vt . Recall that vt,i = yi ht (xi ). Assuming that the range of ht is [+1, −1] we get that λt ∞ ≤ 1. Combining all the above with the left-hand side inequality T given in Lemma 3 we get that 2 T γ − 2 c ≤ D(λT +1 , . . . , λT +1 ). Using the deﬁnition of D (see 1 T Eq. (15)), the value c = 1/(2 γ), and rearranging terms we recover the original bound for AdaBoost PT 2 m 1 −yi t=1 αt ht (xi ) ≤ e−2 γ T . i=1 e m 8 Related Work and Discussion We presented a new framework for designing and analyzing algorithms for playing convex repeated games. Our framework was used for the analysis of known algorithms for both online learning and boosting settings. The framework also paves the way to new algorithms. In a previous paper [17], we suggested the use of duality for the design of online algorithms in the context of mistake bound analysis. The contribution of this paper over [17] is three fold as we now brieﬂy discuss. First, we generalize the applicability of the framework beyond the speciﬁc setting of online learning with the hinge-loss to the general setting of convex repeated games. The setting of convex repeated games was formally termed “online convex programming” by Zinkevich [19] and was ﬁrst presented by Gordon in [9]. There is voluminous amount of work on unifying approaches for deriving online learning algorithms. We refer the reader to [11, 12, 3] for work closely related to the content of this paper. By generalizing our previously studied algorithmic framework [17] beyond online learning, we can automatically utilize well known online learning algorithms, such as the EG and p-norm algorithms [12, 11], to the setting of online convex programming. We would like to note that the algorithms presented in [19] can be derived as special cases of our algorithmic framework 1 by setting f (w) = 2 w 2 . Parallel and independently to this work, Gordon [10] described another algorithmic framework for online convex programming that is closely related to the potential based algorithms described by Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi [3]. Gordon also considered the problem of deﬁning appropriate potential functions. Our work generalizes some of the theorems in [10] while providing a somewhat simpler analysis. Second, the usage of generalized Fenchel duality rather than the Lagrange duality given in [17] enables us to analyze boosting algorithms based on the framework. Many authors derived unifying frameworks for boosting algorithms [13, 8, 4]. Nonetheless, our general framework and the connection between game playing and Fenchel duality underscores an interesting perspective of both online learning and boosting. We believe that this viewpoint has the potential of yielding new algorithms in both domains. Last, despite the generality of the framework introduced in this paper, the resulting analysis is more distilled than the earlier analysis given in [17] for two reasons. (i) The usage of Lagrange duality in [17] is somehow restricted while the notion of generalized Fenchel duality is more appropriate to the general and broader problems we consider in this paper. (ii) The strongly convex property we employ both simpliﬁes the analysis and enables more intuitive conditions in our theorems. There are various possible extensions of the work that we did not pursue here due to the lack of space. For instanc, our framework can naturally be used for the analysis of other settings such as repeated games (see [7, 19]). The applicability of our framework to online learning can also be extended to other prediction problems such as regression and sequence prediction. Last, we conjecture that our primal-dual view of boosting will lead to new methods for regularizing boosting algorithms, thus improving their generalization capabilities.

<p>Author: Silvia Richter, Douglas Aberdeen, Jin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Current road-trafﬁc optimisation practice around the world is a combination of hand tuned policies with a small degree of automatic adaption. Even state-ofthe-art research controllers need good models of the road trafﬁc, which cannot be obtained directly from existing sensors. We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the trafﬁc signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the trafﬁc system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison. Along the way we extend natural-actor critic approaches to work for distributed and online inﬁnite-horizon problems. 1</p><p>5 0.5980438 <a title="13-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Learnability_and_the_doubling_dimension.html">109 nips-2006-Learnability and the doubling dimension</a></p>
<p>Author: Yi Li, Philip M. Long</p><p>Abstract: Given a set of classiﬁers and a probability distribution over their domain, one can deﬁne a metric by taking the distance between a pair of classiﬁers to be the probability that they classify a random item differently. We prove bounds on the sample complexity of PAC learning in terms of the doubling dimension of this metric. These bounds imply known bounds on the sample complexity of learning halfspaces with respect to the uniform distribution that are optimal up to a constant factor. We prove a bound that holds for any algorithm that outputs a classiﬁer with zero error whenever this is possible; this bound is in terms of the maximum of the doubling dimension and the VC-dimension of , and strengthens the best known bound in terms of the VC-dimension alone. We show that there is no bound on the doubling dimension in terms of the VC-dimension of (in contrast with the metric dimension).</p><p>6 0.59379262 <a title="13-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-An_Approach_to_Bounded_Rationality.html">26 nips-2006-An Approach to Bounded Rationality</a></p>

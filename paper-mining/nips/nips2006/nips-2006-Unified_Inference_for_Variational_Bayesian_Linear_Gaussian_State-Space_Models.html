The approximate Variational Bayesian method applied to these models is an attractive approach, used successfully in applications ranging from acoustics to bioinformatics. The most challenging aspect of implementing the method is in performing inference on the hidden state sequence of the model. We show how to convert the inference problem so that standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions from the literature may be applied. This is in contrast to previously published approaches based on Belief Propagation. Our framework both simpliﬁes and uniﬁes the inference problem, so that future applications may be more easily developed. We demonstrate the elegance of the approach on Bayesian temporal ICA, with an application to ﬁnding independent dynamical processes underlying noisy EEG signals. 1 Linear Gaussian State-Space Models Linear Gaussian State-Space Models (LGSSMs)1 are fundamental in time-series analysis [1, 2, 3]. In these models the observations v1:T 2 are generated from an underlying dynamical system on h1:T according to: v v vt = Bht + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0V , ΣV ), h h ht = Aht−1 + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0H , ΣH ) , where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian with mean µ and covariance Σ, and 0X denotes an Xdimensional zero vector. The observation vt has dimension V and the hidden state ht has dimension H. Probabilistically, the LGSSM is deﬁned by: T p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ) = p(v1 |h1 )p(h1 ) p(vt |ht )p(ht |ht−1 ), t=2 with p(vt |ht ) = N (Bht , ΣV ), p(ht |ht−1 ) = N (Aht−1 , ΣH ), p(h1 ) = N (µ, Σ) and where Θ = {A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ} denotes the model parameters. Because of the widespread use of these models, a Bayesian treatment of parameters is of considerable interest [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. An exact implementation of the Bayesian LGSSM is formally intractable [8], and recently a Variational Bayesian (VB) approximation has been studied [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]. The most challenging part of implementing the VB method is performing inference over h1:T , and previous authors have developed their own specialized routines, based on Belief Propagation, since standard LGSSM inference routines appear, at ﬁrst sight, not to be applicable. 1 2 Also called Kalman Filters/Smoothers, Linear Dynamical Systems. v1:T denotes v1 , . . . , vT . A key contribution of this paper is to show how the Variational Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM can be implemented using standard LGSSM inference routines. Based on the insight we provide, any standard inference method may be applied, including those speciﬁcally addressed to improve numerical stability [2, 10, 11]. In this article, we decided to describe the predictor-corrector and Rauch-Tung-Striebel recursions [2], and also suggest a small modiﬁcation that reduces computational cost. The Bayesian LGSSM is particularly of interest when strong prior constraints are needed to ﬁnd adequate solutions. One such case is in EEG signal analysis, whereby we wish to extract sources that evolve independently through time. Since EEG is particularly noisy [12], a prior that encourages sources to have preferential dynamics is advantageous. This application is discussed in Section 4, and demonstrates the ease of applying our VB framework. 2 Bayesian Linear Gaussian State-Space Models In the Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM, instead of considering the model parameters Θ as ﬁxed, ˆ ˆ we deﬁne a prior distribution p(Θ|Θ), where Θ is a set of hyperparameters. Then: ˆ p(v1:T |Θ) = ˆ p(v1:T |Θ)p(Θ|Θ) . (1) Θ In a full Bayesian treatment we would deﬁne additional prior distributions over the hyperparameters ˆ Θ. Here we take instead the ML-II (‘evidence’) framework, in which the optimal set of hyperpaˆ ˆ rameters is found by maximizing p(v1:T |Θ) with respect to Θ [6, 7, 9]. For the parameter priors, here we deﬁne Gaussians on the columns of A and B 3 : H e− p(A|α, ΣH ) ∝ αj 2 ˆ ( A j −A j ) T ˆ Σ−1 (Aj −Aj ) H H , e− p(B|β, ΣV ) ∝ j=1 βj 2 T ˆ (Bj −Bj ) ˆ Σ−1 (Bj −Bj ) V , j=1 ˆ ˆ which has the effect of biasing the transition and emission matrices to desired forms A and B. The −1 −1 4 conjugate priors for general inverse covariances ΣH and ΣV are Wishart distributions [7] . In the simpler case assumed here of diagonal covariances these become Gamma distributions [5, 7]. The ˆ hyperparameters are then Θ = {α, β}5 . Variational Bayes ˆ Optimizing Eq. (1) with respect to Θ is difﬁcult due to the intractability of the integrals. Instead, in VB, one considers the lower bound [6, 7, 9]6 : ˆ ˆ L = log p(v1:T |Θ) ≥ Hq (Θ, h1:T ) + log p(Θ|Θ) q(Θ) + E(h1:T , Θ) q(Θ,h1:T ) ≡ F, where E(h1:T , Θ) ≡ log p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ). Hd (x) signiﬁes the entropy of the distribution d(x), and · d(x) denotes the expectation operator. The key approximation in VB is q(Θ, h1:T ) ≡ q(Θ)q(h1:T ), from which one may show that, for optimality of F, ˆ E(h1:T ,Θ) q(h1:T ) . q(h1:T ) ∝ e E(h1:T ,Θ) q(Θ) , q(Θ) ∝ p(Θ|Θ)e These coupled equations need to be iterated to convergence. The updates for the parameters q(Θ) are straightforward and are given in Appendices A and B. Once converged, the hyperparameters are ˆ updated by maximizing F with respect to Θ, which lead to simple update formulae [7]. Our main concern is with the update for q(h1:T ), for which this paper makes a departure from treatments previously presented. 3 More general Gaussian priors may be more suitable depending on the application. For expositional simplicity, we do not put priors on µ and Σ. 5 For simplicity, we keep the parameters of the Gamma priors ﬁxed. 6 Strictly we should write throughout q(·|v1:T ). We omit the dependence on v1:T for notational convenience. 4 Uniﬁed Inference on q(h1:T ) 3 Optimally q(h1:T ) is Gaussian since, up to a constant, E(h1:T , Θ) − 1 2 q(Θ) is quadratic in h1:T 7 : T T (vt −Bht )T Σ−1 (vt −Bht ) V q(B,ΣV ) + (ht −Aht−1 ) Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H t=1 q(A,ΣH ) . (2) In addition, optimally, q(A|ΣH ) and q(B|ΣV ) are Gaussians (see Appendix A), so we can easily carry out the averages in Eq. (2). The further averages over q(ΣH ) and q(ΣV ) are also easy due to conjugacy. Whilst this deﬁnes the distribution q(h1:T ), quantities such as q(ht ), required for example for the parameter updates (see the Appendices), need to be inferred from this distribution. Clearly, in the non-Bayesian case, the averages over the parameters are not present, and the above simply represents the posterior distribution of an LGSSM whose visible variables have been clamped into their evidential states. In that case, inference can be performed using any standard LGSSM routine. Our aim, therefore, is to try to represent the averaged Eq. (2) directly as the posterior distribution q (h1:T |˜1:T ) of an LGSSM , for some suitable parameter settings. ˜ v Mean + Fluctuation Decomposition A useful decomposition is to write (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT SB ht , t V q(B,ΣV ) f luctuation mean and similarly (ht −Aht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H = (ht − A ht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht − A ht−1 ) +hT SA ht−1 , t−1 H q(A,ΣH ) mean f luctuation T −1 where the parameter covariances are SB ≡ B T Σ−1 B − B Σ−1 B = V HB and SA ≡ V V T −1 −1 −1 AT ΣH A − A ΣH A = HHA (for HA and HB deﬁned in Appendix A). The mean terms simply represent a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. However, the extra contributions from the ﬂuctuations mean that Eq. (2) cannot be written as a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. In order to deal with these extra terms, our idea is to treat the ﬂuctuations as arising from an augmented visible variable, for which Eq. (2) can then be considered as a clamped LGSSM. Inference Using an Augmented LGSSM To represent Eq. (2) as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), we may augment vt and B as8 : ˜ v vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0H ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UB ), T where UA is the Cholesky decomposition of SA , so that UA UA = SA . Similarly, UB is the Cholesky decomposition of SB . The equivalent LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is then completed by specifying9 ˜ v ˜ A≡ A , ˜ ΣH ≡ Σ−1 H −1 , ˜ ΣV ≡ diag( Σ−1 V −1 , IH , IH ), µ ≡ µ, ˜ ˜ Σ ≡ Σ. The validity of this parameter assignment can be checked by showing that, up to negligible constants, the exponent of this augmented LGSSM has the same form as Eq. (2)10 . Now that this has been written as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), standard inference routines in the literature may be applied to ˜ v compute q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) [1, 2, 11]11 . ˜ v 7 For simplicity of exposition, we ignore the ﬁrst time-point here. The notation vert(x1 , . . . , xn ) stands for vertically concatenating the arguments x1 , . . . , xn . 9 ˜ ˜ ˜ Strictly, we need a time-dependent emission Bt = B, for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. For time T , BT has the Cholesky factor UA replaced by 0H,H . 10 There are several ways of achieving a similar augmentation. We chose this since, in the non-Bayesian limit UA = UB = 0H,H , no numerical instabilities would be introduced. 11 Note that, since the augmented LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is designed to match the fully clamped distribution ˜ v q(h1:T |v1:T ), the ﬁltered posterior q (ht |˜1:t ) does not correspond to q(ht |v1:t ). ˜ v 8 Algorithm 1 LGSSM: Forward and backward recursive updates.

These are given in Algorithm 1, where q (ht |˜1:T ) is computed by calling the FORWARD and BACKWARD procedures. ˜ v We present two variants of the FORWARD pass. Either we may call procedure FORWARD in ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Algorithm 1 with parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ and the augmented visible variables vt in which ˜ we use steps 1a, 2a, 5a and 6a. This is exactly the predictor-corrector form of a Kalman Filter [2]. Otherwise, in order to reduce the computational cost, we may call procedure FORWARD with the −1 ˜ ˜ parameters A, B , ΣH , Σ−1 , µ, Σ and the original visible variable vt in which we use steps ˜ ˜ V T 1b (where UAB UAB ≡ SA +SB ), 2b, 5b and 6b. The two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Computing q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) is then completed by calling the common BACKWARD pass. ˜ v The important point here is that the reader may supply any standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing routine, and simply call it with the appropriate parameters. In some parameter regimes, or in very long time-series, numerical stability may be a serious concern, for which several stabilized algorithms have been developed over the years, for example the square-root forms [2, 10, 11]. By converting the problem to a standard form, we have therefore uniﬁed and simpliﬁed inference, so that future applications may be more readily developed12 . 3.1 Relation to Previous Approaches An alternative approach to the one above, and taken in [5, 7], is to write the posterior as T log q(h1:T ) = φt (ht−1 , ht ) + const. t=2 for suitably deﬁned quadratic forms φt (ht−1 , ht ). Here the potentials φt (ht−1 , ht ) encode the averaging over the parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV . The approach taken in [7] is to recognize this as a 12 The computation of the log-likelihood bound does not require any augmentation. pairwise Markov chain, for which the Belief Propagation recursions may be applied. The approach in [5] is based on a Kullback-Leibler minimization of the posterior with a chain structure, which is algorithmically equivalent to Belief Propagation. Whilst mathematically valid procedures, the resulting algorithms do not correspond to any of the standard forms in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, whose properties have been well studied [14]. 4 An Application to Bayesian ICA A particular case for which the Bayesian LGSSM is of interest is in extracting independent source signals underlying a multivariate timeseries [5, 15]. This will demonstrate how the approach developed in Section 3 makes VB easily to apply. The sources si are modeled as independent in the following sense: p(si , sj ) = p(si )p(sj ), 1:T 1:T 1:T 1:T for i = j, i, j = 1, . . . , C. Independence implies block diagonal transition and state noise matrices A, ΣH and Σ, where each block c has dimension Hc . A one dimensional source sc for each independent dynamical subsystem is then t formed from sc = 1T hc , where 1c is a unit vector and hc is the state of t c t t dynamical system c. Combining the sources, we can write st = P ht , where P = diag(1T , . . . , 1T ), ht = vert(h1 , . . . , hC ). The resulting 1 C t t emission matrix is constrained to be of the form B = W P , where W is the V × C mixing matrix. This means that the observations v are formed from linearly mixing the sources, vt = W st + ηt . The Figure 1: The structure of graphical structure of this model is presented in Fig 1. To encourage redundant components to be removed, we place a zero mean Gaussian the LGSSM for ICA. prior on W . In this case, we do not deﬁne a prior for the parameters ΣH and ΣV which are instead considered as hyperparameters. More details of the model are given in [15]. The constraint B = W P requires a minor modiﬁcation from Section 3, as we discuss below. Inference on q(h1:T ) A small modiﬁcation of the mean + ﬂuctuation decomposition for B occurs, namely: (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V q(W ) = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT P T SW P ht , t V −1 where B ≡ W P and SW = V HW . The quantities W and HW are obtained as in Appendix A.1 with the replacement ht ← P ht . To represent the above as a LGSSM, we augment vt and B as vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0C ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UW P ), where UW is the Cholesky decomposition of SW . The equivalent LGSSM is then completed by ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ specifying A ≡ A , ΣH ≡ ΣH , ΣV ≡ diag(ΣV , IH , IC ), µ ≡ µ, Σ ≡ Σ, and inference for ˜ q(h1:T ) performed using Algorithm 1. This demonstrates the elegance and unity of the approach in Section 3, since no new algorithm needs to be developed to perform inference, even in this special constrained parameter case. 4.1 Demonstration As a simple demonstration, we used an LGSSM to generate 3 sources sc with random 5×5 transition t matrices Ac , µ = 0H and Σ ≡ ΣH ≡ IH . The sources were mixed into three observations v vt = W st + ηt , for W chosen with elements from a zero mean unit variance Gaussian distribution, and ΣV = IV . We then trained a Bayesian LGSSM with 5 sources and 7 × 7 transition matrices Ac . ˆ To bias the model to ﬁnd the simplest sources, we used Ac ≡ 0Hc ,Hc for all sources. In Fig2a and Fig 2b we see the original sources and the noisy observations respectively. In Fig2c we see the estimated sources from our method after convergence of the hyperparameter updates. Two of the 5 sources have been removed, and the remaining three are a reasonable estimation of the original sources. Another possible approach for introducing prior knowledge is to use a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 (a) 150 200 250 300 0 50 (b) 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 (c) 100 150 200 250 300 (d) Figure 2: (a) Original sources st .

However, it is not clear how to reliably ﬁnd the hyperparameters α and β in this case. One solution is to estimate them by optimizing the new objective function jointly with respect to the parameters and hyperparameters (this is the so-called joint map estimation – see for example [16]). A typical result of using this joint MAP approach on the artiﬁcial data is presented in Fig 2d. The joint MAP does not estimate the hyperparameters well, and the incorrect number of sources is identiﬁed. 4.2 Application to EEG Analysis In Fig 3a we plot three seconds of EEG data recorded from 4 channels (located in the right hemisphere) while a person is performing imagined movement of the right hand. As is typical in EEG, each channel shows drift terms below 1 Hz which correspond to artifacts of the instrumentation, together with the presence of 50 Hz mains contamination and masks the rhythmical activity related to the mental task, mainly centered at 10 and 20 Hz [17]. We would therefore like a method which enables us to extract components in these information-rich 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands. Standard ICA methods such as FastICA do not ﬁnd satisfactory sources based on raw ‘noisy’ data, and preprocessing with band-pass ﬁlters is usually required. Additionally, in EEG research, ﬂexibility in the number of recovered sources is important since there may be many independent oscillators of interest underlying the observations and we would like some way to automatically determine their effective number. To preferentially ﬁnd sources at particular frequencies, we speciﬁed a block ˆ diagonal matrix Ac for each source c, where each block is a 2 × 2 rotation matrix at the desired frequency. We deﬁned the following 16 groups of frequencies: [0.5], [0.5], [0.5], [0.5]; [10,11], [10,11], [10,11], [10,11]; [20,21], [20,21], [20,21], [20,21]; [50], [50], [50], [50]. The temporal evolution of the sources obtained after training the Bayesian LGSSM is given in Fig3(b,c,d,e) (grouped by frequency range). The Bayes LGSSM removed 4 unnecessary sources from the mixing matrix W , that is one [10,11] Hz and three [20,21] Hz sources. The ﬁrst 4 sources contain dominant low frequency drift, sources 5, 6 and 8 contain [10,11] Hz, while source 10 contains [20,21] Hz centered activity. Of the 4 sources initialized to 50 Hz, only 2 retained 50 Hz activity, while the Ac of the other two have changed to model other frequencies present in the EEG. This method demonstrates the usefulness and applicability of the VB method in a real-world situation. 5 Conclusion We considered the application of Variational Bayesian learning to Linear Gaussian State-Space Models. This is an important class of models with widespread application, and ﬁnding a simple way to implement this approximate Bayesian procedure is of considerable interest. The most demanding part of the procedure is inference of the hidden states of the model. Previously, this has been achieved using Belief Propagation, which differs from inference in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, for which highly efﬁcient and stabilized procedures exist. A central contribution of this paper is to show how inference can be written using the standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions by augmenting the original model. Additionally, a minor modiﬁcation to the standard Kalman Filtering routine may be applied for computational efﬁciency. We demonstrated the elegance and unity of our approach by showing how to easily apply a Variational Bayes analysis of temporal ICA. Speciﬁcally, our Bayes ICA approach successfully extracts independent processes underlying EEG signals, biased towards preferred frequency ranges. We hope that this simple and unifying interpretation of Variational Bayesian LGSSMs may therefore facilitate the further application to related models. A A.1 Parameter Updates for A and B Determining q(B|ΣV ) By examining F, the contribution of q(B|ΣV ) can be interpreted as the negative KL divergence between q(B|ΣV ) and a Gaussian. Hence, optimally, q(B|ΣV ) is a Gaussian. The covariance [ΣB ]ij,kl ≡ Bij − Bij Bkl − Bkl (averages wrt q(B|ΣV )) is given by: T hj hl t t −1 [ΣB ]ij,kl = [HB ]jl [ΣV ]ik , where [HB ]jl ≡ t=1 −1 The mean is given by B = NB HB , where [NB ]ij ≡ T t=1 hj t q(ht ) q(ht ) + βj δjl . i ˆ vt + βj Bij .

Covariance Updates By specifying a Wishart prior for the inverse of the covariances, conjugate update formulae are possible. In practice, it is more common to specify diagonal inverse covariances, for which the corresponding priors are simply Gamma distributions [7, 5]. For this simple diagonal case, the explicit updates are given below. Determining q(ΣV ) For the constraint Σ−1 = diag(ρ), where each diagonal element follows a Gamma prior V Ga(b1 , b2 ) [7], q(ρ) factorizes and the optimal updates are  q(ρi ) = Ga b1 + where GB ≡ −1 T NB HB NB .   T T 1 i , b2 +  (vt )2 − [GB ]ii + 2 2 t=1 j ˆ2 βj Bij  , Determining q(ΣH ) Analogously, for Σ−1 = diag(τ ) with prior Ga(a1 , a2 ) [5], the updates are H    T T −1 1 ˆij , a2 + (hi )2 − [GA ]ii + αj A2  , q(τi ) = Ga a1 + t 2 2 t=2 j −1 T where GA ≡ NA HA NA .

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efﬁcient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also conﬁrm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.</p><p>3 0.25336778 <a title="167-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>4 0.23153925 <a title="167-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Emergence_of_conjunctive_visual_features_by_quadratic_independent_component_analysis.html">76 nips-2006-Emergence of conjunctive visual features by quadratic independent component analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: J.t. Lindgren, Aapo Hyvärinen</p><p>Abstract: In previous studies, quadratic modelling of natural images has resulted in cell models that react strongly to edges and bars. Here we apply quadratic Independent Component Analysis to natural image patches, and show that up to a small approximation error, the estimated components are computing conjunctions of two linear features. These conjunctive features appear to represent not only edges and bars, but also inherently two-dimensional stimuli, such as corners. In addition, we show that for many of the components, the underlying linear features have essentially V1 simple cell receptive ﬁeld characteristics. Our results indicate that the development of the V2 cells preferring angles and corners may be partly explainable by the principle of unsupervised sparse coding of natural images. 1</p><p>5 0.18642035 <a title="167-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms.html">75 nips-2006-Efficient sparse coding algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Alexis Battle, Rajat Raina, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for ﬁnding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, ﬁnding sparse codes remains a very difﬁcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efﬁcient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1 -regularized least squares problem and an L2 -constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a signiﬁcant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive ﬁeld surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1</p><p>6 0.16012056 <a title="167-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Human_Motion_Using_Binary_Latent_Variables.html">134 nips-2006-Modeling Human Motion Using Binary Latent Variables</a></p>

<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model ﬁnds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during motion capture.

<p>Author: Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N (100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of signiﬁcance α = 1 − ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the inﬂuence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efﬁciently detect outliers at a given level of signiﬁcance and compute their empirical p-values. We illustrate GEM for several simulated and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces. 1</p><p>3 0.80122149 <a title="167-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Nonnegative_Sparse_PCA.html">149 nips-2006-Nonnegative Sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Zass, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: We describe a nonnegative variant of the ”Sparse PCA” problem. The goal is to create a low dimensional representation from a collection of points which on the one hand maximizes the variance of the projected points and on the other uses only parts of the original coordinates, and thereby creating a sparse representation. What distinguishes our problem from other Sparse PCA formulations is that the projection involves only nonnegative weights of the original coordinates — a desired quality in various ﬁelds, including economics, bioinformatics and computer vision. Adding nonnegativity contributes to sparseness, where it enforces a partitioning of the original coordinates among the new axes. We describe a simple yet efﬁcient iterative coordinate-descent type of scheme which converges to a local optimum of our optimization criteria, giving good results on large real world datasets. 1</p><p>4 0.74933439 <a title="167-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>5 0.69861537 <a title="167-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-A_Complexity-Distortion_Approach_to_Joint_Pattern_Alignment.html">3 nips-2006-A Complexity-Distortion Approach to Joint Pattern Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Vedaldi, Stefano Soatto</p><p>Abstract: Image Congealing (IC) is a non-parametric method for the joint alignment of a collection of images affected by systematic and unwanted deformations. The method attempts to undo the deformations by minimizing a measure of complexity of the image ensemble, such as the averaged per-pixel entropy. This enables alignment without an explicit model of the aligned dataset as required by other methods (e.g. transformed component analysis). While IC is simple and general, it may introduce degenerate solutions when the transformations allow minimizing the complexity of the data by collapsing them to a constant. Such solutions need to be explicitly removed by regularization. In this paper we propose an alternative formulation which solves this regularization issue on a more principled ground. We make the simple observation that alignment should simplify the data while preserving the useful information carried by them. Therefore we trade off ﬁdelity and complexity of the aligned ensemble rather than minimizing the complexity alone. This eliminates the need for an explicit regularization of the transformations, and has a number of other useful properties such as noise suppression. We show the modeling and computational beneﬁts of the approach to the some of the problems on which IC has been demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.69045913 <a title="167-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Denoising_and_Dimension_Reduction_in_Feature_Space.html">65 nips-2006-Denoising and Dimension Reduction in Feature Space</a></p>

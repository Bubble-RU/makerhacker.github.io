<p>Author: Chaitanya Chemudugunta, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: Techniques such as probabilistic topic models and latent-semantic indexing have been shown to be broadly useful at automatically extracting the topical or semantic content of documents, or more generally for dimension-reduction of sparse count data. These types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an abstraction from the words in a document to a lower-dimensional latent variable representation that captures what the document is generally about beyond the speciﬁc words it contains. In this paper we propose a new probabilistic model that tempers this approach by representing each document as a combination of (a) a background distribution over common words, (b) a mixture distribution over general topics, and (c) a distribution over words that are treated as being speciﬁc to that document. We illustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval by matching documents both at a general topic level and at a speciﬁc word level, providing an advantage over techniques that only match documents at a general level (such as topic models or latent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the speciﬁc word level (such as TF-IDF). 1 Introduction and Motivation Reducing high-dimensional data vectors to robust and interpretable lower-dimensional representations has a long and successful history in data analysis, including recent innovations such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al, 1994) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003). These types of techniques have found broad application in modeling of sparse high-dimensional count data such as the “bag of words” representations for documents or transaction data for Web and retail applications. Approaches such as LSI and LDA have both been shown to be useful for “object matching” in their respective latent spaces. In information retrieval for example, both a query and a set of documents can be represented in the LSI or topic latent spaces, and the documents can be ranked in terms of how well they match the query based on distance or similarity in the latent space. The mapping to latent space represents a generalization or abstraction away from the sparse set of observed words, to a “higher-level” semantic representation in the latent space. These abstractions in principle lead to better generalization on new data compared to inferences carried out directly in the original sparse high-dimensional space. The capability of these models to provide improved generalization has been demonstrated empirically in a number of studies (e.g., Deerwester et al 1994; Hofmann 1999; Canny 2004; Buntine et al, 2005). However, while this type of generalization is broadly useful in terms of inference and prediction, there are situations where one can over-generalize. Consider trying to match the following query to a historical archive of news articles: election + campaign + Camejo. The query is intended to ﬁnd documents that are about US presidential campaigns and also about Peter Camejo (who ran as vice-presidential candidate alongside independent Ralph Nader in 2004). LSI and topic models are likely to highly rank articles that are related to presidential elections (even if they don’t necessarily contain the words election or campaign). However, a potential problem is that the documents that are highly ranked by LSI or topic models need not include any mention of the name Camejo. The reason is that the combination of words in this query is likely to activate one or more latent variables related to the concept of presidential campaigns. However, once this generalization is made the model has “lost” the information about the speciﬁc word Camejo and it will only show up in highly ranked documents if this word happens to frequently occur in these topics (unlikely in this case given that this candidate received relatively little media coverage compared to the coverage given to the candidates from the two main parties). But from the viewpoint of the original query, our preference would be to get documents that are about the general topic of US presidential elections with the speciﬁc constraint that they mention Peter Camejo. Word-based retrieval techniques, such as the widely-used term-frequency inverse-documentfrequency (TF-IDF) method, have the opposite problem in general. They tend to be overly speciﬁc in terms of matching words in the query to documents. In general of course one would like to have a balance between generality and speciﬁcity. One ad hoc approach is to combine scores from a general method such as LSI with those from a more speciﬁc method such as TF-IDF in some manner, and indeed this technique has been proposed in information retrieval (Vogt and Cottrell, 1999). Similarly, in the ad hoc LDA approach (Wei and Croft, 2006), the LDA model is linearly combined with document-speciﬁc word distributions to capture both general as well as speciﬁc information in documents. However, neither method is entirely satisfactory since it is not clear how to trade-off generality and speciﬁcity in a principled way. The contribution of this paper is a new graphical model based on latent topics that handles the tradeoff between generality and speciﬁcity in a fully probabilistic and automated manner. The model, which we call the special words with background (SWB) model, is an extension of the LDA model. The new model allows words in documents to be modeled as either originating from general topics, or from document-speciﬁc “special” word distributions, or from a corpus-wide background distribution. The idea is that words in a document such as election and campaign are likely to come from a general topic on presidential elections, whereas a name such as Camejo is much more likely to be treated as “non-topical” and speciﬁc to that document. Words in queries are automatically interpreted (in a probabilistic manner) as either being topical or special, in the context of each document, allowing for a data-driven document-speciﬁc trade-off between the beneﬁts of topic-based abstraction and speciﬁc word matching. Daum´ and Marcu (2006) independently proposed a probabilistic e model using similar concepts for handling different training and test distributions in classiﬁcation problems. Although we have focused primarily on documents in information retrieval in the discussion above, the model we propose can in principle be used on any large sparse matrix of count data. For example, transaction data sets where rows are individuals and columns correspond to items purchased or Web sites visited are ideally suited to this approach. The latent topics can capture broad patterns of population behavior and the “special word distributions” can capture the idiosyncracies of speciﬁc individuals. Section 2 reviews the basic principles of the LDA model and introduces the new SWB model. Section 3 illustrates how the model works in practice using examples from New York Times news articles. In Section 4 we describe a number of experiments with 4 different document sets, including perplexity experiments and information retrieval experiments, illustrating the trade-offs between generalization and speciﬁcity for different models. Section 5 contains a brief discussion and concluding comments. 2 A Topic Model for Special Words Figure 1(a) shows the graphical model for what we will refer to as the “standard topic model” or LDA. There are D documents and document d has Nd words. α and β are ﬁxed parameters of symmetric Dirichlet priors for the D document-topic multinomials represented by θ and the T topicword multinomials represented by φ. In the generative model, for each document d, the Nd words (a) β2 β1 α γ Ω ψ θ λ β0 z x φ w (b) α θ β z φ w Nd T T D Nd D Figure 1: Graphical models for (a) the standard LDA topic model (left) and (b) the proposed special words topic model with a background distribution (SWB) (right). are generated by drawing a topic t from the document-topic distribution p(z|θd ) and then drawing a word w from the topic-word distribution p(w|z = t, φt ). As shown in Grifﬁths and Steyvers (2004) the topic assignments z for each word token in the corpus can be efﬁciently sampled via Gibbs sampling (after marginalizing over θ and φ). Point estimates for the θ and φ distributions can be computed conditioned on a particular sample, and predictive distributions can be obtained by averaging over multiple samples. We will refer to the proposed model as the special words topic model with background distribution (SWB) (Figure 1(b)). SWB has a similar general structure to the LDA model (Figure 1(a)) but with additional machinery to handle special words and background words. In particular, associated with each word token is a latent random variable x, taking value x = 0 if the word w is generated via the topic route, value x = 1 if the word is generated as a special word (for that document) and value x = 2 if the word is generated from a background distribution speciﬁc for the corpus. The variable x acts as a switch: if x = 0, the previously described standard topic mechanism is used to generate the word, whereas if x = 1 or x = 2, words are sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial Ψ or a corpus speciﬁc multinomial Ω (with symmetric Dirichlet priors parametrized by β1 and β2 ) respectively. x is sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial λ, which in turn has a symmetric Dirichlet prior, γ. One could also use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to introduce another level of uncertainty about the Dirichlet priors (e.g., see Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003)—we have not investigated this option, primarily for computational reasons. In all our experiments, we set α = 0.1, β0 = β2 = 0.01, β1 = 0.0001 and γ = 0.3—all weak symmetric priors. The conditional probability of a word w given a document d can be written as: T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w) p(w|d) = p(x = 0|d) t=1 ′ where p (w|d) is the special word distribution for document d, and p′′ (w) is the background word distribution for the corpus. Note that when compared to the standard topic model the SWB model can explain words in three different ways, via topics, via a special word distribution, or via a background word distribution. Given the graphical model above, it is relatively straightforward to derive Gibbs sampling equations that allow joint sampling of the zi and xi latent variables for each word token wi , for xi = 0: p (xi = 0, zi = t |w, x−i , z−i , α, β0 , γ ) ∝ Nd0,−i + γ × Nd,−i + 3γ TD Ctd,−i + α t′ TD Ct′ d,−i + T α × WT Cwt,−i + β0 WT w ′ Cw ′ t,−i + W β0 and for xi = 1: p (xi = 1 |w, x−i , z−i , β1 , γ ) ∝ Nd1,−i + γ × Nd,−i + 3γ WD Cwd,−i + β1 w′ WD Cw′ d,−i + W β1 e mail krugman nytimes com memo to critics of the media s liberal bias the pinkos you really should be going after are those business reporters even i was startled by the tone of the jan 21 issue of investment news which describes itself as the weekly newspaper for financial advisers the headline was paul o neill s sweet deal the blurb was irs backs off closing loophole averting tax liability for execs and treasury chief it s not really news that the bush administration likes tax breaks for businessmen but two weeks later i learned from the wall street journal that this loophole is more than a tax break for businessmen it s a gift to biznesmen and it may be part of a larger pattern confused in the former soviet union the term biznesmen pronounced beeznessmen refers to the class of sudden new rich who emerged after the fall of communism and who generally got rich by using their connections to strip away the assets of public enterprises what we ve learned from enron and other players to be named later is that america has its own biznesmen and that we need to watch out for policies that make it easier for them to ply their trade it turns out that the sweet deal investment news was referring to the use of split premium life insurance policies to give executives largely tax free compensation you don t want to know the details is an even sweeter deal for executives of companies that go belly up it shields their wealth from creditors and even from lawsuits sure enough reports the wall street journal former enron c e o s kenneth lay and jeffrey skilling both had large split premium policies so what other pro biznes policies have been promulgated lately last year both houses of … john w snow was paid more than 50 million in salary bonus and stock in his nearly 12 years as chairman of the csx corporation the railroad company during that period the company s profits fell and its stock rose a bit more than half as much as that of the average big company mr snow s compensation amid csx s uneven performance has drawn criticism from union officials and some corporate governance specialists in 2000 for example after the stock had plunged csx decided to reverse a 25 million loan to him the move is likely to get more scrutiny after yesterday s announcement that mr snow has been chosen by president bush to replace paul o neill as the treasury secretary like mr o neill mr snow is an outsider on wall street but an insider in corporate america with long experience running an industrial company some wall street analysts who follow csx said yesterday that mr snow had ably led the company through a difficult period in the railroad industry and would make a good treasury secretary it s an excellent nomination said jill evans an analyst at j p morgan who has a neutral rating on csx stock i think john s a great person for the administration he as the c e o of a railroad has probably touched every sector of the economy union officials are less complimentary of mr snow s performance at csx last year the a f l c i o criticized him and csx for the company s decision to reverse the loan allowing him to return stock he had purchased with the borrowed money at a time when independent directors are in demand a corporate governance specialist said recently that mr snow had more business relationships with members of his own board than any other chief executive in addition mr snow is the third highest paid of 37 chief executives of transportation companies said ric marshall chief executive of the corporate library which provides specialized investment research into corporate boards his own compensation levels have been pretty high mr marshall said he could afford to take a public service job a csx program in 1996 allowed mr snow and other top csx executives to buy… Figure 2: Examples of two news articles with special words (as inferred by the model) shaded in gray.

Note that when there is not strong supporting evidence for xi = 0 (i.e., the conditional probability of this event is low), then the probability of the word being generated by the special words route, xi = 1, or background route, xi = 2 increases. One iteration of the Gibbs sampler corresponds to a sampling pass through all word tokens in the corpus. In practice we have found that around 500 iterations are often sufﬁcient for the in-sample perplexity (or log-likelihood) and the topic distributions to stabilize. We also pursued a variant of SWB, the special words (SW) model that excludes the background distribution Ω and has a symmetric Beta prior, γ, on λ (which in SW is a document-speciﬁc Bernoulli distribution). In all our SW model runs, we set γ = 0.5 resulting in a weak symmetric prior that is equivalent to adding one pseudo-word to each document. Experimental results (not shown) indicate that the ﬁnal word-topic assignments are not sensitive to either the value of the prior or the initial assignments to the latent variables, x and z. 3 Illustrative Examples We illustrate the operation of the SW model with a data set consisting of 3104 articles from the New York Times (NYT) with a total of 1,399,488 word tokens. This small set of NYT articles was formed by selecting all NYT articles that mention the word “Enron.” The SW topic model was run with T = 100 topics. In total, 10 Gibbs samples were collected from the model. Figure 2 shows two short fragments of articles from this NYT dataset. The background color of words indicates the probability of assigning words to the special words topic—darker colors are associated with higher probability that over the 10 Gibbs samples a word was assigned to the special topic. The words with gray foreground colors were treated as stopwords and were not included in the analysis.

Figure 2(b) shows how a last name such as “Snow” and the corporation name “CSX” that are speciﬁc to the document are likely to be assigned to the special topic. The words “Snow” and “CSX” do not occur often in other documents but are mentioned several times in the example document. This combination of low document-frequency and high term-frequency within the document is one factor that makes these words more likely to be treated as “special” words. 4 Experimental Results: Perplexity and Precision We use 4 different document sets in our experiments, as summarized in Table 1. The NIPS and PATENTS document sets are used for perplexity experiments and the AP and FR data sets for retrieval experiments. The NIPS data set is available online1 and PATENTS, AP, and FR consist of documents from the U.S. Patents collection (TREC Vol-3), Associated Press news articles from 1998 (TREC Vol-2), and articles from the Federal Register (TREC Vol-1, 2) respectively. To create the sampled AP and FR data sets, all documents relevant to queries were included ﬁrst and the rest of the documents were chosen randomly. In the results below all LDA/SWB/SW models were ﬁt using T = 200 topics. Figure 3 demonstrates the background component learned by the SWB model on the 4 different document data sets. The background distributions learned for each set of documents are quite intuitive, with words that are commonly used across a broad range of documents within each corpus. The ratio of words assigned to the special words distribution and the background distribution are (respectively for each data set), 25%:10% (NIPS), 58%:5% (PATENTS), 11%:6% (AP), 50%:11% (FR). Of note is the fact that a much larger fraction of words are treated as special in collections containing long documents (NIPS, PATENTS, and FR) than in short “abstract-like” collections (such as AP)—this makes sense since short documents are more likely to contain general summary information while longer documents will have more speciﬁc details. 4.1 Perplexity Comparisons The NIPS and PATENTS documents sets do not have queries and relevance judgments, but nonetheless are useful for evaluating perplexity. We compare the predictive performance of the SW and SWB topic models with the standard topic model by computing the perplexity of unseen words in test documents. Perplexity of a test set under a model is deﬁned as follows: 1 From http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜roweis/data.html 1900 550 LDA SW SWB 1800 500 1700 450 LDA SW SWB Perplexity Perplexity 1600 1500 1400 400 350 300 1300 250 1200 200 1100 1000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 150 10 90 20 Percentage of Words Observed 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Percentage of Words Observed Figure 4: Average perplexity of the two special words models and the standard topics model as a function of the percentage of words observed in test documents on the NIPS data set (left) and the PATENTS data set (right). Perplexity(wtest |Dtrain ) = exp − Dtest d=1 log p(wd |Dtrain ) Dtest d=1 Nd where wtest is a vector of words in the test data set, wd is a vector of words in document d of the test set, and Dtrain is the training set. For the SWB model, we approximate p(wd |Dtrain ) as follows: p(wd |Dtrain ) ≈ 1 S S p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) s=1 where Θs , Φs , Ψs , Ωs and λs are point estimates from s = 1:S different Gibbs sampling runs. The probability of the words wd in a test document d, given its parameters, can be computed as follows: Nd p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) = T s s φs i t θtd + λs ψwi d + λs Ωs i 3d w w 2d λs 1d i=1 t=1 where Nd is the number of words in test document d and wi is the ith word being predicted in the s s test document. θtd , φs i t , ψwi d , Ωs i and λs are point estimates from sample s. w w d When a fraction of words of a test document d is observed, a Gibbs sampler is run on the observed words to update the document-speciﬁc parameters, θd , ψd and λd and these updated parameters are used in the computation of perplexity. For the NIPS data set, documents from the last year of the data set were held out to compute perplexity (Dtest = 150), and for the PATENTS data set 500 documents were randomly selected as test documents. From the perplexity ﬁgures, it can be seen that once a small fraction of the test document words is observed (20% for NIPS and 10% for PATENTS), the SW and SWB models have signiﬁcantly lower perplexity values than LDA indicating that the SW and SWB models are using the special words “route” to better learn predictive models for individual documents. 4.2 Information Retrieval Results Returning to the point of capturing both speciﬁc and general aspects of documents as discussed in the introduction of the paper, we generated 500 queries of length 3-5 using randomly selected lowfrequency words from the NIPS corpus and then ranked documents relative to these queries using several different methods. Table 2 shows for the top k-ranked documents (k = 1, 10, 50, 100) how many of the retrieved documents contained at least one of the words in the query. Note that we are not assessing relevance here in a traditional information retrieval sense, but instead are assessing how Method TF-IDF LSI LDA SW SWB 1 Ret Doc 100.0 97.6 90.0 99.2 99.4 10 Ret Docs 100.0 82.7 80.6 97.1 96.6 50 Ret Docs 100.0 64.6 67.0 79.1 78.7 100 Ret Docs 100.0 54.3 58.7 67.3 67.2 Table 2: Percentage of retrieved documents containing at least one query word (NIPS corpus).

TF-IDF has 100% matches, as one would expect, and the techniques that generalize (such as LSI and LDA) have far fewer exact matches. The SWB and SW models have more speciﬁc matches than either LDA or LSI, indicating that they have the ability to match at the level of speciﬁc words. Of course this is not of much utility unless the SWB and SW models can also perform well in terms of retrieving relevant documents (not just documents containing the query words), which we investigate next. For the AP and FR documents sets, 3 types of query sets were constructed from TREC Topics 1150, based on the T itle (short), Desc (sentence-length) and Concepts (long list of keywords) ﬁelds. Queries that have no relevance judgments for a collection were removed from the query set for that collection. The score for a document d relative to a query q for the SW and standard topic models can be computed as the probability of q given d (known as the query-likelihood model in the IR community). For the SWB topic model, we have T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w)] [p(x = 0|d) p(q|d) ≈ w∈q t=1 We compare SW and SWB models with the standard topic model (LDA), LSI and TF-IDF. The TFCW D D wd IDF score for a word w in a document d is computed as TF-IDF(w, d) = Nd × log2 Dw . For LSI, the TF-IDF weight matrix is reduced to a K-dimensional latent space using SVD, K = 200. A given query is ﬁrst mapped into the LSI latent space or the TF-IDF space (known as query folding), and documents are scored based on their cosine distances to the mapped queries. To measure the performance of each algorithm we used 2 metrics that are widely used in IR research: the mean average precision (MAP) and the precision for the top 10 documents retrieved (pr@10d). The main difference between the AP and FR documents is that the latter documents are considerably longer on average and there are fewer queries for the FR data set. Figure 5 summarizes the results, broken down by algorithm, query type, document set, and metric. The maximum score for each query experiment is shown in bold: in all cases (query-type/data set/metric) the SW or SWB model produced the highest scores. To determine statistical signiﬁcance, we performed a t-test at the 0.05 level between the scores of each of the SW and SWB models, and the scores of the LDA model (as LDA has the best scores overall among TF-IDF, LSI and LDA). Differences between SW and SWB are not signiﬁcant. In ﬁgure 5, we use the symbol * to indicate scores where the SW and SWB models showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference (always an improvement) relative to the LDA model. The differences for the “non-starred” query and metric scores of SW and SWB are not statistically signiﬁcant but nonetheless always favor SW and SWB over LDA. 5 Discussion and Conclusions Wei and Croft (2006) have recently proposed an ad hoc LDA approach that models p(q|d) as a weighted combination of a multinomial over the entire corpus (the background model), a multinomial over the document, and an LDA model. Wei and Croft showed that this combination provides excellent retrieval performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods. In a number of experiments (not shown) comparing the SWB and ad hoc LDA models we found that the two techniques produced comparable precision performance, with small but systematic performance gains being achieved by an ad hoc combination where the standard LDA model in ad hoc LDA was replaced with the SWB model. An interesting direction for future work is to investigate fully generative models that can achieve the performance of ad hoc approaches. In conclusion, we have proposed a new probabilistic model that accounts for both general and speciﬁc aspects of documents or individual behavior. The model extends existing latent variable probabilistic approaches such as LDA by allowing these models to take into account speciﬁc aspects of documents (or individuals) that are exceptions to the broader structure of the data. This allows, for example, documents to be modeled as a mixture of words generated by general topics and words generated in a manner speciﬁc to that document. Experimental results on information retrieval tasks indicate that the SWB topic model does not suffer from the weakness of techniques such as LSI and LDA when faced with very speciﬁc query words, nor does it suffer the limitations of TF-IDF in terms of its ability to generalize.

<p>Author: Christopher J. Burges, Robert Ragno, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: The quality measures used in information retrieval are particularly difﬁcult to optimize directly, since they depend on the model scores only through the sorted order of the documents returned for a given query. Thus, the derivatives of the cost with respect to the model parameters are either zero, or are undeﬁned. In this paper, we propose a class of simple, ﬂexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difﬁculties by working with implicit cost functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the resulting implicit cost function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate signiﬁcantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for signiﬁcantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions. 1</p><p>4 0.13067266 <a title="166-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem.html">5 nips-2006-A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem</a></p>

Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose two statistical tests to determine if two samples are from different distributions. Our test statistic is in both cases the distance between the means of the two samples mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The ﬁrst test is based on a large deviation bound for the test statistic, while the second is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in O(m2 ) time. We apply our approach to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where our test performs strongly. We also demonstrate excellent performance when comparing distributions over graphs, for which no alternative tests currently exist.</p><p>5 0.12648506 <a title="166-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Stochastic_Relational_Models_for_Discriminative_Link_Prediction.html">183 nips-2006-Stochastic Relational Models for Discriminative Link Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp, Zhao Xu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) framework, stochastic relational models (SRM), for learning social, physical, and other relational phenomena where interactions between entities are observed. The key idea is to model the stochastic structure of entity relationships (i.e., links) via a tensor interaction of multiple GPs, each deﬁned on one type of entities. These models in fact deﬁne a set of nonparametric priors on inﬁnite dimensional tensor matrices, where each element represents a relationship between a tuple of entities. By maximizing the marginalized likelihood, information is exchanged between the participating GPs through the entire relational network, so that the dependency structure of links is messaged to the dependency of entities, reﬂected by the adapted GP kernels. The framework offers a discriminative approach to link prediction, namely, predicting the existences, strengths, or types of relationships based on the partially observed linkage network as well as the attributes of entities (if given). We discuss properties and variants of SRM and derive an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Very encouraging experimental results are achieved on a toy problem and a user-movie preference link prediction task. In the end we discuss extensions of SRM to general relational learning tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.10741958 <a title="166-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Relational_Learning_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">169 nips-2006-Relational Learning with Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Verma, Karl Pfleger, David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Clustering, or factoring of a document collection attempts to “explain” each observed document in terms of one or a small number of inferred prototypes. Prior work demonstrated that when links exist between documents in the corpus (as is the case with a collection of web pages or scientiﬁc papers), building a joint model of document contents and connections produces a better model than that built from contents or connections alone. Many problems arise when trying to apply these joint models to corpus at the scale of the World Wide Web, however; one of these is that the sheer overhead of representing a feature space on the order of billions of dimensions becomes impractical. We address this problem with a simple representational shift inspired by probabilistic relational models: instead of representing document linkage in terms of the identities of linking documents, we represent it by the explicit and inferred attributes of the linking documents. Several surprising results come with this shift: in addition to being computationally more tractable, the new model produces factors that more cleanly decompose the document collection. We discuss several variations on this model and show how some can be seen as exact generalizations of the PageRank algorithm. 1</p><p>2 0.82057846 <a title="166-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_General_and_Specific_Aspects_of_Documents_with_a_Probabilistic_Topic_Model.html">133 nips-2006-Modeling General and Specific Aspects of Documents with a Probabilistic Topic Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Chaitanya Chemudugunta, Padhraic Smyth, Mark Steyvers</p><p>Abstract: Techniques such as probabilistic topic models and latent-semantic indexing have been shown to be broadly useful at automatically extracting the topical or semantic content of documents, or more generally for dimension-reduction of sparse count data. These types of models and algorithms can be viewed as generating an abstraction from the words in a document to a lower-dimensional latent variable representation that captures what the document is generally about beyond the speciﬁc words it contains. In this paper we propose a new probabilistic model that tempers this approach by representing each document as a combination of (a) a background distribution over common words, (b) a mixture distribution over general topics, and (c) a distribution over words that are treated as being speciﬁc to that document. We illustrate how this model can be used for information retrieval by matching documents both at a general topic level and at a speciﬁc word level, providing an advantage over techniques that only match documents at a general level (such as topic models or latent-sematic indexing) or that only match documents at the speciﬁc word level (such as TF-IDF). 1 Introduction and Motivation Reducing high-dimensional data vectors to robust and interpretable lower-dimensional representations has a long and successful history in data analysis, including recent innovations such as latent semantic indexing (LSI) (Deerwester et al, 1994) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003). These types of techniques have found broad application in modeling of sparse high-dimensional count data such as the “bag of words” representations for documents or transaction data for Web and retail applications. Approaches such as LSI and LDA have both been shown to be useful for “object matching” in their respective latent spaces. In information retrieval for example, both a query and a set of documents can be represented in the LSI or topic latent spaces, and the documents can be ranked in terms of how well they match the query based on distance or similarity in the latent space. The mapping to latent space represents a generalization or abstraction away from the sparse set of observed words, to a “higher-level” semantic representation in the latent space. These abstractions in principle lead to better generalization on new data compared to inferences carried out directly in the original sparse high-dimensional space. The capability of these models to provide improved generalization has been demonstrated empirically in a number of studies (e.g., Deerwester et al 1994; Hofmann 1999; Canny 2004; Buntine et al, 2005). However, while this type of generalization is broadly useful in terms of inference and prediction, there are situations where one can over-generalize. Consider trying to match the following query to a historical archive of news articles: election + campaign + Camejo. The query is intended to ﬁnd documents that are about US presidential campaigns and also about Peter Camejo (who ran as vice-presidential candidate alongside independent Ralph Nader in 2004). LSI and topic models are likely to highly rank articles that are related to presidential elections (even if they don’t necessarily contain the words election or campaign). However, a potential problem is that the documents that are highly ranked by LSI or topic models need not include any mention of the name Camejo. The reason is that the combination of words in this query is likely to activate one or more latent variables related to the concept of presidential campaigns. However, once this generalization is made the model has “lost” the information about the speciﬁc word Camejo and it will only show up in highly ranked documents if this word happens to frequently occur in these topics (unlikely in this case given that this candidate received relatively little media coverage compared to the coverage given to the candidates from the two main parties). But from the viewpoint of the original query, our preference would be to get documents that are about the general topic of US presidential elections with the speciﬁc constraint that they mention Peter Camejo. Word-based retrieval techniques, such as the widely-used term-frequency inverse-documentfrequency (TF-IDF) method, have the opposite problem in general. They tend to be overly speciﬁc in terms of matching words in the query to documents. In general of course one would like to have a balance between generality and speciﬁcity. One ad hoc approach is to combine scores from a general method such as LSI with those from a more speciﬁc method such as TF-IDF in some manner, and indeed this technique has been proposed in information retrieval (Vogt and Cottrell, 1999). Similarly, in the ad hoc LDA approach (Wei and Croft, 2006), the LDA model is linearly combined with document-speciﬁc word distributions to capture both general as well as speciﬁc information in documents. However, neither method is entirely satisfactory since it is not clear how to trade-off generality and speciﬁcity in a principled way. The contribution of this paper is a new graphical model based on latent topics that handles the tradeoff between generality and speciﬁcity in a fully probabilistic and automated manner. The model, which we call the special words with background (SWB) model, is an extension of the LDA model. The new model allows words in documents to be modeled as either originating from general topics, or from document-speciﬁc “special” word distributions, or from a corpus-wide background distribution. The idea is that words in a document such as election and campaign are likely to come from a general topic on presidential elections, whereas a name such as Camejo is much more likely to be treated as “non-topical” and speciﬁc to that document. Words in queries are automatically interpreted (in a probabilistic manner) as either being topical or special, in the context of each document, allowing for a data-driven document-speciﬁc trade-off between the beneﬁts of topic-based abstraction and speciﬁc word matching. Daum´ and Marcu (2006) independently proposed a probabilistic e model using similar concepts for handling different training and test distributions in classiﬁcation problems. Although we have focused primarily on documents in information retrieval in the discussion above, the model we propose can in principle be used on any large sparse matrix of count data. For example, transaction data sets where rows are individuals and columns correspond to items purchased or Web sites visited are ideally suited to this approach. The latent topics can capture broad patterns of population behavior and the “special word distributions” can capture the idiosyncracies of speciﬁc individuals. Section 2 reviews the basic principles of the LDA model and introduces the new SWB model. Section 3 illustrates how the model works in practice using examples from New York Times news articles. In Section 4 we describe a number of experiments with 4 different document sets, including perplexity experiments and information retrieval experiments, illustrating the trade-offs between generalization and speciﬁcity for different models. Section 5 contains a brief discussion and concluding comments. 2 A Topic Model for Special Words Figure 1(a) shows the graphical model for what we will refer to as the “standard topic model” or LDA. There are D documents and document d has Nd words. α and β are ﬁxed parameters of symmetric Dirichlet priors for the D document-topic multinomials represented by θ and the T topicword multinomials represented by φ. In the generative model, for each document d, the Nd words (a) β2 β1 α γ Ω ψ θ λ β0 z x φ w (b) α θ β z φ w Nd T T D Nd D Figure 1: Graphical models for (a) the standard LDA topic model (left) and (b) the proposed special words topic model with a background distribution (SWB) (right). are generated by drawing a topic t from the document-topic distribution p(z|θd ) and then drawing a word w from the topic-word distribution p(w|z = t, φt ). As shown in Grifﬁths and Steyvers (2004) the topic assignments z for each word token in the corpus can be efﬁciently sampled via Gibbs sampling (after marginalizing over θ and φ). Point estimates for the θ and φ distributions can be computed conditioned on a particular sample, and predictive distributions can be obtained by averaging over multiple samples. We will refer to the proposed model as the special words topic model with background distribution (SWB) (Figure 1(b)). SWB has a similar general structure to the LDA model (Figure 1(a)) but with additional machinery to handle special words and background words. In particular, associated with each word token is a latent random variable x, taking value x = 0 if the word w is generated via the topic route, value x = 1 if the word is generated as a special word (for that document) and value x = 2 if the word is generated from a background distribution speciﬁc for the corpus. The variable x acts as a switch: if x = 0, the previously described standard topic mechanism is used to generate the word, whereas if x = 1 or x = 2, words are sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial Ψ or a corpus speciﬁc multinomial Ω (with symmetric Dirichlet priors parametrized by β1 and β2 ) respectively. x is sampled from a document-speciﬁc multinomial λ, which in turn has a symmetric Dirichlet prior, γ. One could also use a hierarchical Bayesian approach to introduce another level of uncertainty about the Dirichlet priors (e.g., see Blei, Ng, and Jordan, 2003)—we have not investigated this option, primarily for computational reasons. In all our experiments, we set α = 0.1, β0 = β2 = 0.01, β1 = 0.0001 and γ = 0.3—all weak symmetric priors. The conditional probability of a word w given a document d can be written as: T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w) p(w|d) = p(x = 0|d) t=1 ′ where p (w|d) is the special word distribution for document d, and p′′ (w) is the background word distribution for the corpus. Note that when compared to the standard topic model the SWB model can explain words in three different ways, via topics, via a special word distribution, or via a background word distribution.

Note that when there is not strong supporting evidence for xi = 0 (i.e., the conditional probability of this event is low), then the probability of the word being generated by the special words route, xi = 1, or background route, xi = 2 increases. One iteration of the Gibbs sampler corresponds to a sampling pass through all word tokens in the corpus. In practice we have found that around 500 iterations are often sufﬁcient for the in-sample perplexity (or log-likelihood) and the topic distributions to stabilize. We also pursued a variant of SWB, the special words (SW) model that excludes the background distribution Ω and has a symmetric Beta prior, γ, on λ (which in SW is a document-speciﬁc Bernoulli distribution). In all our SW model runs, we set γ = 0.5 resulting in a weak symmetric prior that is equivalent to adding one pseudo-word to each document. Experimental results (not shown) indicate that the ﬁnal word-topic assignments are not sensitive to either the value of the prior or the initial assignments to the latent variables, x and z. 3 Illustrative Examples We illustrate the operation of the SW model with a data set consisting of 3104 articles from the New York Times (NYT) with a total of 1,399,488 word tokens. This small set of NYT articles was formed by selecting all NYT articles that mention the word “Enron.” The SW topic model was run with T = 100 topics. In total, 10 Gibbs samples were collected from the model. Figure 2 shows two short fragments of articles from this NYT dataset. The background color of words indicates the probability of assigning words to the special words topic—darker colors are associated with higher probability that over the 10 Gibbs samples a word was assigned to the special topic. The words with gray foreground colors were treated as stopwords and were not included in the analysis.

Figure 2(b) shows how a last name such as “Snow” and the corporation name “CSX” that are speciﬁc to the document are likely to be assigned to the special topic. The words “Snow” and “CSX” do not occur often in other documents but are mentioned several times in the example document. This combination of low document-frequency and high term-frequency within the document is one factor that makes these words more likely to be treated as “special” words. 4 Experimental Results: Perplexity and Precision We use 4 different document sets in our experiments, as summarized in Table 1. The NIPS and PATENTS document sets are used for perplexity experiments and the AP and FR data sets for retrieval experiments. The NIPS data set is available online1 and PATENTS, AP, and FR consist of documents from the U.S. Patents collection (TREC Vol-3), Associated Press news articles from 1998 (TREC Vol-2), and articles from the Federal Register (TREC Vol-1, 2) respectively. To create the sampled AP and FR data sets, all documents relevant to queries were included ﬁrst and the rest of the documents were chosen randomly. In the results below all LDA/SWB/SW models were ﬁt using T = 200 topics. Figure 3 demonstrates the background component learned by the SWB model on the 4 different document data sets. The background distributions learned for each set of documents are quite intuitive, with words that are commonly used across a broad range of documents within each corpus. The ratio of words assigned to the special words distribution and the background distribution are (respectively for each data set), 25%:10% (NIPS), 58%:5% (PATENTS), 11%:6% (AP), 50%:11% (FR). Of note is the fact that a much larger fraction of words are treated as special in collections containing long documents (NIPS, PATENTS, and FR) than in short “abstract-like” collections (such as AP)—this makes sense since short documents are more likely to contain general summary information while longer documents will have more speciﬁc details. 4.1 Perplexity Comparisons The NIPS and PATENTS documents sets do not have queries and relevance judgments, but nonetheless are useful for evaluating perplexity. We compare the predictive performance of the SW and SWB topic models with the standard topic model by computing the perplexity of unseen words in test documents. Perplexity of a test set under a model is deﬁned as follows: 1 From http://www.cs.toronto.edu/˜roweis/data.html 1900 550 LDA SW SWB 1800 500 1700 450 LDA SW SWB Perplexity Perplexity 1600 1500 1400 400 350 300 1300 250 1200 200 1100 1000 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 150 10 90 20 Percentage of Words Observed 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 Percentage of Words Observed Figure 4: Average perplexity of the two special words models and the standard topics model as a function of the percentage of words observed in test documents on the NIPS data set (left) and the PATENTS data set (right). Perplexity(wtest |Dtrain ) = exp − Dtest d=1 log p(wd |Dtrain ) Dtest d=1 Nd where wtest is a vector of words in the test data set, wd is a vector of words in document d of the test set, and Dtrain is the training set. For the SWB model, we approximate p(wd |Dtrain ) as follows: p(wd |Dtrain ) ≈ 1 S S p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) s=1 where Θs , Φs , Ψs , Ωs and λs are point estimates from s = 1:S different Gibbs sampling runs. The probability of the words wd in a test document d, given its parameters, can be computed as follows: Nd p(wd |{Θs Φs Ψs Ωs λs }) = T s s φs i t θtd + λs ψwi d + λs Ωs i 3d w w 2d λs 1d i=1 t=1 where Nd is the number of words in test document d and wi is the ith word being predicted in the s s test document. θtd , φs i t , ψwi d , Ωs i and λs are point estimates from sample s. w w d When a fraction of words of a test document d is observed, a Gibbs sampler is run on the observed words to update the document-speciﬁc parameters, θd , ψd and λd and these updated parameters are used in the computation of perplexity. For the NIPS data set, documents from the last year of the data set were held out to compute perplexity (Dtest = 150), and for the PATENTS data set 500 documents were randomly selected as test documents. From the perplexity ﬁgures, it can be seen that once a small fraction of the test document words is observed (20% for NIPS and 10% for PATENTS), the SW and SWB models have signiﬁcantly lower perplexity values than LDA indicating that the SW and SWB models are using the special words “route” to better learn predictive models for individual documents. 4.2 Information Retrieval Results Returning to the point of capturing both speciﬁc and general aspects of documents as discussed in the introduction of the paper, we generated 500 queries of length 3-5 using randomly selected lowfrequency words from the NIPS corpus and then ranked documents relative to these queries using several different methods. Table 2 shows for the top k-ranked documents (k = 1, 10, 50, 100) how many of the retrieved documents contained at least one of the words in the query. Note that we are not assessing relevance here in a traditional information retrieval sense, but instead are assessing how Method TF-IDF LSI LDA SW SWB 1 Ret Doc 100.0 97.6 90.0 99.2 99.4 10 Ret Docs 100.0 82.7 80.6 97.1 96.6 50 Ret Docs 100.0 64.6 67.0 79.1 78.7 100 Ret Docs 100.0 54.3 58.7 67.3 67.2 Table 2: Percentage of retrieved documents containing at least one query word (NIPS corpus).

TF-IDF has 100% matches, as one would expect, and the techniques that generalize (such as LSI and LDA) have far fewer exact matches. The SWB and SW models have more speciﬁc matches than either LDA or LSI, indicating that they have the ability to match at the level of speciﬁc words. Of course this is not of much utility unless the SWB and SW models can also perform well in terms of retrieving relevant documents (not just documents containing the query words), which we investigate next. For the AP and FR documents sets, 3 types of query sets were constructed from TREC Topics 1150, based on the T itle (short), Desc (sentence-length) and Concepts (long list of keywords) ﬁelds. Queries that have no relevance judgments for a collection were removed from the query set for that collection. The score for a document d relative to a query q for the SW and standard topic models can be computed as the probability of q given d (known as the query-likelihood model in the IR community). For the SWB topic model, we have T p(w|z = t)p(z = t|d) + p(x = 1|d)p′ (w|d) + p(x = 2|d)p′′ (w)] [p(x = 0|d) p(q|d) ≈ w∈q t=1 We compare SW and SWB models with the standard topic model (LDA), LSI and TF-IDF. The TFCW D D wd IDF score for a word w in a document d is computed as TF-IDF(w, d) = Nd × log2 Dw . For LSI, the TF-IDF weight matrix is reduced to a K-dimensional latent space using SVD, K = 200. A given query is ﬁrst mapped into the LSI latent space or the TF-IDF space (known as query folding), and documents are scored based on their cosine distances to the mapped queries. To measure the performance of each algorithm we used 2 metrics that are widely used in IR research: the mean average precision (MAP) and the precision for the top 10 documents retrieved (pr@10d). The main difference between the AP and FR documents is that the latter documents are considerably longer on average and there are fewer queries for the FR data set. Figure 5 summarizes the results, broken down by algorithm, query type, document set, and metric. The maximum score for each query experiment is shown in bold: in all cases (query-type/data set/metric) the SW or SWB model produced the highest scores. To determine statistical signiﬁcance, we performed a t-test at the 0.05 level between the scores of each of the SW and SWB models, and the scores of the LDA model (as LDA has the best scores overall among TF-IDF, LSI and LDA). Differences between SW and SWB are not signiﬁcant. In ﬁgure 5, we use the symbol * to indicate scores where the SW and SWB models showed a statistically signiﬁcant difference (always an improvement) relative to the LDA model. The differences for the “non-starred” query and metric scores of SW and SWB are not statistically signiﬁcant but nonetheless always favor SW and SWB over LDA. 5 Discussion and Conclusions Wei and Croft (2006) have recently proposed an ad hoc LDA approach that models p(q|d) as a weighted combination of a multinomial over the entire corpus (the background model), a multinomial over the document, and an LDA model. Wei and Croft showed that this combination provides excellent retrieval performance compared to other state-of-the-art IR methods. In a number of experiments (not shown) comparing the SWB and ad hoc LDA models we found that the two techniques produced comparable precision performance, with small but systematic performance gains being achieved by an ad hoc combination where the standard LDA model in ad hoc LDA was replaced with the SWB model. An interesting direction for future work is to investigate fully generative models that can achieve the performance of ad hoc approaches. In conclusion, we have proposed a new probabilistic model that accounts for both general and speciﬁc aspects of documents or individual behavior. The model extends existing latent variable probabilistic approaches such as LDA by allowing these models to take into account speciﬁc aspects of documents (or individuals) that are exceptions to the broader structure of the data. This allows, for example, documents to be modeled as a mixture of words generated by general topics and words generated in a manner speciﬁc to that document. Experimental results on information retrieval tasks indicate that the SWB topic model does not suffer from the weakness of techniques such as LSI and LDA when faced with very speciﬁc query words, nor does it suffer the limitations of TF-IDF in terms of its ability to generalize.

<p>Author: Christopher J. Burges, Robert Ragno, Quoc V. Le</p><p>Abstract: The quality measures used in information retrieval are particularly difﬁcult to optimize directly, since they depend on the model scores only through the sorted order of the documents returned for a given query. Thus, the derivatives of the cost with respect to the model parameters are either zero, or are undeﬁned. In this paper, we propose a class of simple, ﬂexible algorithms, called LambdaRank, which avoids these difﬁculties by working with implicit cost functions. We describe LambdaRank using neural network models, although the idea applies to any differentiable function class. We give necessary and sufﬁcient conditions for the resulting implicit cost function to be convex, and we show that the general method has a simple mechanical interpretation. We demonstrate signiﬁcantly improved accuracy, over a state-of-the-art ranking algorithm, on several datasets. We also show that LambdaRank provides a method for signiﬁcantly speeding up the training phase of that ranking algorithm. Although this paper is directed towards ranking, the proposed method can be extended to any non-smooth and multivariate cost functions. 1</p><p>4 0.45585999 <a title="166-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem.html">5 nips-2006-A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Malte Rasch, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose two statistical tests to determine if two samples are from different distributions. Our test statistic is in both cases the distance between the means of the two samples mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The ﬁrst test is based on a large deviation bound for the test statistic, while the second is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in O(m2 ) time. We apply our approach to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where our test performs strongly. We also demonstrate excellent performance when comparing distributions over graphs, for which no alternative tests currently exist.</p><p>5 0.40255037 <a title="166-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Stochastic_Relational_Models_for_Discriminative_Link_Prediction.html">183 nips-2006-Stochastic Relational Models for Discriminative Link Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Yu, Wei Chu, Shipeng Yu, Volker Tresp, Zhao Xu</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a Gaussian process (GP) framework, stochastic relational models (SRM), for learning social, physical, and other relational phenomena where interactions between entities are observed. The key idea is to model the stochastic structure of entity relationships (i.e., links) via a tensor interaction of multiple GPs, each deﬁned on one type of entities. These models in fact deﬁne a set of nonparametric priors on inﬁnite dimensional tensor matrices, where each element represents a relationship between a tuple of entities. By maximizing the marginalized likelihood, information is exchanged between the participating GPs through the entire relational network, so that the dependency structure of links is messaged to the dependency of entities, reﬂected by the adapted GP kernels. The framework offers a discriminative approach to link prediction, namely, predicting the existences, strengths, or types of relationships based on the partially observed linkage network as well as the attributes of entities (if given). We discuss properties and variants of SRM and derive an efﬁcient learning algorithm. Very encouraging experimental results are achieved on a toy problem and a user-movie preference link prediction task. In the end we discuss extensions of SRM to general relational learning tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.37689707 <a title="166-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Relational_Learning_with_Gaussian_Processes.html">169 nips-2006-Relational Learning with Gaussian Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Deepak Verma, Karl Pfleger, David Tax</p><p>Abstract: Clustering, or factoring of a document collection attempts to “explain” each observed document in terms of one or a small number of inferred prototypes. Prior work demonstrated that when links exist between documents in the corpus (as is the case with a collection of web pages or scientiﬁc papers), building a joint model of document contents and connections produces a better model than that built from contents or connections alone. Many problems arise when trying to apply these joint models to corpus at the scale of the World Wide Web, however; one of these is that the sheer overhead of representing a feature space on the order of billions of dimensions becomes impractical. We address this problem with a simple representational shift inspired by probabilistic relational models: instead of representing document linkage in terms of the identities of linking documents, we represent it by the explicit and inferred attributes of the linking documents. Several surprising results come with this shift: in addition to being computationally more tractable, the new model produces factors that more cleanly decompose the document collection. We discuss several variations on this model and show how some can be seen as exact generalizations of the PageRank algorithm. 1</p><p>2 0.51372403 <a title="166-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_Random_Sampling%3A_A_Sketch-based_Sampling_Technique_for_Sparse_Data.html">56 nips-2006-Conditional Random Sampling: A Sketch-based Sampling Technique for Sparse Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Ping Li, Kenneth W. Church, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: We1 develop Conditional Random Sampling (CRS), a technique particularly suitable for sparse data. In large-scale applications, the data are often highly sparse. CRS combines sketching and sampling in that it converts sketches of the data into conditional random samples online in the estimation stage, with the sample size determined retrospectively. This paper focuses on approximating pairwise l2 and l1 distances and comparing CRS with random projections. For boolean (0/1) data, CRS is provably better than random projections. We show using real-world data that CRS often outperforms random projections.

<p>Author: Amir Globerson, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: A number of exact and approximate methods are available for inference calculations in graphical models. Many recent approximate methods for graphs with cycles are based on tractable algorithms for tree structured graphs. Here we base the approximation on a different tractable model, planar graphs with binary variables and pure interaction potentials (no external ﬁeld). The partition function for such models can be calculated exactly using an algorithm introduced by Fisher and Kasteleyn in the 1960s. We show how such tractable planar models can be used in a decomposition to derive upper bounds on the partition function of non-planar models. The resulting algorithm also allows for the estimation of marginals. We compare our planar decomposition to the tree decomposition method of Wainwright et. al., showing that it results in a much tighter bound on the partition function, improved pairwise marginals, and comparable singleton marginals. Graphical models are a powerful tool for modeling multivariate distributions, and have been successfully applied in various ﬁelds such as coding theory and image processing. Applications of graphical models typically involve calculating two types of quantities, namely marginal distributions, and MAP assignments. The evaluation of the model partition function is closely related to calculating marginals [12]. These three problems can rarely be solved exactly in polynomial time, and are provably computationally hard in the general case [1]. When the model conforms to a tree structure, however, all these problems can be solved in polynomial time. This has prompted extensive research into tree based methods. For example, the junction tree method [6] converts a graphical model into a tree by clustering nodes into cliques, such that the graph over cliques is a tree. The resulting maximal clique size (cf. tree width) may nevertheless be prohibitively large. Wainwright et. al. [9, 11] proposed an approximate method based on trees known as tree reweighting (TRW). The TRW approach decomposes the potential vector of a graphical model into a mixture over spanning trees of the model, and then uses convexity arguments to bound various quantities, such as the partition function. One key advantage of this approach is that it provides bounds on partition function value, a property which is not shared by approximations based on Bethe free energies [13]. In this paper we focus on a different class of tractable models: planar graphs. A graph is called planar if it can be drawn in the plane without crossing edges. Works in the 1960s by physicists Fisher [5] and Kasteleyn [7], among others, have shown that the partition function for planar graphs may be calculated in polynomial time. This, however, is true under two key restrictions. One is that the variables xi are binary. The other is that the interaction potential depends only on xi xj (where xi ∈ {±1}), and not on their individual values (i.e., the zero external ﬁeld case). Here we show how the above method can be used to obtain upper bounds on the partition function for non-planar graphs. As in TRW, we decompose the potential of a non-planar graph into a sum over spanning planar models, and then use a convexity argument to obtain an upper bound on the log partition function. The bound optimization is a convex problem, and can be solved in polynomial time. We compare our method with TRW on a planar graph with an external ﬁeld, and show that it performs favorably with respect to both pairwise marginals and the bound on the partition function, and the two methods give similar results for singleton marginals. 1 Deﬁnitions and Notations Given a graph G with n vertices and a set of edges E, we are interested in pairwise Markov Random Fields (MRF) over the graph G. A pairwise MRF [13] is a multivariate distribution over variables x = {x1 , . . . , xn } deﬁned as 1 P p(x) = e ij∈E fij (xi ,xj ) (1) Z where fij are a set of |E| functions, or interaction potentials, deﬁned over pairs of variables. The P partition function is deﬁned as Z = x e ij∈E fij (xi ,xj ) . Here we will focus on the case where xi ∈ {±1}. Furthermore, we will be interested in interaction potentials which only depend on agreement or disagreement between the signs of their variables. We deﬁne those by 1 θij (1 + xi xj ) = θij I(xi = xj ) (2) 2 so that fij (xi , xj ) is zero if xi = xj and θij if xi = xj . The model is then deﬁned via the set of parameters θij . We use θ to denote the vector of parameters θij , and denote the partition function by Z(θ) to highlight its dependence on these parameters. f (xi , xj ) = A graph G is deﬁned as planar if it can be drawn in the plane without any intersection of edges [4]. With some abuse of notation, we deﬁne E as the set of line segments in 2 corresponding to the edges in the graph. The regions of 2 \ E are deﬁned as the faces of the graph. The face which corresponds to an unbounded region is called the external face. Given a planar graph G, its dual graph G∗ is deﬁned in the following way: the vertices of G∗ correspond to faces of G, and there is an edge between two vertices in G∗ iff the two corresponding faces in G share an edge. If the graph G is weighted, the weight on an edge in G∗ is the weight on the edge shared by the corresponding faces in G. A plane triangulation of a planar graph G is obtained from G by adding edges such that all the faces of the resulting graph have exactly three vertices. Thus a plane triangulated graph has a dual where all vertices have degree three. It can be shown that every plane graph can be plane triangulated [4]. We shall also need the notion of a perfect matching on a graph. A perfect matching on a graph G is deﬁned as a set of edges H ⊆ E such that every vertex in G has exactly one edge in H incident on it. If the graph is weighted, the weight of the matching is deﬁned as the product of the weights of the edges in the matching. Finally, we recall the deﬁnition of a marginal polytope of a graph [12]. Consider an MRF over a graph G where fij are given by Equation 2. Denote the probability of the event I(xi = xj ) under p(x) by τij . The marginal polytope of G, denoted by M(G), is deﬁned as the set of values τij that can be obtained under some assignment to the parameters θij . For a general graph G the polytope M(G) cannot be described using a polynomial number of inequalities. However, for planar graphs, it turns out that a set of O(n3 ) constraints, commonly referred to as triangle inequalities, sufﬁce to describe M(G) (see [3] page 434). The triangle inequalities are deﬁned by 1 TRI(n) = {τij : τij + τjk − τik ≤ 1, τij + τjk + τik ≥ 1, ∀i, j, k ∈ {1, . . . , n}} (3) Note that the above inequalities actually contain variables τij which do not correspond to edges in the original graph G. Thus the equality M(G) = TRI(n) should be understood as referring only to the values of τij that correspond to edges in the graph. Importantly, the values of τij for edges not in the graph need not be valid marginals for any MRF. In other words M(G) is a projection of TRI(n) on the set of edges of G. It is well known that the marginal polytope for trees is described via pairwise constraints. It is thus interesting that for planar graphs, it is triplets, rather than pairwise 1 The deﬁnition here is slightly different from that in [3], since here we refer to agreement probabilities, whereas [3] refers to disagreement probabilities. This polytope is also referred to as the cut polytope. constraints, that characterize the polytope. In this sense, planar graphs and trees may be viewed as a hierarchy of polytope complexity classes. It remains an interesting problem to characterize other structures in this hierarchy and their related inference algorithms. 2 Exact calculation of partition function using perfect matching The seminal works of Kasteleyn [7] and Fisher [5] have shown how one can calculate the partition function for a binary MRF over a planar graph with pure interaction potentials. We brieﬂy review Fisher’s construction, which we will use in what follows. Our interpretation of the method differs somewhat from that of Fisher, but we believe it is more straightforward. The key idea in calculating the partition function is to convert the summation over values of x to the problem of calculating the sum of weights of all perfect matchings in a graph constructed from G, as shown below. In this section, we consider weighted graphs (graphs with numbers assigned to their edges). For the graph G associated with the pairwise MRF, we assign weights wij = e2θij to the edges. The ﬁrst step in the construction is to plane triangulate the graph G. Let us call the resulting graph GT . We deﬁne an MRF on GT by assigning a parameter θij = 0 to the edges that have been added to G, and the corresponding weight wij = 1. Thus GT essentially describes the same distribution as G, and therefore has the same partition function. We can thus restrict our attention to calculating the partition function for the MRF on GT . As a ﬁrst step in calculating a partition function over GT , we introduce the following deﬁnition: a ˆ set of edges E in GT is an agreement edge set (or AES) if for every triangle face F in GT one of the ˆ ˆ following holds: The edges in F are all in E, or exactly one of the edges in F is in E. The weight ˆ is deﬁned as the product of the weights of the edges in E. ˆ of a set E It can be shown that there exists a bijection between pairs of assignments {x, −x} and agreement edge sets. The mapping from x to an edge set is simply the set of edges such that xi = xj . It is easy to see that this is an agreement edge set. The reverse mapping is obtained by ﬁnding an assignment x such that xi = xj iff the corresponding edge is in the agreement edge set. The existence of this mapping can be shown by induction on the number of (triangle) faces. P The contribution of a given assignment x to the partition function is e ˆ sponds to an AES denoted by E it is easy to see that P e ij∈E θij I(xi =xj ) = e− P ij∈E θij P e ˆ ij∈E 2θij = ce P ˆ ij∈E ij∈E 2θij θij I(xi =xj ) =c wij . If x corre(4) ˆ ij∈E P where c = e− ij∈E θij . Deﬁne the superset Λ as the set of agreement edge sets. The above then implies that Z(θ) = 2c E∈Λ ij∈E wij , and is thus proportional to the sum of AES weights. ˆ ˆ To sum over agreement edge sets, we use the following elegant trick introduced by Fisher [5]. Construct a new graph GPM from the dual of GT by introducing new vertices and edges according to the following rule: Replace each original vertex with three vertices that are connected to each other, and assign a weight of one to the new edges. Next, consider the three neighbors of the original vertex 2 . Connect each of the three new vertices to one of these three neighbors, keeping the original weights on these edges. The transformation is illustrated in Figure 1. The new graph GPM has O(3n) vertices, and is also planar. It can be seen that there is a one to one correspondence between perfect matchings in GPM and agreement edge sets in GT . Deﬁne Ω to be the set of perfect matchings in GPM . Then Z(θ) = 2c M ∈Ω ij∈M wij where we have used the fact that all the new weights have a value of one. Thus, the partition function is a sum over the weights of perfect matchings in GPM . Finally, we need a way of summing over the weights of the set of perfect matchings in a graph. Kasteleyn [7] proved that for a planar graph GPM , this sum may be obtained using the following sequence of steps: • Direct the edges of the graph GPM such that for every face (except possibly the external face), the number of edges on its perimeter oriented in a clockwise manner is odd. Kasteleyn showed that such a so called Pfafﬁan orientation may be constructed in polynomial time for a planar graph (see also [8] page 322). 2 Note that in the dual of GT all vertices have degree three, since GT is plane triangulated. 1.2 0.7 0.6 1 1 1 0.8 0.6 0.8 1.5 1.4 1.5 1 1 1.2 1 1 1 1 0.7 1.4 1 1 1 Figure 1: Illustration of the graph transformations in Section 2 for a complete graph with four vertices. Left panel shows the original weighted graph (dotted edges and grey vertices) and its dual (solid edges and black vertices). Right panel shows the dual graph with each vertex replaced by a triangle (the graph GPM in the text). Weights for dual graph edges correspond to the weights on the original graph. • Deﬁne the matrix P (GPM ) to be a skew symmetric matrix such that Pij = 0 if ij is not an edge, Pij = wij if the arrow on edge ij runs from i to j and Pij = −wij otherwise. • The sum over weighted matchings can then be shown to equal |P (GPM )|. The partition function is thus given by Z(θ) = 2c |P (GPM )|. To conclude this section we reiterate the following two key points: the partition function of a binary MRF over a planar graph with interaction potentials as in Equation 2 may be calculated in polynomial time by calculating the determinant of a matrix of size O(3n). An important outcome of this result is that the functional relation between Z(θ) and the parameters θij is known, a fact we shall use in what follows. 3 Partition function bounds via planar decomposition Given a non-planar graph G over binary variables with a vector of interaction potentials θ, we wish to use the exact planar computation to obtain a bound on the partition function of the MRF on G. We assume for simplicity that the potentials on the MRF for G are given in the form of Equation 2. Thus, G violates the assumptions of the previous section only in its non-planarity. Deﬁne G(r) as a set of spanning planar subgraphs of G, i.e., each graph G(r) is planar and contains all the vertices of G and some its edges. Denote by m the number of such graphs. Introduce the following deﬁnitions: (r) • θ (r) is a set of parameters on the edges of G(r) , and θij is an element in this set. Z(θ (r) ) is the partition function of the MRF on G(r) with parameters θ (r) . ˆ (r) ˆ(r) • θ is a set of parameters on the edges of G such that if edge (ij) is in G(r) then θij = (r) ˆ(r) θ , and otherwise θ = 0. ij ij Given a distribution ρ(r) on the graphs G(r) (i.e., ρ(r) ≥ 0 for r = 1, . . . , m and assume that the parameters for G(r) are such that ˆ ρ(r)θ θ= (r) r ρ(r) = 1), (5) r Then, by the convexity of the log partition function, as a function of the model parameters, we have ρ(r) log Z(θ (r) ) ≡ f (θ, ρ, θ (r) ) log Z(θ) ≤ (6) r Since by assumption the graphs G(r) are planar, this bound can be calculated in polynomial time. Since this bound is true for any set of parameters θ (r) which satisﬁes the condition in Equation 5 and for any distribution ρ(r), we may optimize over these two variables to obtain the tightest bound possible. Deﬁne the optimal bound for a ﬁxed value of ρ(r) by g(ρ, θ) (optimization is w.r.t. θ (r) ) g(ρ, θ) = f (θ, ρ, θ (r) ) min θ (r) : P ˆ ρ(r)θ (r) =θ (7) Also, deﬁne the optimum of the above w.r.t. ρ by h(θ). h(θ) = min g(θ, ρ) ρ(r) ≥ 0, ρ(r) = 1 (8) Thus, h(θ) is the optimal upper bound for the given parameter vector θ. In the following section we argue that we can in fact ﬁnd the global optimum of the above problem. 4 Globally Optimal Bound Optimization First consider calculating g(ρ, θ) from Equation 7. Note that since log Z(θ (r) ) is a convex function of θ (r) , and the constraints are linear, the overall optimization is convex and can be solved efﬁciently. In the current implementation, we use a projected gradient algorithm [2]. The gradient of f (θ, ρ, θ (r) ) w.r.t. θ (r) is given by ∂f (θ, ρ, θ (r) ) (r) ∂θij (r) = ρ(r) 1 + eθij (r) P −1 (GPM ) (r) k(i,j) Sign(Pk(i,j) (GPM )) (9) where k(i, j) returns the row and column indices of the element in the upper triangular matrix of (r) (r) P (GPM ), which contains the element e2θij . Since the optimization in Equation 7 is convex, it has an equivalent convex dual. Although we do not use this dual for optimization (because of the difﬁculty of expressing the entropy of planar models solely in terms of triplet marginals), it nevertheless allows some insight into the structure of the problem. The dual in this case is closely linked to the notion of the marginal polytope deﬁned in Section 1. Using a derivation similar to [11], we arrive at the following characterization of the dual g(ρ, θ) = max τ ∈TRI(n) ρ(r)H(θ (r) (τ )) θ·τ + (10) r where θ (r) (τ ) denotes the parameters of an MRF on G(r) such that its marginals are given by the restriction of τ to the edges of G(r) , and H(θ (r) (τ )) denotes the entropy of the MRF over G(r) with parameters θ (r) (τ ). The maximized function in Equation 10 is linear in ρ and thus g(ρ, θ) is a pointwise maximum over (linear) convex functions in ρ and is thus convex in ρ. It therefore has no (r) local minima. Denote by θmin (ρ) the set of parameters that minimizes Equation 7 for a given value of ρ. Using a derivation similar to that in [11], the gradient of g(ρ, θ) can be shown to be ∂g(ρ, θ) (r) = H(θmin (ρ)) ∂ρ(r) (11) Since the partition function for G(r) can be calculated efﬁciently, so can the entropy. We can now summarize the algorithm for calculating h(θ) • Initialize ρ0 . Iterate: – For ρt , ﬁnd θ (r) which solves the minimization in Equation 7. – Calculate the gradient of g(ρ, θ) at ρt using the expression in Equation 11 – Update ρt+1 = ρt + αv where v is a feasible search direction calculated from the gradient of g(ρ, θ) and the simplex constraints on ρ. The step size α is calculated via an Armijo line search. – Halt when the change in g(ρ, θ) is smaller than some threshold. Note that the minimization w.r.t. θ (r) is not very time consuming since we can initialize it with the minimum from the previous step, and thus only a few iterations are needed to ﬁnd the new optimum, provided the change in ρ is not too big. The above algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global optimum of ρ [2], and thus we obtain the tightest possible upper bound on Z(θ) given our planar graph decomposition. The procedure described here is asymmetric w.r.t. ρ and θ (r) . In a symmetric formulation the minimizing gradient steps could be carried out jointly or in an alternating sequence. The symmetric ˆ (r) formulation can be obtained by decoupling ρ and θ (r) in the bi-linear constraint ρ(r)θ = θ. Field Figure 2: Illustration of planar subgraph construction for a rectangular lattice with external ﬁeld. Original graph is shown on the left. The ﬁeld vertex is connected to all vertices (edges not shown). The graph on the right results from isolating the 4th ,5th columns of the original graph (shown in grey), and connecting the ﬁeld vertex to the external vertices of the three disconnected components. Note that the resulting graph is planar. ˜ ˜ Speciﬁcally, we introduce θ (r) = θ (r) ρ(r) and perform the optimization w.r.t. ρ and θ (r) . It can be ˜(r) ) with the relevant (de-coupled) constraint is equivalent shown that a stationary point of f (θ, ρ, θ to the procedure described above. The advantage of this approach is that the exact minimization w.r.t θ (r) is not required before modifying ρ. Our experiments have shown, however, that the methods take comparable times to converge, although this may be a property of the implementation. 5 Estimating Marginals The optimization problem as deﬁned above minimizes an upper bound on the partition function. However, it may also be of interest to obtain estimates of the marginals of the MRF over G. To obtain marginal estimates, we follow the approach in [11]. We ﬁrst characterize the optimum of Equation 7 for a ﬁxed value of ρ. Deriving the Lagrangian of Equation 7 w.r.t. θ (r) we obtain the (r) following characterization of θmin (ρ): Marginal Optimality Criterion: For any two graphs G(r) , G(s) such that the edge (ij) is in both (r) (s) graphs, the optimal parameter vector satisﬁes τij (θmin (ρ)) = τij (θmin (ρ)). Thus, the optimal set of parameters for the graphs G(r) is such that every two graphs agree on the marginals of all the edges they share. This implies that at the optimum, there is a well deﬁned set of marginals over all the edges. We use this set as an approximation to the true marginals. A different method for estimating marginals uses the partition function bound directly. We ﬁrst P calculate partition function bounds on the sums: αi (1) = x:xi =1 e ij∈E fij (xi ,xj ) and αi (−1) = P αi (1) e ij∈E fij (xi ,xj ) and then normalize αi (1)+αi (−1) to obtain an estimate for p(xi = 1). This method has the advantage of being more numerically stable (since it does not depend on derivatives of log Z). However, it needs to be calculated separately for each variable, so that it may be time consuming if one is interested in marginals for a large set of variables. x:xi =−1 6 Experimental Evaluation We study the application of our Planar Decomposition (PDC) P method to a binary MRF on a square P lattice with an external ﬁeld. The MRF is given by p(x) ∝ e ij∈E θij xi xj + i∈V θi xi where V are the lattice vertices, and θi and θij are parameters. Note that this interaction does not satisfy the conditions for exact calculation of the partition function, even though the graph is planar. This problem is in fact NP hard [1]. However, it is possible to obtain the desired interaction form by introducing an additional variable xn+1 that is connected to all the original variables.P Denote the correspondP ij∈E θij xi xj + i∈V θi,n+1 xi xn+1 , where ing graph by Gf . Consider the distribution p(x, xn+1 ) ∝ e θi,n+1 = θi . It is easy to see that any property of p(x) (e.g., partition function, marginals) may be calculated from the corresponding property of p(x, xn+1 ). The advantage of the latter distribution is that it has the desired interaction form. We can thus apply PDC by choosing planar subgraphs of the non-planar graph Gf . 0.25 0.15 0.1 0.05 0.5 1 1.5 Interaction Strength 0.03 Singleton Marginal Error Z Bound Error Pairwise Marginals Error 0.08 PDC TRW 0.2 0.07 0.06 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 2 0.5 1 1.5 Interaction Strength 0.025 0.02 0.015 0.01 0.005 2 0.5 1 1.5 Interaction Strength 2 !3 x 10 0.025 0.02 0.015 0.5 1 Field Strength 1.5 2 Singleton Marginal Error Pairwise Marginals Error Z Bound Error 0.03 0.03 0.025 0.02 0.015 0.5 1 Field Strength 1.5 2 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 0.5 1 Field Strength 1.5 2 Figure 3: Comparison of the TRW and Planar Decomposition (PDC) algorithms on a 7×7 square lattice. TRW results shown in red squares, and PDC in blue circles. Left column shows the error in the log partition bound. Middle column is the mean error for pairwise marginals, and right column is the error for the singleton marginal of the variable at the lattice center. Results in upper row are for ﬁeld parameters drawn from U[−0.05, 0.05] and various interaction parameters. Results in the lower row are for interaction parameters drawn from U [−0.5, 0.5] and various ﬁeld parameters. Error bars are standard errors calculated from 40 random trials. There are clearly many ways to choose spanning planar subgraphs of Gf . Spanning subtrees are one option, and were used in [11]. Since our optimization is polynomial in the number of subgraphs, √ we preferred to use a number of subgraphs that is linear in n. The key idea in generating these planar subgraphs is to generate disconnected components of the lattice and connect xn+1 only to the external vertices of these components. Here we generate three disconnected components by isolating two neighboring columns (or rows) from the rest of the graph, resulting in three components. This is √ illustrated in Figure 2. To this set of 2 n graphs, we add the independent variables graph consisting only of edges from the ﬁeld node to all the other nodes. We compared the performance of the PDC and TRW methods 3 4 on a 7 × 7 lattice . Since the exact partition function and marginals can be calculated for this case, we could compare both algorithms to the true values. The MRF parameters were set according to the two following scenarios: 1) Varying Interaction - The ﬁeld parameters θi were drawn uniformly from U[−0.05, 0.05], and the interaction θij from U[−α, α] where α ∈ {0.2, 0.4, . . . , 2}. This is the setting tested in [11]. 2) Varying Field θi was drawn uniformly from U[−α, α], where α ∈ {0.2, 0.4, . . . , 2} and θij from U[−0.5, 0.5]. For each scenario, we calculated the following measures: 1) Normalized log partition error 1 1 alg − log Z true ). 2) Error in pairwise marginals |E| ij∈E |palg (xi = 1, xj = 1) − 49 (log Z ptrue (xi = 1, xj = 1)|. Pairwise marginals were calculated jointly using the marginal optimality criterion of Section 5. 3) Error in singleton marginals. We calculated the singleton marginals for the innermost node in the lattice (i.e., coordinate [3, 3]), which intuitively should be the most difﬁcult for the planar based algorithm. This marginal was calculated using two partition functions, as explained in Section 5 5 . The same method was used for TRW. The reported error measure is |palg (xi = 1) − ptrue (xi = 1)|. Results were averaged over 40 random trials. Results for the two scenarios and different evaluation measures are given in Figure 3. It can be seen that the partition function bound for PDC is signiﬁcantly better than TRW for almost all parameter settings, although the difference becomes smaller for large ﬁeld values. Error for the PDC pairwise 3 TRW and PDC bounds were optimized over both the subgraph parameters and the mixture parameters ρ. In terms of running time, PDC optimization for a ﬁxed value of ρ took about 30 seconds, which is still slower than the TRW message passing implementation. 5 Results using the marginal optimality criterion were worse for PDC, possibly due to its reduced numerical precision. 4 marginals are smaller than those of TRW for all parameter settings. For the singleton parameters, TRW slightly outperforms PDC. This is not surprising since the ﬁeld is modeled by every spanning tree in the TRW decomposition, whereas in PDC not all the structures model a given ﬁeld. 7 Discussion We have presented a method for using planar graphs as the basis for approximating non-planar graphs such as planar graphs with external ﬁelds. While the restriction to binary variables limits the applicability of our approach, it remains relevant in many important applications, such as coding theory and combinatorial optimization. Moreover, it is always possible to convert a non-binary graphical model to a binary one by introducing additional variables. The resulting graph will typically not be planar, even when the original graph over k−ary variables is. However, the planar decomposition method can then be applied to this non-planar graph. The optimization of the decomposition is carried out explicitly over the planar subgraphs, thus limiting the number of subgraphs that can be used in the approximation. In the TRW method this problem is circumvented since it is possible to implicitly optimize over all spanning trees. The reason this can be done for trees is that the entropy of an MRF over a tree may be written as a function of its marginal variables. We do not know of an equivalent result for planar graphs, and it remains a challenge to ﬁnd one. It is however possible to combine the planar and tree decompositions into one single bound, which is guaranteed to outperform the tree or planar approximations alone. The planar decomposition idea may in principle be applied to bounding the value of the MAP assignment. However, as in TRW, it can be shown that the solution is not dependent on the decomposition (as long as each edge appears in some structure), and the problem is equivalent to maximizing a linear function over the marginal polytope (which can be done in polynomial time for planar graphs). However, such a decomposition may suggest new message passing algorithms, as in [10].

<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>5 0.3664206 <a title="166-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem.html">5 nips-2006-A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Malte Rasch, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose two statistical tests to determine if two samples are from different distributions. Our test statistic is in both cases the distance between the means of the two samples mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The ﬁrst test is based on a large deviation bound for the test statistic, while the second is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in O(m2 ) time. We apply our approach to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where our test performs strongly. We also demonstrate excellent performance when comparing distributions over graphs, for which no alternative tests currently exist.</p><p>6 0.36416155 <a title="166-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Support_Vector_Machines_on_a_Budget.html">186 nips-2006-Support Vector Machines on a Budget</a></p>

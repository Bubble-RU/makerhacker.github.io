<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>3 0.11636481 <a title="153-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_sparse_coding_algorithms.html">75 nips-2006-Efficient sparse coding algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Alexis Battle, Rajat Raina, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for ﬁnding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, ﬁnding sparse codes remains a very difﬁcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efﬁcient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1 -regularized least squares problem and an L2 -constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a signiﬁcant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive ﬁeld surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1</p><p>4 0.10239027 <a title="153-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Switched_Gaussian_Process_for_Estimating_Disparity_and_Segmentation_in_Binocular_Stereo.html">15 nips-2006-A Switched Gaussian Process for Estimating Disparity and Segmentation in Binocular Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Williams</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a Gaussian process framework for inferring pixel-wise disparity and bi-layer segmentation of a scene given a stereo pair of images. The Gaussian process covariance is parameterized by a foreground-backgroundocclusion segmentation label to model both smooth regions and discontinuities. As such, we call our model a switched Gaussian process. We propose a greedy incremental algorithm for adding observations from the data and assigning segmentation labels. Two observation schedules are proposed: the ﬁrst treats scanlines as independent, the second uses an active learning criterion to select a sparse subset of points to measure. We show that this probabilistic framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>5 0.091589056 <a title="153-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Large_Scale_Hidden_Semi-Markov_SVMs.html">108 nips-2006-Large Scale Hidden Semi-Markov SVMs</a></p>

<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Peggy Hackney, Christoph Bregler</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for synthesis of human motion in speciﬁed styles. We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>3 0.47978804 <a title="153-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Large_Scale_Hidden_Semi-Markov_SVMs.html">108 nips-2006-Large Scale Hidden Semi-Markov SVMs</a></p>

<p>Author: Andriy Myronenko, Xubo Song, Miguel Á. Carreira-Perpiñán</p><p>Abstract: We introduce Coherent Point Drift (CPD), a novel probabilistic method for nonrigid registration of point sets. The registration is treated as a Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation problem with motion coherence constraint over the velocity ﬁeld such that one point set moves coherently to align with the second set. We formulate the motion coherence constraint and derive a solution of regularized ML estimation through the variational approach, which leads to an elegant kernel form. We also derive the EM algorithm for the penalized ML optimization with deterministic annealing. The CPD method simultaneously ﬁnds both the non-rigid transformation and the correspondence between two point sets without making any prior assumption of the transformation model except that of motion coherence. This method can estimate complex non-linear non-rigid transformations, and is shown to be accurate on 2D and 3D examples and robust in the presence of outliers and missing points.</p><p>5 0.45936194 <a title="153-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Multiple_Instance_Learning_for_Computer_Aided_Diagnosis.html">140 nips-2006-Multiple Instance Learning for Computer Aided Diagnosis</a></p>
<p>Author: Murat Dundar, Balaji Krishnapuram, R. B. Rao, Glenn M. Fung</p><p>Abstract: Many computer aided diagnosis (CAD) problems can be best modelled as a multiple-instance learning (MIL) problem with unbalanced data: i.e. , the training data typically consists of a few positive bags, and a very large number of negative instances. Existing MIL algorithms are much too computationally expensive for these datasets. We describe CH, a framework for learning a Convex Hull representation of multiple instances that is signiﬁcantly faster than existing MIL algorithms. Our CH framework applies to any standard hyperplane-based learning algorithm, and for some algorithms, is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimal solution. Experimental studies on two different CAD applications further demonstrate that the proposed algorithm signiﬁcantly improves diagnostic accuracy when compared to both MIL and traditional classiﬁers. Although not designed for standard MIL problems (which have both positive and negative bags and relatively balanced datasets), comparisons against other MIL methods on benchmark problems also indicate that the proposed method is competitive with the state-of-the-art.</p><p>6 0.45522046 <a title="153-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_Under_Prior_Knowledge_with_Application_to_Image_Segmentation.html">51 nips-2006-Clustering Under Prior Knowledge with Application to Image Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jason M. Samonds, Brian R. Potetz, Tai S. Lee</p><p>Abstract: Although there has been substantial progress in understanding the neurophysiological mechanisms of stereopsis, how neurons interact in a network during stereo computation remains unclear. Computational models on stereopsis suggest local competition and long-range cooperation are important for resolving ambiguity during stereo matching. To test these predictions, we simultaneously recorded from multiple neurons in V1 of awake, behaving macaques while presenting surfaces of different depths rendered in dynamic random dot stereograms. We found that the interaction between pairs of neurons was a function of similarity in receptive fields, as well as of the input stimulus. Neurons coding the same depth experienced common inhibition early in their responses for stimuli presented at their nonpreferred disparities. They experienced mutual facilitation later in their responses for stimulation at their preferred disparity. These findings are consistent with a local competition mechanism that first removes gross mismatches, and a global cooperative mechanism that further refines depth estimates. 1 In trod u ction The human visual system is able to extract three-dimensional (3D) structures in random noise stereograms even when such images evoke no perceptible patterns when viewed monocularly [1]. Bela Julesz proposed that this is accomplished by a stereopsis mechanism that detects correlated shifts in 2D noise patterns between the two eyes. He also suggested that this mechanism likely involves cooperative neural processing early in the visual system. Marr and Poggio formalized the computational constraints for solving stereo matching (Fig. 1a) and devised an algorithm that can discover the underlying 3D structures in a variety of random dot stereogram patterns [2]. Their algorithm was based on two rules: (1) each element or feature is unique (i.e., can be assigned only one disparity) and (2) surfaces of objects are cohesive (i.e., depth changes gradually across space). To describe their algorithm in neurophysiological terms, we can consider neurons in primary visual cortex as simple element or feature detectors. The first rule is implemented by introducing competitive interactions (mutual inhibition) among neurons of different disparity tuning at each location (Fig. 1b, blue solid horizontal or vertical lines), allowing only one disparity to be detected at each location. The second rule is implemented by introducing cooperative interactions (mutual facilitation) among neurons tuned to the same depth (image disparity) across different spatial locations (Fig. 1b, along the red dashed diagonal lines). In other words, a disparity estimate at one location is more likely to be correct if neighboring locations have similar disparity estimates. A dynamic system under such constraints can relax to a stable global disparity map. Here, we present neurophysiological evidence of interactions between disparity-tuned neurons in the primary visual cortex that is consistent with this general approach. We sampled from a variety of spatially distributed disparity tuned neurons (see electrodes Fig. 1b) while displaying DRDS stimuli defined at various disparities (see stimulus Fig.1b). We then measured the dynamics of interactions by assessing the temporal evolution of correlation in neural responses. a Left Image b Right Image Electrodes Disparity Left Image ?

We simultaneously recorded from 4-8 electrodes providing data from up to 10 neurons in a single recording session (some electrodes recorded from as many as 3 neurons). We collected data from 112 neurons that provided 224 pairs for cross-correlation analysis. For stimuli, we used 12 Hz dynamic random dot stereograms (DRDS; 25% density black and white pixels on a mean luminance background) presented in a 3.5-degree aperture. Liquid crystal shutter goggles were used to present random dot patterns to each eye separately. Eleven horizontal disparities between the two eyes, ranging from ±0.9 degrees, were tested. Seventy-four neurons (66%) had significant disparity tuning and 99 pairs (44%) were comprised of neurons that both had significant disparity tuning (1-way ANOVA, p<0.05). b 5mm Medial - Lateral 100µV 0.2ms 1° Figure 2: (a) Example recording session from five electrodes in V1.

<p>Author: Chi-hoon Lee, Shaojun Wang, Feng Jiao, Dale Schuurmans, Russell Greiner</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel, semi-supervised approach to training discriminative random ﬁelds (DRFs) that efﬁciently exploits labeled and unlabeled training data to achieve improved accuracy in a variety of image processing tasks. We formulate DRF training as a form of MAP estimation that combines conditional loglikelihood on labeled data, given a data-dependent prior, with a conditional entropy regularizer deﬁned on unlabeled data. Although the training objective is no longer concave, we develop an efﬁcient local optimization procedure that produces classiﬁers that are more accurate than ones based on standard supervised DRF training. We then apply our semi-supervised approach to train DRFs to segment both synthetic and real data sets, and demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements over supervised DRFs in each case.</p><p>4 0.66618997 <a title="153-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>5 0.66592085 <a title="153-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Distributed_Inference_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">69 nips-2006-Distributed Inference in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>6 0.66319686 <a title="153-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Computation_of_Graph_Kernels.html">77 nips-2006-Fast Computation of Graph Kernels</a></p>

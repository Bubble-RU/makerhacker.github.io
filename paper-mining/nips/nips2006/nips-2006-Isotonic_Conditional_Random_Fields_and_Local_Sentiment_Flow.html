<p>Author: Jade P. Vinson, David Decaprio, Matthew D. Pearson, Stacey Luoma, James E. Galagan</p><p>Abstract: Computational gene prediction using generative models has reached a plateau, with several groups converging to a generalized hidden Markov model (GHMM) incorporating phylogenetic models of nucleotide sequence evolution. Further improvements in gene calling accuracy are likely to come through new methods that incorporate additional data, both comparative and species speciﬁc. Conditional Random Fields (CRFs), which directly model the conditional probability P (y|x) of a vector of hidden states conditioned on a set of observations, provide a uniﬁed framework for combining probabilistic and non-probabilistic information and have been shown to outperform HMMs on sequence labeling tasks in natural language processing. We describe the use of CRFs for comparative gene prediction. We implement a model that encapsulates both a phylogenetic-GHMM (our baseline comparative model) and additional non-probabilistic features. We tested our model on the genome sequence of the fungal human pathogen Cryptococcus neoformans. Our baseline comparative model displays accuracy comparable to the the best available gene prediction tool for this organism. Moreover, we show that discriminative training and the incorporation of non-probabilistic evidence signiﬁcantly improve performance.

<p>Author: Samuel S. Gross, Olga Russakovsky, Chuong B. Do, Serafim Batzoglou</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of training a conditional random ﬁeld (CRF) to maximize per-label predictive accuracy on a training set, an approach motivated by the principle of empirical risk minimization. We give a gradient-based procedure for minimizing an arbitrarily accurate approximation of the empirical risk under a Hamming loss function. In experiments with both simulated and real data, our optimization procedure gives signiﬁcantly better testing performance than several current approaches for CRF training, especially in situations of high label noise. 1</p><p>4 0.059333809 <a title="101-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_Under_Prior_Knowledge_with_Application_to_Image_Segmentation.html">51 nips-2006-Clustering Under Prior Knowledge with Application to Image Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>5 0.04248818 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Ordinal_Regression_by_Extended_Binary_Classification.html">156 nips-2006-Ordinal Regression by Extended Binary Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ling Li, Hsuan-tien Lin</p><p>Abstract: We present a reduction framework from ordinal regression to binary classiﬁcation based on extended examples. The framework consists of three steps: extracting extended examples from the original examples, learning a binary classiﬁer on the extended examples with any binary classiﬁcation algorithm, and constructing a ranking rule from the binary classiﬁer. A weighted 0/1 loss of the binary classiﬁer would then bound the mislabeling cost of the ranking rule. Our framework allows not only to design good ordinal regression algorithms based on well-tuned binary classiﬁcation approaches, but also to derive new generalization bounds for ordinal regression from known bounds for binary classiﬁcation. In addition, our framework uniﬁes many existing ordinal regression algorithms, such as perceptron ranking and support vector ordinal regression. When compared empirically on benchmark data sets, some of our newly designed algorithms enjoy advantages in terms of both training speed and generalization performance over existing algorithms, which demonstrates the usefulness of our framework. 1</p><p>6 0.039476175 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Learning_to_Model_Spatial_Dependency%3A_Semi-Supervised_Discriminative_Random_Fields.html">118 nips-2006-Learning to Model Spatial Dependency: Semi-Supervised Discriminative Random Fields</a></p>

We formulate DRF training as a form of MAP estimation that combines conditional loglikelihood on labeled data, given a data-dependent prior, with a conditional entropy regularizer deﬁned on unlabeled data. Although the training objective is no longer concave, we develop an efﬁcient local optimization procedure that produces classiﬁers that are more accurate than ones based on standard supervised DRF training. We then apply our semi-supervised approach to train DRFs to segment both synthetic and real data sets, and demonstrate signiﬁcant improvements over supervised DRFs in each case.</p><p>6 0.40196815 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_General_and_Specific_Aspects_of_Documents_with_a_Probabilistic_Topic_Model.html">133 nips-2006-Modeling General and Specific Aspects of Documents with a Probabilistic Topic Model</a></p>

<p>Author: David Barber, Silvia Chiappa</p><p>Abstract: Linear Gaussian State-Space Models are widely used and a Bayesian treatment of parameters is therefore of considerable interest. The approximate Variational Bayesian method applied to these models is an attractive approach, used successfully in applications ranging from acoustics to bioinformatics. The most challenging aspect of implementing the method is in performing inference on the hidden state sequence of the model. We show how to convert the inference problem so that standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions from the literature may be applied. This is in contrast to previously published approaches based on Belief Propagation. Our framework both simpliﬁes and uniﬁes the inference problem, so that future applications may be more easily developed. We demonstrate the elegance of the approach on Bayesian temporal ICA, with an application to ﬁnding independent dynamical processes underlying noisy EEG signals. 1 Linear Gaussian State-Space Models Linear Gaussian State-Space Models (LGSSMs)1 are fundamental in time-series analysis [1, 2, 3]. In these models the observations v1:T 2 are generated from an underlying dynamical system on h1:T according to: v v vt = Bht + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0V , ΣV ), h h ht = Aht−1 + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0H , ΣH ) , where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian with mean µ and covariance Σ, and 0X denotes an Xdimensional zero vector. The observation vt has dimension V and the hidden state ht has dimension H. Probabilistically, the LGSSM is deﬁned by: T p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ) = p(v1 |h1 )p(h1 ) p(vt |ht )p(ht |ht−1 ), t=2 with p(vt |ht ) = N (Bht , ΣV ), p(ht |ht−1 ) = N (Aht−1 , ΣH ), p(h1 ) = N (µ, Σ) and where Θ = {A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ} denotes the model parameters. Because of the widespread use of these models, a Bayesian treatment of parameters is of considerable interest [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. An exact implementation of the Bayesian LGSSM is formally intractable [8], and recently a Variational Bayesian (VB) approximation has been studied [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]. The most challenging part of implementing the VB method is performing inference over h1:T , and previous authors have developed their own specialized routines, based on Belief Propagation, since standard LGSSM inference routines appear, at ﬁrst sight, not to be applicable. 1 2 Also called Kalman Filters/Smoothers, Linear Dynamical Systems. v1:T denotes v1 , . . . , vT . A key contribution of this paper is to show how the Variational Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM can be implemented using standard LGSSM inference routines. Based on the insight we provide, any standard inference method may be applied, including those speciﬁcally addressed to improve numerical stability [2, 10, 11]. In this article, we decided to describe the predictor-corrector and Rauch-Tung-Striebel recursions [2], and also suggest a small modiﬁcation that reduces computational cost. The Bayesian LGSSM is particularly of interest when strong prior constraints are needed to ﬁnd adequate solutions. One such case is in EEG signal analysis, whereby we wish to extract sources that evolve independently through time. Since EEG is particularly noisy [12], a prior that encourages sources to have preferential dynamics is advantageous. This application is discussed in Section 4, and demonstrates the ease of applying our VB framework. 2 Bayesian Linear Gaussian State-Space Models In the Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM, instead of considering the model parameters Θ as ﬁxed, ˆ ˆ we deﬁne a prior distribution p(Θ|Θ), where Θ is a set of hyperparameters. Then: ˆ p(v1:T |Θ) = ˆ p(v1:T |Θ)p(Θ|Θ) . (1) Θ In a full Bayesian treatment we would deﬁne additional prior distributions over the hyperparameters ˆ Θ. Here we take instead the ML-II (‘evidence’) framework, in which the optimal set of hyperpaˆ ˆ rameters is found by maximizing p(v1:T |Θ) with respect to Θ [6, 7, 9]. For the parameter priors, here we deﬁne Gaussians on the columns of A and B 3 : H e− p(A|α, ΣH ) ∝ αj 2 ˆ ( A j −A j ) T ˆ Σ−1 (Aj −Aj ) H H , e− p(B|β, ΣV ) ∝ j=1 βj 2 T ˆ (Bj −Bj ) ˆ Σ−1 (Bj −Bj ) V , j=1 ˆ ˆ which has the effect of biasing the transition and emission matrices to desired forms A and B. The −1 −1 4 conjugate priors for general inverse covariances ΣH and ΣV are Wishart distributions [7] . In the simpler case assumed here of diagonal covariances these become Gamma distributions [5, 7]. The ˆ hyperparameters are then Θ = {α, β}5 . Variational Bayes ˆ Optimizing Eq. (1) with respect to Θ is difﬁcult due to the intractability of the integrals. Instead, in VB, one considers the lower bound [6, 7, 9]6 : ˆ ˆ L = log p(v1:T |Θ) ≥ Hq (Θ, h1:T ) + log p(Θ|Θ) q(Θ) + E(h1:T , Θ) q(Θ,h1:T ) ≡ F, where E(h1:T , Θ) ≡ log p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ). Hd (x) signiﬁes the entropy of the distribution d(x), and · d(x) denotes the expectation operator. The key approximation in VB is q(Θ, h1:T ) ≡ q(Θ)q(h1:T ), from which one may show that, for optimality of F, ˆ E(h1:T ,Θ) q(h1:T ) . q(h1:T ) ∝ e E(h1:T ,Θ) q(Θ) , q(Θ) ∝ p(Θ|Θ)e These coupled equations need to be iterated to convergence. The updates for the parameters q(Θ) are straightforward and are given in Appendices A and B. Once converged, the hyperparameters are ˆ updated by maximizing F with respect to Θ, which lead to simple update formulae [7]. Our main concern is with the update for q(h1:T ), for which this paper makes a departure from treatments previously presented. 3 More general Gaussian priors may be more suitable depending on the application. For expositional simplicity, we do not put priors on µ and Σ. 5 For simplicity, we keep the parameters of the Gamma priors ﬁxed. 6 Strictly we should write throughout q(·|v1:T ). We omit the dependence on v1:T for notational convenience. 4 Uniﬁed Inference on q(h1:T ) 3 Optimally q(h1:T ) is Gaussian since, up to a constant, E(h1:T , Θ) − 1 2 q(Θ) is quadratic in h1:T 7 : T T (vt −Bht )T Σ−1 (vt −Bht ) V q(B,ΣV ) + (ht −Aht−1 ) Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H t=1 q(A,ΣH ) . (2) In addition, optimally, q(A|ΣH ) and q(B|ΣV ) are Gaussians (see Appendix A), so we can easily carry out the averages in Eq. (2). The further averages over q(ΣH ) and q(ΣV ) are also easy due to conjugacy. Whilst this deﬁnes the distribution q(h1:T ), quantities such as q(ht ), required for example for the parameter updates (see the Appendices), need to be inferred from this distribution. Clearly, in the non-Bayesian case, the averages over the parameters are not present, and the above simply represents the posterior distribution of an LGSSM whose visible variables have been clamped into their evidential states. In that case, inference can be performed using any standard LGSSM routine. Our aim, therefore, is to try to represent the averaged Eq. (2) directly as the posterior distribution q (h1:T |˜1:T ) of an LGSSM , for some suitable parameter settings. ˜ v Mean + Fluctuation Decomposition A useful decomposition is to write (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT SB ht , t V q(B,ΣV ) f luctuation mean and similarly (ht −Aht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H = (ht − A ht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht − A ht−1 ) +hT SA ht−1 , t−1 H q(A,ΣH ) mean f luctuation T −1 where the parameter covariances are SB ≡ B T Σ−1 B − B Σ−1 B = V HB and SA ≡ V V T −1 −1 −1 AT ΣH A − A ΣH A = HHA (for HA and HB deﬁned in Appendix A). The mean terms simply represent a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. However, the extra contributions from the ﬂuctuations mean that Eq. (2) cannot be written as a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. In order to deal with these extra terms, our idea is to treat the ﬂuctuations as arising from an augmented visible variable, for which Eq. (2) can then be considered as a clamped LGSSM. Inference Using an Augmented LGSSM To represent Eq. (2) as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), we may augment vt and B as8 : ˜ v vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0H ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UB ), T where UA is the Cholesky decomposition of SA , so that UA UA = SA . Similarly, UB is the Cholesky decomposition of SB . The equivalent LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is then completed by specifying9 ˜ v ˜ A≡ A , ˜ ΣH ≡ Σ−1 H −1 , ˜ ΣV ≡ diag( Σ−1 V −1 , IH , IH ), µ ≡ µ, ˜ ˜ Σ ≡ Σ. The validity of this parameter assignment can be checked by showing that, up to negligible constants, the exponent of this augmented LGSSM has the same form as Eq. (2)10 . Now that this has been written as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), standard inference routines in the literature may be applied to ˜ v compute q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) [1, 2, 11]11 . ˜ v 7 For simplicity of exposition, we ignore the ﬁrst time-point here. The notation vert(x1 , . . . , xn ) stands for vertically concatenating the arguments x1 , . . . , xn . 9 ˜ ˜ ˜ Strictly, we need a time-dependent emission Bt = B, for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. For time T , BT has the Cholesky factor UA replaced by 0H,H . 10 There are several ways of achieving a similar augmentation. We chose this since, in the non-Bayesian limit UA = UB = 0H,H , no numerical instabilities would be introduced. 11 Note that, since the augmented LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is designed to match the fully clamped distribution ˜ v q(h1:T |v1:T ), the ﬁltered posterior q (ht |˜1:t ) does not correspond to q(ht |v1:t ). ˜ v 8 Algorithm 1 LGSSM: Forward and backward recursive updates.

These are given in Algorithm 1, where q (ht |˜1:T ) is computed by calling the FORWARD and BACKWARD procedures. ˜ v We present two variants of the FORWARD pass. Either we may call procedure FORWARD in ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Algorithm 1 with parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ and the augmented visible variables vt in which ˜ we use steps 1a, 2a, 5a and 6a. This is exactly the predictor-corrector form of a Kalman Filter [2]. Otherwise, in order to reduce the computational cost, we may call procedure FORWARD with the −1 ˜ ˜ parameters A, B , ΣH , Σ−1 , µ, Σ and the original visible variable vt in which we use steps ˜ ˜ V T 1b (where UAB UAB ≡ SA +SB ), 2b, 5b and 6b. The two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Computing q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) is then completed by calling the common BACKWARD pass. ˜ v The important point here is that the reader may supply any standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing routine, and simply call it with the appropriate parameters. In some parameter regimes, or in very long time-series, numerical stability may be a serious concern, for which several stabilized algorithms have been developed over the years, for example the square-root forms [2, 10, 11]. By converting the problem to a standard form, we have therefore uniﬁed and simpliﬁed inference, so that future applications may be more readily developed12 . 3.1 Relation to Previous Approaches An alternative approach to the one above, and taken in [5, 7], is to write the posterior as T log q(h1:T ) = φt (ht−1 , ht ) + const. t=2 for suitably deﬁned quadratic forms φt (ht−1 , ht ). Here the potentials φt (ht−1 , ht ) encode the averaging over the parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV . The approach taken in [7] is to recognize this as a 12 The computation of the log-likelihood bound does not require any augmentation. pairwise Markov chain, for which the Belief Propagation recursions may be applied. The approach in [5] is based on a Kullback-Leibler minimization of the posterior with a chain structure, which is algorithmically equivalent to Belief Propagation. Whilst mathematically valid procedures, the resulting algorithms do not correspond to any of the standard forms in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, whose properties have been well studied [14]. 4 An Application to Bayesian ICA A particular case for which the Bayesian LGSSM is of interest is in extracting independent source signals underlying a multivariate timeseries [5, 15]. This will demonstrate how the approach developed in Section 3 makes VB easily to apply. The sources si are modeled as independent in the following sense: p(si , sj ) = p(si )p(sj ), 1:T 1:T 1:T 1:T for i = j, i, j = 1, . . . , C. Independence implies block diagonal transition and state noise matrices A, ΣH and Σ, where each block c has dimension Hc . A one dimensional source sc for each independent dynamical subsystem is then t formed from sc = 1T hc , where 1c is a unit vector and hc is the state of t c t t dynamical system c. Combining the sources, we can write st = P ht , where P = diag(1T , . . . , 1T ), ht = vert(h1 , . . . , hC ). The resulting 1 C t t emission matrix is constrained to be of the form B = W P , where W is the V × C mixing matrix. This means that the observations v are formed from linearly mixing the sources, vt = W st + ηt . The Figure 1: The structure of graphical structure of this model is presented in Fig 1. To encourage redundant components to be removed, we place a zero mean Gaussian the LGSSM for ICA. prior on W . In this case, we do not deﬁne a prior for the parameters ΣH and ΣV which are instead considered as hyperparameters. More details of the model are given in [15]. The constraint B = W P requires a minor modiﬁcation from Section 3, as we discuss below. Inference on q(h1:T ) A small modiﬁcation of the mean + ﬂuctuation decomposition for B occurs, namely: (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V q(W ) = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT P T SW P ht , t V −1 where B ≡ W P and SW = V HW . The quantities W and HW are obtained as in Appendix A.1 with the replacement ht ← P ht . To represent the above as a LGSSM, we augment vt and B as vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0C ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UW P ), where UW is the Cholesky decomposition of SW . The equivalent LGSSM is then completed by ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ specifying A ≡ A , ΣH ≡ ΣH , ΣV ≡ diag(ΣV , IH , IC ), µ ≡ µ, Σ ≡ Σ, and inference for ˜ q(h1:T ) performed using Algorithm 1. This demonstrates the elegance and unity of the approach in Section 3, since no new algorithm needs to be developed to perform inference, even in this special constrained parameter case. 4.1 Demonstration As a simple demonstration, we used an LGSSM to generate 3 sources sc with random 5×5 transition t matrices Ac , µ = 0H and Σ ≡ ΣH ≡ IH . The sources were mixed into three observations v vt = W st + ηt , for W chosen with elements from a zero mean unit variance Gaussian distribution, and ΣV = IV . We then trained a Bayesian LGSSM with 5 sources and 7 × 7 transition matrices Ac . ˆ To bias the model to ﬁnd the simplest sources, we used Ac ≡ 0Hc ,Hc for all sources. In Fig2a and Fig 2b we see the original sources and the noisy observations respectively. In Fig2c we see the estimated sources from our method after convergence of the hyperparameter updates. Two of the 5 sources have been removed, and the remaining three are a reasonable estimation of the original sources. Another possible approach for introducing prior knowledge is to use a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 (a) 150 200 250 300 0 50 (b) 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 (c) 100 150 200 250 300 (d) Figure 2: (a) Original sources st .

However, it is not clear how to reliably ﬁnd the hyperparameters α and β in this case. One solution is to estimate them by optimizing the new objective function jointly with respect to the parameters and hyperparameters (this is the so-called joint map estimation – see for example [16]). A typical result of using this joint MAP approach on the artiﬁcial data is presented in Fig 2d. The joint MAP does not estimate the hyperparameters well, and the incorrect number of sources is identiﬁed. 4.2 Application to EEG Analysis In Fig 3a we plot three seconds of EEG data recorded from 4 channels (located in the right hemisphere) while a person is performing imagined movement of the right hand. As is typical in EEG, each channel shows drift terms below 1 Hz which correspond to artifacts of the instrumentation, together with the presence of 50 Hz mains contamination and masks the rhythmical activity related to the mental task, mainly centered at 10 and 20 Hz [17]. We would therefore like a method which enables us to extract components in these information-rich 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands. Standard ICA methods such as FastICA do not ﬁnd satisfactory sources based on raw ‘noisy’ data, and preprocessing with band-pass ﬁlters is usually required. Additionally, in EEG research, ﬂexibility in the number of recovered sources is important since there may be many independent oscillators of interest underlying the observations and we would like some way to automatically determine their effective number. To preferentially ﬁnd sources at particular frequencies, we speciﬁed a block ˆ diagonal matrix Ac for each source c, where each block is a 2 × 2 rotation matrix at the desired frequency. We deﬁned the following 16 groups of frequencies: [0.5], [0.5], [0.5], [0.5]; [10,11], [10,11], [10,11], [10,11]; [20,21], [20,21], [20,21], [20,21]; [50], [50], [50], [50]. The temporal evolution of the sources obtained after training the Bayesian LGSSM is given in Fig3(b,c,d,e) (grouped by frequency range). The Bayes LGSSM removed 4 unnecessary sources from the mixing matrix W , that is one [10,11] Hz and three [20,21] Hz sources. The ﬁrst 4 sources contain dominant low frequency drift, sources 5, 6 and 8 contain [10,11] Hz, while source 10 contains [20,21] Hz centered activity. Of the 4 sources initialized to 50 Hz, only 2 retained 50 Hz activity, while the Ac of the other two have changed to model other frequencies present in the EEG. This method demonstrates the usefulness and applicability of the VB method in a real-world situation. 5 Conclusion We considered the application of Variational Bayesian learning to Linear Gaussian State-Space Models. This is an important class of models with widespread application, and ﬁnding a simple way to implement this approximate Bayesian procedure is of considerable interest. The most demanding part of the procedure is inference of the hidden states of the model. Previously, this has been achieved using Belief Propagation, which differs from inference in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, for which highly efﬁcient and stabilized procedures exist. A central contribution of this paper is to show how inference can be written using the standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions by augmenting the original model. Additionally, a minor modiﬁcation to the standard Kalman Filtering routine may be applied for computational efﬁciency. We demonstrated the elegance and unity of our approach by showing how to easily apply a Variational Bayes analysis of temporal ICA. Speciﬁcally, our Bayes ICA approach successfully extracts independent processes underlying EEG signals, biased towards preferred frequency ranges. We hope that this simple and unifying interpretation of Variational Bayesian LGSSMs may therefore facilitate the further application to related models. A A.1 Parameter Updates for A and B Determining q(B|ΣV ) By examining F, the contribution of q(B|ΣV ) can be interpreted as the negative KL divergence between q(B|ΣV ) and a Gaussian. Hence, optimally, q(B|ΣV ) is a Gaussian. The covariance [ΣB ]ij,kl ≡ Bij − Bij Bkl − Bkl (averages wrt q(B|ΣV )) is given by: T hj hl t t −1 [ΣB ]ij,kl = [HB ]jl [ΣV ]ik , where [HB ]jl ≡ t=1 −1 The mean is given by B = NB HB , where [NB ]ij ≡ T t=1 hj t q(ht ) q(ht ) + βj δjl . i ˆ vt + βj Bij .

Covariance Updates By specifying a Wishart prior for the inverse of the covariances, conjugate update formulae are possible. In practice, it is more common to specify diagonal inverse covariances, for which the corresponding priors are simply Gamma distributions [7, 5]. For this simple diagonal case, the explicit updates are given below. Determining q(ΣV ) For the constraint Σ−1 = diag(ρ), where each diagonal element follows a Gamma prior V Ga(b1 , b2 ) [7], q(ρ) factorizes and the optimal updates are  q(ρi ) = Ga b1 + where GB ≡ −1 T NB HB NB .   T T 1 i , b2 +  (vt )2 − [GB ]ii + 2 2 t=1 j ˆ2 βj Bij  , Determining q(ΣH ) Analogously, for Σ−1 = diag(τ ) with prior Ga(a1 , a2 ) [5], the updates are H    T T −1 1 ˆij , a2 + (hi )2 − [GA ]ii + αj A2  , q(τi ) = Ga a1 + t 2 2 t=2 j −1 T where GA ≡ NA HA NA .

We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space.

We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>4 0.60715437 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Novel_Gaussian_Sum_Smoother_for_Approximate_Inference_in_Switching_Linear_Dynamical_Systems.html">10 nips-2006-A Novel Gaussian Sum Smoother for Approximate Inference in Switching Linear Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: David Barber, Bertrand Mesot</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a method for approximate smoothed inference in a class of switching linear dynamical systems, based on a novel form of Gaussian Sum smoother. This class includes the switching Kalman Filter and the more general case of switch transitions dependent on the continuous latent state. The method improves on the standard Kim smoothing approach by dispensing with one of the key approximations, thus making fuller use of the available future information. Whilst the only central assumption required is projection to a mixture of Gaussians, we show that an additional conditional independence assumption results in a simpler but stable and accurate alternative. Unlike the alternative unstable Expectation Propagation procedure, our method consists only of a single forward and backward pass and is reminiscent of the standard smoothing ‘correction’ recursions in the simpler linear dynamical system. The algorithm performs well on both toy experiments and in a large scale application to noise robust speech recognition. 1 Switching Linear Dynamical System The Linear Dynamical System (LDS) [1] is a key temporal model in which a latent linear process generates the observed series. For complex time-series which are not well described globally by a single LDS, we may break the time-series into segments, each modeled by a potentially different LDS. This is the basis for the Switching LDS (SLDS) [2, 3, 4, 5] where, for each time t, a switch variable st ∈ 1, . . . , S describes which of the LDSs is to be used. The observation (or ‘visible’) vt ∈ RV is linearly related to the hidden state ht ∈ RH with additive noise η by vt = B(st )ht + η v (st ) p(vt |ht , st ) = N (B(st )ht , Σv (st )) ≡ (1) where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and covariance Σ. The transition dynamics of the continuous hidden state ht is linear, ht = A(st )ht−1 + η h (st ), ≡ p(ht |ht−1 , st ) = N A(st )ht−1 , Σh (st ) (2) The switch st may depend on both the previous st−1 and ht−1 . This is an augmented SLDS (aSLDS), and deﬁnes the model T p(vt |ht , st )p(ht |ht−1 , st )p(st |ht−1 , st−1 ) p(v1:T , h1:T , s1:T ) = t=1 The standard SLDS[4] considers only switch transitions p(st |st−1 ). At time t = 1, p(s1 |h0 , s0 ) simply denotes the prior p(s1 ), and p(h1 |h0 , s1 ) denotes p(h1 |s1 ). The aim of this article is to address how to perform inference in the aSLDS. In particular we desire the ﬁltered estimate p(ht , st |v1:t ) and the smoothed estimate p(ht , st |v1:T ), for any 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Both ﬁltered and smoothed inference in the SLDS is intractable, scaling exponentially with time [4]. s1 s2 s3 s4 h1 h2 h3 h4 v1 v2 v3 v4 Figure 1: The independence structure of the aSLDS. Square nodes denote discrete variables, round nodes continuous variables. In the SLDS links from h to s are not normally considered. 2 Expectation Correction Our approach to approximate p(ht , st |v1:T ) mirrors the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ‘correction’ smoother for the simpler LDS [1].The method consists of a single forward pass to recursively ﬁnd the ﬁltered posterior p(ht , st |v1:t ), followed by a single backward pass to correct this into a smoothed posterior p(ht , st |v1:T ). The forward pass we use is equivalent to standard Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) [6]. The main contribution of this paper is a novel form of backward pass, based only on collapsing the smoothed posterior to a mixture of Gaussians. Together with the ADF forward pass, we call the method Expectation Correction, since it corrects the moments found from the forward pass. A more detailed description of the method, including pseudocode, is given in [7]. 2.1 Forward Pass (Filtering) Readers familiar with ADF may wish to continue directly to Section (2.2). Our aim is to form a recursion for p(st , ht |v1:t ), based on a Gaussian mixture approximation of p(ht |st , v1:t ). Without loss of generality, we may decompose the ﬁltered posterior as p(ht , st |v1:t ) = p(ht |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (3) The exact representation of p(ht |st , v1:t ) is a mixture with O(S t ) components. We therefore approximate this with a smaller I-component mixture I p(ht |st , v1:t ) ≈ p(ht |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t ) it =1 where p(ht |it , st , v1:t ) is a Gaussian parameterized with mean f (it , st ) and covariance F (it , st ). To ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters, consider p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) = p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) (4) st ,it Evaluating p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) We ﬁnd p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) by ﬁrst computing the joint distribution p(ht+1 , vt+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t ), which is a Gaussian with covariance and mean elements, Σhh = A(st+1 )F (it , st )AT (st+1 ) + Σh (st+1 ), Σvv = B(st+1 )Σhh B T (st+1 ) + Σv (st+1 ) Σvh = B(st+1 )F (it , st ), µv = B(st+1 )A(st+1 )f (it , st ), µh = A(st+1 )f (it , st ) (5) and then conditioning on vt+1 1 . For the case S = 1, this forms the usual Kalman Filter recursions[1]. Evaluating p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) The mixture weight in (4) can be found from the decomposition p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (6) 1 p(x|y) is a Gaussian with mean µx + Σxy Σ−1 (y − µy ) and covariance Σxx − Σxy Σ−1 Σyx . yy yy The ﬁrst factor in (6), p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t ) is a Gaussian with mean µv and covariance Σvv , as given in (5). The last two factors p(it |st , v1:t ) and p(st |v1:t ) are given from the previous iteration. Finally, p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) is found from p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) = p(st+1 |ht , st ) p(ht |it ,st ,v1:t ) (7) where · p denotes expectation with respect to p. In the SLDS, (7) is replaced by the Markov transition p(st+1 |st ). In the aSLDS, however, (7) will generally need to be computed numerically. Closing the recursion We are now in a position to calculate (4). For each setting of the variable st+1 , we have a mixture of I × S Gaussians which we numerically collapse back to I Gaussians to form I p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ≈ p(ht+1 |it+1 , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) it+1 =1 Any method of choice may be supplied to collapse a mixture to a smaller mixture; our code simply repeatedly merges low-weight components. In this way the new mixture coefﬁcients p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ), it+1 ∈ 1, . . . , I are deﬁned, completing the description of how to form a recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) in (3). A recursion for the switch variable is given by p(st+1 |v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |st+1 , it , st , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) st ,it where all terms have been computed during the recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ). The likelihood p(v1:T ) may be found by recursing p(v1:t+1 ) = p(vt+1 |v1:t )p(v1:t ), where p(vt+1 |vt ) = p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) it ,st ,st+1 2.2 Backward Pass (Smoothing) The main contribution of this paper is to ﬁnd a suitable way to ‘correct’ the ﬁltered posterior p(st , ht |v1:t ) obtained from the forward pass into a smoothed posterior p(st , ht |v1:T ). We derive this for the case of a single Gaussian representation. The extension to the mixture case is straightforward and presented in [7]. We approximate the smoothed posterior p(ht |st , v1:T ) by a Gaussian with mean g(st ) and covariance G(st ) and our aim is to ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters. A useful starting point for a recursion is: p(st+1 |v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht , st |v1:T ) = st+1 The term p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) may be computed as p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) = p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) (8) ht+1 The recursion therefore requires p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ), which we can write as p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ∝ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) (9) The difﬁculty here is that the functional form of p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) is not squared exponential in ht+1 , so that p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be Gaussian2 . One possibility would be to approximate the non-Gaussian p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) by a Gaussian (or mixture thereof) by minimizing the Kullback-Leilbler divergence between the two, or performing moment matching in the case of a single Gaussian. A simpler alternative (which forms ‘standard’ EC) is to make the assumption p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), where p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) is already known from the previous backward recursion. Under this assumption, the recursion becomes p(ht , st |v1:T ) ≈ p(st+1 |v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (10) st+1 2 In the exact calculation, p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) is a mixture of Gaussians, see [7]. However, since in (9) the two terms p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) will only be approximately computed during the recursion, our approximation to p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be a mixture of Gaussians. Evaluating p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian in ht , whose statistics we will now compute. First we ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) which may be obtained from the joint distribution p(ht , ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |ht , st+1 )p(ht |st , v1:t ) (11) which itself can be found from a forward dynamics from the ﬁltered estimate p(ht |st , v1:t ). The statistics for the marginal p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:t ) are simply those of p(ht |st , v1:t ), since st+1 carries no extra information about ht . The remaining statistics are the mean of ht+1 , the covariance of ht+1 and cross-variance between ht and ht+1 , which are given by ht+1 = A(st+1 )ft (st ), Σt+1,t+1 = A(st+1 )Ft (st )AT (st+1 )+Σh (st+1 ), Σt+1,t = A(st+1 )Ft (st ) Given the statistics of (11), we may now condition on ht+1 to ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ). Doing so effectively constitutes a reversal of the dynamics, ← − − ht = A (st , st+1 )ht+1 + ←(st , st+1 ) η ← − ← − − − where A (st , st+1 ) and ←(st , st+1 ) ∼ N (← t , st+1 ), Σ (st , st+1 )) are easily found using η m(s conditioning. Averaging the above reversed dynamics over p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), we ﬁnd that p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian with statistics ← − ← − ← − ← − − µt = A (st , st+1 )g(st+1 )+← t , st+1 ), Σt,t = A (st , st+1 )G(st+1 ) A T (st , st+1 )+ Σ (st , st+1 ) m(s These equations directly mirror the standard RTS backward pass[1]. Evaluating p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) The main departure of EC from previous methods is in treating the term p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) = p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (12) The term p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) is given by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) ′ ′ s′ p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) (13) t Here p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ), where p(st+1 |st , v1:t ) occurs in the forward pass, (7). In (13), p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t ) is found by marginalizing (11). Computing the average of (13) with respect to p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) may be achieved by any numerical integration method desired. A simple approximation is to evaluate the integrand at the mean value of the averaging distribution p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ). More sophisticated methods (see [7]) such as sampling from the Gaussian p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) have the advantage that covariance information is used3 . Closing the Recursion We have now computed both the continuous and discrete factors in (8), which we wish to use to write the smoothed estimate in the form p(ht , st |v1:T ) = p(st |v1:T )p(ht |st , v1:T ). The distribution p(ht |st , v1:T ) is readily obtained from the joint (8) by conditioning on st to form the mixture p(ht |st , v1:T ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) st+1 which may then be collapsed to a single Gaussian (the mixture case is discussed in [7]). The smoothed posterior p(st |v1:T ) is given by p(st |v1:T ) = p(st+1 |v1:T ) p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) . (14) st+1 3 This is a form of exact sampling since drawing samples from a Gaussian is easy. This should not be confused with meaning that this use of sampling renders EC a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme. 2.3 Relation to other methods The EC Backward pass is closely related to Kim’s method [8]. In both EC and Kim’s method, the approximation p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), is used to form a numerically simple backward pass. The other ‘approximation’ in EC is to numerically compute the average in (14). In Kim’s method, however, an update for the discrete variables is formed by replacing the required term in (14) by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) ≈ p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) (15) Since p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) ∝ p(st+1 |st )p(st |v1:t )/p(st+1 |v1:t ), this can be computed simply from the ﬁltered results alone. The fundamental difference therefore between EC and Kim’s method is that the approximation, (15), is not required by EC. The EC backward pass therefore makes fuller use of the future information, resulting in a recursion which intimately couples the continuous and discrete variables. The resulting effect on the quality of the approximation can be profound, as we will see in the experiments. The Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm makes the central assumption of collapsing the posteriors to a Gaussian family [5]; the collapse is deﬁned by a consistency criterion on overlapping marginals. In our experiments, we take the approach in [9] of collapsing to a single Gaussian. Ensuring consistency requires frequent translations between moment and canonical parameterizations, which is the origin of potentially severe numerical instability [10]. In contrast, EC works largely with moment parameterizations of Gaussians, for which relatively few numerical difﬁculties arise. Unlike EP, EC is not based on a consistency criterion and a subtle issue arises about possible inconsistencies in the Forward and Backward approximations for EC. For example, under the conditional independence assumption in the Backward Pass, p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) ≈ p(hT |sT , v1:T ), which is in contradiction to (5) which states that the approximation to p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) will depend on sT −1 . Such potential inconsistencies arise because of the approximations made, and should not be considered as separate approximations in themselves. Rather than using a global (consistency) objective, EC attempts to faithfully approximate the exact Forward and Backward propagation routines. For this reason, as in the exact computation, only a single Forward and Backward pass are required in EC. In [11] a related dynamics reversed is proposed. However, the singularities resulting from incorrectly treating p(vt+1:T |ht , st ) as a density are heuristically ﬁnessed. In [12] a variational method approximates the joint distribution p(h1:T , s1:T |v1:T ) rather than the marginal inference p(ht , st |v1:T ). This is a disadvantage when compared to other methods that directly approximate the marginal. Sequential Monte Carlo methods (Particle Filters)[13], are essentially mixture of delta-function approximations. Whilst potentially powerful, these typically suffer in high-dimensional hidden spaces, unless techniques such as Rao-Blackwellization are performed. ADF is generally preferential to Particle Filtering since in ADF the approximation is a mixture of non-trivial distributions, and is therefore more able to represent the posterior. 3 Demonstration Testing EC in a problem with a reasonably long temporal sequence, T , is important since numerical instabilities may not be apparent in timeseries of just a few points. To do this, we sequentially generate hidden and visible states from a given model, here with H = 3, S = 2, V = 1 – see Figure(2) for full details of the experimental setup. Then, given only the parameters of the model and the visible observations (but not any of the hidden states h1:T , s1:T ), the task is to infer p(ht |st , v1:T ) and p(st |v1:T ). Since the exact computation is exponential in T , a simple alternative is to assume that the original sample states s1:T are the ‘correct’ inferences, and compare how our most probable posterior smoothed estimates arg maxst p(st |v1:T ) compare with the assumed correct sample st . We chose conditions that, from the viewpoint of classical signal processing, are difﬁcult, with changes in the switches occurring at a much higher rate than the typical frequencies in the signal vt . For EC we use the mean approximation for the numerical integration of (12). We included the Particle Filter merely for a point of comparison with ADF, since they are not designed to approximate PF RBPF EP ADFS KimS ECS ADFM KimM ECM 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 Figure 2: The number of errors in estimating p(st |v1:T ) for a binary switch (S = 2) over a time series of length T = 100.

For the RaoBlackwellized Particle Filter [13], 500 particles were used, with Kitagawa resampling. We found that EP4 was numerically unstable and often struggled to converge. To encourage convergence, we used the damping method in [9], performing 20 iterations with a damping factor of 0.5. Nevertheless, the disappointing performance of EP is most likely due to conﬂicts resulting from numerical instabilities introduced by the frequent conversions between moment and canonical representations. The best ﬁltered results are given using ADF, since this is better able to represent the variance in the ﬁltered posterior than the sampling methods. Unlike Kim’s method, EC makes good use of the future information to clean up the ﬁltered results considerably. One should bear in mind that both EC and Kim’s method use the same ADF ﬁltered results. This demonstrates that EC may dramatically improve on Kim’s method, so that the small amount of extra work in making a numerical approximation of p(st |st+1 , v1:T ), (12), may bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts. We found similar conclusions for experiments with an aSLDS[7]. 4 Application to Noise Robust ASR Here we brieﬂy present an application of the SLDS to robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for which the intractable inference is performed by EC, and serves to demonstrate how EC scales well to a large-scale application. Fuller details are given in [14]. The standard approach to noise robust ASR is to provide a set of noise-robust features to a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classiﬁer, which is based on modeling the acoustic feature vector. For example, the method of Unsupervised Spectral Subtraction (USS) [15] provides state-of-the-art performance in this respect. Incorporating noise models directly into such feature-based HMM systems is difﬁcult, mainly because the explicit inﬂuence of the noise on the features is poorly understood. An alternative is to model the raw speech signal directly, such as the SAR-HMM model [16] for which, under clean conditions, isolated spoken digit recognition performs well. However, the SAR-HMM performs poorly under noisy conditions, since no explicit noise processes are taken into account by the model. The approach we take here is to extend the SAR-HMM to include an explicit noise process, so that h the observed signal vt is modeled as a noise corrupted version of a clean hidden signal vt : h vt = vt + ηt ˜ 4 with ηt ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) ˜ ˜ Generalized EP [5], which groups variables together improves on the results, but is still far inferior to the EC results presented here – Onno Zoeter personal communication.

The dynamics of the clean signal is modeled by a switching AR process R h vt = h h cr (st )vt−r + ηt (st ), h ηt (st ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (st )) r=1 where st ∈ {1, . . . , S} denotes which of a set of AR coefﬁcients cr (st ) are to be used at time t, h and ηt (st ) is the so-called innovation noise. When σ 2 (st ) ≡ 0, this model reproduces the SARHMM of [16], a specially constrained HMM. Hence inference and learning for the SAR-HMM are tractable and straightforward. For the case σ 2 (st ) > 0 the model can be recast as an SLDS. To do this we deﬁne ht as a vector which contains the R most recent clean hidden samples ht = h vt h . . . vt−r+1 T (16) and we set A(st ) to be an R × R matrix where the ﬁrst row contains the AR coefﬁcients −cr (st ) and the rest is a shifted down identity matrix. For example, for a third order (R = 3) AR process, A(st ) = −c1 (st ) −c2 (st ) −c3 (st ) 1 0 0 0 1 0 . (17) The hidden covariance matrix Σh (s) has all elements zero, except the top-left most which is set to the innovation variance. To extract the ﬁrst component of ht we use the (switch independent) 1 × R projection matrix B = [ 1 0 . . . 0 ]. The (switch independent) visible scalar noise 2 variance is given by Σv ≡ σv . A well-known issue with raw speech signal models is that the energy of a signal may vary from one speaker to another or because of a change in recording conditions. For this reason the innovation Σh is adjusted by maximizing the likelihood of an observed sequence with respect to the innovation covariance, a process called Gain Adaptation [16]. 4.1 Training & Evaluation Following [16], we trained a separate SAR-HMM for each of the eleven digits (0–9 and ‘oh’) from the TI-DIGITS database [17]. The training set for each digit was composed of 110 single digit utterances down-sampled to 8 kHz, each one pronounced by a male speaker. Each SAR-HMM was composed of ten states with a left-right transition matrix. Each state was associated with a 10thorder AR process and the model was constrained to stay an integer multiple of K = 140 time steps (0.0175 seconds) in the same state. We refer the reader to [16] for a detailed explanation of the training procedure used with the SAR-HMM. An AR-SLDS was built for each of the eleven digits by copying the parameters of the corresponding trained SAR-HMM, i.e., the AR coefﬁcients cr (s) are copied into the ﬁrst row of the hidden transition matrix A(s) and the same discrete transition distribution p(st | st−1 ) is used. The models were then evaluated on a test set composed of 112 corrupted utterances of each of the eleven digits, each pronounced by different male speakers than those used in the training set. The recognition accuracy obtained by the models on the corrupted test sets is presented in Table 1. As expected, the performance of the SAR-HMM rapidly decreases with noise. The feature-based HMM with USS has high accuracy only for high SNR levels. In contrast, the AR-SLDS achieves a recognition accuracy of 61.2% at a SNR close to 0 dB, while the performance of the two other methods is equivalent to random guessing (9.1%). Whilst other inference methods may also perform well in this case, we found that EC performs admirably, without numerical instabilities, even for time-series with several thousand time-steps. 5 Discussion We presented a method for approximate smoothed inference in an augmented class of switching linear dynamical systems. Our approximation is based on the idea that due to the forgetting which commonly occurs in Markovian models, a ﬁnite number of mixture components may provide a reasonable approximation. Clearly, in systems with very long correlation times our method may require too many mixture components to produce a satisfactory result, although we are unaware of other techniques that would be able to cope well in that case. The main beneﬁt of EC over Kim smoothing is that future information is more accurately dealt with. Whilst EC is not as general as EP, EC carefully exploits the properties of singly-connected distributions, such as the aSLDS, to provide a numerically stable procedure. We hope that the ideas presented here may therefore help facilitate the practical application of dynamic hybrid networks. Acknowledgements This work is supported by the EU Project FP6-0027787.

<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Wesley Huie, Kin F. Kan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to learn to make sequential stopping decisions, such as those made along a processing pipeline. We envision a scenario in which a series of decisions must be made as to whether to continue to process. Further processing costs time and resources, but may add value. Our goal is to create, based on historic data, a series of decision rules (one at each stage in the pipeline) that decide, based on information gathered up to that point, whether to continue processing the part. We demonstrate how our framework encompasses problems from manufacturing to vision processing. We derive a quadratic (in the number of decisions) bound on testing performance and provide empirical results on object detection. 1 Pipelined Decisions In many decision problems, all of the data do not arrive at the same time. Often further data collection can be expensive and we would like to make a decision without accruing the added cost. Consider silicon wafer manufacturing. The wafer is processed in a series of stages. After each stage some tests are performed to judge the quality of the wafer. If the wafer fails (due to ﬂaws), then the processing time, energy, and materials are wasted. So, we would like to detect such a failure as early as possible in the production pipeline. A similar problem can occur in vision processing. Consider the case of object detection in images. Often low-level pixel operations (such as downsampling an image) can be performed in parallel by dedicated hardware (on a video capture board, for example). However, searching each subimage patch of the whole image to test whether it is the object in question takes time that is proportional to the number of pixels. Therefore, we can imagine a image pipeline in which low resolution versions of the whole image are scanned ﬁrst. Subimages which are extremely unlikely to contain the desired object are rejected and only those which pass are processed at higher resolution. In this way, we save on many pixel operations and can reduce the cost in time to process an image. Even if downsampling is not possible through dedicated hardware, for most object detection schemes, the image must be downsampled to form an image pyramid in order to search for the object at different scales. Therefore, we can run the early stages of such a pipelined detector at the low resolution versions of the image and throw out large regions of the high resolution versions. Most of the processing is spent searching for small faces (at the high resolutions), so this method can save a lot of processing. Such chained decisions also occur if there is a human in the decision process (to ask further clarifying questions in database search, for instance). We propose a framework that can model all of these scenarios and allow such decision rules to be learned from historic data. We give a learning algorithm based on the minimization of the exponential loss and conclude with some experimental results. 1.1 Problem Formulation Let there be s stages to the processing pipeline. We assume that there is a static distribution from which the parts, objects, or units to be processed are drawn. Let p(x, c) represent this distribution in which x is a vector of the features of this unit and c represents the costs associated with this unit. In particular, let xi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the set of measurements (features) available to the decision maker immediately following stage i. Let c i (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the cost of rejecting (or stopping the processing of) this unit immediately following stage i. Finally, let c s+1 be the cost of allowing the part to pass through all processing stages. Note that ci need not be monotonic in i. To take our wafer manufacturing example, for wafers that are good we might let c i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, indicating that if a wafer is rejected at any stage, one unit of work has been invested for each stage of processing. For the same good wafers, we might let cs+1 = s − 1000, indicating that the value of a completed wafer is 1000 units and therefore the total cost is the processing cost minus the resulting value. For a ﬂawed wafer, the values might be the same, except for c s+1 which we would set to s, indicating that there is no value for a bad wafer. Note that the costs may be either positive or negative. However, only their relative values are important. Once a part has been drawn from the distribution, there is no way of affecting the “base level” for the value of the part. Therefore, we assume for the remainder of this paper that c i ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s + 1 and that ci = 0 for some value of i (between 1 and s + 1). Our goal is to produce a series of decision rules f i (xi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We let fi have a range of {0, 1} and let 0 indicate that processing should continue and 1 indicate that processing should be halted. We let f denote the collection of these s decision rules and augment the collection with an additional rule f s+1 which is identically 1 (for ease of notation). The cost of using these rules to halt processing an example is therefore s+1 i−1 ci fi (xi ) L(f (x), c) = i=1 (1 − fj (xj )) . j=1 We would like to ﬁnd a set of decision rules that minimize E p [L(f (x), c)]. While p(x, c) is not known, we do have a series of samples (training set) D = {(x1 , c1 ), (x2 , c2 ), . . . , (xn , cn )} of n examples drawn from the distribution p. We use superscripts to denote the example index and subscripts to denote the stage index. 2 Boosting Solution For this paper, we consider constructing the rules f i from simpler decision rules, much as in the Adaboost algorithm [1, 2]. We assume that each decision f i (xi ) is computed as the threshold of another function g i (xi ): fi (xi ) = I(gi (xi ) > 0).1 We bound the empirical risk: n n s+1 L(f (xk ), ck ) = i−1 ck I(gi (xk ) > 0) i i k=1 i=1 k=1 n s+1 j=1 k i−1 ck egi (xi ) i ≤ k=1 i=1 I(gj (xk ) ≤ 0) j k n s+1 j=1 k ck egi (xi )− i e−gj (xj ) = Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j . (1) k=1 i=1 Our decision to make all costs positive ensures that the bounds hold. Our decision to make the optimal cost zero helps to ensure that the bound is reasonably tight. As in boosting, we restrict g i (xi ) to take the form mi αi,l hi,l (xi ), the weighted sum of m i subl=1 classiﬁers, each of which returns either −1 or +1. We will construct these weighted sums incrementally and greedily, adding one additional subclassiﬁer and associated weight at each step. We will pick the stage, weight, and function of the subclassiﬁer in order to make the largest negative change in the exponential bound to the empirical risk. The subclassiﬁers, h i,l will be drawn from a small class of hypotheses, H. 1 I is the indicator function that equals 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. 1. Initialize gi (x) = 0 for all stages i k 2. Initialize wi = ck for all stages i and examples k. i 3. For each stage i: (a) Calculate targets for each training example, as shown in equation 5. (b) Let h be the result of running the base learner on this set. (c) Calculate the corresponding α as per equation 3. (d) Score this classiﬁcation as per equation 4 ¯ 4. Select the stage ¯ with the best (highest) score. Let h and α be the classiﬁer and ı ¯ weight found at that stage. ¯¯ 5. Let g¯(x) ← g¯(x) + αh(x). ı ı 6. Update the weights (see equation 2): ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, multiply w¯ by eαh(x¯ ) . ı ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, j > ¯, multiply wj by e−αh(x¯ ) . ı 7. Repeat from step 3 Figure 1: Chained Boosting Algorithm 2.1 Weight Optimization We ﬁrst assume that the stage at which to add a new subclassiﬁer and the subclassiﬁer to add have ¯ ¯ already been chosen: ¯ and h, respectively. That is, h will become h¯,m¯+1 but we simplify it for ı ı ı ease of expression. Our goal is to ﬁnd α ¯,m¯+1 which we similarly abbreviate to α. We ﬁrst deﬁne ¯ ı ı k k wi = ck egi (xi )− i Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j (2) + as the weight of example k at stage i, or its current contribution to our risk bound. If we let D h be ¯ − ¯ the set of indexes of the members of D for which h returns +1, and let D h be similarly deﬁned for ¯ ¯ returns −1, we can further deﬁne those for which h s+1 + W¯ = ı k w¯ + ı + k∈Dh ¯ s+1 k wi − W¯ = ı − ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ k w¯ + ı − k∈Dh ¯ k wi . + ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ + ¯ We interpret W¯ to be the sum of the weights which h will emphasize. That is, it corresponds to ı ¯ ¯ the weights along the path that h selects: For those examples for which h recommends termination, we add the current weight (related to the cost of stopping the processing at this stage). For those ¯ examples for which h recommends continued processing, we add in all future weights (related to all − future costs associated with this example). W¯ can be similarly interpreted to be the weights (or ı ¯ costs) that h recommends skipping. If we optimize the loss bound of Equation 1 with respect to α, we obtain ¯ α= ¯ 1 Wı− log ¯ . + 2 W¯ ı (3) The more weight (cost) that the rule recommends to skip, the higher its α coefﬁcient. 2.2 Full Optimization Using Equation 3 it is straight forward to show that the reduction in Equation 1 due to the addition of this new subclassiﬁer will be + ¯ − ¯ W¯ (1 − eα ) + W¯ (1 − e−α ) . ı ı (4) We know of no efﬁcient method for determining ¯, the stage at which to add a subclassiﬁer, except ı by exhaustive search. However, within a stage, the choice of which subclassiﬁer to use becomes one of maximizing n s+1 k¯ k k z¯ h(x¯ ) , where z¯ = ı ı ı k k wi − w¯ ı (5) i=¯+1 ı k=1 ¯ with respect to h. This is equivalent to an weighted empirical risk minimization where the training 1 2 n k k set is {x¯ , x¯ , . . . , x¯ }. The label of x¯ is the sign of z¯ , and the weight of the same example is the ı ı ı ı ı k magnitude of z¯ . ı 2.3 Algorithm The resulting algorithm is only slightly more complex than standard Adaboost. Instead of a weight vector (one weight for each data example), we now have a weight matrix (one weight for each data example for each stage). We initialize each weight to be the cost associated with halting the corresponding example at the corresponding stage. We start with all g i (x) = 0. The complete algorithm is as in Figure 1. Each time through steps 3 through 7, we complete one “round” and add one additional rule to one stage of the processing. We stop executing this loop when α ≤ 0 or when an iteration counter ¯ exceeds a preset threshold. Bottom-Up Variation In situations where information is only gained after each stage (such as in section 4), we can also train the classiﬁers “bottom-up.” That is, we can start by only adding classiﬁers to the last stage. Once ﬁnished with it, we proceed to the previous stage, and so on. Thus instead of selecting the best stage, i, in each round, we systematically work our way backward through the stages, never revisiting previously set stages. 3 Performance Bounds Using the bounds in [3] we can provide a risk bound for this problem. We let E denote the expectaˆ tion with respect to the true distribution p(x, c) and En denote the empirical average with respect to the n training samples. We ﬁrst bound the indicator function with a piece-wise linear function, b θ , 1 with a maximum slope of θ : z ,0 . I(z > 0) ≤ bθ (z) = max min 1, 1 + θ We then bound the loss: L(f (x), c) ≤ φ θ (f (x), c) where s+1 φθ (f (x), c) = ci min{bθ (gi (xi )), bθ (−gi−1 (xi−1 )), bθ (−gi−2 (xi−2 )), . . . , bθ (−g1 (x1 ))} i=1 s+1 i ci Bθ (gi (xi ), gi−1 (xi−1 ), . . . , g1 (x1 )) = i=1 We replaced the product of indicator functions with a minimization and then bounded each indicator i with bθ . Bθ is just a more compact presentation of the composition of the function b θ and the minimization. We assume that the weights α at each stage have been scaled to sum to 1. This has no affect on the resulting classiﬁcations, but is necessary for the derivation below. Before stating the theorem, for clarity, we state two standard deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 1. Let p(x) be a probability distribution on the set X and let {x 1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be n independent samples from p(x). Let σ 1 , σ 2 , . . . , σ n be n independent samples from a Rademacher random variable (a binary variable that takes on either +1 or −1 with equal probability). Let F be a class of functions mapping X to . Deﬁne the Rademacher Complexity of F to be Rn (F ) = E sup f ∈F n 1 n σ i f (xi ) i=1 1 where the expectation is over the random draws of x through xn and σ 1 through σ n . Deﬁnition 2. Let p(x), {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }, and F be as above. Let g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n be n independent samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Analogous to the above deﬁnition, deﬁne the Gaussian Complexity of G to be Gn (F ) = E sup f ∈F 1 n n g i f (xi ) . i=1 We can now state our theorem, bounding the true risk by a function of the empirical risk: Theorem 3. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hs be the sequence of the sets of functions from which the base classiﬁer draws for chain boosting. If H i is closed under negation for all i, all costs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the weights for the classiﬁers at each stage sum to 1, then with probability 1 − δ, k ˆ E [L(f (x), c)] ≤ En [φθ (f (x), c)] + θ s (i + 1)Gn (Hi ) + i=1 8 ln 2 δ n for some constant k. Proof. Theorem 8 of [3] states ˆ E [L(x, c)] ≤ En (φθ (f (x), c)) + 2Rn (φθ ◦ F ) + 8 ln 2 δ n and therefore we need only bound the R n (φθ ◦ F ) term to demonstrate our theorem. For our case, we have 1 Rn (φθ ◦ F ) = E sup n f ∈F = E sup f ∈F 1 n s+1 ≤ E sup j=1 f ∈F n n σ i φθ (f (xi ), ci ) i=1 s+1 σi i=1 1 n s ci Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) j j j−1 1 j=1 n s+1 s σ i Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) = j j−1 1 i=1 s Rn (Bθ ◦ G j ) j=1 where Gi is the space of convex combinations of functions from H i and G i is the cross product of G1 through Gi . The inequality comes from switching the expectation and the maximization and then from dropping the c i (see [4], lemma 5). j s s Lemma 4 of [3] states that there exists a k such that R n (Bθ ◦ G j ) ≤ kGn (Bθ ◦ G j ). Theorem 14 j 2 s j s of the same paper allows us to conclude that G n (Bθ ◦ G ) ≤ θ i=1 Gn (Gi ). (Because Bθ is the 1 s minimum over a set of functions with maximum slope of θ , the maximum slope of B θ is also 1 .) θ Theorem 12, part 2 states G n (Gi ) = Gn (Hi ). Taken together, this proves our result. Note that this bound has only quadratic dependence on s, the length of the chain and does not explicitly depend on the number of rounds of boosting (the number of rounds affects φ θ which, in turn, affects the bound). 4 Application We tested our algorithm on the MIT face database [5]. This database contains 19-by-19 gray-scale images of faces and non-faces. The training set has 2429 face images and 4548 non-face images. The testing set has 472 faces and 23573 non-faces. We weighted the training set images so that the ratio of the weight of face images to non-face images matched the ratio in the testing set. 0.4 0.4 CB Global CB Bottom−up SVM Boosting 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 150 0.2 100 0.1 False positive rate 0.3 50 Average number of pixels 0.35 average cost/error per example 200 training cost training error testing cost testing error 0.05 0 100 200 300 400 500 number of rounds 700 1000 (a) 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 False negative rate 0.8 0 1 (b) Figure 2: (a) Accuracy verses the number of rounds for a typical run, (b) Error rates and average costs for a variety of cost settings. 4.1 Object Detection as Chained Boosting Our goal is to produce a classiﬁer that can identify non-face images at very low resolutions, thereby allowing for quick processing of large images (as explained later). Most image patches (or subwindows) do not contain faces. We, therefore, built a multi-stage detection system where any early rejection is labeled as a non-face. The ﬁrst stage looks at image patches of size 3-by-3 (i.e. a lowerresolution version of the 19-by-19 original image). The next stage looks at the same image, but at a resolution of 6-by-6. The third stage considers the image at 12-by-12. We did not present the full 19-by-19 images as the classiﬁcation did not signiﬁcantly improve over the 12-by-12 versions. We employ a simple base classiﬁer: the set of all functions that look at a single pixel and predict the class by thresholding the pixel’s value. The total classiﬁer at any stage is a linear combination of these simple classiﬁers. For a given stage, all of the base classiﬁers that target a particular pixel are added together producing a complex function of the value of the pixel. Yet, this pixel can only take on a ﬁnite number of values (256 in this case). Therefore, we can compile this set of base classiﬁers into a single look-up function that maps the brightness of the pixel into a real number. The total classiﬁer for the whole stage is merely the sum of these look-up functions. Therefore, the total work necessary to compute the classiﬁcation at a stage is proportional to the number of pixels in the image considered at that stage, regardless of the number of base classiﬁers used. We therefore assign a cost to each stage of processing proportional to the number of pixels at that stage. If the image is a face, we add a negative cost (i.e. bonus) if the image is allowed to pass through all of the processing stages (and is therefore “accepted” as a face). If the image is a nonface, we add a bonus if the image is rejected at any stage before completion (i.e. correctly labelled). While this dataset has only segmented image patches, in a real application, the classiﬁer would be run on all sub-windows of an image. More importantly, it would also be run at multiple resolutions in order to detect faces of different sizes (or at different distances from the camera). The classiﬁer chain could be run simultaneously at each of these resolutions. To wit, while running the ﬁnal 12-by12 stage at one resolution of the image, the 6-by-6 (previous) stage could be run at the same image resolution. This 6-by-6 processing would be the necessary pre-processing step to running the 12-by12 stage at a higher resolution. As we run our ﬁnal scan for big faces (at a low resolution), we can already (at the same image resolution) be performing initial tests to throw out portions of the image as not worthy of testing for smaller faces (at a higher resolution). Most of the work of detecting objects must be done at the high resolutions because there are many more overlapping subwindows. This chained method allows the culling of most of this high-resolution image processing. 4.2 Experiments For each example, we construct a vector of stage costs as above. We add a constant to this vector to ensure that the minimal element is zero, as per section 1.1. We scale all vectors by the same amount to ensure that the maximal value is 1.This means that the number of misclassiﬁcations is an upper bound on the total cost that the learning algorithm is trying to minimize. There are three ﬂexible quantities in this problem formulation: the cost of a pixel evaluation, the bonus for a correct face classiﬁcation, and the bonus for a correct non-face classiﬁcation. Changing these quantities will control the trade-off between false positives and true positives, and between classiﬁcation error and speed. Figure 2(a) shows the result of a typical run of the algorithm. As a function of the number of rounds, it plots the cost (that which the algorithm is trying to minimize) and the error (number of misclassiﬁed image patches), for both the training and testing sets (where the training set has been reweighted to have the same proportion of faces to non-faces as the testing set). We compared our algorithm’s performance to the performance of support vector machines (SVM) [6] and Adaboost [1] trained and tested on the highest resolution, 12-by-12, image patches. We employed SVM-light [7] with a linear kernels. Figure 2(b) compares the error rates for the methods (solid lines, read against the left vertical axis). Note that the error rates are almost identical for the methods. The dashed lines (read against the right vertical axis) show the average number of pixels evaluated (or total processing cost) for each of the methods. The SVM and Adaboost algorithms have a constant processing cost. Our method (by either training scheme) produces lower processing cost for most error rates. 5 Related Work Cascade detectors for vision processing (see [8] or [9] for example) may appear to be similar to the work in this paper. Especially at ﬁrst glance for the area of object detection, they appear almost the same. However, cascade detection and this work (chained detection) are quite different. Cascade detectors are built one at a time. A coarse detector is ﬁrst trained. The examples which pass that detector are then passed to a ﬁner detector for training, and so on. A series of targets for false-positive rates deﬁne the increasing accuracy of the detector cascade. By contrast, our chain detectors are trained as an ensemble. This is necessary because of two differences in the problem formulation. First, we assume that the information available at each stage changes. Second, we assume there is an explicit cost model that dictates the cost of proceeding from stage to stage and the cost of rejection (or acceptance) at any particular stage. By contrast, cascade detectors are seeking to minimize computational power necessary for a ﬁxed decision. Therefore, the information available to all of the stages is the same, and there are no ﬁxed costs associated with each stage. The ability to train all of the classiﬁers at the same time is crucial to good performance in our framework. The ﬁrst classiﬁer in the chain cannot determine whether it is advantageous to send an example further along unless it knows how the later stages will process the example. Conversely, the later stages cannot construct optimal classiﬁcations until they know the distribution of examples that they will see. Section 4.1 may further confuse the matter. We demonstrated how chained boosting can be used to reduce the computational costs of object detection in images. Cascade detectors are often used for the same purpose. However, the reductions in computational time come from two different sources. In cascade detectors, the time taken to evaluate a given image patch is reduced. In our chained detector formulation, image patches are ignored completely based on analysis of lower resolution patches in the image pyramid. To further illustrate the difference, cascade detectors can always be used to speed up asymmetric classiﬁcation tasks (and are often applied to image detection). By contrast, in Section 4.1 we have exploited the fact that object detection in images is typically performed at multiple scales to turn the problem into a pipeline and apply our framework. Cascade detectors address situations in which prior class probabilities are not equal, while chained detectors address situations in which information is gained at a cost. Both are valid (and separate) ways of tackling image processing (and other tasks as well). In many ways, they are complementary approaches. Classic sequence analysis [10, 11] also addresses the problem of optimal stopping. However, it assumes that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from (usually) a known distribution. Our problem is quite different in that each consecutive sample is drawn from a different (and related) distribution and our goal is to ﬁnd a decision rule without producing a generative model. WaldBoost [12] is a boosting algorithm based on this. It builds a series of features and a ratio comparison test in order to decide when to stop. For WaldBoost, the available features (information) not change between stages. Rather, any feature is available for selection at any point in the chain. Again, this is a different problem than the one considered in this paper. 6 Conclusions We feel this framework of staged decision making is useful in a wide variety of areas. This paper demonstrated how the framework applies to one vision processing task. Obviously it also applies to manufacturing pipelines where errors can be introduced at different stages. It should also be applicable to scenarios where information gathering is costly. Our current formulation only allows for early negative detection. In the face detection example above, this means that in order to report “face,” the classiﬁer must process each stage, even if the result is assured earlier. In Figure 2(b), clearly the upper-left corner (100% false positives and 0% false negatives) is reachable with little effort: classify everything positive without looking at any features. We would like to extend this framework to cover such two-sided early decisions. While perhaps not useful in manufacturing (or even face detection, where the interesting part of the ROC curve is far from the upper-left), it would make the framework more applicable to informationgathering applications.

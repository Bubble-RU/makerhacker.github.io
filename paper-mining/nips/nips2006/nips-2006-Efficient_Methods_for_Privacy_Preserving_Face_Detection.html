<p>Author: Wolf Kienzle, Felix A. Wichmann, Matthias O. Franz, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the bottom-up inﬂuence of local image information on human eye movements. Most existing computational models use a set of biologically plausible linear ﬁlters, e.g., Gabor or Difference-of-Gaussians ﬁlters as a front-end, the outputs of which are nonlinearly combined into a real number that indicates visual saliency. Unfortunately, this requires many design parameters such as the number, type, and size of the front-end ﬁlters, as well as the choice of nonlinearities, weighting and normalization schemes etc., for which biological plausibility cannot always be justiﬁed. As a result, these parameters have to be chosen in a more or less ad hoc way. Here, we propose to learn a visual saliency model directly from human eye movement data. The model is rather simplistic and essentially parameter-free, and therefore contrasts recent developments in the ﬁeld that usually aim at higher prediction rates at the cost of additional parameters and increasing model complexity. Experimental results show that—despite the lack of any biological prior knowledge—our model performs comparably to existing approaches, and in fact learns image features that resemble ﬁndings from several previous studies. In particular, its maximally excitatory stimuli have center-surround structure, similar to receptive ﬁelds in the early human visual system. 1</p><p>3 0.14542657 <a title="73-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Image_Retrieval_and_Classification_Using_Local_Distance_Functions.html">94 nips-2006-Image Retrieval and Classification Using Local Distance Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Andrea Frome, Yoram Singer, Jitendra Malik</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce and experiment with a framework for learning local perceptual distance functions for visual recognition. We learn a distance function for each training image as a combination of elementary distances between patch-based visual features. We apply these combined local distance functions to the tasks of image retrieval and classiﬁcation of novel images. On the Caltech 101 object recognition benchmark, we achieve 60.3% mean recognition across classes using 15 training images per class, which is better than the best published performance by Zhang, et al. 1</p><p>4 0.13197164 <a title="73-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Chained_Boosting.html">50 nips-2006-Chained Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Wesley Huie, Kin F. Kan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to learn to make sequential stopping decisions, such as those made along a processing pipeline. We envision a scenario in which a series of decisions must be made as to whether to continue to process. Further processing costs time and resources, but may add value. Our goal is to create, based on historic data, a series of decision rules (one at each stage in the pipeline) that decide, based on information gathered up to that point, whether to continue processing the part. We demonstrate how our framework encompasses problems from manufacturing to vision processing. We derive a quadratic (in the number of decisions) bound on testing performance and provide empirical results on object detection. 1 Pipelined Decisions In many decision problems, all of the data do not arrive at the same time. Often further data collection can be expensive and we would like to make a decision without accruing the added cost. Consider silicon wafer manufacturing. The wafer is processed in a series of stages. After each stage some tests are performed to judge the quality of the wafer. If the wafer fails (due to ﬂaws), then the processing time, energy, and materials are wasted. So, we would like to detect such a failure as early as possible in the production pipeline. A similar problem can occur in vision processing. Consider the case of object detection in images. Often low-level pixel operations (such as downsampling an image) can be performed in parallel by dedicated hardware (on a video capture board, for example). However, searching each subimage patch of the whole image to test whether it is the object in question takes time that is proportional to the number of pixels. Therefore, we can imagine a image pipeline in which low resolution versions of the whole image are scanned ﬁrst. Subimages which are extremely unlikely to contain the desired object are rejected and only those which pass are processed at higher resolution. In this way, we save on many pixel operations and can reduce the cost in time to process an image. Even if downsampling is not possible through dedicated hardware, for most object detection schemes, the image must be downsampled to form an image pyramid in order to search for the object at different scales. Therefore, we can run the early stages of such a pipelined detector at the low resolution versions of the image and throw out large regions of the high resolution versions. Most of the processing is spent searching for small faces (at the high resolutions), so this method can save a lot of processing. Such chained decisions also occur if there is a human in the decision process (to ask further clarifying questions in database search, for instance). We propose a framework that can model all of these scenarios and allow such decision rules to be learned from historic data. We give a learning algorithm based on the minimization of the exponential loss and conclude with some experimental results. 1.1 Problem Formulation Let there be s stages to the processing pipeline. We assume that there is a static distribution from which the parts, objects, or units to be processed are drawn. Let p(x, c) represent this distribution in which x is a vector of the features of this unit and c represents the costs associated with this unit. In particular, let xi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the set of measurements (features) available to the decision maker immediately following stage i. Let c i (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the cost of rejecting (or stopping the processing of) this unit immediately following stage i. Finally, let c s+1 be the cost of allowing the part to pass through all processing stages. Note that ci need not be monotonic in i. To take our wafer manufacturing example, for wafers that are good we might let c i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, indicating that if a wafer is rejected at any stage, one unit of work has been invested for each stage of processing. For the same good wafers, we might let cs+1 = s − 1000, indicating that the value of a completed wafer is 1000 units and therefore the total cost is the processing cost minus the resulting value. For a ﬂawed wafer, the values might be the same, except for c s+1 which we would set to s, indicating that there is no value for a bad wafer. Note that the costs may be either positive or negative. However, only their relative values are important. Once a part has been drawn from the distribution, there is no way of affecting the “base level” for the value of the part. Therefore, we assume for the remainder of this paper that c i ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s + 1 and that ci = 0 for some value of i (between 1 and s + 1). Our goal is to produce a series of decision rules f i (xi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We let fi have a range of {0, 1} and let 0 indicate that processing should continue and 1 indicate that processing should be halted. We let f denote the collection of these s decision rules and augment the collection with an additional rule f s+1 which is identically 1 (for ease of notation). The cost of using these rules to halt processing an example is therefore s+1 i−1 ci fi (xi ) L(f (x), c) = i=1 (1 − fj (xj )) . j=1 We would like to ﬁnd a set of decision rules that minimize E p [L(f (x), c)]. While p(x, c) is not known, we do have a series of samples (training set) D = {(x1 , c1 ), (x2 , c2 ), . . . , (xn , cn )} of n examples drawn from the distribution p. We use superscripts to denote the example index and subscripts to denote the stage index. 2 Boosting Solution For this paper, we consider constructing the rules f i from simpler decision rules, much as in the Adaboost algorithm [1, 2]. We assume that each decision f i (xi ) is computed as the threshold of another function g i (xi ): fi (xi ) = I(gi (xi ) > 0).1 We bound the empirical risk: n n s+1 L(f (xk ), ck ) = i−1 ck I(gi (xk ) > 0) i i k=1 i=1 k=1 n s+1 j=1 k i−1 ck egi (xi ) i ≤ k=1 i=1 I(gj (xk ) ≤ 0) j k n s+1 j=1 k ck egi (xi )− i e−gj (xj ) = Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j . (1) k=1 i=1 Our decision to make all costs positive ensures that the bounds hold. Our decision to make the optimal cost zero helps to ensure that the bound is reasonably tight. As in boosting, we restrict g i (xi ) to take the form mi αi,l hi,l (xi ), the weighted sum of m i subl=1 classiﬁers, each of which returns either −1 or +1. We will construct these weighted sums incrementally and greedily, adding one additional subclassiﬁer and associated weight at each step. We will pick the stage, weight, and function of the subclassiﬁer in order to make the largest negative change in the exponential bound to the empirical risk. The subclassiﬁers, h i,l will be drawn from a small class of hypotheses, H. 1 I is the indicator function that equals 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. 1. Initialize gi (x) = 0 for all stages i k 2. Initialize wi = ck for all stages i and examples k. i 3. For each stage i: (a) Calculate targets for each training example, as shown in equation 5. (b) Let h be the result of running the base learner on this set. (c) Calculate the corresponding α as per equation 3. (d) Score this classiﬁcation as per equation 4 ¯ 4. Select the stage ¯ with the best (highest) score. Let h and α be the classiﬁer and ı ¯ weight found at that stage. ¯¯ 5. Let g¯(x) ← g¯(x) + αh(x). ı ı 6. Update the weights (see equation 2): ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, multiply w¯ by eαh(x¯ ) . ı ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, j > ¯, multiply wj by e−αh(x¯ ) . ı 7. Repeat from step 3 Figure 1: Chained Boosting Algorithm 2.1 Weight Optimization We ﬁrst assume that the stage at which to add a new subclassiﬁer and the subclassiﬁer to add have ¯ ¯ already been chosen: ¯ and h, respectively. That is, h will become h¯,m¯+1 but we simplify it for ı ı ı ease of expression. Our goal is to ﬁnd α ¯,m¯+1 which we similarly abbreviate to α. We ﬁrst deﬁne ¯ ı ı k k wi = ck egi (xi )− i Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j (2) + as the weight of example k at stage i, or its current contribution to our risk bound. If we let D h be ¯ − ¯ the set of indexes of the members of D for which h returns +1, and let D h be similarly deﬁned for ¯ ¯ returns −1, we can further deﬁne those for which h s+1 + W¯ = ı k w¯ + ı + k∈Dh ¯ s+1 k wi − W¯ = ı − ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ k w¯ + ı − k∈Dh ¯ k wi . + ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ + ¯ We interpret W¯ to be the sum of the weights which h will emphasize. That is, it corresponds to ı ¯ ¯ the weights along the path that h selects: For those examples for which h recommends termination, we add the current weight (related to the cost of stopping the processing at this stage). For those ¯ examples for which h recommends continued processing, we add in all future weights (related to all − future costs associated with this example). W¯ can be similarly interpreted to be the weights (or ı ¯ costs) that h recommends skipping. If we optimize the loss bound of Equation 1 with respect to α, we obtain ¯ α= ¯ 1 Wı− log ¯ . + 2 W¯ ı (3) The more weight (cost) that the rule recommends to skip, the higher its α coefﬁcient. 2.2 Full Optimization Using Equation 3 it is straight forward to show that the reduction in Equation 1 due to the addition of this new subclassiﬁer will be + ¯ − ¯ W¯ (1 − eα ) + W¯ (1 − e−α ) . ı ı (4) We know of no efﬁcient method for determining ¯, the stage at which to add a subclassiﬁer, except ı by exhaustive search. However, within a stage, the choice of which subclassiﬁer to use becomes one of maximizing n s+1 k¯ k k z¯ h(x¯ ) , where z¯ = ı ı ı k k wi − w¯ ı (5) i=¯+1 ı k=1 ¯ with respect to h. This is equivalent to an weighted empirical risk minimization where the training 1 2 n k k set is {x¯ , x¯ , . . . , x¯ }. The label of x¯ is the sign of z¯ , and the weight of the same example is the ı ı ı ı ı k magnitude of z¯ . ı 2.3 Algorithm The resulting algorithm is only slightly more complex than standard Adaboost. Instead of a weight vector (one weight for each data example), we now have a weight matrix (one weight for each data example for each stage). We initialize each weight to be the cost associated with halting the corresponding example at the corresponding stage. We start with all g i (x) = 0. The complete algorithm is as in Figure 1. Each time through steps 3 through 7, we complete one “round” and add one additional rule to one stage of the processing. We stop executing this loop when α ≤ 0 or when an iteration counter ¯ exceeds a preset threshold. Bottom-Up Variation In situations where information is only gained after each stage (such as in section 4), we can also train the classiﬁers “bottom-up.” That is, we can start by only adding classiﬁers to the last stage. Once ﬁnished with it, we proceed to the previous stage, and so on. Thus instead of selecting the best stage, i, in each round, we systematically work our way backward through the stages, never revisiting previously set stages. 3 Performance Bounds Using the bounds in [3] we can provide a risk bound for this problem. We let E denote the expectaˆ tion with respect to the true distribution p(x, c) and En denote the empirical average with respect to the n training samples. We ﬁrst bound the indicator function with a piece-wise linear function, b θ , 1 with a maximum slope of θ : z ,0 . I(z > 0) ≤ bθ (z) = max min 1, 1 + θ We then bound the loss: L(f (x), c) ≤ φ θ (f (x), c) where s+1 φθ (f (x), c) = ci min{bθ (gi (xi )), bθ (−gi−1 (xi−1 )), bθ (−gi−2 (xi−2 )), . . . , bθ (−g1 (x1 ))} i=1 s+1 i ci Bθ (gi (xi ), gi−1 (xi−1 ), . . . , g1 (x1 )) = i=1 We replaced the product of indicator functions with a minimization and then bounded each indicator i with bθ . Bθ is just a more compact presentation of the composition of the function b θ and the minimization. We assume that the weights α at each stage have been scaled to sum to 1. This has no affect on the resulting classiﬁcations, but is necessary for the derivation below. Before stating the theorem, for clarity, we state two standard deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 1. Let p(x) be a probability distribution on the set X and let {x 1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be n independent samples from p(x). Let σ 1 , σ 2 , . . . , σ n be n independent samples from a Rademacher random variable (a binary variable that takes on either +1 or −1 with equal probability). Let F be a class of functions mapping X to . Deﬁne the Rademacher Complexity of F to be Rn (F ) = E sup f ∈F n 1 n σ i f (xi ) i=1 1 where the expectation is over the random draws of x through xn and σ 1 through σ n . Deﬁnition 2. Let p(x), {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }, and F be as above. Let g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n be n independent samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Analogous to the above deﬁnition, deﬁne the Gaussian Complexity of G to be Gn (F ) = E sup f ∈F 1 n n g i f (xi ) . i=1 We can now state our theorem, bounding the true risk by a function of the empirical risk: Theorem 3. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hs be the sequence of the sets of functions from which the base classiﬁer draws for chain boosting. If H i is closed under negation for all i, all costs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the weights for the classiﬁers at each stage sum to 1, then with probability 1 − δ, k ˆ E [L(f (x), c)] ≤ En [φθ (f (x), c)] + θ s (i + 1)Gn (Hi ) + i=1 8 ln 2 δ n for some constant k. Proof. Theorem 8 of [3] states ˆ E [L(x, c)] ≤ En (φθ (f (x), c)) + 2Rn (φθ ◦ F ) + 8 ln 2 δ n and therefore we need only bound the R n (φθ ◦ F ) term to demonstrate our theorem. For our case, we have 1 Rn (φθ ◦ F ) = E sup n f ∈F = E sup f ∈F 1 n s+1 ≤ E sup j=1 f ∈F n n σ i φθ (f (xi ), ci ) i=1 s+1 σi i=1 1 n s ci Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) j j j−1 1 j=1 n s+1 s σ i Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) = j j−1 1 i=1 s Rn (Bθ ◦ G j ) j=1 where Gi is the space of convex combinations of functions from H i and G i is the cross product of G1 through Gi . The inequality comes from switching the expectation and the maximization and then from dropping the c i (see [4], lemma 5). j s s Lemma 4 of [3] states that there exists a k such that R n (Bθ ◦ G j ) ≤ kGn (Bθ ◦ G j ). Theorem 14 j 2 s j s of the same paper allows us to conclude that G n (Bθ ◦ G ) ≤ θ i=1 Gn (Gi ). (Because Bθ is the 1 s minimum over a set of functions with maximum slope of θ , the maximum slope of B θ is also 1 .) θ Theorem 12, part 2 states G n (Gi ) = Gn (Hi ). Taken together, this proves our result. Note that this bound has only quadratic dependence on s, the length of the chain and does not explicitly depend on the number of rounds of boosting (the number of rounds affects φ θ which, in turn, affects the bound). 4 Application We tested our algorithm on the MIT face database [5]. This database contains 19-by-19 gray-scale images of faces and non-faces. The training set has 2429 face images and 4548 non-face images. The testing set has 472 faces and 23573 non-faces. We weighted the training set images so that the ratio of the weight of face images to non-face images matched the ratio in the testing set. 0.4 0.4 CB Global CB Bottom−up SVM Boosting 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 150 0.2 100 0.1 False positive rate 0.3 50 Average number of pixels 0.35 average cost/error per example 200 training cost training error testing cost testing error 0.05 0 100 200 300 400 500 number of rounds 700 1000 (a) 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 False negative rate 0.8 0 1 (b) Figure 2: (a) Accuracy verses the number of rounds for a typical run, (b) Error rates and average costs for a variety of cost settings. 4.1 Object Detection as Chained Boosting Our goal is to produce a classiﬁer that can identify non-face images at very low resolutions, thereby allowing for quick processing of large images (as explained later). Most image patches (or subwindows) do not contain faces. We, therefore, built a multi-stage detection system where any early rejection is labeled as a non-face. The ﬁrst stage looks at image patches of size 3-by-3 (i.e. a lowerresolution version of the 19-by-19 original image). The next stage looks at the same image, but at a resolution of 6-by-6. The third stage considers the image at 12-by-12. We did not present the full 19-by-19 images as the classiﬁcation did not signiﬁcantly improve over the 12-by-12 versions. We employ a simple base classiﬁer: the set of all functions that look at a single pixel and predict the class by thresholding the pixel’s value. The total classiﬁer at any stage is a linear combination of these simple classiﬁers. For a given stage, all of the base classiﬁers that target a particular pixel are added together producing a complex function of the value of the pixel. Yet, this pixel can only take on a ﬁnite number of values (256 in this case). Therefore, we can compile this set of base classiﬁers into a single look-up function that maps the brightness of the pixel into a real number. The total classiﬁer for the whole stage is merely the sum of these look-up functions. Therefore, the total work necessary to compute the classiﬁcation at a stage is proportional to the number of pixels in the image considered at that stage, regardless of the number of base classiﬁers used. We therefore assign a cost to each stage of processing proportional to the number of pixels at that stage. If the image is a face, we add a negative cost (i.e. bonus) if the image is allowed to pass through all of the processing stages (and is therefore “accepted” as a face). If the image is a nonface, we add a bonus if the image is rejected at any stage before completion (i.e. correctly labelled). While this dataset has only segmented image patches, in a real application, the classiﬁer would be run on all sub-windows of an image. More importantly, it would also be run at multiple resolutions in order to detect faces of different sizes (or at different distances from the camera). The classiﬁer chain could be run simultaneously at each of these resolutions. To wit, while running the ﬁnal 12-by12 stage at one resolution of the image, the 6-by-6 (previous) stage could be run at the same image resolution. This 6-by-6 processing would be the necessary pre-processing step to running the 12-by12 stage at a higher resolution. As we run our ﬁnal scan for big faces (at a low resolution), we can already (at the same image resolution) be performing initial tests to throw out portions of the image as not worthy of testing for smaller faces (at a higher resolution). Most of the work of detecting objects must be done at the high resolutions because there are many more overlapping subwindows. This chained method allows the culling of most of this high-resolution image processing. 4.2 Experiments For each example, we construct a vector of stage costs as above. We add a constant to this vector to ensure that the minimal element is zero, as per section 1.1. We scale all vectors by the same amount to ensure that the maximal value is 1.This means that the number of misclassiﬁcations is an upper bound on the total cost that the learning algorithm is trying to minimize. There are three ﬂexible quantities in this problem formulation: the cost of a pixel evaluation, the bonus for a correct face classiﬁcation, and the bonus for a correct non-face classiﬁcation. Changing these quantities will control the trade-off between false positives and true positives, and between classiﬁcation error and speed. Figure 2(a) shows the result of a typical run of the algorithm. As a function of the number of rounds, it plots the cost (that which the algorithm is trying to minimize) and the error (number of misclassiﬁed image patches), for both the training and testing sets (where the training set has been reweighted to have the same proportion of faces to non-faces as the testing set). We compared our algorithm’s performance to the performance of support vector machines (SVM) [6] and Adaboost [1] trained and tested on the highest resolution, 12-by-12, image patches. We employed SVM-light [7] with a linear kernels. Figure 2(b) compares the error rates for the methods (solid lines, read against the left vertical axis). Note that the error rates are almost identical for the methods. The dashed lines (read against the right vertical axis) show the average number of pixels evaluated (or total processing cost) for each of the methods. The SVM and Adaboost algorithms have a constant processing cost. Our method (by either training scheme) produces lower processing cost for most error rates. 5 Related Work Cascade detectors for vision processing (see [8] or [9] for example) may appear to be similar to the work in this paper. Especially at ﬁrst glance for the area of object detection, they appear almost the same. However, cascade detection and this work (chained detection) are quite different. Cascade detectors are built one at a time. A coarse detector is ﬁrst trained. The examples which pass that detector are then passed to a ﬁner detector for training, and so on. A series of targets for false-positive rates deﬁne the increasing accuracy of the detector cascade. By contrast, our chain detectors are trained as an ensemble. This is necessary because of two differences in the problem formulation. First, we assume that the information available at each stage changes. Second, we assume there is an explicit cost model that dictates the cost of proceeding from stage to stage and the cost of rejection (or acceptance) at any particular stage. By contrast, cascade detectors are seeking to minimize computational power necessary for a ﬁxed decision. Therefore, the information available to all of the stages is the same, and there are no ﬁxed costs associated with each stage. The ability to train all of the classiﬁers at the same time is crucial to good performance in our framework. The ﬁrst classiﬁer in the chain cannot determine whether it is advantageous to send an example further along unless it knows how the later stages will process the example. Conversely, the later stages cannot construct optimal classiﬁcations until they know the distribution of examples that they will see. Section 4.1 may further confuse the matter. We demonstrated how chained boosting can be used to reduce the computational costs of object detection in images. Cascade detectors are often used for the same purpose. However, the reductions in computational time come from two different sources. In cascade detectors, the time taken to evaluate a given image patch is reduced. In our chained detector formulation, image patches are ignored completely based on analysis of lower resolution patches in the image pyramid. To further illustrate the difference, cascade detectors can always be used to speed up asymmetric classiﬁcation tasks (and are often applied to image detection). By contrast, in Section 4.1 we have exploited the fact that object detection in images is typically performed at multiple scales to turn the problem into a pipeline and apply our framework. Cascade detectors address situations in which prior class probabilities are not equal, while chained detectors address situations in which information is gained at a cost. Both are valid (and separate) ways of tackling image processing (and other tasks as well). In many ways, they are complementary approaches. Classic sequence analysis [10, 11] also addresses the problem of optimal stopping. However, it assumes that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from (usually) a known distribution. Our problem is quite different in that each consecutive sample is drawn from a different (and related) distribution and our goal is to ﬁnd a decision rule without producing a generative model. WaldBoost [12] is a boosting algorithm based on this. It builds a series of features and a ratio comparison test in order to decide when to stop. For WaldBoost, the available features (information) not change between stages. Rather, any feature is available for selection at any point in the chain. Again, this is a different problem than the one considered in this paper. 6 Conclusions We feel this framework of staged decision making is useful in a wide variety of areas. This paper demonstrated how the framework applies to one vision processing task. Obviously it also applies to manufacturing pipelines where errors can be introduced at different stages. It should also be applicable to scenarios where information gathering is costly. Our current formulation only allows for early negative detection. In the face detection example above, this means that in order to report “face,” the classiﬁer must process each stage, even if the result is assured earlier. In Figure 2(b), clearly the upper-left corner (100% false positives and 0% false negatives) is reachable with little effort: classify everything positive without looking at any features. We would like to extend this framework to cover such two-sided early decisions. While perhaps not useful in manufacturing (or even face detection, where the interesting part of the ROC curve is far from the upper-left), it would make the framework more applicable to informationgathering applications.

<p>Author: Frank Moosmann, Bill Triggs, Frederic Jurie</p><p>Abstract: Some of the most effective recent methods for content-based image classiﬁcation work by extracting dense or sparse local image descriptors, quantizing them according to a coding rule such as k-means vector quantization, accumulating histograms of the resulting “visual word” codes over the image, and classifying these with a conventional classiﬁer such as an SVM. Large numbers of descriptors and large codebooks are needed for good results and this becomes slow using k-means. We introduce Extremely Randomized Clustering Forests – ensembles of randomly created clustering trees – and show that these provide more accurate results, much faster training and testing and good resistance to background clutter in several state-of-the-art image classiﬁcation tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.09339954 <a title="73-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Shai Avidan, Moshe Butman</p><p>Abstract: Bob offers a face-detection web service where clients can submit their images for analysis. Alice would very much like to use the service, but is reluctant to reveal the content of her images to Bob. Bob, for his part, is reluctant to release his face detector, as he spent a lot of time, energy and money constructing it. Secure MultiParty computations use cryptographic tools to solve this problem without leaking any information. Unfortunately, these methods are slow to compute and we introduce a couple of machine learning techniques that allow the parties to solve the problem while leaking a controlled amount of information. The ﬁrst method is an information-bottleneck variant of AdaBoost that lets Bob ﬁnd a subset of features that are enough for classifying an image patch, but not enough to actually reconstruct it. The second machine learning technique is active learning that allows Alice to construct an online classiﬁer, based on a small number of calls to Bob’s face detector. She can then use her online classiﬁer as a fast rejector before using a cryptographically secure classiﬁer on the remaining image patches. 1</p><p>2 0.7636193 <a title="73-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-Clustering_appearance_and_shape_by_learning_jigsaws.html">52 nips-2006-Clustering appearance and shape by learning jigsaws</a></p>
<p>Author: Anitha Kannan, John Winn, Carsten Rother</p><p>Abstract: Patch-based appearance models are used in a wide range of computer vision applications. To learn such models it has previously been necessary to specify a suitable set of patch sizes and shapes by hand. In the jigsaw model presented here, the shape, size and appearance of patches are learned automatically from the repeated structures in a set of training images. By learning such irregularly shaped ‘jigsaw pieces’, we are able to discover both the shape and the appearance of object parts without supervision. When applied to face images, for example, the learned jigsaw pieces are surprisingly strongly associated with face parts of different shapes and scales such as eyes, noses, eyebrows and cheeks, to name a few. We conclude that learning the shape of the patch not only improves the accuracy of appearance-based part detection but also allows for shape-based part detection. This enables parts of similar appearance but different shapes to be distinguished; for example, while foreheads and cheeks are both skin colored, they have markedly different shapes. 1</p><p>3 0.64210296 <a title="73-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Similarity_by_Composition.html">174 nips-2006-Similarity by Composition</a></p>
<p>Author: Oren Boiman, Michal Irani</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new approach for measuring similarity between two signals, which is applicable to many machine learning tasks, and to many signal types. We say that a signal S1 is “similar” to a signal S2 if it is “easy” to compose S1 from few large contiguous chunks of S2 . Obviously, if we use small enough pieces, then any signal can be composed of any other. Therefore, the larger those pieces are, the more similar S1 is to S2 . This induces a local similarity score at every point in the signal, based on the size of its supported surrounding region. These local scores can in turn be accumulated in a principled information-theoretic way into a global similarity score of the entire S1 to S2 . “Similarity by Composition” can be applied between pairs of signals, between groups of signals, and also between different portions of the same signal. It can therefore be employed in a wide variety of machine learning problems (clustering, classiﬁcation, retrieval, segmentation, attention, saliency, labelling, etc.), and can be applied to a wide range of signal types (images, video, audio, biological data, etc.) We show a few such examples. 1</p><p>4 0.6234802 <a title="73-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Image_Retrieval_and_Classification_Using_Local_Distance_Functions.html">94 nips-2006-Image Retrieval and Classification Using Local Distance Functions</a></p>

<p>Author: Lyndsey C. Pickup, David P. Capel, Stephen J. Roberts, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a multi-frame image super-resolution approach from a Bayesian view-point by marginalizing over the unknown registration parameters relating the set of input low-resolution views. In Tipping and Bishop’s Bayesian image super-resolution approach [16], the marginalization was over the superresolution image, necessitating the use of an unfavorable image prior. By integrating over the registration parameters rather than the high-resolution image, our method allows for more realistic prior distributions, and also reduces the dimension of the integral considerably, removing the main computational bottleneck of the other algorithm. In addition to the motion model used by Tipping and Bishop, illumination components are introduced into the generative model, allowing us to handle changes in lighting as well as motion. We show results on real and synthetic datasets to illustrate the efﬁcacy of this approach.</p><p>6 0.55874282 <a title="73-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-A_Nonparametric_Approach_to_Bottom-Up_Visual_Saliency.html">8 nips-2006-A Nonparametric Approach to Bottom-Up Visual Saliency</a></p>

<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>3 0.57258713 <a title="73-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Chained_Boosting.html">50 nips-2006-Chained Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian R. Shelton, Wesley Huie, Kin F. Kan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a method to learn to make sequential stopping decisions, such as those made along a processing pipeline. We envision a scenario in which a series of decisions must be made as to whether to continue to process. Further processing costs time and resources, but may add value. Our goal is to create, based on historic data, a series of decision rules (one at each stage in the pipeline) that decide, based on information gathered up to that point, whether to continue processing the part. We demonstrate how our framework encompasses problems from manufacturing to vision processing. We derive a quadratic (in the number of decisions) bound on testing performance and provide empirical results on object detection. 1 Pipelined Decisions In many decision problems, all of the data do not arrive at the same time. Often further data collection can be expensive and we would like to make a decision without accruing the added cost. Consider silicon wafer manufacturing. The wafer is processed in a series of stages. After each stage some tests are performed to judge the quality of the wafer. If the wafer fails (due to ﬂaws), then the processing time, energy, and materials are wasted. So, we would like to detect such a failure as early as possible in the production pipeline. A similar problem can occur in vision processing. Consider the case of object detection in images. Often low-level pixel operations (such as downsampling an image) can be performed in parallel by dedicated hardware (on a video capture board, for example). However, searching each subimage patch of the whole image to test whether it is the object in question takes time that is proportional to the number of pixels. Therefore, we can imagine a image pipeline in which low resolution versions of the whole image are scanned ﬁrst. Subimages which are extremely unlikely to contain the desired object are rejected and only those which pass are processed at higher resolution. In this way, we save on many pixel operations and can reduce the cost in time to process an image. Even if downsampling is not possible through dedicated hardware, for most object detection schemes, the image must be downsampled to form an image pyramid in order to search for the object at different scales. Therefore, we can run the early stages of such a pipelined detector at the low resolution versions of the image and throw out large regions of the high resolution versions. Most of the processing is spent searching for small faces (at the high resolutions), so this method can save a lot of processing. Such chained decisions also occur if there is a human in the decision process (to ask further clarifying questions in database search, for instance). We propose a framework that can model all of these scenarios and allow such decision rules to be learned from historic data. We give a learning algorithm based on the minimization of the exponential loss and conclude with some experimental results. 1.1 Problem Formulation Let there be s stages to the processing pipeline. We assume that there is a static distribution from which the parts, objects, or units to be processed are drawn. Let p(x, c) represent this distribution in which x is a vector of the features of this unit and c represents the costs associated with this unit. In particular, let xi (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the set of measurements (features) available to the decision maker immediately following stage i. Let c i (1 ≤ i ≤ s) be the cost of rejecting (or stopping the processing of) this unit immediately following stage i. Finally, let c s+1 be the cost of allowing the part to pass through all processing stages. Note that ci need not be monotonic in i. To take our wafer manufacturing example, for wafers that are good we might let c i = i for 1 ≤ i ≤ s, indicating that if a wafer is rejected at any stage, one unit of work has been invested for each stage of processing. For the same good wafers, we might let cs+1 = s − 1000, indicating that the value of a completed wafer is 1000 units and therefore the total cost is the processing cost minus the resulting value. For a ﬂawed wafer, the values might be the same, except for c s+1 which we would set to s, indicating that there is no value for a bad wafer. Note that the costs may be either positive or negative. However, only their relative values are important. Once a part has been drawn from the distribution, there is no way of affecting the “base level” for the value of the part. Therefore, we assume for the remainder of this paper that c i ≥ 0 for 1 ≤ i ≤ s + 1 and that ci = 0 for some value of i (between 1 and s + 1). Our goal is to produce a series of decision rules f i (xi ) for 1 ≤ i ≤ s. We let fi have a range of {0, 1} and let 0 indicate that processing should continue and 1 indicate that processing should be halted. We let f denote the collection of these s decision rules and augment the collection with an additional rule f s+1 which is identically 1 (for ease of notation). The cost of using these rules to halt processing an example is therefore s+1 i−1 ci fi (xi ) L(f (x), c) = i=1 (1 − fj (xj )) . j=1 We would like to ﬁnd a set of decision rules that minimize E p [L(f (x), c)]. While p(x, c) is not known, we do have a series of samples (training set) D = {(x1 , c1 ), (x2 , c2 ), . . . , (xn , cn )} of n examples drawn from the distribution p. We use superscripts to denote the example index and subscripts to denote the stage index. 2 Boosting Solution For this paper, we consider constructing the rules f i from simpler decision rules, much as in the Adaboost algorithm [1, 2]. We assume that each decision f i (xi ) is computed as the threshold of another function g i (xi ): fi (xi ) = I(gi (xi ) > 0).1 We bound the empirical risk: n n s+1 L(f (xk ), ck ) = i−1 ck I(gi (xk ) > 0) i i k=1 i=1 k=1 n s+1 j=1 k i−1 ck egi (xi ) i ≤ k=1 i=1 I(gj (xk ) ≤ 0) j k n s+1 j=1 k ck egi (xi )− i e−gj (xj ) = Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j . (1) k=1 i=1 Our decision to make all costs positive ensures that the bounds hold. Our decision to make the optimal cost zero helps to ensure that the bound is reasonably tight. As in boosting, we restrict g i (xi ) to take the form mi αi,l hi,l (xi ), the weighted sum of m i subl=1 classiﬁers, each of which returns either −1 or +1. We will construct these weighted sums incrementally and greedily, adding one additional subclassiﬁer and associated weight at each step. We will pick the stage, weight, and function of the subclassiﬁer in order to make the largest negative change in the exponential bound to the empirical risk. The subclassiﬁers, h i,l will be drawn from a small class of hypotheses, H. 1 I is the indicator function that equals 1 if the argument is true and 0 otherwise. 1. Initialize gi (x) = 0 for all stages i k 2. Initialize wi = ck for all stages i and examples k. i 3. For each stage i: (a) Calculate targets for each training example, as shown in equation 5. (b) Let h be the result of running the base learner on this set. (c) Calculate the corresponding α as per equation 3. (d) Score this classiﬁcation as per equation 4 ¯ 4. Select the stage ¯ with the best (highest) score. Let h and α be the classiﬁer and ı ¯ weight found at that stage. ¯¯ 5. Let g¯(x) ← g¯(x) + αh(x). ı ı 6. Update the weights (see equation 2): ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, multiply w¯ by eαh(x¯ ) . ı ¯ k k ¯ ı • ∀1 ≤ k ≤ n, j > ¯, multiply wj by e−αh(x¯ ) . ı 7. Repeat from step 3 Figure 1: Chained Boosting Algorithm 2.1 Weight Optimization We ﬁrst assume that the stage at which to add a new subclassiﬁer and the subclassiﬁer to add have ¯ ¯ already been chosen: ¯ and h, respectively. That is, h will become h¯,m¯+1 but we simplify it for ı ı ı ease of expression. Our goal is to ﬁnd α ¯,m¯+1 which we similarly abbreviate to α. We ﬁrst deﬁne ¯ ı ı k k wi = ck egi (xi )− i Pi−1 j=1 gj (xk ) j (2) + as the weight of example k at stage i, or its current contribution to our risk bound. If we let D h be ¯ − ¯ the set of indexes of the members of D for which h returns +1, and let D h be similarly deﬁned for ¯ ¯ returns −1, we can further deﬁne those for which h s+1 + W¯ = ı k w¯ + ı + k∈Dh ¯ s+1 k wi − W¯ = ı − ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ k w¯ + ı − k∈Dh ¯ k wi . + ı k∈Dh i=¯+1 ¯ + ¯ We interpret W¯ to be the sum of the weights which h will emphasize. That is, it corresponds to ı ¯ ¯ the weights along the path that h selects: For those examples for which h recommends termination, we add the current weight (related to the cost of stopping the processing at this stage). For those ¯ examples for which h recommends continued processing, we add in all future weights (related to all − future costs associated with this example). W¯ can be similarly interpreted to be the weights (or ı ¯ costs) that h recommends skipping. If we optimize the loss bound of Equation 1 with respect to α, we obtain ¯ α= ¯ 1 Wı− log ¯ . + 2 W¯ ı (3) The more weight (cost) that the rule recommends to skip, the higher its α coefﬁcient. 2.2 Full Optimization Using Equation 3 it is straight forward to show that the reduction in Equation 1 due to the addition of this new subclassiﬁer will be + ¯ − ¯ W¯ (1 − eα ) + W¯ (1 − e−α ) . ı ı (4) We know of no efﬁcient method for determining ¯, the stage at which to add a subclassiﬁer, except ı by exhaustive search. However, within a stage, the choice of which subclassiﬁer to use becomes one of maximizing n s+1 k¯ k k z¯ h(x¯ ) , where z¯ = ı ı ı k k wi − w¯ ı (5) i=¯+1 ı k=1 ¯ with respect to h. This is equivalent to an weighted empirical risk minimization where the training 1 2 n k k set is {x¯ , x¯ , . . . , x¯ }. The label of x¯ is the sign of z¯ , and the weight of the same example is the ı ı ı ı ı k magnitude of z¯ . ı 2.3 Algorithm The resulting algorithm is only slightly more complex than standard Adaboost. Instead of a weight vector (one weight for each data example), we now have a weight matrix (one weight for each data example for each stage). We initialize each weight to be the cost associated with halting the corresponding example at the corresponding stage. We start with all g i (x) = 0. The complete algorithm is as in Figure 1. Each time through steps 3 through 7, we complete one “round” and add one additional rule to one stage of the processing. We stop executing this loop when α ≤ 0 or when an iteration counter ¯ exceeds a preset threshold. Bottom-Up Variation In situations where information is only gained after each stage (such as in section 4), we can also train the classiﬁers “bottom-up.” That is, we can start by only adding classiﬁers to the last stage. Once ﬁnished with it, we proceed to the previous stage, and so on. Thus instead of selecting the best stage, i, in each round, we systematically work our way backward through the stages, never revisiting previously set stages. 3 Performance Bounds Using the bounds in [3] we can provide a risk bound for this problem. We let E denote the expectaˆ tion with respect to the true distribution p(x, c) and En denote the empirical average with respect to the n training samples. We ﬁrst bound the indicator function with a piece-wise linear function, b θ , 1 with a maximum slope of θ : z ,0 . I(z > 0) ≤ bθ (z) = max min 1, 1 + θ We then bound the loss: L(f (x), c) ≤ φ θ (f (x), c) where s+1 φθ (f (x), c) = ci min{bθ (gi (xi )), bθ (−gi−1 (xi−1 )), bθ (−gi−2 (xi−2 )), . . . , bθ (−g1 (x1 ))} i=1 s+1 i ci Bθ (gi (xi ), gi−1 (xi−1 ), . . . , g1 (x1 )) = i=1 We replaced the product of indicator functions with a minimization and then bounded each indicator i with bθ . Bθ is just a more compact presentation of the composition of the function b θ and the minimization. We assume that the weights α at each stage have been scaled to sum to 1. This has no affect on the resulting classiﬁcations, but is necessary for the derivation below. Before stating the theorem, for clarity, we state two standard deﬁnition: Deﬁnition 1. Let p(x) be a probability distribution on the set X and let {x 1 , x2 , . . . , xn } be n independent samples from p(x). Let σ 1 , σ 2 , . . . , σ n be n independent samples from a Rademacher random variable (a binary variable that takes on either +1 or −1 with equal probability). Let F be a class of functions mapping X to . Deﬁne the Rademacher Complexity of F to be Rn (F ) = E sup f ∈F n 1 n σ i f (xi ) i=1 1 where the expectation is over the random draws of x through xn and σ 1 through σ n . Deﬁnition 2. Let p(x), {x1 , x2 , . . . , xn }, and F be as above. Let g 1 , g 2 , . . . , g n be n independent samples from a Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and variance 1. Analogous to the above deﬁnition, deﬁne the Gaussian Complexity of G to be Gn (F ) = E sup f ∈F 1 n n g i f (xi ) . i=1 We can now state our theorem, bounding the true risk by a function of the empirical risk: Theorem 3. Let H1 , H2 , . . . , Hs be the sequence of the sets of functions from which the base classiﬁer draws for chain boosting. If H i is closed under negation for all i, all costs are bounded between 0 and 1, and the weights for the classiﬁers at each stage sum to 1, then with probability 1 − δ, k ˆ E [L(f (x), c)] ≤ En [φθ (f (x), c)] + θ s (i + 1)Gn (Hi ) + i=1 8 ln 2 δ n for some constant k. Proof. Theorem 8 of [3] states ˆ E [L(x, c)] ≤ En (φθ (f (x), c)) + 2Rn (φθ ◦ F ) + 8 ln 2 δ n and therefore we need only bound the R n (φθ ◦ F ) term to demonstrate our theorem. For our case, we have 1 Rn (φθ ◦ F ) = E sup n f ∈F = E sup f ∈F 1 n s+1 ≤ E sup j=1 f ∈F n n σ i φθ (f (xi ), ci ) i=1 s+1 σi i=1 1 n s ci Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) j j j−1 1 j=1 n s+1 s σ i Bθ (gj (xi ), gj−1 (xi ), . . . , g1 (xi )) = j j−1 1 i=1 s Rn (Bθ ◦ G j ) j=1 where Gi is the space of convex combinations of functions from H i and G i is the cross product of G1 through Gi . The inequality comes from switching the expectation and the maximization and then from dropping the c i (see [4], lemma 5). j s s Lemma 4 of [3] states that there exists a k such that R n (Bθ ◦ G j ) ≤ kGn (Bθ ◦ G j ). Theorem 14 j 2 s j s of the same paper allows us to conclude that G n (Bθ ◦ G ) ≤ θ i=1 Gn (Gi ). (Because Bθ is the 1 s minimum over a set of functions with maximum slope of θ , the maximum slope of B θ is also 1 .) θ Theorem 12, part 2 states G n (Gi ) = Gn (Hi ). Taken together, this proves our result. Note that this bound has only quadratic dependence on s, the length of the chain and does not explicitly depend on the number of rounds of boosting (the number of rounds affects φ θ which, in turn, affects the bound). 4 Application We tested our algorithm on the MIT face database [5]. This database contains 19-by-19 gray-scale images of faces and non-faces. The training set has 2429 face images and 4548 non-face images. The testing set has 472 faces and 23573 non-faces. We weighted the training set images so that the ratio of the weight of face images to non-face images matched the ratio in the testing set. 0.4 0.4 CB Global CB Bottom−up SVM Boosting 0.3 0.25 0.2 0.15 0.1 150 0.2 100 0.1 False positive rate 0.3 50 Average number of pixels 0.35 average cost/error per example 200 training cost training error testing cost testing error 0.05 0 100 200 300 400 500 number of rounds 700 1000 (a) 0 0 0.2 0.4 0.6 False negative rate 0.8 0 1 (b) Figure 2: (a) Accuracy verses the number of rounds for a typical run, (b) Error rates and average costs for a variety of cost settings. 4.1 Object Detection as Chained Boosting Our goal is to produce a classiﬁer that can identify non-face images at very low resolutions, thereby allowing for quick processing of large images (as explained later). Most image patches (or subwindows) do not contain faces. We, therefore, built a multi-stage detection system where any early rejection is labeled as a non-face. The ﬁrst stage looks at image patches of size 3-by-3 (i.e. a lowerresolution version of the 19-by-19 original image). The next stage looks at the same image, but at a resolution of 6-by-6. The third stage considers the image at 12-by-12. We did not present the full 19-by-19 images as the classiﬁcation did not signiﬁcantly improve over the 12-by-12 versions. We employ a simple base classiﬁer: the set of all functions that look at a single pixel and predict the class by thresholding the pixel’s value. The total classiﬁer at any stage is a linear combination of these simple classiﬁers. For a given stage, all of the base classiﬁers that target a particular pixel are added together producing a complex function of the value of the pixel. Yet, this pixel can only take on a ﬁnite number of values (256 in this case). Therefore, we can compile this set of base classiﬁers into a single look-up function that maps the brightness of the pixel into a real number. The total classiﬁer for the whole stage is merely the sum of these look-up functions. Therefore, the total work necessary to compute the classiﬁcation at a stage is proportional to the number of pixels in the image considered at that stage, regardless of the number of base classiﬁers used. We therefore assign a cost to each stage of processing proportional to the number of pixels at that stage. If the image is a face, we add a negative cost (i.e. bonus) if the image is allowed to pass through all of the processing stages (and is therefore “accepted” as a face). If the image is a nonface, we add a bonus if the image is rejected at any stage before completion (i.e. correctly labelled). While this dataset has only segmented image patches, in a real application, the classiﬁer would be run on all sub-windows of an image. More importantly, it would also be run at multiple resolutions in order to detect faces of different sizes (or at different distances from the camera). The classiﬁer chain could be run simultaneously at each of these resolutions. To wit, while running the ﬁnal 12-by12 stage at one resolution of the image, the 6-by-6 (previous) stage could be run at the same image resolution. This 6-by-6 processing would be the necessary pre-processing step to running the 12-by12 stage at a higher resolution. As we run our ﬁnal scan for big faces (at a low resolution), we can already (at the same image resolution) be performing initial tests to throw out portions of the image as not worthy of testing for smaller faces (at a higher resolution). Most of the work of detecting objects must be done at the high resolutions because there are many more overlapping subwindows. This chained method allows the culling of most of this high-resolution image processing. 4.2 Experiments For each example, we construct a vector of stage costs as above. We add a constant to this vector to ensure that the minimal element is zero, as per section 1.1. We scale all vectors by the same amount to ensure that the maximal value is 1.This means that the number of misclassiﬁcations is an upper bound on the total cost that the learning algorithm is trying to minimize. There are three ﬂexible quantities in this problem formulation: the cost of a pixel evaluation, the bonus for a correct face classiﬁcation, and the bonus for a correct non-face classiﬁcation. Changing these quantities will control the trade-off between false positives and true positives, and between classiﬁcation error and speed. Figure 2(a) shows the result of a typical run of the algorithm. As a function of the number of rounds, it plots the cost (that which the algorithm is trying to minimize) and the error (number of misclassiﬁed image patches), for both the training and testing sets (where the training set has been reweighted to have the same proportion of faces to non-faces as the testing set). We compared our algorithm’s performance to the performance of support vector machines (SVM) [6] and Adaboost [1] trained and tested on the highest resolution, 12-by-12, image patches. We employed SVM-light [7] with a linear kernels. Figure 2(b) compares the error rates for the methods (solid lines, read against the left vertical axis). Note that the error rates are almost identical for the methods. The dashed lines (read against the right vertical axis) show the average number of pixels evaluated (or total processing cost) for each of the methods. The SVM and Adaboost algorithms have a constant processing cost. Our method (by either training scheme) produces lower processing cost for most error rates. 5 Related Work Cascade detectors for vision processing (see [8] or [9] for example) may appear to be similar to the work in this paper. Especially at ﬁrst glance for the area of object detection, they appear almost the same. However, cascade detection and this work (chained detection) are quite different. Cascade detectors are built one at a time. A coarse detector is ﬁrst trained. The examples which pass that detector are then passed to a ﬁner detector for training, and so on. A series of targets for false-positive rates deﬁne the increasing accuracy of the detector cascade. By contrast, our chain detectors are trained as an ensemble. This is necessary because of two differences in the problem formulation. First, we assume that the information available at each stage changes. Second, we assume there is an explicit cost model that dictates the cost of proceeding from stage to stage and the cost of rejection (or acceptance) at any particular stage. By contrast, cascade detectors are seeking to minimize computational power necessary for a ﬁxed decision. Therefore, the information available to all of the stages is the same, and there are no ﬁxed costs associated with each stage. The ability to train all of the classiﬁers at the same time is crucial to good performance in our framework. The ﬁrst classiﬁer in the chain cannot determine whether it is advantageous to send an example further along unless it knows how the later stages will process the example. Conversely, the later stages cannot construct optimal classiﬁcations until they know the distribution of examples that they will see. Section 4.1 may further confuse the matter. We demonstrated how chained boosting can be used to reduce the computational costs of object detection in images. Cascade detectors are often used for the same purpose. However, the reductions in computational time come from two different sources. In cascade detectors, the time taken to evaluate a given image patch is reduced. In our chained detector formulation, image patches are ignored completely based on analysis of lower resolution patches in the image pyramid. To further illustrate the difference, cascade detectors can always be used to speed up asymmetric classiﬁcation tasks (and are often applied to image detection). By contrast, in Section 4.1 we have exploited the fact that object detection in images is typically performed at multiple scales to turn the problem into a pipeline and apply our framework. Cascade detectors address situations in which prior class probabilities are not equal, while chained detectors address situations in which information is gained at a cost. Both are valid (and separate) ways of tackling image processing (and other tasks as well). In many ways, they are complementary approaches. Classic sequence analysis [10, 11] also addresses the problem of optimal stopping. However, it assumes that the samples are drawn i.i.d. from (usually) a known distribution. Our problem is quite different in that each consecutive sample is drawn from a different (and related) distribution and our goal is to ﬁnd a decision rule without producing a generative model. WaldBoost [12] is a boosting algorithm based on this. It builds a series of features and a ratio comparison test in order to decide when to stop. For WaldBoost, the available features (information) not change between stages. Rather, any feature is available for selection at any point in the chain. Again, this is a different problem than the one considered in this paper. 6 Conclusions We feel this framework of staged decision making is useful in a wide variety of areas. This paper demonstrated how the framework applies to one vision processing task. Obviously it also applies to manufacturing pipelines where errors can be introduced at different stages. It should also be applicable to scenarios where information gathering is costly. Our current formulation only allows for early negative detection. In the face detection example above, this means that in order to report “face,” the classiﬁer must process each stage, even if the result is assured earlier. In Figure 2(b), clearly the upper-left corner (100% false positives and 0% false negatives) is reachable with little effort: classify everything positive without looking at any features. We would like to extend this framework to cover such two-sided early decisions. While perhaps not useful in manufacturing (or even face detection, where the interesting part of the ROC curve is far from the upper-left), it would make the framework more applicable to informationgathering applications.

<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>5 0.56950444 <a title="73-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Cuturi, Kenji Fukumizu</p><p>Abstract: We propose a family of kernels for structured objects which is based on the bag-ofcomponents paradigm. However, rather than decomposing each complex object into the single histogram of its components, we use for each object a family of nested histograms, where each histogram in this hierarchy describes the object seen from an increasingly granular perspective. We use this hierarchy of histograms to deﬁne elementary kernels which can detect coarse and ﬁne similarities between the objects. We compute through an efﬁcient averaging trick a mixture of such speciﬁc kernels, to propose a ﬁnal kernel value which weights efﬁciently local and global matches. We propose experimental results on an image retrieval experiment which show that this mixture is an effective template procedure to be used with kernels on histograms.</p><p>6 0.56829661 <a title="73-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Discriminative_Visual_Codebooks_using_Randomized_Clustering_Forests.html">78 nips-2006-Fast Discriminative Visual Codebooks using Randomized Clustering Forests</a></p>

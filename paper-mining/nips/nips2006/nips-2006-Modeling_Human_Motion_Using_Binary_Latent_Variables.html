<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efﬁcient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also conﬁrm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.</p><p>3 0.274198 <a title="134-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Motion_Style_Synthesis_from_Perceptual_Observations.html">111 nips-2006-Learning Motion Style Synthesis from Perceptual Observations</a></p>
<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Peggy Hackney, Christoph Bregler</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an algorithm for synthesis of human motion in speciﬁed styles. We use a theory of movement observation (Laban Movement Analysis) to describe movement styles as points in a multi-dimensional perceptual space. We cast the task of learning to synthesize desired movement styles as a regression problem: sequences generated via space-time interpolation of motion capture data are used to learn a nonlinear mapping between animation parameters and movement styles in perceptual space. We demonstrate that the learned model can apply a variety of motion styles to pre-recorded motion sequences and it can extrapolate styles not originally included in the training data. 1</p><p>4 0.16012056 <a title="134-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Recursive_ICA.html">167 nips-2006-Recursive ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghao Shan, Lingyun Zhang, Garrison W. Cottrell</p><p>Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular method for extracting independent features from visual data. However, as a fundamentally linear technique, there is always nonlinear residual redundancy that is not captured by ICA. Hence there have been many attempts to try to create a hierarchical version of ICA, but so far none of the approaches have a natural way to apply them more than once. Here we show that there is a relatively simple technique that transforms the absolute values of the outputs of a previous application of ICA into a normal distribution, to which ICA maybe applied again. This results in a recursive ICA algorithm that may be applied any number of times in order to extract higher order structure from previous layers. 1</p><p>5 0.12846635 <a title="134-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>6 0.12492507 <a title="134-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Max-margin_classification_of_incomplete_data.html">130 nips-2006-Max-margin classification of incomplete data</a></p>

<p>Author: Ce Liu, William T. Freeman, Edward H. Adelson</p><p>Abstract: A reliable motion estimation algorithm must function under a wide range of conditions. One regime, which we consider here, is the case of moving objects with contours but no visible texture. Tracking distinctive features such as corners can disambiguate the motion of contours, but spurious features such as T-junctions can be badly misleading. It is difﬁcult to determine the reliability of motion from local measurements, since a full rank covariance matrix can result from both real and spurious features. We propose a novel approach that avoids these points altogether, and derives global motion estimates by utilizing information from three levels of contour analysis: edgelets, boundary fragments and contours. Boundary fragment are chains of orientated edgelets, for which we derive motion estimates from local evidence. The uncertainties of the local estimates are disambiguated after the boundary fragments are properly grouped into contours. The grouping is done by constructing a graphical model and marginalizing it using importance sampling. We propose two equivalent representations in this graphical model, reversible switch variables attached to the ends of fragments and fragment chains, to capture both local and global statistics of boundaries. Our system is successfully applied to both synthetic and real video sequences containing high-contrast boundaries and textureless regions. The system produces good motion estimates along with properly grouped and completed contours.</p><p>6 0.4117898 <a title="134-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Comparative_Gene_Prediction_using_Conditional_Random_Fields.html">54 nips-2006-Comparative Gene Prediction using Conditional Random Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>2 0.92757589 <a title="134-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Small_World_Threshold_for_Economic_Network_Formation.html">14 nips-2006-A Small World Threshold for Economic Network Formation</a></p>
<p>Author: Eyal Even-dar, Michael Kearns</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a game-theoretic model for network formation inspired by earlier stochastic models that mix localized and long-distance connectivity. In this model, players may purchase edges at distance d at a cost of dα , and wish to minimize the sum of their edge purchases and their average distance to other players. In this model, we show there is a striking “small world” threshold phenomenon: in two dimensions, if α < 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network of constant diameter (independent of network size), and if α > 2 then every Nash equilibrium results in a network whose diameter grows as a root of the network size, and thus is unbounded. We contrast our results with those of Kleinberg [8] in a stochastic model, and empirically investigate the “navigability” of equilibrium networks. Our theoretical results all generalize to higher dimensions. 1</p><p>3 0.91285908 <a title="134-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Sample_Complexity_of_Policy_Search_with_Known_Dynamics.html">171 nips-2006-Sample Complexity of Policy Search with Known Dynamics</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Ambuj Tewari</p><p>Abstract: We consider methods that try to ﬁnd a good policy for a Markov decision process by choosing one from a given class. The policy is chosen based on its empirical performance in simulations. We are interested in conditions on the complexity of the policy class that ensure the success of such simulation based policy search methods. We show that under bounds on the amount of computation involved in computing policies, transition dynamics and rewards, uniform convergence of empirical estimates to true value functions occurs. Previously, such results were derived by assuming boundedness of pseudodimension and Lipschitz continuity. These assumptions and ours are both stronger than the usual combinatorial complexity measures. We show, via minimax inequalities, that this is essential: boundedness of pseudodimension or fat-shattering dimension alone is not sufﬁcient.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.8743186 <a title="134-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Modeling_Human_Motion_Using_Binary_Latent_Variables.html">134 nips-2006-Modeling Human Motion Using Binary Latent Variables</a></p>

After training, the model ﬁnds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during motion capture.

<p>Author: Jiayuan Huang, Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We consider the scenario where training and test data are drawn from different distributions, commonly referred to as sample selection bias. Most algorithms for this setting try to ﬁrst recover sampling distributions and then make appropriate corrections based on the distribution estimate. We present a nonparametric method which directly produces resampling weights without distribution estimation. Our method works by matching distributions between training and testing sets in feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that our method works well in practice.</p><p>6 0.67871892 <a title="134-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Logarithmic_Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Reinforcement_Learning.html">125 nips-2006-Logarithmic Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

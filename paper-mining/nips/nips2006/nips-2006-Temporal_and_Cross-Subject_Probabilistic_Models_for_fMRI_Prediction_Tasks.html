</p><p>4 We also employed non-traditional methods for feature selection and regularization that exploit the spatial structure of voxel activity in the brain. [sent-6, score-0.492]

</p><p>6 Functional scans can be taken during a task of interest, such as the subject viewing images or reading text, thus providing a glimpse of how brain activity changes in response to certain stimuli and tasks. [sent-9, score-0.51]
</p><p>7 An fMRI session produces scans of the brain volume across time, obtaining BOLD measurements from thousands of small sub-volumes, or voxels at each time step. [sent-10, score-0.883]
</p><p>8 Much of the current fMRI research focuses on the goal of identifying brain regions activated in response to some task or stimulus (e. [sent-11, score-0.267]
</p><p>9 Going beyond identifying the location of responsive regions, these models begin to demonstrate how the brain encodes states and stimuli [3], often capturing distributed patterns of activation across multiple brain regions simultaneously. [sent-20, score-0.528]
</p><p>10 The recent Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Competition [2] (PBAIC), featured both the use of complex stimuli and a prediction task, presenting a unique data set for predicting subjective experiences given functional MRI sessions. [sent-24, score-0.293]
</p><p>11 Functional scans from three subjects were taken while the subjects watched three video segments. [sent-25, score-0.46]
</p><p>12 Thus, during the scan, subjects were exposed to rich stimuli including rapidly changing images of people, meaningful sounds such as dialog and music, and even emotional stimuli, all overlapping in time. [sent-26, score-0.3]
</p><p>13 Given this data set, the goal was to predict these real-valued subjective ratings for each subject based only on the fMRI scans. [sent-28, score-0.553]
</p><p>14 The structured probabilistic framework allowed us to represent many relevant relationships in the data, including evolution of subjective ratings over time, the likelihood of different subjects rating experiences similarly, and of course the relationship between voxels and ratings. [sent-30, score-1.554]
</p><p>15 We also explored novel feature selection methods, which exploit the spatial characteristics of brain activity. [sent-31, score-0.275]
</p><p>16 We demonstrate the performance of our model by training from a subset of the movie sessions and predicting ratings for held out movies. [sent-33, score-0.545]
</p><p>17 An analysis of our learned models, in particular our feature selection results, also provides some insight into the regions of the brain activated by different stimuli and states. [sent-36, score-0.389]
</p><p>18 The backbone of the model is a conditional linear Gaussian model, capturing the dependence of ratings on voxel measurements. [sent-38, score-0.665]
</p><p>19 The variables in our model are voxel activations and ratings. [sent-40, score-0.264]
</p><p>20 For each subject s and each time point t, we have a collection of ratings Rs (·, t), with Rs (j, t) representing the jth rating type (for instance Language) for s at time t. [sent-41, score-0.746]
</p><p>21 Note that the rating sequences given by the subjects are actually convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function before use, to account for the delay inherent in the BOLD signal response [4]. [sent-42, score-0.541]
</p><p>22 For each s and t, we also have the voxel activities Vs (·, t). [sent-43, score-0.264]
</p><p>23 Each rating Rs (j, t) is modeled as a linear Gaussian random variable, dependent only on voxels from 2 that subject’s brain as features. [sent-46, score-1.025]
</p><p>24 We assume that the dependence of the rating on the voxels is time-invariant, so that the same parameters ws (j) and σs are used for every time point. [sent-48, score-1.013]
</p><p>25 Importantly, however, each rating should not depend on all of the subject’s voxels, as this is neither biologically likely nor statistically plausible given the large number of voxels. [sent-49, score-0.292]
</p><p>26 In our setting, we want to express a conditional linear Gaussian of the ratings given the voxels. [sent-71, score-0.401]
</p><p>27 A distribution P (X | Y ) can also be parametrized using the joint precision matrix: P (X | Y ) =  1 Z(Y )  i  1 2 exp − QXX (i, i)Xi 2  exp (−QXX (i, j)Xi Xj ) i,j∈EX  exp (−QXY (i, k)Xi Yk ), i,k∈EY  where EX is the set of edges between nodes in X, and EY represents edges from Y to X. [sent-72, score-0.277]
</p><p>28 Our particular GMRF is a joint probabilistic model that encompasses, for a particular rating type j, the value of the rating Rs (j, t) for all of the subjects s across all time points t. [sent-73, score-0.856]
</p><p>29 Thus, the variables in the model are: all of the voxel measurements Vs (l, t), for all s, t and voxels l selected to be relevant to rating j; and all of the ratings Rs (j, t) (for all s, t). [sent-77, score-1.576]
</p><p>30 As we discuss below, the model is trained conditionally, and therefore encodes a joint distribution over the rating variables, conditional on all of the voxel measurements. [sent-78, score-0.643]
</p><p>31 Thus, there will be no free parameters corresponding to the voxel nodes due to the use of a conditional model, while rating nodes Rs (j, ·) have an associated node potential parameter Qnode (s, j). [sent-79, score-0.652]
</p><p>32 Each rating node Rs (j, t) has edges connecting it to a subset of relevant voxels from Vs (·, t) at the same time slice. [sent-80, score-0.924]
</p><p>33 The set of voxels can vary for different ratings or subjects, but is consistent across time. [sent-81, score-0.976]
</p><p>34 The precision matrix entry Qvoxel (s, j, v) parametrizes the edge from voxel v to rating j. [sent-82, score-0.627]
</p><p>35 To encode the dependencies between the rating at different time points, our dynamic model includes edges between each rating Rs (j, t) and the previous and following ratings, Rs (j, t − 1) and Rs (j, t + 1). [sent-83, score-0.653]
</p><p>36 We also use the GMRF to encode the dependencies between the ratings of different subjects, in a way that does not assume that the subjects gave identical ratings, by introducing appropriate edges in the model. [sent-85, score-0.616]
</p><p>37 (1) s,l,t  Learning and Prediction  We learn the parameters of the model above from a data set consisting of all of the voxels and all the subjective ratings for all three subjects. [sent-88, score-1.005]
</p><p>38 We train the parameters discriminatively [10], to maximize the conditional likelihood of the observed ratings given the observed voxel measurements,  as speciﬁed in Eq. [sent-89, score-0.665]
</p><p>39 Conditional training is appropriate in our setting, as our task is precisely to predict the ratings given the voxels; importantly, this form of training allows us to avoid modeling the highly noisy, high-dimensional voxel activation distribution. [sent-91, score-0.671]
</p><p>40 We split parameter learning into two phases, ﬁrst learning the dependence of ratings on voxels, and then learning the parameters between rating nodes. [sent-92, score-0.663]
</p><p>41 The entire joint precision matrix over all voxels and ratings would be prohibitively large for our learning procedure, and this approximation was computationally much more efﬁcient. [sent-93, score-1.03]
</p><p>42 In the ﬁrst phase, we learn linear models to predict each rating given only the voxel activations. [sent-94, score-0.592]
</p><p>43 We then modify our graph, replacing the very large set of voxel nodes with a new, much smaller set of nodes representing the linear combinations of the voxel activations which we just learned. [sent-95, score-0.594]
</p><p>44 1  From Voxels to Ratings  To learn the dependencies of ratings on voxels for a single subject s, we ﬁnd parameters ws (j), using linear regression, which optimize 1 P (Rs (j, ·) | Vs (·, ·)) ∝ exp − 2 (Rs (j, t) − ws (j)T Vs (·, t))2 . [sent-99, score-1.381]
</p><p>45 (2) 2σs t However, to deal with the high dimensionality of the feature space relative to the number of training instances, we utilize feature selection; we also introduce regularization terms into the objective that can be viewed as a spatially-based prior over ws (j). [sent-100, score-0.269]
</p><p>46 First, we reduce the number of voxels involved in the objective for each rating using a simple feature selection method — we compute the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient for each voxel and each rating, and select the most highly correlated features. [sent-101, score-1.257]
</p><p>47 The number of voxels to select is a setting which we tuned, for each rating type individually, using ﬁve-fold cross-validation on the training set. [sent-102, score-0.863]
</p><p>48 We chose to use the same number of voxels across subjects, which is more restrictive but increases the amount of data available for cross-validation. [sent-103, score-0.605]
</p><p>49 Even following this feature selection process, we often still have a large number (perhaps hundreds) of relevant voxels as features, and these features are quite noisy. [sent-104, score-0.659]
</p><p>50 Introducing both types of regularization, we end up with a log-likelihood objective of the form: 2  (Rs (j, t) − ws (j)T Vs (·, t))2 + α t  |ws (j, i)|  ws (j, i) + β i  (3)  i  Finally, we introduce a novel form of regularization, intended to model spatial regularities. [sent-107, score-0.351]
</p><p>51 Letting vi − vk 2 denote the Euclidean distance between voxels vi and vk in the brain, we deﬁne:  1 if vi − vk 2 < dmin ,  if vi − vk 2 > dmax , D(i, k) = 0  dmax − vi −vk 2  otherwise. [sent-111, score-0.958]
</p><p>52 This term can offset the L1 term by co-activating voxels that are spatially nearby. [sent-114, score-0.571]
</p><p>53 Note that this regularization term is applied to the absolute values of the voxel weights, hence allowing nearby voxels to have opposite effects on the rating; we do observe such cases in our learned model. [sent-116, score-0.917]
</p><p>54 Given ws (j), which we consider the optimal linear combination of Vs (·, j) for predicting Rs (j), we remove the voxel nodes Vs (·, t) from our model, and introduce new ‘summary’ nodes Uj (t) = ws (j)T Vs (·, t). [sent-124, score-0.656]
</p><p>55 3  Prediction  Prediction of unseen ratings given new fMRI scans can be obtained through probabilistic inference on the models learned for each rating type. [sent-137, score-0.755]
</p><p>56 We incorporate the observed voxel data from all three subjects as observed values in our GMRF, which induces a Gaussian posterior over the joint set of ratings. [sent-138, score-0.477]
</p><p>57 As the objective is convex, this process is guaranteed to converge to the mode of the posterior Gaussian, providing the most likely ratings for all subjects, at all time points, given the functional data from scans during a new movie. [sent-144, score-0.489]
</p><p>58 Before use in prediction, the rating sequences were convolved with a standard hemodynamic response function [4]. [sent-154, score-0.342]
</p><p>59 The core ratings used in the competition were Amusement, Attention, Arousal, Body Parts, Environmental Sounds, Faces, Food, Language, Laughter, Motion, Music, Sadness, and Tools. [sent-155, score-0.43]
</p><p>60 Since the ratings are continuous values, competition scoring was based on the correlation (for frames where the movie is playing) of predicted  0. [sent-156, score-0.536]

</p><p>63 ratings with true ratings, across rating types and all subjects, combined using a z ′ -transform. [sent-176, score-0.697]
</p><p>64 To train our model, we use the fMRI measurements along with all ratings from all subjects’ sessions for some set of movies, holding out other movies for testing. [sent-178, score-0.48]
</p><p>65 The learned model is then used to predict ratings for the held out test movies for all subjects, from fMRI data alone. [sent-181, score-0.47]
</p><p>66 We also evaluate the results of our feature selection steps, examining which regions of the brain are used for each rating prediction. [sent-183, score-0.562]
</p><p>67 We also constructed two simpliﬁed versions of our GMRF, one which includes edges between subjects but not time interactions, and conversely one which includes time interactions but removed subject edges. [sent-193, score-0.319]
</p><p>68 We also see that the addition of a spatial prior (using cross-validation to select which ratings to apply it to), results in a small additional improvement, which we explore further in Sec. [sent-198, score-0.445]
</p><p>69 Performance on each of the rating types individually is shown in Fig. [sent-201, score-0.317]
</p><p>70 One interesting note is that the relative ordering of rating type accuracy for the different models is surprisingly consistent. [sent-203, score-0.292]
</p><p>71 We trained the model using data from Movie1 and Movie2 and the corresponding ratings from all three subjects. [sent-206, score-0.371]

</p><p>73 2  Voxel Selection and Regularization  We also examined the results of feature selection and regularization, looking at the location of voxels used for each rating, and the differences resulting from various techniques. [sent-221, score-0.633]
</p><p>74 Starting with the approximately 30, 000 brain voxels per subject, we apply our feature selection techniques, using cross-validation on training sessions to determine the number of voxels used to predict each rating. [sent-222, score-1.454]
</p><p>75 For instance, a small voxel set (less than 100) performs well for the Body Parts rating, while the Language rating does well with several hundred voxels, and Amusement uses an intermediate number. [sent-225, score-0.556]
</p><p>76 This may reﬂect the actual size and number of brain regions activated by such stimuli, but likely also reﬂects voxel noise and the difﬁculty of the individual predictions. [sent-226, score-0.508]
</p><p>77 Visualization demonstrates that our selected voxels often occur in regions known to be responsive to relevant stimuli. [sent-227, score-0.692]
</p><p>78 For instance, voxels selected for Motion in all subjects include voxels in cortical areas known to respond to motion in the visual ﬁeld (Fig. [sent-228, score-1.372]
</p><p>79 Likewise, many voxels selected for Language occur in regions linked to language processing (Fig. [sent-230, score-0.727]
</p><p>80 However, many other voxels were not from expected brain regions, attributable in part to noise in the data, but also due to the intermixed and correlated stimuli in the videos. [sent-232, score-0.844]
</p><p>81 For instance, the ratings Language and Faces for subject 1 in Movie1 have correlation 0. [sent-233, score-0.494]
</p><p>82 68, and we observed that the voxels selected for Faces and Language overlapped signiﬁcantly. [sent-234, score-0.599]
</p><p>83 Voxels in the language centers of the brain improve the prediction of Faces since the two stimuli are causally related, but it might be preferable to capture this correlation by adding edges between the rating nodes of our GMRF. [sent-235, score-0.767]
</p><p>84 Interestingly, there was some consistency in voxel selection between subjects, even though our model did not incorporate cross-subject voxel selection. [sent-236, score-0.566]
</p><p>85 4(a), we see that the respective voxels do come from similar regions. [sent-239, score-0.571]
</p><p>86 We added the prior for ratings which it improved in cross-validation trials for all subjects — Motion, Language, and Faces. [sent-242, score-0.57]
</p><p>87 Comparison of the voxels selected with and without our spatial prior reveal that it does result in more spatially coherent groups of voxels. [sent-243, score-0.673]
</p><p>88 Note the total number of voxels selected does not rise in general. [sent-244, score-0.599]
</p><p>89 4(a), the voxels for Faces for subject 3 include a relevant group of voxels even without the prior, but including the spatial prior results in inluding additional voxels voxels near this region. [sent-246, score-2.467]
</p><p>90 Arousal prediction was actually hurt by including the spatial prior, and looking at the voxels selected for subject 2 for Arousal Fig. [sent-248, score-0.773]
</p><p>91 Further, while voxels are very noisy, with appropriate regularization and the use of a spatially-based prior, reliable prediction was possible using individual voxels as features. [sent-253, score-1.23]
</p><p>92 Although voxels were selected from the whole brain, many of the voxels selected as features in our model were located in brain regions known to be activated by relevant stimuli. [sent-254, score-1.468]
</p><p>93 One natural extension to our work would include the addition of interactions between distinct rating types, such as Language and Faces, which are likely to be correlated. [sent-255, score-0.317]
</p><p>94 This may improve predictions, and could also result in more targeted voxel selection for each rating. [sent-256, score-0.302]
</p><p>95 More broadly, though, the PBAIC experiments provided an extremely rich data set, including complex spatial and temporal interactions among brain voxels and among features of the stimuli. [sent-257, score-0.83]
</p><p>96 There are many aspects of this data we have yet to explore, including modeling the relationships between the voxels themselves across time, perhaps identifying interesting cascading patterns of voxel activity. [sent-258, score-0.869]
</p><p>97 Another interesting direction would be to determine which temporal aspects of the semantic ratings are best encoded by brain activity — for instance it is possible that brain activity may respond more strongly to changes in some stimuli rather than simply stimulus presence. [sent-259, score-0.932]
</p><p>98 Such investigations could provide further insight into brain activity in response to complex stimuli in addition to improving our ability to make accurate predictions from fMRI data. [sent-260, score-0.364]

<p>Author: Enrico Simonotto, Heather Whalley, Stephen Lawrie, Lawrence Murray, David Mcgonigle, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Structural equation models can be seen as an extension of Gaussian belief networks to cyclic graphs, and we show they can be understood generatively as the model for the joint distribution of long term average equilibrium activity of Gaussian dynamic belief networks. Most use of structural equation models in fMRI involves postulating a particular structure and comparing learnt parameters across different groups. In this paper it is argued that there are situations where priors about structure are not ﬁrm or exhaustive, and given sufﬁcient data, it is worth investigating learning network structure as part of the approach to connectivity analysis. First we demonstrate structure learning on a toy problem. We then show that for particular fMRI data the simple models usually assumed are not supported. We show that is is possible to learn sensible structural equation models that can provide modelling beneﬁts, but that are not necessarily going to be the same as a true causal model, and suggest the combination of prior models and learning or the use of temporal information from dynamic models may provide more beneﬁts than learning structural equations alone. 1</p><p>3 0.14372832 <a title="188-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_Integrating_Source_Localization_and_Noise_Suppression_of_MEG_and_EEG_data.html">12 nips-2006-A Probabilistic Algorithm Integrating Source Localization and Noise Suppression of MEG and EEG data</a></p>
<p>Author: Johanna M. Zumer, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a novel algorithm for integrating source localization and noise suppression based on a probabilistic graphical model of stimulus-evoked MEG/EEG data. Our algorithm localizes multiple dipoles while suppressing noise sources with the computational complexity equivalent to a single dipole scan, and is therefore more efﬁcient than traditional multidipole ﬁtting procedures. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time course of several simultaneously-active dipoles, with rotating or ﬁxed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. Furthermore, the algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm for localizing auditory cortex in a tumor patient and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated. 1</p><p>4 0.14343111 <a title="188-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Humanlike_Predictor_of_Facial_Attractiveness.html">4 nips-2006-A Humanlike Predictor of Facial Attractiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Kagian, Gideon Dror, Tommer Leyvand, Daniel Cohen-or, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general. 1 I n trod u cti on Philosophers, artists and scientists have been trying to capture the nature of beauty since the early days of philosophy. Although in modern days a common layman's notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion, recent findings suggest that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness and that their preferences may be an innate part of the primary constitution of our nature. Several experiments have shown that 2 to 8 months old infants prefer looking at faces which adults rate as being more attractive [1]. In addition, attractiveness ratings show very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures [2]. Such findings give rise to the quest for common factors which determine human facial attractiveness. Accordingly, various hypotheses, from cognitive, evolutional and social perspectives, have been put forward to describe the common preferences for facial beauty. Inspired by Sir Francis Galton’s photographic method of composing faces [3], Rubenstein, Langlois and Roggman created averaged faces by morphing multiple images together and proposed that averageness is the answer for facial attractiveness [4, 5]. Human judges found these averaged faces to be attractive and rated them with attractiveness ratings higher than the mean rating of the component faces composing them. Grammer and Thornhill have investigated symmetry and averageness of faces and concluded that symmetry was more important than averageness in facial attractiveness [6]. Little and colleagues have agreed that average faces are attractive but claim that faces with certain extreme features, such as extreme sexually dimorphic traits, may be more attractive than average faces [7]. Other researchers have suggested various conditions which may contribute to facial attractiveness such as neonate features, pleasant expressions and familiarity. Cunningham and his associates suggest a multiple fitness model in which there is no single constructing line that determines attractiveness. Instead, different categories of features signal different desirable qualities of the perceived target [8]. Even so, the multiple fitness model agrees that some facial qualities are universally physically attractive to people. Apart from eliciting the facial characteristics which account for attractiveness, modern researchers try to describe underlying mechanisms for these preferences. Many contributors refer to the evolutionary origins of attractiveness preferences [9]-[11]. According to this view, facial traits signal mate quality and imply chances for reproductive success and parasite resistance. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that preferred features might not signal mate quality but that the “good taste” by itself is an evolutionary adaptation (individuals with a preference for attractiveness will have attractive offspring that will be favored as mates) [9]. Another mechanism explains attractiveness' preferences through a cognitive theory - a preference for attractive faces might be induced as a by-product of general perception or recognition mechanisms [5, 12]: Attractive faces might be pleasant to look at since they are closer to the cognitive representation of the face category in the mind. These cognitive representations are described as a part of a cognitive mechanism that abstracts prototypes from distinct classes of objects. These prototypes relate to average faces when considering the averageness hypothesis. A third view has suggested that facial attractiveness originates in a social mechanism, where preferences may be dependent on the learning history of the individual and even on his social goals [12]. Different studies have tried to use computational methods in order to analyze facial attractiveness. Averaging faces with morph tools was done in several cases (e.g. [5, 13]). In [14], laser scans of faces were put into complete correspondence with the average face in order to examine the relationship between facial attractiveness, age, and averageness. Another approach was used in [15] where a genetic algorithm, guided by interactive user selections, was programmed to evolve a “most beautiful” female face. [16] used machine learning methods to investigate whether a machine can predict attractiveness ratings by learning a mapping from facial images to their attractiveness scores. Their predictor achieved a significant correlation of 0.6 with average human ratings, demonstrating that facial beauty can be learned by a machine, at least to some degree. However, as human raters still do significantly outperform the predictor of [16], the challenge of constructing a facial attractiveness machine with human level evaluation accuracy has remained open. A primary goal of this study is to surpass these results by developing a machine which obtains human level performance in predicting facial attractiveness. Having accomplished this, our second main goal is to conduct a series of simulated psychophysical experiments and study the resemblance between human and machine judgments. This latter task carries two potential rewards: A. To determine whether the machine can aid in understanding the psychophysics of human facial attractiveness, capitalizing on the ready accessibility of the analysis of its inner workings, and B. To study whether learning an explicit operational ratings prediction task also entails learning implicit humanlike biases, at least for the case of facial attractiveness. 2 2.1 T h e f aci al trai n in g d atab as e: Acq u i s i ti on , p rep roces s i n g an d rep res en tati on Rating facial attractiveness The chosen database was composed of 91 facial images of American females, taken by the Japanese photographer Akira Gomi. All 91 samples were frontal color photographs of young Caucasian females with a neutral expression. All samples were of similar age, skin color and gender. The subjects’ portraits had no accessories or other distracting items such as jewelry. All 91 facial images in the dataset were rated for attractiveness by 28 human raters (15 males, 13 females) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive). Ratings were collected with a specifically designed html interface. Each rater was asked to view the entire set before rating in order to acquire a notion of attractiveness scale. There was no time limit for judging the attractiveness of each sample and raters could go back and adjust the ratings of already rated samples. The images were presented to each rater in a random order and each image was presented on a separate page. The final attractiveness rating of each sample was its mean rating across all raters. To validate that the number of ratings collected adequately represented the ``collective attractiveness rating'' we randomly divided the raters into two disjoint groups of equal size. For each facial image, we calculated the mean rating on each group, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean ratings of the two groups. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The mean correlation between two groups was 0.92 ( = 0.01). This corresponds well to the known level of consistency among groups of raters reported in the literature (e.g. [2]). Hence, the mean ratings collected are stable indicators of attractiveness that can be used for the learning task. The facial set contained faces in all ranges of attractiveness. Final attractiveness ratings range from 1.42 to 5.75 and the mean rating was 3.33 ( = 0.94). 2.2 Data preprocessing and representation Preliminary experimentation with various ways of representing a facial image have systematically shown that features based on measured proportions, distances and angles of faces are most effective in capturing the notion of facial attractiveness (e.g. [16]). To extract facial features we developed an automatic engine that is capable of identifying eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and head contour. In total, we measured 84 coordinates describing the locations of those facial features (Figure 1). Several regions are suggested for extracting mean hair color, mean skin color and skin texture. The feature extraction process was basically automatic but some coordinates needed to be manually adjusted in some of the images. The facial coordinates are used to create a distances-vector of all 3,486 distances between all pairs of coordinates in the complete graph created by all coordinates. For each image, all distances are normalized by face length. In a similar manner, a slopes-vector of all the 3,486 slopes of the lines connecting the facial coordinates is computed. Central fluctuating asymmetry (CFA), which is described in [6], is calculated from the coordinates as well. The application also provides, for each face, Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) values of hair color and skin color, and a measurement of skin smoothness. Figure 1: Facial coordinates with hair and skin sample regions as represented by the facial feature extractor. Coordinates are used for calculating geometric features and asymmetry. Sample regions are used for calculating color values and smoothness. The sample image, used for illustration only, is of T.G. and is presented with her full consent. Combining the distances-vector and the slopes-vector yields a vector representation of 6,972 geometric features for each image. Since strong correlations are expected among the features in such representation, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to these geometric features, producing 90 principal components which span the sub-space defined by the 91 image vector representations. The geometric features are projected on those 90 principal components and supply 90 orthogonal eigenfeatures representing the geometric features. Eight measured features were not included in the PCA analysis, including CFA, smoothness, hair color coordinates (HSV) and skin color coordinates. These features are assumed to be directly connected to human perception of facial attractiveness and are hence kept at their original values. These 8 features were added to the 90 geometric eigenfeatures, resulting in a total of 98 image-features representing each facial image in the dataset. 3 3.1 E xp eri men ts an d resu l ts Predictor construction and validation We experimented with several induction algorithms including simple Linear Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) (both linear as well as non-linear) and Gaussian Processes (GP). However, as the LS-SVM and GP showed no substantial advantage over Linear Regression, the latter was used and is presented in the sequel. A key ingredient in our methods is to use a proper image-features selection strategy. To this end we used subset feature selection, implemented by ranking the image-features by their Pearson correlation with the target. Other ranking functions produced no substantial gain. To measure the performance of our method we removed one sample from the whole dataset. This sample served as a test set. We found, for each left out sample, the optimal number of image-features by performing leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) on the remaining samples and selecting the number of features that minimizes the absolute difference between the algorithm's output and the targets of the training set. In other words, the score for a test example was predicted using a single model based on the training set only. This process was repeated n=91 times, once for each image sample. The vector of attractiveness predictions of all images is then compared with the true targets. These scores are found to be in a high Pearson correlation of 0.82 with the mean ratings of humans (P-value < 10 -23), which corresponds to a normalized Mean Squared Error of 0.39. This accuracy is a marked improvement over the recently published performance results of a Pearson correlation of 0.6 on a similar dataset [16]. The average correlation of an individual human rater to the mean correlations of all other raters in our dataset is 0.67 and the average correlation between the mean ratings of groups of raters is 0.92 (section 2.1). It should be noted that we tried to use this feature selection and training procedure with the original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures, ranking them by their correlation to the targets and selecting up to 300 best ranked features. This, however, has failed to produce good predictors due to strong correlations between the original geometric features (maximal Pearson correlation obtained was 0.26). 3.2 S i m i l a r i t y o f ma c h i n e a n d h u m a n j u d g m e n t s Each rater (human and machine) has a 91 dimensional rating vector describing its Figure 2: Distribution of mean Euclidean distance from each human rater to all other raters in the ratings space. The machine’s average distance form all other raters (left bar) is smaller than the average distance of each of the human raters to all others. attractiveness ratings of all 91 images. These vectors can be embedded in a 91 dimensional ratings space. The Euclidian distance between all raters (human and machine) in this space was computed. Compared with each of the human raters, the ratings of the machine were the closest, on average, to the ratings of all other human raters (Figure 2). To verify that the machine ratings are not outliers that fall out of clusters of human raters (even though their mean distance from the other ratings is small) we surrounded each of the rating vectors in the ratings space with multidimensional spheres of several radius sizes. The machine had more human neighbors than the mean number of neighbors of human raters, testifying that it does not fall between clusters. Finally, for a graphic display of machine ratings among human ratings we applied PCA to machine and human ratings in the rating space and projected all ratings onto the resulting first 2 and 3 principal components. Indeed, the machine is well placed in a mid-zone of human raters (Figure 3). 5 Machine 0 Machine 0 -4 -8 -5 7 5 0 -10 -10 -5 0 5 10 (a) 0 -7 -5 (b) Figure 3: Location of machine ratings among the 28 human ratings: Ratings were projected into 2 dimensions (a) and 3 dimensions (b) by performing PCA on all ratings and projecting them on the first principal components. The projected data explain 29.8% of the variance in (a) and 36.6% in (b). 3.3 Psychophysical experiments in silico A number of simulated psychophysical experiments reveal humanlike biases of the machine's performance. Rubenstein et al. discuss a morphing technique to create mathematically averaged faces from multiple face images [5]. They reported that averaged faces made of 16 and 32 original component images were rated higher in attractiveness than the mean attractiveness ratings of their component faces and higher than composites consisting of fewer faces. In their experiment, 32-component composites were found to be the most attractive. We used a similar technique to create averaged virtually-morphed faces with various numbers of components, nc, and have let the machine predict their attractiveness. To this end, coordinate values of the original component faces were averaged to create a new set of coordinates for the composite. These coordinates were used to calculate the geometrical features and CFA of the averaged face. Smoothness and HSV values for the composite faces were calculated by averaging the corresponding values of the component faces 1. To study the effect of nc on the attractiveness score we produced 1,000 virtual morph images for each value of n c between 2 and 50, and used our attractiveness predictor (section 3.1) to compute the attractiveness scores of the resulting composites. In accordance with the experimental results of [5], the machine manifests a humanlike bias for higher scores of averaged composites over their components’ mean score. Figure 4a, presenting these results, shows the percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite, for each number of components n c. As evident, the attractiveness rating of a composite surpasses a larger percent of its components’ ratings as nc increases. Figure 4a also shows the mean scores of 1,000 1 HSV values are converted to RGB before averaging composites and the mean scores of their components, for each n c (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]). Their actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1. As expected, the mean scores of the components images are independent of n c, while composites’ scores increase with nc. Mean values of smoothness and asymmetry of the composites are presented in Figure 4b. 0.4 Smoothness Asymmetry 0.8 0.2 0.75 0 -0.2 0.7 -0.4 0.65 -0.6 0.6 Fraction of less attractive components Composite's score (normalized) Components' mean score (normalized) 0.55 2 10 20 30 40 -0.8 50 -1 2 Number of components in composite 10 20 30 40 50 Number of components in composite (a) (b) Figure 4: Mean results over 1,000 composites made of varying numbers of image components: (a) Percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite accompanied with mean scores of composites and the mean scores of their components (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1).

Since blurring and smoothing of faces occur when faces are averaged together [5], the smooth complexion of composites may underlie the attractiveness of averaged composites. In our experiment, a preference for averageness is found even though our method of virtual-morphing does not produce the smoothening effect and the mean smoothness value of composites corresponds to the mean smoothness value in the original dataset, for all nc (see Figure 4b). Researchers have also suggested that averaged faces are attractive since they are exceptionally symmetric [18]. Figure 4b shows that the mean level of asymmetry is indeed highly correlated with the mean scores of the morphs (Pearson correlation of -0.91, P-value < 10 -19). However, examining the correlation between the rest of the features and the composites' scores reveals that this high correlation is not at all unique to asymmetry. In fact, 45 of the 98 features are strongly correlated with attractiveness scores (|Pearson correlation| > 0.9). The high correlation between these numerous features and attractiveness scores of averaged faces indicates that symmetry level is not an exceptional factor in the machine’s preference for averaged faces. Instead, it suggests that averaging causes many features, including both geometric features and symmetry, to change in a direction which causes an increase in attractiveness. It has been argued that although averaged faces are found to be attractive, very attractive faces are not average [18]. A virtual composite made of the 12 most attractive faces in the set (as rated by humans) was rated by the machine with a high score of 5.6 while 1,000 composites made of 50 faces got a maximum score of only 5.3. This type of preference resembles the findings of an experiment by Perrett et al. in which a highly attractive composite, morphed from only attractive faces, was preferred by humans over a composite made of 60 images of all levels of attractiveness [13]. Another study by Zaidel et al. examined the asymmetry of attractiveness perception and offered a relationship between facial attractiveness and hemispheric specialization [19]. In this research right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created by attaching each half of the face to its mirror image. Subjects were asked to look at left-left and right-right composites of the same image and judge which one is more attractive. For women’s faces, right-right composites got twice as many ‘more attractive’ responses than left-left composites. Interestingly, similar results were found when simulating the same experiment with the machine: Right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created from the extracted coordinates of each image and the machine was used to predict their attractiveness ratings (taking care to exclude the original image used for the chimeric composition from the training set, as it contains many features which are identical to those of the composite). The machine gave 63 out of 91 right-right composites a higher rating than their matching left-left composite, while only 28 left-left composites were judged as more attractive. A paired t-test shows these results to be statistically significant with P-value < 10 -7 (scores of chimeric composites are normally distributed). It is interesting to see that the machine manifests the same kind of asymmetry bias reported by Zaidel et al, though it has never been explicitly trained for that. 4 Di s cu s s i on In this work we produced a high quality training set for learning facial attractiveness of human faces. Using supervised learning methodologies we were able to construct the first predictor that achieves accurate, humanlike performance for this task. Our results add the task of facial attractiveness prediction to a collection of abstract tasks that has been successfully accomplished with current machine learning techniques. Examining the machine and human raters' representations in the ratings space identifies the ratings of the machine in the center of human raters, and closest, in average, to other human raters. The similarity between human and machine preferences has prompted us to further study the machine’s operation in order to capitalize on the accessibility of its inner workings and learn more about human perception of facial attractiveness. To this end, we have found that that the machine favors averaged faces made of several component faces. While this preference is known to be common to humans as well, researchers have previously offered different reasons for favoring averageness. Our analysis has revealed that symmetry is strongly related to the attractiveness of averaged faces, but is definitely not the only factor in the equation since about half of the image-features relate to the ratings of averaged composites in a similar manner as the symmetry measure. This suggests that a general movement of features toward attractiveness, rather than a simple increase in symmetry, is responsible for the attractiveness of averaged faces. Obviously, strictly speaking this can be held true only for the machine, but, in due of the remarkable ``humnalike'' behavior of the machine, it also brings important support to the idea that this finding may well extend also to human perception of facial attractiveness. Overall, it is quite surprising and pleasing to see that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases related to facial attractiveness. It is likely that while the machine learns the ratings in an explicit supervised manner, it also concomitantly and implicitly learns other basic characteristics of human facial ratings, as revealed by studying its</p><p>5 0.10859866 <a title="188-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-High-Dimensional_Graphical_Model_Selection_Using_%24%5Cell_1%24-Regularized_Logistic_Regression.html">92 nips-2006-High-Dimensional Graphical Model Selection Using $\ell 1$-Regularized Logistic Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin J. Wainwright, John D. Lafferty, Pradeep K. Ravikumar</p><p>Abstract: We focus on the problem of estimating the graph structure associated with a discrete Markov random ﬁeld. We describe a method based on 1 regularized logistic regression, in which the neighborhood of any given node is estimated by performing logistic regression subject to an 1 -constraint. Our framework applies to the high-dimensional setting, in which both the number of nodes p and maximum neighborhood sizes d are allowed to grow as a function of the number of observations n. Our main result is to establish suﬃcient conditions on the triple (n, p, d) for the method to succeed in consistently estimating the neighborhood of every node in the graph simultaneously. Under certain mutual incoherence conditions analogous to those imposed in previous work on linear regression, we prove that consistent neighborhood selection can be obtained as long as the number of observations n grows more quickly than 6d6 log d + 2d5 log p, thereby establishing that logarithmic growth in the number of samples n relative to graph size p is suﬃcient to achieve neighborhood consistency.

<p>Author: Alexis Battle, Gal Chechik, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic model applied to the fMRI video rating prediction task of the Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Competition (PBAIC) [2]. Our goal is to predict a time series of subjective, semantic ratings of a movie given functional MRI data acquired during viewing by three subjects. Our method uses conditionally trained Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds, which model both the relationships between the subjects’ fMRI voxel measurements and the ratings, as well as the dependencies of the ratings across time steps and between subjects. We also employed non-traditional methods for feature selection and regularization that exploit the spatial structure of voxel activity in the brain. The model displayed good performance in predicting the scored ratings for the three subjects in test data sets, and a variant of this model was the third place entrant to the 2006 PBAIC. 1</p><p>2 0.70937788 <a title="188-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Humanlike_Predictor_of_Facial_Attractiveness.html">4 nips-2006-A Humanlike Predictor of Facial Attractiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Kagian, Gideon Dror, Tommer Leyvand, Daniel Cohen-or, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general. 1 I n trod u cti on Philosophers, artists and scientists have been trying to capture the nature of beauty since the early days of philosophy. Although in modern days a common layman's notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion, recent findings suggest that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness and that their preferences may be an innate part of the primary constitution of our nature. Several experiments have shown that 2 to 8 months old infants prefer looking at faces which adults rate as being more attractive [1]. In addition, attractiveness ratings show very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures [2]. Such findings give rise to the quest for common factors which determine human facial attractiveness. Accordingly, various hypotheses, from cognitive, evolutional and social perspectives, have been put forward to describe the common preferences for facial beauty. Inspired by Sir Francis Galton’s photographic method of composing faces [3], Rubenstein, Langlois and Roggman created averaged faces by morphing multiple images together and proposed that averageness is the answer for facial attractiveness [4, 5]. Human judges found these averaged faces to be attractive and rated them with attractiveness ratings higher than the mean rating of the component faces composing them. Grammer and Thornhill have investigated symmetry and averageness of faces and concluded that symmetry was more important than averageness in facial attractiveness [6]. Little and colleagues have agreed that average faces are attractive but claim that faces with certain extreme features, such as extreme sexually dimorphic traits, may be more attractive than average faces [7]. Other researchers have suggested various conditions which may contribute to facial attractiveness such as neonate features, pleasant expressions and familiarity. Cunningham and his associates suggest a multiple fitness model in which there is no single constructing line that determines attractiveness. Instead, different categories of features signal different desirable qualities of the perceived target [8]. Even so, the multiple fitness model agrees that some facial qualities are universally physically attractive to people. Apart from eliciting the facial characteristics which account for attractiveness, modern researchers try to describe underlying mechanisms for these preferences. Many contributors refer to the evolutionary origins of attractiveness preferences [9]-[11]. According to this view, facial traits signal mate quality and imply chances for reproductive success and parasite resistance. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that preferred features might not signal mate quality but that the “good taste” by itself is an evolutionary adaptation (individuals with a preference for attractiveness will have attractive offspring that will be favored as mates) [9]. Another mechanism explains attractiveness' preferences through a cognitive theory - a preference for attractive faces might be induced as a by-product of general perception or recognition mechanisms [5, 12]: Attractive faces might be pleasant to look at since they are closer to the cognitive representation of the face category in the mind. These cognitive representations are described as a part of a cognitive mechanism that abstracts prototypes from distinct classes of objects. These prototypes relate to average faces when considering the averageness hypothesis. A third view has suggested that facial attractiveness originates in a social mechanism, where preferences may be dependent on the learning history of the individual and even on his social goals [12]. Different studies have tried to use computational methods in order to analyze facial attractiveness. Averaging faces with morph tools was done in several cases (e.g. [5, 13]). In [14], laser scans of faces were put into complete correspondence with the average face in order to examine the relationship between facial attractiveness, age, and averageness. Another approach was used in [15] where a genetic algorithm, guided by interactive user selections, was programmed to evolve a “most beautiful” female face. [16] used machine learning methods to investigate whether a machine can predict attractiveness ratings by learning a mapping from facial images to their attractiveness scores. Their predictor achieved a significant correlation of 0.6 with average human ratings, demonstrating that facial beauty can be learned by a machine, at least to some degree. However, as human raters still do significantly outperform the predictor of [16], the challenge of constructing a facial attractiveness machine with human level evaluation accuracy has remained open. A primary goal of this study is to surpass these results by developing a machine which obtains human level performance in predicting facial attractiveness. Having accomplished this, our second main goal is to conduct a series of simulated psychophysical experiments and study the resemblance between human and machine judgments. This latter task carries two potential rewards: A. To determine whether the machine can aid in understanding the psychophysics of human facial attractiveness, capitalizing on the ready accessibility of the analysis of its inner workings, and B. To study whether learning an explicit operational ratings prediction task also entails learning implicit humanlike biases, at least for the case of facial attractiveness. 2 2.1 T h e f aci al trai n in g d atab as e: Acq u i s i ti on , p rep roces s i n g an d rep res en tati on Rating facial attractiveness The chosen database was composed of 91 facial images of American females, taken by the Japanese photographer Akira Gomi. All 91 samples were frontal color photographs of young Caucasian females with a neutral expression. All samples were of similar age, skin color and gender. The subjects’ portraits had no accessories or other distracting items such as jewelry. All 91 facial images in the dataset were rated for attractiveness by 28 human raters (15 males, 13 females) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive). Ratings were collected with a specifically designed html interface. Each rater was asked to view the entire set before rating in order to acquire a notion of attractiveness scale. There was no time limit for judging the attractiveness of each sample and raters could go back and adjust the ratings of already rated samples. The images were presented to each rater in a random order and each image was presented on a separate page. The final attractiveness rating of each sample was its mean rating across all raters. To validate that the number of ratings collected adequately represented the ``collective attractiveness rating'' we randomly divided the raters into two disjoint groups of equal size. For each facial image, we calculated the mean rating on each group, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean ratings of the two groups. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The mean correlation between two groups was 0.92 ( = 0.01). This corresponds well to the known level of consistency among groups of raters reported in the literature (e.g. [2]). Hence, the mean ratings collected are stable indicators of attractiveness that can be used for the learning task. The facial set contained faces in all ranges of attractiveness. Final attractiveness ratings range from 1.42 to 5.75 and the mean rating was 3.33 ( = 0.94). 2.2 Data preprocessing and representation Preliminary experimentation with various ways of representing a facial image have systematically shown that features based on measured proportions, distances and angles of faces are most effective in capturing the notion of facial attractiveness (e.g. [16]). To extract facial features we developed an automatic engine that is capable of identifying eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and head contour. In total, we measured 84 coordinates describing the locations of those facial features (Figure 1). Several regions are suggested for extracting mean hair color, mean skin color and skin texture. The feature extraction process was basically automatic but some coordinates needed to be manually adjusted in some of the images. The facial coordinates are used to create a distances-vector of all 3,486 distances between all pairs of coordinates in the complete graph created by all coordinates. For each image, all distances are normalized by face length. In a similar manner, a slopes-vector of all the 3,486 slopes of the lines connecting the facial coordinates is computed. Central fluctuating asymmetry (CFA), which is described in [6], is calculated from the coordinates as well. The application also provides, for each face, Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) values of hair color and skin color, and a measurement of skin smoothness. Figure 1: Facial coordinates with hair and skin sample regions as represented by the facial feature extractor. Coordinates are used for calculating geometric features and asymmetry. Sample regions are used for calculating color values and smoothness. The sample image, used for illustration only, is of T.G. and is presented with her full consent. Combining the distances-vector and the slopes-vector yields a vector representation of 6,972 geometric features for each image. Since strong correlations are expected among the features in such representation, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to these geometric features, producing 90 principal components which span the sub-space defined by the 91 image vector representations. The geometric features are projected on those 90 principal components and supply 90 orthogonal eigenfeatures representing the geometric features. Eight measured features were not included in the PCA analysis, including CFA, smoothness, hair color coordinates (HSV) and skin color coordinates. These features are assumed to be directly connected to human perception of facial attractiveness and are hence kept at their original values. These 8 features were added to the 90 geometric eigenfeatures, resulting in a total of 98 image-features representing each facial image in the dataset. 3 3.1 E xp eri men ts an d resu l ts Predictor construction and validation We experimented with several induction algorithms including simple Linear Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) (both linear as well as non-linear) and Gaussian Processes (GP). However, as the LS-SVM and GP showed no substantial advantage over Linear Regression, the latter was used and is presented in the sequel. A key ingredient in our methods is to use a proper image-features selection strategy. To this end we used subset feature selection, implemented by ranking the image-features by their Pearson correlation with the target. Other ranking functions produced no substantial gain. To measure the performance of our method we removed one sample from the whole dataset. This sample served as a test set. We found, for each left out sample, the optimal number of image-features by performing leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) on the remaining samples and selecting the number of features that minimizes the absolute difference between the algorithm's output and the targets of the training set. In other words, the score for a test example was predicted using a single model based on the training set only. This process was repeated n=91 times, once for each image sample. The vector of attractiveness predictions of all images is then compared with the true targets. These scores are found to be in a high Pearson correlation of 0.82 with the mean ratings of humans (P-value < 10 -23), which corresponds to a normalized Mean Squared Error of 0.39. This accuracy is a marked improvement over the recently published performance results of a Pearson correlation of 0.6 on a similar dataset [16]. The average correlation of an individual human rater to the mean correlations of all other raters in our dataset is 0.67 and the average correlation between the mean ratings of groups of raters is 0.92 (section 2.1). It should be noted that we tried to use this feature selection and training procedure with the original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures, ranking them by their correlation to the targets and selecting up to 300 best ranked features. This, however, has failed to produce good predictors due to strong correlations between the original geometric features (maximal Pearson correlation obtained was 0.26). 3.2 S i m i l a r i t y o f ma c h i n e a n d h u m a n j u d g m e n t s Each rater (human and machine) has a 91 dimensional rating vector describing its Figure 2: Distribution of mean Euclidean distance from each human rater to all other raters in the ratings space. The machine’s average distance form all other raters (left bar) is smaller than the average distance of each of the human raters to all others. attractiveness ratings of all 91 images. These vectors can be embedded in a 91 dimensional ratings space. The Euclidian distance between all raters (human and machine) in this space was computed. Compared with each of the human raters, the ratings of the machine were the closest, on average, to the ratings of all other human raters (Figure 2). To verify that the machine ratings are not outliers that fall out of clusters of human raters (even though their mean distance from the other ratings is small) we surrounded each of the rating vectors in the ratings space with multidimensional spheres of several radius sizes. The machine had more human neighbors than the mean number of neighbors of human raters, testifying that it does not fall between clusters. Finally, for a graphic display of machine ratings among human ratings we applied PCA to machine and human ratings in the rating space and projected all ratings onto the resulting first 2 and 3 principal components. Indeed, the machine is well placed in a mid-zone of human raters (Figure 3). 5 Machine 0 Machine 0 -4 -8 -5 7 5 0 -10 -10 -5 0 5 10 (a) 0 -7 -5 (b) Figure 3: Location of machine ratings among the 28 human ratings: Ratings were projected into 2 dimensions (a) and 3 dimensions (b) by performing PCA on all ratings and projecting them on the first principal components. The projected data explain 29.8% of the variance in (a) and 36.6% in (b). 3.3 Psychophysical experiments in silico A number of simulated psychophysical experiments reveal humanlike biases of the machine's performance. Rubenstein et al. discuss a morphing technique to create mathematically averaged faces from multiple face images [5]. They reported that averaged faces made of 16 and 32 original component images were rated higher in attractiveness than the mean attractiveness ratings of their component faces and higher than composites consisting of fewer faces. In their experiment, 32-component composites were found to be the most attractive. We used a similar technique to create averaged virtually-morphed faces with various numbers of components, nc, and have let the machine predict their attractiveness. To this end, coordinate values of the original component faces were averaged to create a new set of coordinates for the composite. These coordinates were used to calculate the geometrical features and CFA of the averaged face. Smoothness and HSV values for the composite faces were calculated by averaging the corresponding values of the component faces 1. To study the effect of nc on the attractiveness score we produced 1,000 virtual morph images for each value of n c between 2 and 50, and used our attractiveness predictor (section 3.1) to compute the attractiveness scores of the resulting composites. In accordance with the experimental results of [5], the machine manifests a humanlike bias for higher scores of averaged composites over their components’ mean score. Figure 4a, presenting these results, shows the percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite, for each number of components n c. As evident, the attractiveness rating of a composite surpasses a larger percent of its components’ ratings as nc increases. Figure 4a also shows the mean scores of 1,000 1 HSV values are converted to RGB before averaging composites and the mean scores of their components, for each n c (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]). Their actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1. As expected, the mean scores of the components images are independent of n c, while composites’ scores increase with nc. Mean values of smoothness and asymmetry of the composites are presented in Figure 4b. 0.4 Smoothness Asymmetry 0.8 0.2 0.75 0 -0.2 0.7 -0.4 0.65 -0.6 0.6 Fraction of less attractive components Composite's score (normalized) Components' mean score (normalized) 0.55 2 10 20 30 40 -0.8 50 -1 2 Number of components in composite 10 20 30 40 50 Number of components in composite (a) (b) Figure 4: Mean results over 1,000 composites made of varying numbers of image components: (a) Percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite accompanied with mean scores of composites and the mean scores of their components (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1).

Since blurring and smoothing of faces occur when faces are averaged together [5], the smooth complexion of composites may underlie the attractiveness of averaged composites. In our experiment, a preference for averageness is found even though our method of virtual-morphing does not produce the smoothening effect and the mean smoothness value of composites corresponds to the mean smoothness value in the original dataset, for all nc (see Figure 4b). Researchers have also suggested that averaged faces are attractive since they are exceptionally symmetric [18]. Figure 4b shows that the mean level of asymmetry is indeed highly correlated with the mean scores of the morphs (Pearson correlation of -0.91, P-value < 10 -19). However, examining the correlation between the rest of the features and the composites' scores reveals that this high correlation is not at all unique to asymmetry. In fact, 45 of the 98 features are strongly correlated with attractiveness scores (|Pearson correlation| > 0.9). The high correlation between these numerous features and attractiveness scores of averaged faces indicates that symmetry level is not an exceptional factor in the machine’s preference for averaged faces. Instead, it suggests that averaging causes many features, including both geometric features and symmetry, to change in a direction which causes an increase in attractiveness. It has been argued that although averaged faces are found to be attractive, very attractive faces are not average [18]. A virtual composite made of the 12 most attractive faces in the set (as rated by humans) was rated by the machine with a high score of 5.6 while 1,000 composites made of 50 faces got a maximum score of only 5.3. This type of preference resembles the findings of an experiment by Perrett et al. in which a highly attractive composite, morphed from only attractive faces, was preferred by humans over a composite made of 60 images of all levels of attractiveness [13]. Another study by Zaidel et al. examined the asymmetry of attractiveness perception and offered a relationship between facial attractiveness and hemispheric specialization [19]. In this research right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created by attaching each half of the face to its mirror image. Subjects were asked to look at left-left and right-right composites of the same image and judge which one is more attractive. For women’s faces, right-right composites got twice as many ‘more attractive’ responses than left-left composites. Interestingly, similar results were found when simulating the same experiment with the machine: Right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created from the extracted coordinates of each image and the machine was used to predict their attractiveness ratings (taking care to exclude the original image used for the chimeric composition from the training set, as it contains many features which are identical to those of the composite). The machine gave 63 out of 91 right-right composites a higher rating than their matching left-left composite, while only 28 left-left composites were judged as more attractive. A paired t-test shows these results to be statistically significant with P-value < 10 -7 (scores of chimeric composites are normally distributed). It is interesting to see that the machine manifests the same kind of asymmetry bias reported by Zaidel et al, though it has never been explicitly trained for that. 4 Di s cu s s i on In this work we produced a high quality training set for learning facial attractiveness of human faces. Using supervised learning methodologies we were able to construct the first predictor that achieves accurate, humanlike performance for this task. Our results add the task of facial attractiveness prediction to a collection of abstract tasks that has been successfully accomplished with current machine learning techniques. Examining the machine and human raters' representations in the ratings space identifies the ratings of the machine in the center of human raters, and closest, in average, to other human raters. The similarity between human and machine preferences has prompted us to further study the machine’s operation in order to capitalize on the accessibility of its inner workings and learn more about human perception of facial attractiveness. To this end, we have found that that the machine favors averaged faces made of several component faces. While this preference is known to be common to humans as well, researchers have previously offered different reasons for favoring averageness. Our analysis has revealed that symmetry is strongly related to the attractiveness of averaged faces, but is definitely not the only factor in the equation since about half of the image-features relate to the ratings of averaged composites in a similar manner as the symmetry measure. This suggests that a general movement of features toward attractiveness, rather than a simple increase in symmetry, is responsible for the attractiveness of averaged faces. Obviously, strictly speaking this can be held true only for the machine, but, in due of the remarkable ``humnalike'' behavior of the machine, it also brings important support to the idea that this finding may well extend also to human perception of facial attractiveness. Overall, it is quite surprising and pleasing to see that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases related to facial attractiveness. It is likely that while the machine learns the ratings in an explicit supervised manner, it also concomitantly and implicitly learns other basic characteristics of human facial ratings, as revealed by studying its</p><p>3 0.57514375 <a title="188-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Structural_Equation_Models_for_fMRI.html">113 nips-2006-Learning Structural Equation Models for fMRI</a></p>
<p>Author: Enrico Simonotto, Heather Whalley, Stephen Lawrie, Lawrence Murray, David Mcgonigle, Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Structural equation models can be seen as an extension of Gaussian belief networks to cyclic graphs, and we show they can be understood generatively as the model for the joint distribution of long term average equilibrium activity of Gaussian dynamic belief networks. Most use of structural equation models in fMRI involves postulating a particular structure and comparing learnt parameters across different groups. In this paper it is argued that there are situations where priors about structure are not ﬁrm or exhaustive, and given sufﬁcient data, it is worth investigating learning network structure as part of the approach to connectivity analysis. First we demonstrate structure learning on a toy problem. We then show that for particular fMRI data the simple models usually assumed are not supported. We show that is is possible to learn sensible structural equation models that can provide modelling beneﬁts, but that are not necessarily going to be the same as a true causal model, and suggest the combination of prior models and learning or the use of temporal information from dynamic models may provide more beneﬁts than learning structural equations alone. 1</p><p>4 0.42280874 <a title="188-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-A_Probabilistic_Algorithm_Integrating_Source_Localization_and_Noise_Suppression_of_MEG_and_EEG_data.html">12 nips-2006-A Probabilistic Algorithm Integrating Source Localization and Noise Suppression of MEG and EEG data</a></p>
<p>Author: Johanna M. Zumer, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a novel algorithm for integrating source localization and noise suppression based on a probabilistic graphical model of stimulus-evoked MEG/EEG data. Our algorithm localizes multiple dipoles while suppressing noise sources with the computational complexity equivalent to a single dipole scan, and is therefore more efﬁcient than traditional multidipole ﬁtting procedures. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time course of several simultaneously-active dipoles, with rotating or ﬁxed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. Furthermore, the algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm for localizing auditory cortex in a tumor patient and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated. 1</p><p>5 0.41133308 <a title="188-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Inducing_Metric_Violations_in_Human_Similarity_Judgements.html">97 nips-2006-Inducing Metric Violations in Human Similarity Judgements</a></p>
<p>Author: Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Felix A. Wichmann, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Attempting to model human categorization and similarity judgements is both a very interesting but also an exceedingly difﬁcult challenge. Some of the difﬁculty arises because of conﬂicting evidence whether human categorization and similarity judgements should or should not be modelled as to operate on a mental representation that is essentially metric. Intuitively, this has a strong appeal as it would allow (dis)similarity to be represented geometrically as distance in some internal space. Here we show how a single stimulus, carefully constructed in a psychophysical experiment, introduces l2 violations in what used to be an internal similarity space that could be adequately modelled as Euclidean. We term this one inﬂuential data point a conﬂictual judgement. We present an algorithm of how to analyse such data and how to identify the crucial point. Thus there may not be a strict dichotomy between either a metric or a non-metric internal space but rather degrees to which potentially large subsets of stimuli are represented metrically with a small subset causing a global violation of metricity.</p><p>6 0.40117908 <a title="188-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Processes_with_Random_Effects.html">91 nips-2006-Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes with Random Effects</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexis Battle, Gal Chechik, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: We present a probabilistic model applied to the fMRI video rating prediction task of the Pittsburgh Brain Activity Interpretation Competition (PBAIC) [2]. Our goal is to predict a time series of subjective, semantic ratings of a movie given functional MRI data acquired during viewing by three subjects. Our method uses conditionally trained Gaussian Markov random ﬁelds, which model both the relationships between the subjects’ fMRI voxel measurements and the ratings, as well as the dependencies of the ratings across time steps and between subjects. We also employed non-traditional methods for feature selection and regularization that exploit the spatial structure of voxel activity in the brain. The model displayed good performance in predicting the scored ratings for the three subjects in test data sets, and a variant of this model was the third place entrant to the 2006 PBAIC. 1</p><p>2 0.77727073 <a title="188-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Predicting_spike_times_from_subthreshold_dynamics_of_a_neuron.html">162 nips-2006-Predicting spike times from subthreshold dynamics of a neuron</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Kobayashi, Shigeru Shinomoto</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that a neuron reproduces highly precise spike response to identical ﬂuctuating input currents. We wish to accurately predict the ﬁring times of a given neuron for any input current. For this purpose we adopt a model that mimics the dynamics of the membrane potential, and then take a cue from its dynamics for predicting the spike occurrence for a novel input current. It is found that the prediction is signiﬁcantly improved by observing the state space of the membrane potential and its time derivative(s) in advance of a possible spike, in comparison to simply thresholding an instantaneous value of the estimated potential. 1</p><p>3 0.74493504 <a title="188-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Bayesian_Image_Super-resolution%2C_Continued.html">42 nips-2006-Bayesian Image Super-resolution, Continued</a></p>
<p>Author: Lyndsey C. Pickup, David P. Capel, Stephen J. Roberts, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: This paper develops a multi-frame image super-resolution approach from a Bayesian view-point by marginalizing over the unknown registration parameters relating the set of input low-resolution views. In Tipping and Bishop’s Bayesian image super-resolution approach [16], the marginalization was over the superresolution image, necessitating the use of an unfavorable image prior. By integrating over the registration parameters rather than the high-resolution image, our method allows for more realistic prior distributions, and also reduces the dimension of the integral considerably, removing the main computational bottleneck of the other algorithm. In addition to the motion model used by Tipping and Bishop, illumination components are introduced into the generative model, allowing us to handle changes in lighting as well as motion. We show results on real and synthetic datasets to illustrate the efﬁcacy of this approach.</p><p>4 0.64106148 <a title="188-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Context_Effects_in_Category_Learning%3A_An_Investigation_of_Four_Probabilistic_Models.html">58 nips-2006-Context Effects in Category Learning: An Investigation of Four Probabilistic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Michael Shettel, Michael P. Holmes</p><p>Abstract: Categorization is a central activity of human cognition. When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Speciﬁcally, when experimental subjects are shown an exemplar of some target category, the category prototype appears to be pulled toward the exemplar, and the prototypes of all nontarget categories appear to be pushed away. These push and pull effects diminish with experience, and likely reﬂect long-term learning of category boundaries. We propose and evaluate four principled probabilistic (Bayesian) accounts of context effects in categorization. In all four accounts, the probability of an exemplar given a category is encoded as a Gaussian density in feature space, and categorization involves computing category posteriors given an exemplar. The models differ in how the uncertainty distribution of category prototypes is represented (localist or distributed), and how it is updated following each experience (using a maximum likelihood gradient ascent, or a Kalman ﬁlter update). We ﬁnd that the distributed maximum-likelihood model can explain the key experimental phenomena. Further, the model predicts other phenomena that were conﬁrmed via reanalysis of the experimental data. Categorization is a key cognitive activity. We continually make decisions about characteristics of objects and individuals: Is the fruit ripe? Does your friend seem unhappy? Is your car tire ﬂat? When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Intuitive naturalistic scenarios in which context effects occur are easy to imagine. For example, if one lifts a medium-weight object after lifting a light-weight or heavy-weight object, the medium weight feels heavier following the light weight than following the heavy weight. Although the object-contrast effect might be due to fatigue of sensory-motor systems, many context effects in categorization are purely cognitive and cannot easily be attributed to neural habituation. For example, if you are reviewing a set of conference papers, and the ﬁrst three in the set are dreadful, then even a mediocre paper seems like it might be above threshold for acceptance. Another example of a category boundary shift due to context is the following. Suppose you move from San Diego to Pittsburgh and notice that your neighbors repeatedly describe muggy, somewhat overcast days as ”lovely.” Eventually, your notion of what constitutes a lovely day accommodates to your new surroundings. As we describe shortly, experimental studies have shown a fundamental link between context effects in categorization and long-term learning of category boundaries. We believe that context effects can be viewed as a reﬂection of a trial-to-trial learning, and the cumulative effect of these trial-to-trial modulations corresponds to what we classically consider to be category learning. Consequently, any compelling model of category learning should also be capable of explaining context effects. 1 Experimental Studies of Context Effects in Categorization Consider a set of stimuli that vary along a single continuous dimension. Throughout this paper, we use as an illustration circles of varying diameters, and assume four categories of circles deﬁned ranges of diameters; call them A, B, C, and D, in order from smallest to largest diameter. In a classiﬁcation paradigm, experimental subjects are given an exemplar drawn from one category and are asked to respond with the correct category label (Zotov, Jones, & Mewhort, 2003). After making their response, subjects receive feedback as to the correct label, which we’ll refer to as the target. In a production paradigm, subjects are given a target category label and asked to produce an exemplar of that category, e.g., using a computer mouse to indicate the circle diameter (Jones & Mewhort, 2003). Once a response is made, subjects receive feedback as to the correct or true category label for the exemplar they produced. Neither classiﬁcation nor production task has sequential structure, because the order of trial is random in both experiments. The production task provides direct information about the subjects’ internal representations, because subjects are producing exemplars that they consider to be prototypes of a category, whereas the categorization task requires indirect inferences to be made about internal representations from reaction time and accuracy data. Nonetheless, the ﬁndings in the production and classiﬁcation tasks mirror one another nicely, providing converging evidence as to the nature of learning. The production task reveals how mental representations shift as a function of trial-to-trial sequences, and these shifts cause the sequential pattern of errors and response times typically observed in the classiﬁcation task. We focus on the production task in this paper because it provides a richer source of data. However, we address the categorization task with our models as well. Figure 1 provides a schematic depiction of the key sequential effects in categorization. The horizontal line represents the stimulus dimension, e.g., circle diameter. The dimension is cut into four regions labeled with the corresponding category. The category center, which we’ll refer to as the prototype, is indicated by a vertical dashed line. The long solid vertical line marks the current exemplar—whether it is an exemplar presented to subjects in the classiﬁcation task or an exemplar generated by subjects in the production task. Following an experimental trial with this exemplar, category prototypes appear to shift: the target-category prototype moves toward the exemplar, which we refer to as a pull effect, and all nontarget-category prototypes move away from the exemplar, which we refer to as a push effect. Push and pull effects are assessed in the production task by examining the exemplar produced on the following trial, and in the categorization task by examining the likelihood of an error response near category boundaries. The set of phenomena to be explained are as follows, described in terms of the production task. All numerical results referred to are from Jones and Mewhort (2003). This experiment consisted of 12 blocks of 40 trials, with each category label given as target 10 times within a block. • Within-category pull: When a target category is repeated on successive trials, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves toward the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial, with respect to the true category prototype. Across the experiment, a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.524 is obtained, and remains fairly constant over trials. • Between-category push: When the target category changes from one trial to the next, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves away from the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial (or equivalently, from the prototype of the target category on the ﬁrst trial). Figure 2a summarizes the sequential push effects from Jones and Mewhort. The diameter of the circle produced on trial t is plotted as a function of the target category on trial t − 1, with one line for each of the four trial t targets. The mean diameter for each target category is subtracted out, so the absolute vertical offset of each line is unimportant. The main feature of the data to note is that all four curves have a negative slope, which has the following meaning: the smaller that target t − 1 is (i.e., the further to the left on the x axis in Figure 1), the larger the response to target t is (further to the right in Figure 1), and vice versa, reﬂecting a push away from target t − 1. Interestingly and importantly, the magnitude of the push increases with the ordinal distance between targets t − 1 and t. Figure 2a is based on data from only eight subjects and is therefore noisy, though the effect is statistically reliable. As further evidence, Figure 2b shows data from a categorization task (Zotov et al., 2003), where the y-axis is a different dependent measure, but the negative slope has the same interpretation as in Figure 2a. example Figure 1: Schematic depiction of sequential effects in categorization A B C D stimulus dimension C 0 B −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 −0.1 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation D 0.02 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label (b) humans: classification (d) KFU−distrib 0.08 D previous category label C D 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation response deviation C B (f) MLGA−distrib 0.08 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 B A previous category label 0.06 A (e) MLGA−local 0.08 0.06 A 0.04 (c) KFU−local 0.08 response deviation response deviation 0.06 response bias from (a) production task of Jones and Mewhort (2003), (b) classiﬁcation task of Zotov et al.

In quantitative estimation of push and pull effects, trial t is included in the data only if the response on trial t − 1 is correct. Thus, the effects follow trials in which no error feedback is given to the subjects, and therefore the adjustments are not due to explicit error correction. • Push and pull effects diminish over the course of the experiment. The magnitude of push effects can be measured by the slope of the regression lines ﬁt to the data in Figure 2a. The slopes get shallower over successive trial blocks. The magnitude of pull effects can be measured by the standard deviation (SD) of the produced exemplars, which also decreases over successive trial blocks. • Accuracy increases steadily over the course of the experiment, from 78% correct responses in the ﬁrst block to 91% in the ﬁnal block. This improvement occurs despite the fact that error feedback is relatively infrequent and becomes even less frequent as performance improves. 2 Four Models In this paper, we explore four probabilistic (Bayesian) models to explain data described in the previous section. The key phenomenon to explain turns out to be the push effect, for which three of the four models fail to account. Modelers typically discard the models that they reject, and present only their pet model. In this work, we ﬁnd it useful to report on the rejected models for three reasons. First, they help to set up and motivate the one successful model. Second, they include several obvious candidates, and we therefore have the imperative to address them. Third, in order to evaluate a model that can explain certain data, one needs to know the degree to which the the data constrain the space of models. If many models exist that are consistent with the data, one has little reason to prefer our pet candidate. Underlying all of the models is a generative probabilistic framework in which a category i is represented by a prototype value, di , on the dimension that discriminates among the categories. In the example used throughout this paper, the dimension is the diameter of a circle (hence the notation d for the prototype). An exemplar, E, of category i is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean di and variance vi , denoted E ∼ N (di , vi ). Category learning involves determining d ≡ {di }. In this work, we assume that the {vi } are ﬁxed and given. Because d is unknown at the start of the experiment, it is treated as the value of a random vector, D ≡ {Di }. Figure 3a shows a simple graphical model representing the generative framework, in which E is the exemplar and C the category label. To formalize our discussion so far, we adopt the following notation: P (E|C = c, D = d) ∼ N (hc d, vc ), (1) where, for the time being, hc is a unary column vector all of whose elements are zero except for element c which has value 1. (Subscripts may indicate either an index over elements of a vector, or an index over vectors. Boldface is used for vectors and matrices.) Figure 3: (a) Graphical model depicting selection of an exemplar, E, of a category, C, based on the prototype vector, D; (b) Dynamic version of model indexed by trials, t (a) D (b) C Dt-1 Ct-1 E Dt Ct Et-1 Et We assume that the prototype representation, D, is multivariate Gaussian, D ∼ N (Ψ, Σ), where Ψ and Σ encode knowledge—and uncertainty in the knowledge—of the category prototype structure. Given this formulation, the uncertainty in D can be integrated out: P (E|C) ∼ N (hc Ψ, hc ΣhT + vc ). c (2) For the categorization task, a category label can be assigned by evaluating the category posterior, P (C|E), via Bayes rule, Equation 1, and the category priors, P (C). In this framework, learning takes place via trial-to-trial adaptation of the category prototype distribution, D. In Figure 3b, we add the subscript t to each random variable to denote the trial, yielding a dynamic graphical model for the sequential updating of the prototype vector, Dt . (The reader should be attentive to the fact that we use subscripted indices to denote both trials and category labels. We generally use the index t to denote trial, and c or i to denote a category label.) The goal of our modeling work is to show that the sequential updating process leads to context effects, such as the push and pull effects discussed earlier. We propose four alternative models to explore within this framework. The four models are obtained via the Cartesian product of two binary choices: the learning rule and the prototype representation. 2.1 Learning rule The ﬁrst learning rule, maximum likelihood gradient ascent (MLGA), attempts to adjust the prototype representation so as to maximize the log posterior of the category given the exemplar. (The category, C = c, is the true label associated with the exemplar, i.e., either the target label the subject was asked to produce, or—if an error was made—the actual category label the subject did produce.) Gradient ascent is performed in all parameters of Ψ and Σ: ∆ψi = ψ ∂ log(P (c|e)) and ∂ψi ∆σij = σ ∂ log(P (c|e)), ∂σij (3) where ψ and σ are step sizes. To ensure that Σ remains a covariance matrix, constrained gradient 2 steps are applied. The constraints are: (1) diagonal terms are nonnegative, i.e., σi ≥ 0; (2) offdiagonal terms are symmetric, i.e., σij = σji ; and (3) the matrix remains positive deﬁnite, ensured σ by −1 ≤ σiijj ≤ 1. σ The second learning rule, a Kalman ﬁlter update (KFU), reestimates the uncertainty distribution of the prototypes given evidence provided by the current exemplar and category label. To draw the correspondence between our framework and a Kalman ﬁlter: the exemplar is a scalar measurement that pops out of the ﬁlter, the category prototypes are the hidden state of the ﬁlter, the measurement noise is vc , and the linear mapping from state to measurement is achieved by hc . Technically, the model is a measurement-switched Kalman ﬁlter, where the switching is determined by the category label c, i.e., the measurement function, hc , and noise, vc , are conditioned on c. The Kalman ﬁlter also allows temporal dynamics via the update equation, dt = Adt−1 , as well as internal process noise, whose covariance matrix is often denoted Q in standard Kalman ﬁlter notation. We investigated the choice of A and R, but because they did not impact the qualitative outcome of the simulations, we used A = I and R = 0. Given the correspondence we’ve established, the KFU equations—which specify Ψt+1 and Σt+1 as a function of ct , et , Ψt , and Σt —can be found in an introductory text (e.g., Maybeck, 1979). Change to a category prototype for each category following a trial of a given category. Solid (open) bars indicate trials in which the exemplar is larger (smaller) than the prototype. 2.2 prototype mvt.

To select the appropriate prototype given a current category c, we deﬁned the unary vector hc and applied hc as a linear transform on D. The identical operations can be performed in conjunction with a distributed representation of the prototype. But we step back momentarily to motivate the distributed representation. The localist representation suffers from a key weakness: it does not exploit interrelatedness constraints on category structure. The task given to experimental subjects speciﬁes that there are four categories, and they have an ordering; the circle diameters associated with category A are smaller than the diameters associated with B, etc. Consequently, dA < dB < dC < dD . One might make a further assumption that the category prototypes are equally spaced. Exploiting these two sources of domain knowledge leads to the distributed representation of category structure. A simple sort of distributed representation involves deﬁning the prototype for category i not as di but as a linear function of an underlying two-dimensional state-space representation of structure. In this state space, d1 indicates the distance between categories and d2 an offset for all categories. This representation of state can be achieved by applying Equation 1 and deﬁning hc = (nc , 1), where nc is the ordinal position of the category (nA = 1, nB = 2, etc.). We augment this representation with a bit of redundancy by incorporating not only the ordinal positions but also the reverse ordinal positions; this addition yields a symmetry in the representation between the two ends of the ordinal category scale. As a result of this augmentation, d becomes a three-dimensional state space, and hc = (nc , N + 1 − nc , 1), where N is the number of categories. To summarize, both the localist and distributed representations posit the existence of a hidden-state space—unknown at the start of learning—that speciﬁes category prototypes. The localist model assumes one dimension in the state space per prototype, whereas the distributed model assumes fewer dimensions in the state space—three, in our proposal—than there are prototypes, and computes the prototype location as a function of the state. Both localist and distributed representations assume a ﬁxed, known {hc } that specify the interpretation of the state space, or, in the case of the distributed model, the subject’s domain knowledge about category structure. 3 Simulation Methodology We deﬁned a one-dimensional feature space in which categories A-D corresponded to the ranges [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), and [4, 5), respectively. In the human experiment, responses were considered incorrect if they were smaller than A or larger than D; we call these two cases out-of-bounds-low (OOBL) and out-of-bounds-high (OOBH). OOBL and OOBH were treated as two additional categories, resulting in 6 categories altogether for the simulation. Subjects and the model were never asked to produce exemplars of OOBL or OOBH, but feedback was given if a response fell into these categories. As in the human experiment, our simulation involved 480 trials. We performed 100 replications of each simulation with identical initial conditions but different trial sequences, and averaged results over replications. All prototypes were initialized to have the same mean, 3.0, at the start of the simulation. Because subjects had some initial practice on the task before the start of the experimental trials, we provided the models with 12 initial trials of a categorization (not production) task, two for each of the 6 categories. (For the MLGA models, it was necessary to use a large step size on these trials to move the prototypes to roughly the correct neighborhood.) To perform the production task, the models must generate an exemplar given a category. It seems natural to draw an exemplar from the distribution in Equation 2 for P (E|C). However, this distribu- tion reﬂects the full range of exemplars that lie within the category boundaries, and presumably in the production task, subjects attempt to produce a prototypical exemplar. Consequently, we exclude the intrinsic category variance, vc , from Equation 2 in generating exemplars, leaving variance only via uncertainty about the prototype. Each model involved selection of various parameters and initial conditions. We searched the parameter space by hand, attempting to ﬁnd parameters that satisﬁed basic properties of the data: the accuracy and response variance in the ﬁrst and second halves of the experiment. We report only parameters for the one model that was successful, the MLGA-Distrib: ψ = 0.0075, σ = 1.5 × 10−6 for off-diagonal terms and 1.5 × 10−7 for diagonal terms (the gradient for the diagonal terms was relatively steep), Σ0 = 0.01I, and for all categories c, vc = 0.42 . 4 4.1 Results Push effect The phenomenon that most clearly distinguishes the models is the push effect. The push effect is manifested in sequential-dependency functions, which plot the (relative) response on trial t as a function of trial t − 1. As we explained using Figures 2a,b, the signature of the push effect is a negatively sloped line for each of the different trial t target categories. The sequential-dependency functions for the four models are presented in Figures 2c-f. KFU-Local (Figure 2c) produces a ﬂat line, indicating no push whatsoever. The explanation for this result is straightforward: the Kalman ﬁlter update alters only the variable that is responsible for the measurement (exemplar) obtained on that trial. That variable is the prototype of the target class c, Dc . We thought the lack of an interaction among the category prototypes might be overcome with KFU-Distrib, because with a distributed prototype representation, all of the state variables jointly determine the target category prototype. However, our intuition turned out to be incorrect. We experimented with many different representations and parameter settings, but KFU-Distrib consistently obtained ﬂat or shallow positive sloping lines (Figure 2d). MLGA-Local (Figure 2e) obtains a push effect for neighboring classes, but not distant classes. For example, examining the dashed magenta line, note that B is pushed away by A and C, but is not affected by D. MLGA-Local maximizes the likelihood of the target category both by pulling the classconditional density of the target category toward the exemplar and by pushing the class-conditional densities of the other categories away from the exemplar. However, if a category has little probability mass at the location of the exemplar, the increase in likelihood that results from pushing it further away is negligible, and consequently, so is the push effect. MLGA-Distrib obtains a lovely result (Figure 2f)—a negatively-sloped line, diagnostic of the push effect. The effect magnitude matches that in the human data (Figure 2a), and captures the key property that the push effect increases with the ordinal distance of the categories. We did not build a mechanism into MLGA-Distrib to produce the push effect; it is somewhat of an emergent property of the model. The state representation of MLGA-Distrib has three components: d1 , the weight of the ordinal position of a category prototype, d2 , the weight of the reverse ordinal position, and d3 , an offset. The last term, d3 , cannot be responsible for a push effect, because it shifts all prototypes equally, and therefore can only produce a ﬂat sequential dependency function. Figure 4 helps provide an intuition how d1 and d2 work together to produce the push effect. Each graph shows the average movement of the category prototype (units on the y-axis are arbitrary) observed on trial t, for each of the four categories, following presentation of a given category on trial t − 1. Positve values on the y axis indicate increases in the prototype (movement to the right in Figure 1), and negative values decreases. Each solid vertical bar represents the movement of a given category prototype following a trial in which the exemplar is larger than its current prototype; each open vertical bar represents movement when the exemplar is to the left of its prototype. Notice that all category prototypes get larger or smaller on a given trial. But over the course of the experiment, the exemplar should be larger than the prototype as often as it is smaller, and the two shifts should sum together and partially cancel out. The result is the value indicated by the small horizontal bar along each line. The balance between the shifts in the two directions exactly corresponds to the push effect. Thus, the model produce a push-effect graph, but it is not truly producing a push effect as was originally conceived by the experimentalists. We are currently considering empirical consequences of this simulation result. Figure 5 shows a trial-by-trial trace from MLGA-Distrib.

Like all of the other models, MLGA-Distrib readily produces a pull effect, which is shown in the movement of category prototypes in Figure 5e. More observably, a pull effect is manifested when two successive trials of the same category are positively correlated: when trial t − 1 is to the left of the true category prototype, trial t is likely to be to the left as well. In the human data, the correlation coefﬁcient over the experiment is 0.524; in the model, the coefﬁcient is 0.496. The explanation for the pull effect is apparent: moving the category prototype to the exemplar increases the category likelihood. Although many learning effects in humans are based on error feedback, the experimental studies showed that push and pull effects occur even in the absence of errors, as they do in MLGA-Distrib. The model simply assumes that the target category it used to generate an exemplar is the correct category when no feedback to the contrary is provided. As long as the likelihood gradient is nonzero, category prototypes will be shifted. Pull and push effects shrink over the course of the experiment in human studies, as they do in the simulation. Figure 5e shows a reduction in both pull and push, as measured by the shift of the prototype means toward or away from the exemplar. We measured the slope of MLGA-Distrib’s push function (Figure 2f) for trials in the ﬁrst and second half of the simulation. The slope dropped from −0.042 to −0.025, as one would expect from Figure 5e. (These slopes are obtained by combining responses from 100 replications of the simulation. Consequently, each point on the push function was an average over 6000 trials, and therefore the regression slopes are highly reliable.) A quantitative, observable measure of pull is the standard deviation (SD) of responses. As push and pull effects diminish, SDs should decrease. In human subjects, the response SDs in the ﬁrst and second half of the experiment are 0.43 and 0.33, respectively. In the simulation, the response SDs are 0.51 and 0.38. Shrink reﬂects the fact that the model is approaching a local optimum in log likelihood, causing gradients—and learning steps—to become smaller. Not all model parameter settings lead to shrink; as in any gradient-based algorithm, step sizes that are too large do not lead to converge. However, such parameter settings make little sense in the context of the learning objective. 4.3 Model predictions MLGA-Distrib produces greater pull of the target category toward the exemplar than push of the neighboring categories away from the exemplar. In the simulation, the magnitude of the target pull— measured by the movement of the prototype mean—is 0.105, contrasted with the neighbor push, which is 0.017. After observing this robust result in the simulation, we found pertinent experimental data. Using the categorization paradigm, Zotov et al. (2003) found that if the exemplar on trial t is near a category border, subjects are more likely to produce an error if the category on trial t − 1 is repeated (i.e., a pull effect just took place) than if the previous trial is of the neighboring category (i.e., a push effect), even when the distance between exemplars on t − 1 and t is matched. The greater probability of error translates to a greater magnitude of pull than push. The experimental studies noted a phenomenon termed snap back. If the same target category is presented on successive trials, and an error is made on the ﬁrst trial, subjects perform very accurately on the second trial, i.e., they generate an exemplar near the true category prototype. It appears as if subjects, realizing they have been slacking, reawaken and snap the category prototype back to where it belongs. We tested the model, but observed a sort of anti snap back. If the model made an error on the ﬁrst trial, the mean deviation was larger—not smaller—on the second trial: 0.40 versus 0.32. Thus, MLGA-Distrib fails to explain this phenomenon. However, the phenomenon is not inconsistent with the model. One might suppose that on an error trial, subjects become more attentive, and increased attention might correspond to a larger learning rate on an error trial, which should yield a more accurate response on the following trial. McLaren et al. (1995) studied a phenomenon in humans known as peak shift, in which subjects are trained to categorize unidimensional stimuli into one of two categories. Subjects are faster and more accurate when presented with exemplars far from the category boundary than those near the boundary. In fact, they respond more efﬁciently to far exemplars than they do to the category prototype. The results are characterized in terms of the prototype of one category being pushed away from the prototype of the other category. It seems straightforward to explain these data in MLGA-Distrib as a type of long-term push effect. 5 Related Work and Conclusions Stewart, Brown, and Chater (2002) proposed an account of categorization context effects in which responses are based solely on the relative difference between the previous and present exemplars. No representation of the category prototype is maintained. However, classiﬁcation based solely on relative difference cannot account for a diminished bias effects as a function of experience. A long-term stable prototype representation, of the sort incorporated into our models, seems necessary. We considered four models in our investigation, and the fact that only one accounts for the experimental data suggests that the data are nontrivial. All four models have principled theoretical underpinnings, and they space they deﬁne may suggest other elegant frameworks for understanding mechanisms of category learning. The successful model, MLDA-Distrib, offers a deep insight into understanding multiple-category domains: category structure must be considered. MLGA-Distrib exploits knowledge available to subjects performing the task concerning the ordinal relationships among categories. A model without this knowledge, MLGA-Local, fails to explain data. Thus, the interrelatedness of categories appears to provide a source of constraint that individuals use in learning about the structure of the world.

<p>Author: Johanna M. Zumer, Hagai T. Attias, Kensuke Sekihara, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: We have developed a novel algorithm for integrating source localization and noise suppression based on a probabilistic graphical model of stimulus-evoked MEG/EEG data. Our algorithm localizes multiple dipoles while suppressing noise sources with the computational complexity equivalent to a single dipole scan, and is therefore more efﬁcient than traditional multidipole ﬁtting procedures. In simulation, the algorithm can accurately localize and estimate the time course of several simultaneously-active dipoles, with rotating or ﬁxed orientation, at noise levels typical for averaged MEG data. Furthermore, the algorithm is superior to beamforming techniques, which we show to be an approximation to our graphical model, in estimation of temporally correlated sources. Success of this algorithm for localizing auditory cortex in a tumor patient and for localizing an epileptic spike source are also demonstrated. 1</p><p>6 0.60676092 <a title="188-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Structural_Equation_Models_for_fMRI.html">113 nips-2006-Learning Structural Equation Models for fMRI</a></p>

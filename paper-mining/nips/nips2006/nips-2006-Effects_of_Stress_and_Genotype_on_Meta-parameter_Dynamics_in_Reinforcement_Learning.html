<p>Author: Huan Xu, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: Computation of a satisfactory control policy for a Markov decision process when the parameters of the model are not exactly known is a problem encountered in many practical applications. The traditional robust approach is based on a worstcase analysis and may lead to an overly conservative policy. In this paper we consider the tradeoff between nominal performance and the worst case performance over all possible models. Based on parametric linear programming, we propose a method that computes the whole set of Pareto efﬁcient policies in the performancerobustness plane when only the reward parameters are subject to uncertainty. In the more general case when the transition probabilities are also subject to error, we show that the strategy with the “optimal” tradeoff might be non-Markovian and hence is in general not tractable. 1</p><p>3 0.11541163 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Time-Intensity_Profiles_of_Human_Activity_using_Non-Parametric_Bayesian_Models.html">114 nips-2006-Learning Time-Intensity Profiles of Human Activity using Non-Parametric Bayesian Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer interaction, video surveillance, and Web data analysis. We propose a non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven fashion what “factors” are generating the observations on a particular day, including (for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-speciﬁc effects corresponding to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category. Applications to real–world data sets of count data involving both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique. 1</p><p>4 0.10406011 <a title="71-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Logarithmic_Online_Regret_Bounds_for_Undiscounted_Reinforcement_Learning.html">125 nips-2006-Logarithmic Online Regret Bounds for Undiscounted Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: David Barber, Bertrand Mesot</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a method for approximate smoothed inference in a class of switching linear dynamical systems, based on a novel form of Gaussian Sum smoother. This class includes the switching Kalman Filter and the more general case of switch transitions dependent on the continuous latent state. The method improves on the standard Kim smoothing approach by dispensing with one of the key approximations, thus making fuller use of the available future information. Whilst the only central assumption required is projection to a mixture of Gaussians, we show that an additional conditional independence assumption results in a simpler but stable and accurate alternative. Unlike the alternative unstable Expectation Propagation procedure, our method consists only of a single forward and backward pass and is reminiscent of the standard smoothing ‘correction’ recursions in the simpler linear dynamical system. The algorithm performs well on both toy experiments and in a large scale application to noise robust speech recognition. 1 Switching Linear Dynamical System The Linear Dynamical System (LDS) [1] is a key temporal model in which a latent linear process generates the observed series. For complex time-series which are not well described globally by a single LDS, we may break the time-series into segments, each modeled by a potentially different LDS. This is the basis for the Switching LDS (SLDS) [2, 3, 4, 5] where, for each time t, a switch variable st ∈ 1, . . . , S describes which of the LDSs is to be used. The observation (or ‘visible’) vt ∈ RV is linearly related to the hidden state ht ∈ RH with additive noise η by vt = B(st )ht + η v (st ) p(vt |ht , st ) = N (B(st )ht , Σv (st )) ≡ (1) where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian distribution with mean µ and covariance Σ. The transition dynamics of the continuous hidden state ht is linear, ht = A(st )ht−1 + η h (st ), ≡ p(ht |ht−1 , st ) = N A(st )ht−1 , Σh (st ) (2) The switch st may depend on both the previous st−1 and ht−1 . This is an augmented SLDS (aSLDS), and deﬁnes the model T p(vt |ht , st )p(ht |ht−1 , st )p(st |ht−1 , st−1 ) p(v1:T , h1:T , s1:T ) = t=1 The standard SLDS[4] considers only switch transitions p(st |st−1 ). At time t = 1, p(s1 |h0 , s0 ) simply denotes the prior p(s1 ), and p(h1 |h0 , s1 ) denotes p(h1 |s1 ). The aim of this article is to address how to perform inference in the aSLDS. In particular we desire the ﬁltered estimate p(ht , st |v1:t ) and the smoothed estimate p(ht , st |v1:T ), for any 1 ≤ t ≤ T . Both ﬁltered and smoothed inference in the SLDS is intractable, scaling exponentially with time [4]. s1 s2 s3 s4 h1 h2 h3 h4 v1 v2 v3 v4 Figure 1: The independence structure of the aSLDS. Square nodes denote discrete variables, round nodes continuous variables. In the SLDS links from h to s are not normally considered. 2 Expectation Correction Our approach to approximate p(ht , st |v1:T ) mirrors the Rauch-Tung-Striebel ‘correction’ smoother for the simpler LDS [1].The method consists of a single forward pass to recursively ﬁnd the ﬁltered posterior p(ht , st |v1:t ), followed by a single backward pass to correct this into a smoothed posterior p(ht , st |v1:T ). The forward pass we use is equivalent to standard Assumed Density Filtering (ADF) [6]. The main contribution of this paper is a novel form of backward pass, based only on collapsing the smoothed posterior to a mixture of Gaussians. Together with the ADF forward pass, we call the method Expectation Correction, since it corrects the moments found from the forward pass. A more detailed description of the method, including pseudocode, is given in [7]. 2.1 Forward Pass (Filtering) Readers familiar with ADF may wish to continue directly to Section (2.2). Our aim is to form a recursion for p(st , ht |v1:t ), based on a Gaussian mixture approximation of p(ht |st , v1:t ). Without loss of generality, we may decompose the ﬁltered posterior as p(ht , st |v1:t ) = p(ht |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (3) The exact representation of p(ht |st , v1:t ) is a mixture with O(S t ) components. We therefore approximate this with a smaller I-component mixture I p(ht |st , v1:t ) ≈ p(ht |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t ) it =1 where p(ht |it , st , v1:t ) is a Gaussian parameterized with mean f (it , st ) and covariance F (it , st ). To ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters, consider p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) = p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) (4) st ,it Evaluating p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) We ﬁnd p(ht+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t+1 ) by ﬁrst computing the joint distribution p(ht+1 , vt+1 |st , it , st+1 , v1:t ), which is a Gaussian with covariance and mean elements, Σhh = A(st+1 )F (it , st )AT (st+1 ) + Σh (st+1 ), Σvv = B(st+1 )Σhh B T (st+1 ) + Σv (st+1 ) Σvh = B(st+1 )F (it , st ), µv = B(st+1 )A(st+1 )f (it , st ), µh = A(st+1 )f (it , st ) (5) and then conditioning on vt+1 1 . For the case S = 1, this forms the usual Kalman Filter recursions[1]. Evaluating p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) The mixture weight in (4) can be found from the decomposition p(st , it |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) (6) 1 p(x|y) is a Gaussian with mean µx + Σxy Σ−1 (y − µy ) and covariance Σxx − Σxy Σ−1 Σyx . yy yy The ﬁrst factor in (6), p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t ) is a Gaussian with mean µv and covariance Σvv , as given in (5). The last two factors p(it |st , v1:t ) and p(st |v1:t ) are given from the previous iteration. Finally, p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) is found from p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t ) = p(st+1 |ht , st ) p(ht |it ,st ,v1:t ) (7) where · p denotes expectation with respect to p. In the SLDS, (7) is replaced by the Markov transition p(st+1 |st ). In the aSLDS, however, (7) will generally need to be computed numerically. Closing the recursion We are now in a position to calculate (4). For each setting of the variable st+1 , we have a mixture of I × S Gaussians which we numerically collapse back to I Gaussians to form I p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) ≈ p(ht+1 |it+1 , st+1 , v1:t+1 )p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) it+1 =1 Any method of choice may be supplied to collapse a mixture to a smaller mixture; our code simply repeatedly merges low-weight components. In this way the new mixture coefﬁcients p(it+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ), it+1 ∈ 1, . . . , I are deﬁned, completing the description of how to form a recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ) in (3). A recursion for the switch variable is given by p(st+1 |v1:t+1 ) ∝ p(vt+1 |st+1 , it , st , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) st ,it where all terms have been computed during the recursion for p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:t+1 ). The likelihood p(v1:T ) may be found by recursing p(v1:t+1 ) = p(vt+1 |v1:t )p(v1:t ), where p(vt+1 |vt ) = p(vt+1 |it , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(st+1 |it , st , v1:t )p(it |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ) it ,st ,st+1 2.2 Backward Pass (Smoothing) The main contribution of this paper is to ﬁnd a suitable way to ‘correct’ the ﬁltered posterior p(st , ht |v1:t ) obtained from the forward pass into a smoothed posterior p(st , ht |v1:T ). We derive this for the case of a single Gaussian representation. The extension to the mixture case is straightforward and presented in [7]. We approximate the smoothed posterior p(ht |st , v1:T ) by a Gaussian with mean g(st ) and covariance G(st ) and our aim is to ﬁnd a recursion for these parameters. A useful starting point for a recursion is: p(st+1 |v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht , st |v1:T ) = st+1 The term p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) may be computed as p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) = p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t )p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) (8) ht+1 The recursion therefore requires p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ), which we can write as p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ∝ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T )p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) (9) The difﬁculty here is that the functional form of p(st |st+1 , ht+1 , v1:t ) is not squared exponential in ht+1 , so that p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be Gaussian2 . One possibility would be to approximate the non-Gaussian p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) by a Gaussian (or mixture thereof) by minimizing the Kullback-Leilbler divergence between the two, or performing moment matching in the case of a single Gaussian. A simpler alternative (which forms ‘standard’ EC) is to make the assumption p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), where p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) is already known from the previous backward recursion. Under this assumption, the recursion becomes p(ht , st |v1:T ) ≈ p(st+1 |v1:T )p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (10) st+1 2 In the exact calculation, p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) is a mixture of Gaussians, see [7]. However, since in (9) the two terms p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) will only be approximately computed during the recursion, our approximation to p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) will not be a mixture of Gaussians. Evaluating p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian in ht , whose statistics we will now compute. First we ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) which may be obtained from the joint distribution p(ht , ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |ht , st+1 )p(ht |st , v1:t ) (11) which itself can be found from a forward dynamics from the ﬁltered estimate p(ht |st , v1:t ). The statistics for the marginal p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:t ) are simply those of p(ht |st , v1:t ), since st+1 carries no extra information about ht . The remaining statistics are the mean of ht+1 , the covariance of ht+1 and cross-variance between ht and ht+1 , which are given by ht+1 = A(st+1 )ft (st ), Σt+1,t+1 = A(st+1 )Ft (st )AT (st+1 )+Σh (st+1 ), Σt+1,t = A(st+1 )Ft (st ) Given the statistics of (11), we may now condition on ht+1 to ﬁnd p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ). Doing so effectively constitutes a reversal of the dynamics, ← − − ht = A (st , st+1 )ht+1 + ←(st , st+1 ) η ← − ← − − − where A (st , st+1 ) and ←(st , st+1 ) ∼ N (← t , st+1 ), Σ (st , st+1 )) are easily found using η m(s conditioning. Averaging the above reversed dynamics over p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), we ﬁnd that p(ht |ht+1 , st , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) is a Gaussian with statistics ← − ← − ← − ← − − µt = A (st , st+1 )g(st+1 )+← t , st+1 ), Σt,t = A (st , st+1 )G(st+1 ) A T (st , st+1 )+ Σ (st , st+1 ) m(s These equations directly mirror the standard RTS backward pass[1]. Evaluating p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) The main departure of EC from previous methods is in treating the term p(st |st+1 , v1:T ) = p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) (12) The term p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) is given by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) = p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) ′ ′ s′ p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t )p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) (13) t Here p(st , st+1 |v1:t ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:t )p(st |v1:t ), where p(st+1 |st , v1:t ) occurs in the forward pass, (7). In (13), p(ht+1 |st+1 , st , v1:t ) is found by marginalizing (11). Computing the average of (13) with respect to p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) may be achieved by any numerical integration method desired. A simple approximation is to evaluate the integrand at the mean value of the averaging distribution p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ). More sophisticated methods (see [7]) such as sampling from the Gaussian p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ) have the advantage that covariance information is used3 . Closing the Recursion We have now computed both the continuous and discrete factors in (8), which we wish to use to write the smoothed estimate in the form p(ht , st |v1:T ) = p(st |v1:T )p(ht |st , v1:T ). The distribution p(ht |st , v1:T ) is readily obtained from the joint (8) by conditioning on st to form the mixture p(ht |st , v1:T ) = p(st+1 |st , v1:T )p(ht |st , st+1 , v1:T ) st+1 which may then be collapsed to a single Gaussian (the mixture case is discussed in [7]). The smoothed posterior p(st |v1:T ) is given by p(st |v1:T ) = p(st+1 |v1:T ) p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) . (14) st+1 3 This is a form of exact sampling since drawing samples from a Gaussian is easy. This should not be confused with meaning that this use of sampling renders EC a sequential Monte-Carlo scheme. 2.3 Relation to other methods The EC Backward pass is closely related to Kim’s method [8]. In both EC and Kim’s method, the approximation p(ht+1 |st , st+1 , v1:T ) ≈ p(ht+1 |st+1 , v1:T ), is used to form a numerically simple backward pass. The other ‘approximation’ in EC is to numerically compute the average in (14). In Kim’s method, however, an update for the discrete variables is formed by replacing the required term in (14) by p(st |ht+1 , st+1 , v1:t ) p(ht+1 |st+1 ,v1:T ) ≈ p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) (15) Since p(st |st+1 , v1:t ) ∝ p(st+1 |st )p(st |v1:t )/p(st+1 |v1:t ), this can be computed simply from the ﬁltered results alone. The fundamental difference therefore between EC and Kim’s method is that the approximation, (15), is not required by EC. The EC backward pass therefore makes fuller use of the future information, resulting in a recursion which intimately couples the continuous and discrete variables. The resulting effect on the quality of the approximation can be profound, as we will see in the experiments. The Expectation Propagation (EP) algorithm makes the central assumption of collapsing the posteriors to a Gaussian family [5]; the collapse is deﬁned by a consistency criterion on overlapping marginals. In our experiments, we take the approach in [9] of collapsing to a single Gaussian. Ensuring consistency requires frequent translations between moment and canonical parameterizations, which is the origin of potentially severe numerical instability [10]. In contrast, EC works largely with moment parameterizations of Gaussians, for which relatively few numerical difﬁculties arise. Unlike EP, EC is not based on a consistency criterion and a subtle issue arises about possible inconsistencies in the Forward and Backward approximations for EC. For example, under the conditional independence assumption in the Backward Pass, p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) ≈ p(hT |sT , v1:T ), which is in contradiction to (5) which states that the approximation to p(hT |sT −1 , sT , v1:T ) will depend on sT −1 . Such potential inconsistencies arise because of the approximations made, and should not be considered as separate approximations in themselves. Rather than using a global (consistency) objective, EC attempts to faithfully approximate the exact Forward and Backward propagation routines. For this reason, as in the exact computation, only a single Forward and Backward pass are required in EC. In [11] a related dynamics reversed is proposed. However, the singularities resulting from incorrectly treating p(vt+1:T |ht , st ) as a density are heuristically ﬁnessed. In [12] a variational method approximates the joint distribution p(h1:T , s1:T |v1:T ) rather than the marginal inference p(ht , st |v1:T ). This is a disadvantage when compared to other methods that directly approximate the marginal. Sequential Monte Carlo methods (Particle Filters)[13], are essentially mixture of delta-function approximations. Whilst potentially powerful, these typically suffer in high-dimensional hidden spaces, unless techniques such as Rao-Blackwellization are performed. ADF is generally preferential to Particle Filtering since in ADF the approximation is a mixture of non-trivial distributions, and is therefore more able to represent the posterior. 3 Demonstration Testing EC in a problem with a reasonably long temporal sequence, T , is important since numerical instabilities may not be apparent in timeseries of just a few points. To do this, we sequentially generate hidden and visible states from a given model, here with H = 3, S = 2, V = 1 – see Figure(2) for full details of the experimental setup. Then, given only the parameters of the model and the visible observations (but not any of the hidden states h1:T , s1:T ), the task is to infer p(ht |st , v1:T ) and p(st |v1:T ). Since the exact computation is exponential in T , a simple alternative is to assume that the original sample states s1:T are the ‘correct’ inferences, and compare how our most probable posterior smoothed estimates arg maxst p(st |v1:T ) compare with the assumed correct sample st . We chose conditions that, from the viewpoint of classical signal processing, are difﬁcult, with changes in the switches occurring at a much higher rate than the typical frequencies in the signal vt . For EC we use the mean approximation for the numerical integration of (12). We included the Particle Filter merely for a point of comparison with ADF, since they are not designed to approximate PF RBPF EP ADFS KimS ECS ADFM KimM ECM 1000 800 600 400 200 0 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 0 10 20 Figure 2: The number of errors in estimating p(st |v1:T ) for a binary switch (S = 2) over a time series of length T = 100.

For the RaoBlackwellized Particle Filter [13], 500 particles were used, with Kitagawa resampling. We found that EP4 was numerically unstable and often struggled to converge. To encourage convergence, we used the damping method in [9], performing 20 iterations with a damping factor of 0.5. Nevertheless, the disappointing performance of EP is most likely due to conﬂicts resulting from numerical instabilities introduced by the frequent conversions between moment and canonical representations. The best ﬁltered results are given using ADF, since this is better able to represent the variance in the ﬁltered posterior than the sampling methods. Unlike Kim’s method, EC makes good use of the future information to clean up the ﬁltered results considerably. One should bear in mind that both EC and Kim’s method use the same ADF ﬁltered results. This demonstrates that EC may dramatically improve on Kim’s method, so that the small amount of extra work in making a numerical approximation of p(st |st+1 , v1:T ), (12), may bring signiﬁcant beneﬁts. We found similar conclusions for experiments with an aSLDS[7]. 4 Application to Noise Robust ASR Here we brieﬂy present an application of the SLDS to robust Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), for which the intractable inference is performed by EC, and serves to demonstrate how EC scales well to a large-scale application. Fuller details are given in [14]. The standard approach to noise robust ASR is to provide a set of noise-robust features to a standard Hidden Markov Model (HMM) classiﬁer, which is based on modeling the acoustic feature vector. For example, the method of Unsupervised Spectral Subtraction (USS) [15] provides state-of-the-art performance in this respect. Incorporating noise models directly into such feature-based HMM systems is difﬁcult, mainly because the explicit inﬂuence of the noise on the features is poorly understood. An alternative is to model the raw speech signal directly, such as the SAR-HMM model [16] for which, under clean conditions, isolated spoken digit recognition performs well. However, the SAR-HMM performs poorly under noisy conditions, since no explicit noise processes are taken into account by the model. The approach we take here is to extend the SAR-HMM to include an explicit noise process, so that h the observed signal vt is modeled as a noise corrupted version of a clean hidden signal vt : h vt = vt + ηt ˜ 4 with ηt ∼ N (0, σ 2 ) ˜ ˜ Generalized EP [5], which groups variables together improves on the results, but is still far inferior to the EC results presented here – Onno Zoeter personal communication. Noise Variance 0 10−7 10−6 10−5 10−4 10−3 SNR (dB) 26.5 26.3 25.1 19.7 10.6 0.7 HMM 100.0% 100.0% 90.9% 86.4% 59.1% 9.1% SAR-HMM 97.0% 79.8% 56.7% 22.2% 9.7% 9.1% AR-SLDS 96.8% 96.8% 96.4% 94.8% 84.0% 61.2% Table 1: Comparison of the recognition accuracy of three models when the test utterances are corrupted by various levels of Gaussian noise. The dynamics of the clean signal is modeled by a switching AR process R h vt = h h cr (st )vt−r + ηt (st ), h ηt (st ) ∼ N (0, σ 2 (st )) r=1 where st ∈ {1, . . . , S} denotes which of a set of AR coefﬁcients cr (st ) are to be used at time t, h and ηt (st ) is the so-called innovation noise. When σ 2 (st ) ≡ 0, this model reproduces the SARHMM of [16], a specially constrained HMM. Hence inference and learning for the SAR-HMM are tractable and straightforward. For the case σ 2 (st ) > 0 the model can be recast as an SLDS. To do this we deﬁne ht as a vector which contains the R most recent clean hidden samples ht = h vt h . . . vt−r+1 T (16) and we set A(st ) to be an R × R matrix where the ﬁrst row contains the AR coefﬁcients −cr (st ) and the rest is a shifted down identity matrix. For example, for a third order (R = 3) AR process, A(st ) = −c1 (st ) −c2 (st ) −c3 (st ) 1 0 0 0 1 0 . (17) The hidden covariance matrix Σh (s) has all elements zero, except the top-left most which is set to the innovation variance. To extract the ﬁrst component of ht we use the (switch independent) 1 × R projection matrix B = [ 1 0 . . . 0 ]. The (switch independent) visible scalar noise 2 variance is given by Σv ≡ σv . A well-known issue with raw speech signal models is that the energy of a signal may vary from one speaker to another or because of a change in recording conditions. For this reason the innovation Σh is adjusted by maximizing the likelihood of an observed sequence with respect to the innovation covariance, a process called Gain Adaptation [16]. 4.1 Training & Evaluation Following [16], we trained a separate SAR-HMM for each of the eleven digits (0–9 and ‘oh’) from the TI-DIGITS database [17]. The training set for each digit was composed of 110 single digit utterances down-sampled to 8 kHz, each one pronounced by a male speaker. Each SAR-HMM was composed of ten states with a left-right transition matrix. Each state was associated with a 10thorder AR process and the model was constrained to stay an integer multiple of K = 140 time steps (0.0175 seconds) in the same state. We refer the reader to [16] for a detailed explanation of the training procedure used with the SAR-HMM. An AR-SLDS was built for each of the eleven digits by copying the parameters of the corresponding trained SAR-HMM, i.e., the AR coefﬁcients cr (s) are copied into the ﬁrst row of the hidden transition matrix A(s) and the same discrete transition distribution p(st | st−1 ) is used. The models were then evaluated on a test set composed of 112 corrupted utterances of each of the eleven digits, each pronounced by different male speakers than those used in the training set. The recognition accuracy obtained by the models on the corrupted test sets is presented in Table 1. As expected, the performance of the SAR-HMM rapidly decreases with noise. The feature-based HMM with USS has high accuracy only for high SNR levels. In contrast, the AR-SLDS achieves a recognition accuracy of 61.2% at a SNR close to 0 dB, while the performance of the two other methods is equivalent to random guessing (9.1%). Whilst other inference methods may also perform well in this case, we found that EC performs admirably, without numerical instabilities, even for time-series with several thousand time-steps. 5 Discussion We presented a method for approximate smoothed inference in an augmented class of switching linear dynamical systems. Our approximation is based on the idea that due to the forgetting which commonly occurs in Markovian models, a ﬁnite number of mixture components may provide a reasonable approximation. Clearly, in systems with very long correlation times our method may require too many mixture components to produce a satisfactory result, although we are unaware of other techniques that would be able to cope well in that case. The main beneﬁt of EC over Kim smoothing is that future information is more accurately dealt with. Whilst EC is not as general as EP, EC carefully exploits the properties of singly-connected distributions, such as the aSLDS, to provide a numerically stable procedure. We hope that the ideas presented here may therefore help facilitate the practical application of dynamic hybrid networks. Acknowledgements This work is supported by the EU Project FP6-0027787.

<p>Author: Gediminas Lukšys, Jérémie Knüsel, Denis Sheynikhovich, Carmen Sandi, Wulfram Gerstner</p><p>Abstract: Stress and genetic background regulate different aspects of behavioral learning through the action of stress hormones and neuromodulators. In reinforcement learning (RL) models, meta-parameters such as learning rate, future reward discount factor, and exploitation-exploration factor, control learning dynamics and performance. They are hypothesized to be related to neuromodulatory levels in the brain. We found that many aspects of animal learning and performance can be described by simple RL models using dynamic control of the meta-parameters. To study the effects of stress and genotype, we carried out 5-hole-box light conditioning and Morris water maze experiments with C57BL/6 and DBA/2 mouse strains. The animals were exposed to different kinds of stress to evaluate its effects on immediate performance as well as on long-term memory. Then, we used RL models to simulate their behavior. For each experimental session, we estimated a set of model meta-parameters that produced the best ﬁt between the model and the animal performance. The dynamics of several estimated meta-parameters were qualitatively similar for the two simulated experiments, and with statistically signiﬁcant differences between different genetic strains and stress conditions. 1</p><p>2 0.59150857 <a title="71-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-Learning_Time-Intensity_Profiles_of_Human_Activity_using_Non-Parametric_Bayesian_Models.html">114 nips-2006-Learning Time-Intensity Profiles of Human Activity using Non-Parametric Bayesian Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: Data sets that characterize human activity over time through collections of timestamped events or counts are of increasing interest in application areas as humancomputer interaction, video surveillance, and Web data analysis. We propose a non-parametric Bayesian framework for modeling collections of such data. In particular, we use a Dirichlet process framework for learning a set of intensity functions corresponding to different categories, which form a basis set for representing individual time-periods (e.g., several days) depending on which categories the time-periods are assigned to. This allows the model to learn in a data-driven fashion what “factors” are generating the observations on a particular day, including (for example) weekday versus weekend effects or day-speciﬁc effects corresponding to unique (single-day) occurrences of unusual behavior, sharing information where appropriate to obtain improved estimates of the behavior associated with each category. Applications to real–world data sets of count data involving both vehicles and people are used to illustrate the technique. 1</p><p>3 0.56146735 <a title="71-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Multiple_timescales_and_uncertainty_in_motor_adaptation.html">141 nips-2006-Multiple timescales and uncertainty in motor adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad P. Körding, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Reza Shadmehr</p><p>Abstract: Our motor system changes due to causes that span multiple timescales. For example, muscle response can change because of fatigue, a condition where the disturbance has a fast timescale or because of disease where the disturbance is much slower. Here we hypothesize that the nervous system adapts in a way that reﬂects the temporal properties of such potential disturbances. According to a Bayesian formulation of this idea, movement error results in a credit assignment problem: what timescale is responsible for this disturbance? The adaptation schedule inﬂuences the behavior of the optimal learner, changing estimates at different timescales as well as the uncertainty. A system that adapts in this way predicts many properties observed in saccadic gain adaptation. It well predicts the timecourses of motor adaptation in cases of partial sensory deprivation and reversals of the adaptation direction.</p><p>4 0.51724041 <a title="71-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Combining_causal_and_similarity-based_reasoning.html">53 nips-2006-Combining causal and similarity-based reasoning</a></p>

We present a Bayesian model of inductive reasoning that incorporates both kinds of knowledge, and show that it accounts well for human inferences about the properties of biological species. 1</p><p>5 0.49144781 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-The_Robustness-Performance_Tradeoff_in_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">191 nips-2006-The Robustness-Performance Tradeoff in Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Huan Xu, Shie Mannor</p><p>Abstract: Computation of a satisfactory control policy for a Markov decision process when the parameters of the model are not exactly known is a problem encountered in many practical applications. The traditional robust approach is based on a worstcase analysis and may lead to an overly conservative policy. In this paper we consider the tradeoff between nominal performance and the worst case performance over all possible models. Based on parametric linear programming, we propose a method that computes the whole set of Pareto efﬁcient policies in the performancerobustness plane when only the reward parameters are subject to uncertainty. In the more general case when the transition probabilities are also subject to error, we show that the strategy with the “optimal” tradeoff might be non-Markovian and hence is in general not tractable. 1</p><p>6 0.47741503 <a title="71-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-An_Application_of_Reinforcement_Learning_to_Aerobatic_Helicopter_Flight.html">25 nips-2006-An Application of Reinforcement Learning to Aerobatic Helicopter Flight</a></p>

The dynamics of several estimated meta-parameters were qualitatively similar for the two simulated experiments, and with statistically signiﬁcant differences between different genetic strains and stress conditions. 1</p><p>2 0.57953453 <a title="71-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Unsupervised_Regression_with_Applications_to_Nonlinear_System_Identification.html">200 nips-2006-Unsupervised Regression with Applications to Nonlinear System Identification</a></p>
<p>Author: Ali Rahimi, Ben Recht</p><p>Abstract: We derive a cost functional for estimating the relationship between highdimensional observations and the low-dimensional process that generated them with no input-output examples. Limiting our search to invertible observation functions confers numerous beneﬁts, including a compact representation and no suboptimal local minima. Our approximation algorithms for optimizing this cost functional are fast and give diagnostic bounds on the quality of their solution. Our method can be viewed as a manifold learning algorithm that utilizes a prior on the low-dimensional manifold coordinates. The beneﬁts of taking advantage of such priors in manifold learning and searching for the inverse observation functions in system identiﬁcation are demonstrated empirically by learning to track moving targets from raw measurements in a sensor network setting and in an RFID tracking experiment. 1</p><p>3 0.57312536 <a title="71-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Kernel_Method_for_the_Two-Sample-Problem.html">5 nips-2006-A Kernel Method for the Two-Sample-Problem</a></p>
<p>Author: Arthur Gretton, Karsten M. Borgwardt, Malte Rasch, Bernhard Schölkopf, Alex J. Smola</p><p>Abstract: We propose two statistical tests to determine if two samples are from different distributions. Our test statistic is in both cases the distance between the means of the two samples mapped into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). The ﬁrst test is based on a large deviation bound for the test statistic, while the second is based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic. The test statistic can be computed in O(m2 ) time. We apply our approach to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where our test performs strongly. We also demonstrate excellent performance when comparing distributions over graphs, for which no alternative tests currently exist.</p><p>4 0.44323346 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Optimal_Change-Detection_and_Spiking_Neurons.html">154 nips-2006-Optimal Change-Detection and Spiking Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Angela J. Yu</p><p>Abstract: Survival in a non-stationary, potentially adversarial environment requires animals to detect sensory changes rapidly yet accurately, two oft competing desiderata. Neurons subserving such detections are faced with the corresponding challenge to discern “real” changes in inputs as quickly as possible, while ignoring noisy ﬂuctuations. Mathematically, this is an example of a change-detection problem that is actively researched in the controlled stochastic processes community. In this paper, we utilize sophisticated tools developed in that community to formalize an instantiation of the problem faced by the nervous system, and characterize the Bayes-optimal decision policy under certain assumptions. We will derive from this optimal strategy an information accumulation and decision process that remarkably resembles the dynamics of a leaky integrate-and-ﬁre neuron. This correspondence suggests that neurons are optimized for tracking input changes, and sheds new light on the computational import of intracellular properties such as resting membrane potential, voltage-dependent conductance, and post-spike reset voltage. We also explore the inﬂuence that factors such as timing, uncertainty, neuromodulation, and reward should and do have on neuronal dynamics and sensitivity, as the optimal decision strategy depends critically on these factors. 1</p><p>5 0.44175819 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Theory_and_Dynamics_of_Perceptual_Bistability.html">192 nips-2006-Theory and Dynamics of Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>6 0.44010133 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Unsupervised_Learning_of_a_Probabilistic_Grammar_for_Object_Detection_and_Parsing.html">199 nips-2006-Unsupervised Learning of a Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing</a></p>

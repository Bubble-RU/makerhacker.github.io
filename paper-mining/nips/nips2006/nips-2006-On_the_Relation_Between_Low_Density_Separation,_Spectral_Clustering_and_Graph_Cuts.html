<p>Author: Boaz Nadler, Meirav Galun</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering methods are common graph-based approaches to clustering of data. Spectral clustering algorithms typically start from local information encoded in a weighted graph on the data and cluster according to the global eigenvectors of the corresponding (normalized) similarity matrix. One contribution of this paper is to present fundamental limitations of this general local to global approach. We show that based only on local information, the normalized cut functional is not a suitable measure for the quality of clustering. Further, even with a suitable similarity measure, we show that the ﬁrst few eigenvectors of such adjacency matrices cannot successfully cluster datasets that contain structures at different scales of size and density. Based on these ﬁndings, a second contribution of this paper is a novel diffusion based measure to evaluate the coherence of individual clusters. Our measure can be used in conjunction with any bottom-up graph-based clustering method, it is scale-free and can determine coherent clusters at all scales. We present both synthetic examples and real image segmentation problems where various spectral clustering algorithms fail. In contrast, using this coherence measure ﬁnds the expected clusters at all scales.

<p>Author: Yonatan Amit, Shai Shalev-shwartz, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: We describe and analyze an algorithmic framework for online classiﬁcation where each online trial consists of multiple prediction tasks that are tied together. We tackle the problem of updating the online hypothesis by deﬁning a projection problem in which each prediction task corresponds to a single linear constraint. These constraints are tied together through a single slack parameter. We then introduce a general method for approximately solving the problem by projecting simultaneously and independently on each constraint which corresponds to a prediction sub-problem, and then averaging the individual solutions. We show that this approach constitutes a feasible, albeit not necessarily optimal, solution for the original projection problem. We derive concrete simultaneous projection schemes and analyze them in the mistake bound model. We demonstrate the power of the proposed algorithm in experiments with online multiclass text categorization. Our experiments indicate that a combination of class-dependent features with the simultaneous projection method outperforms previously studied algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.22964402 <a title="151-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Convergence_of_Laplacian_Eigenmaps.html">60 nips-2006-Convergence of Laplacian Eigenmaps</a></p>

<p>Author: Hamed Valizadegan, Rong Jin</p><p>Abstract: Maximum margin clustering was proposed lately and has shown promising performance in recent studies [1, 2]. It extends the theory of support vector machine to unsupervised learning. Despite its good performance, there are three major problems with maximum margin clustering that question its eﬃciency for real-world applications. First, it is computationally expensive and diﬃcult to scale to large-scale datasets because the number of parameters in maximum margin clustering is quadratic in the number of examples. Second, it requires data preprocessing to ensure that any clustering boundary will pass through the origins, which makes it unsuitable for clustering unbalanced dataset. Third, it is sensitive to the choice of kernel functions, and requires external procedure to determine the appropriate values for the parameters of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose “generalized maximum margin clustering” framework that addresses the above three problems simultaneously. The new framework generalizes the maximum margin clustering algorithm by allowing any clustering boundaries including those not passing through the origins. It signiﬁcantly improves the computational eﬃciency by reducing the number of parameters. Furthermore, the new framework is able to automatically determine the appropriate kernel matrix without any labeled data. Finally, we show a formal connection between maximum margin clustering and spectral clustering. We demonstrate the eﬃciency of the generalized maximum margin clustering algorithm using both synthetic datasets and real datasets from the UCI repository. 1</p><p>6 0.18217185 <a title="151-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Kernels_on_Structured_Objects_Through_Nested_Histograms.html">103 nips-2006-Kernels on Structured Objects Through Nested Histograms</a></p>

<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Jiayuan Huang, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We usually endow the investigated objects with pairwise relationships, which can be illustrated as graphs. In many real-world problems, however, relationships among the objects of our interest are more complex than pairwise. Naively squeezing the complex relationships into pairwise ones will inevitably lead to loss of information which can be expected valuable for our learning tasks however. Therefore we consider using hypergraphs instead to completely represent complex relationships among the objects of our interest, and thus the problem of learning with hypergraphs arises. Our main contribution in this paper is to generalize the powerful methodology of spectral clustering which originally operates on undirected graphs to hypergraphs, and further develop algorithms for hypergraph embedding and transductive classiﬁcation on the basis of the spectral hypergraph clustering approach. Our experiments on a number of benchmarks showed the advantages of hypergraphs over usual graphs. 1</p><p>3 0.59384692 <a title="151-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Convergence_of_Laplacian_Eigenmaps.html">60 nips-2006-Convergence of Laplacian Eigenmaps</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthias Hein, Markus Maier</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of denoising a noisily sampled submanifold M in Rd , where the submanifold M is a priori unknown and we are only given a noisy point sample. The presented denoising algorithm is based on a graph-based diffusion process of the point sample. We analyze this diffusion process using recent results about the convergence of graph Laplacians. In the experiments we show that our method is capable of dealing with non-trivial high-dimensional noise. Moreover using the denoising algorithm as pre-processing method we can improve the results of a semi-supervised learning algorithm. 1</p><p>6 0.47361627 <a title="151-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Prediction_on_a_Graph_with_a_Perceptron.html">163 nips-2006-Prediction on a Graph with a Perceptron</a></p>

<p>Author: Alexander Rakhlin, Andrea Caponnetto</p><p>Abstract: We phrase K-means clustering as an empirical risk minimization procedure over a class HK and explicitly calculate the covering number for this class. Next, we show that stability of K-means clustering is characterized by the geometry of HK with respect to the underlying distribution. We prove that in the case of a unique global minimizer, the clustering solution is stable with respect to complete changes of the data, while for the case of multiple minimizers, the change of Ω(n1/2 ) samples deﬁnes the transition between stability and instability. While for a ﬁnite number of minimizers this result follows from multinomial distribution estimates, the case of inﬁnite minimizers requires more reﬁned tools. We conclude by proving that stability of the functions in HK implies stability of the actual centers of the clusters. Since stability is often used for selecting the number of clusters in practice, we hope that our analysis serves as a starting point for ﬁnding theoretically grounded recipes for the choice of K. 1</p><p>5 0.59303385 <a title="151-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Natural_Actor-Critic_for_Road_Traffic_Optimisation.html">143 nips-2006-Natural Actor-Critic for Road Traffic Optimisation</a></p>
<p>Author: Silvia Richter, Douglas Aberdeen, Jin Yu</p><p>Abstract: Current road-trafﬁc optimisation practice around the world is a combination of hand tuned policies with a small degree of automatic adaption. Even state-ofthe-art research controllers need good models of the road trafﬁc, which cannot be obtained directly from existing sensors. We use a policy-gradient reinforcement learning approach to directly optimise the trafﬁc signals, mapping currently deployed sensor observations to control signals. Our trained controllers are (theoretically) compatible with the trafﬁc system used in Sydney and many other cities around the world. We apply two policy-gradient methods: (1) the recent natural actor-critic algorithm, and (2) a vanilla policy-gradient algorithm for comparison. Along the way we extend natural-actor critic approaches to work for distributed and online inﬁnite-horizon problems. 1</p><p>6 0.59077871 <a title="151-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Learning_from_Multiple_Sources.html">116 nips-2006-Learning from Multiple Sources</a></p>

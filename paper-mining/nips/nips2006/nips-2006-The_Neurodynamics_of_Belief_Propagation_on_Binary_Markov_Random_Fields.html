<p>Author: Thomas Voegtlin</p><p>Abstract: In biological neurons, the timing of a spike depends on the timing of synaptic currents, in a way that is classically described by the Phase Response Curve. This has implications for temporal coding: an action potential that arrives on a synapse has an implicit meaning, that depends on the position of the postsynaptic neuron on the ﬁring cycle. Here we show that this implicit code can be used to perform computations. Using theta neurons, we derive a spike-timing dependent learning rule from an error criterion. We demonstrate how to train an auto-encoder neural network using this rule. 1</p><p>3 0.1475192 <a title="190-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Using_Combinatorial_Optimization_within_Max-Product_Belief_Propagation.html">201 nips-2006-Using Combinatorial Optimization within Max-Product Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel Tarlow, Gal Elidan, Daphne Koller, John C. Duchi</p><p>Abstract: In general, the problem of computing a maximum a posteriori (MAP) assignment in a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) is computationally intractable. However, in certain subclasses of MRF, an optimal or close-to-optimal assignment can be found very efﬁciently using combinatorial optimization algorithms: certain MRFs with mutual exclusion constraints can be solved using bipartite matching, and MRFs with regular potentials can be solved using minimum cut methods. However, these solutions do not apply to the many MRFs that contain such tractable components as sub-networks, but also other non-complying potentials. In this paper, we present a new method, called C OMPOSE, for exploiting combinatorial optimization for sub-networks within the context of a max-product belief propagation algorithm. C OMPOSE uses combinatorial optimization for computing exact maxmarginals for an entire sub-network; these can then be used for inference in the context of the network as a whole. We describe highly efﬁcient methods for computing max-marginals for subnetworks corresponding both to bipartite matchings and to regular networks. We present results on both synthetic and real networks encoding correspondence problems between images, which involve both matching constraints and pairwise geometric constraints. We compare to a range of current methods, showing that the ability of C OMPOSE to transmit information globally across the network leads to improved convergence, decreased running time, and higher-scoring assignments.</p><p>4 0.14551985 <a title="190-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Attentional_Processing_on_a_Spike-Based_VLSI_Neural_Network.html">36 nips-2006-Attentional Processing on a Spike-Based VLSI Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Yingxue Wang, Rodney J. Douglas, Shih-Chii Liu</p><p>Abstract: The neurons of the neocortex communicate by asynchronous events called action potentials (or ’spikes’). However, for simplicity of simulation, most models of processing by cortical neural networks have assumed that the activations of their neurons can be approximated by event rates rather than taking account of individual spikes. The obstacle to exploring the more detailed spike processing of these networks has been reduced considerably in recent years by the development of hybrid analog-digital Very-Large Scale Integrated (hVLSI) neural networks composed of spiking neurons that are able to operate in real-time. In this paper we describe such a hVLSI neural network that performs an interesting task of selective attentional processing that was previously described for a simulated ’pointer-map’ rate model by Hahnloser and colleagues. We found that most of the computational features of their rate model can be reproduced in the spiking implementation; but, that spike-based processing requires a modiﬁcation of the original network architecture in order to memorize a previously attended target. 1</p><p>5 0.142832 <a title="190-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter Carbonetto, Nando D. Freitas</p><p>Abstract: Despite all the attention paid to variational methods based on sum-product message passing (loopy belief propagation, tree-reweighted sum-product), these methods are still bound to inference on a small set of probabilistic models. Mean ﬁeld approximations have been applied to a broader set of problems, but the solutions are often poor. We propose a new class of conditionally-speciﬁed variational approximations based on mean ﬁeld theory. While not usable on their own, combined with sequential Monte Carlo they produce guaranteed improvements over conventional mean ﬁeld. Moreover, experiments on a well-studied problem— inferring the stable conﬁgurations of the Ising spin glass—show that the solutions can be signiﬁcantly better than those obtained using sum-product-based methods. 1</p><p>6 0.12280519 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Context_dependent_amplification_of_both_rate_and_event-correlation_in_a_VLSI_network_of_spiking_neurons.html">59 nips-2006-Context dependent amplification of both rate and event-correlation in a VLSI network of spiking neurons</a></p>

<p>Author: Elisabetta Chicca, Giacomo Indiveri, Rodney J. Douglas</p><p>Abstract: Cooperative competitive networks are believed to play a central role in cortical processing and have been shown to exhibit a wide set of useful computational properties. We propose a VLSI implementation of a spiking cooperative competitive network and show how it can perform context dependent computation both in the mean ﬁring rate domain and in spike timing correlation space. In the mean rate case the network ampliﬁes the activity of neurons belonging to the selected stimulus and suppresses the activity of neurons receiving weaker stimuli. In the event correlation case, the recurrent network ampliﬁes with a higher gain the correlation between neurons which receive highly correlated inputs while leaving the mean ﬁring rate unaltered. We describe the network architecture and present experimental data demonstrating its context dependent computation capabilities. 1</p><p>4 0.46853289 <a title="190-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Conditional_mean_field.html">57 nips-2006-Conditional mean field</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael G. Rabbat, Mário Figueiredo, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring the structure of a network from cooccurrence data: observations that indicate which nodes occur in a signaling pathway but do not directly reveal node order within the pathway. This problem is motivated by network inference problems arising in computational biology and communication systems, in which it is difﬁcult or impossible to obtain precise time ordering information. Without order information, every permutation of the activated nodes leads to a different feasible solution, resulting in combinatorial explosion of the feasible set. However, physical principles underlying most networked systems suggest that not all feasible solutions are equally likely. Intuitively, nodes that co-occur more frequently are probably more closely connected. Building on this intuition, we model path co-occurrences as randomly shufﬂed samples of a random walk on the network. We derive a computationally efﬁcient network inference algorithm and, via novel concentration inequalities for importance sampling estimators, prove that a polynomial complexity Monte Carlo version of the algorithm converges with high probability. 1</p><p>6 0.41977021 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Attentional_Processing_on_a_Spike-Based_VLSI_Neural_Network.html">36 nips-2006-Attentional Processing on a Spike-Based VLSI Neural Network</a></p>

We found that most of the computational features of their rate model can be reproduced in the spiking implementation; but, that spike-based processing requires a modiﬁcation of the original network architecture in order to memorize a previously attended target. 1</p><p>4 0.53674459 <a title="190-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Uncertainty%2C_phase_and_oscillatory_hippocampal_recall.html">197 nips-2006-Uncertainty, phase and oscillatory hippocampal recall</a></p>
<p>Author: Máté Lengyel, Peter Dayan</p><p>Abstract: Many neural areas, notably, the hippocampus, show structured, dynamical, population behavior such as coordinated oscillations. It has long been observed that such oscillations provide a substrate for representing analog information in the ﬁring phases of neurons relative to the underlying population rhythm. However, it has become increasingly clear that it is essential for neural populations to represent uncertainty about the information they capture, and the substantial recent work on neural codes for uncertainty has omitted any analysis of oscillatory systems. Here, we observe that, since neurons in an oscillatory network need not only ﬁre once in each cycle (or even at all), uncertainty about the analog quantities each neuron represents by its ﬁring phase might naturally be reported through the degree of concentration of the spikes that it ﬁres. We apply this theory to memory in a model of oscillatory associative recall in hippocampal area CA3. Although it is not well treated in the literature, representing and manipulating uncertainty is fundamental to competent memory; our theory enables us to view CA3 as an effective uncertainty-aware, retrieval system. 1</p><p>5 0.52944404 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Predicting_spike_times_from_subthreshold_dynamics_of_a_neuron.html">162 nips-2006-Predicting spike times from subthreshold dynamics of a neuron</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryota Kobayashi, Shigeru Shinomoto</p><p>Abstract: It has been established that a neuron reproduces highly precise spike response to identical ﬂuctuating input currents. We wish to accurately predict the ﬁring times of a given neuron for any input current. For this purpose we adopt a model that mimics the dynamics of the membrane potential, and then take a cue from its dynamics for predicting the spike occurrence for a novel input current. It is found that the prediction is signiﬁcantly improved by observing the state space of the membrane potential and its time derivative(s) in advance of a possible spike, in comparison to simply thresholding an instantaneous value of the estimated potential. 1</p><p>6 0.52773458 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Large_Margin_Multi-channel_Analog-to-Digital_Conversion_with_Applications_to_Neural_Prosthesis.html">107 nips-2006-Large Margin Multi-channel Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Applications to Neural Prosthesis</a></p>

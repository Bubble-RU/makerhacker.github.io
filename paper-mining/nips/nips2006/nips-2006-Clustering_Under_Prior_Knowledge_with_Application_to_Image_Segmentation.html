</p><p>6 1  Introduction  Most approaches to semi-supervised learning (SSL) see the problem from one of two (dual) perspectives: supervised classiﬁcation with additional unlabelled data (see [20] for a recent survey); clustering with prior information or constraints (e. [sent-17, score-0.272]
</p><p>7 The second perspective, usually termed semi-supervised clustering (SSC), is usually adopted when labels are totaly absent, but there are (usually pair-wise) relations that one wishes to enforce or encourage. [sent-20, score-0.308]

</p><p>9 However, the previous EM-type algorithms for this class of methods have a major drawback: the presence of the prior makes the E-step non-trivial, forcing the use of expensive Gibbs sampling [11] or suboptimal methods such as the iterated conditional modes algorithm [4]. [sent-26, score-0.166]
</p><p>10 The keystone is the formulation of SSC as a penalized logistic regression problem, where the labels are only indirectly observed. [sent-28, score-0.297]

</p><p>12 When applied to image segmentation, our method allows using spatial priors which are typical of image estimation problems (e. [sent-33, score-0.567]
</p><p>13 Under these priors, the M-step of our GEM algorithm reduces to a simple image denoising procedure, for which there are several extremely efﬁcient algorithms. [sent-36, score-0.334]
</p><p>14 2  Formulation  We start from the standard formulation of ﬁnite mixture models: X = {x1 , . [sent-37, score-0.13]
</p><p>15 , xn } is an observed data set, where each xi ∈ I d was generated (independently) according to one of a set of K probR ability (density or mass) functions {p(·|φ(1) ), . [sent-40, score-0.089]
</p><p>16 In image segmentation, each xi is a pixel value (gray scale, d = 1; color, d = 3) or a vector of local (e. [sent-44, score-0.276]
</p><p>17 Associated (1) (K) with X , there is a hidden label set Y = {y1 , . [sent-47, score-0.075]
</p><p>18 , yi ]T ∈ {0, 1}K , with (k) yi = 1 if and only if xi was generated by source k (the so-called “1-of-K” binary encoding). [sent-53, score-0.763]
</p><p>19 Thus, K  n (k)  p (X |Y, φ ) =  p(xi |φ k=1  (k)  i: yi  K  )=  p(xi |φ i=1  =1  (k)  (k)  )  yi  ,  (1)  k=1  where φ = (φ(1) , . [sent-54, score-0.674]
</p><p>20 In standard mixture models, all the yi are assumed to be independent and identically distributed samples following a multinomial distribution with probabilities {η (1) , . [sent-58, score-0.498]
</p><p>21 This is the part of standard mixture models that has to be modiﬁed in order to i k (η insert grouping constraints [15] or a grouping prior p(Y) [4, 11]. [sent-64, score-0.317]
</p><p>22 However, this prior destroys the simplicity of the standard E-step for ﬁnite mixtures, which is critically based on the independence assumption. [sent-65, score-0.138]
</p><p>23 , zi ]T ∈ I K following a multinomial logistic model [5]: R , n  K  P (Y|Z) =  (k)  (k)  (k) P [yi  = 1|zi ]  yi  ,  where  (k) P [yi  = 1|zi ] =  i=1 k=1  ezi  (l) K zi l=1 e  . [sent-76, score-1.078]
</p><p>24 , zn ]T ; of course, Z can be seen as an n × (K − 1) matrix, where z(k) is the k-th column and zi is the i-th row. [sent-93, score-0.327]
</p><p>25 With this formulation, certain grouping preferences may be expressed by a prior p(Z). [sent-94, score-0.223]
</p><p>26 (4)  For image segmentation, each z(k) is an image with real-valued elements and a natural choice for A is to have Ai,j = λ, if i and j are neighbors, and zero otherwise. [sent-99, score-0.374]
</p><p>27 Assuming periodic boundary conditions for the neighborhood system, ∆ is a block-circulant matrix with circulant blocks [2]. [sent-100, score-0.174]
</p><p>28 However, as shown below, other more sophisticated priors (such as wavelet-based priors) can also be used at no additional computational cost [1]. [sent-101, score-0.141]
</p><p>29 1  Model Estimation Marginal Maximum A Posteriori and the GEM Algorithm  Based on the formulation presented in the previous section, SSC is performed by estimating Z and φ, seeing Y as missing data. [sent-103, score-0.113]
</p><p>30 The marginal maximum a posteriori estimate is obtained by  marginalizing out the hidden labels (over all the possible label conﬁgurations), Z, φ = arg max Z,φ  Y  p(X , Y, Z|φ) = arg max Z,φ  p(X |Y, φ) P (Y|Z) p(Z),  (5)  Y  where we’re assuming a ﬂat prior for φ. [sent-104, score-0.43]
</p><p>31 This is in contrast Markov random ﬁeld approaches to image segmentation, which lead to hard combinatorial problems, since they perform optimization directly with respect to the (discrete) label variables Y. [sent-106, score-0.318]
</p><p>32 By ﬁnding arg maxk P [yi = 1|zi ], for every i, one may obtain a hard clustering/segmentation. [sent-108, score-0.098]
</p><p>33 , by applying the following iterative procedure (until some convergence criterion is satisﬁed): E-step: Compute the conditional expectation of the complete log-posterior, given the current estimates (Z, φ) and the observations X : Q(Z, φ|Z, φ) = EY log p(Y, Z, φ|X ) Z, φ, X . [sent-111, score-0.099]
</p><p>34 log p(Y, Z, φ|X ) = log p(X |Y, φ) + log P (Y|Z) + log p(Z) n  . [sent-116, score-0.256]

</p><p>36 (9)  = 1|zi ]  Notice that this is the same as the E-step for a standard ﬁnite mixture, where the probabilities (k) P [yi = 1|zi ] (given by (2)) play the role of the probabilities of the classes/components. [sent-125, score-0.104]
</p><p>37 Finally, (k) the Q function is obtained by plugging the expectations yi into (8). [sent-126, score-0.368]

</p><p>39 In supervised image segmentation, these parameters are known (e. [sent-139, score-0.263]
</p><p>40 In unsupervised image segmentation, φ is unknown and (10) will have to be applied. [sent-142, score-0.245]
</p><p>41 To update the estimate of Z, we need to maximize (or at least improve, see (7)) n  K  K (k) (k)  L(Z|Y) ≡ i=1  k=1  (k)  ezi  yi zi − log  + log p(Z). [sent-143, score-0.85]
</p><p>42 (11)  k=1  Without the prior, this would be a simple logistic regression (LR) problem, with an identity design (k) (k) matrix [5]; however, instead of the usual hard labels yi ∈ {0, 1}, we have “soft” labels yi ∈ [0, 1]. [sent-144, score-0.925]
</p><p>43 Thus, the iteration θ new = arg max R(θ, θ) = θ + B−1 g(θ) θ  (13)  is guaranteed to monotonically improve E(θ), i. [sent-153, score-0.102]

</p><p>47 Deﬁning v = z + B−1 (y − η(z)), the MM update equation for solving (11) is thus znew (v) = arg min z  1 T (z − v) B (z − v) − log p(z) , 2  (15)  where p(z) is equivalent to p(Z), because z is simply the lexicographic vectorization of Z. [sent-171, score-0.475]
</p><p>48 (Generalized) M-step: Apply one or more iterations (15), keeping y ﬁxed, that is, loop through the following two steps: v ← z + B−1 (y − η(z)) and z ← znew (v). [sent-179, score-0.134]
</p><p>49 4  Speeding Up the Algorithm  In image segmentation, the MM update equation (15) is formally equivalent to the MAP estimation of an image with n pixels in I K−1 , under prior p(z), where v plays the role of observed image, and R B is the inverse covariance matrix of the noise. [sent-181, score-0.565]

</p><p>52 Since the eigenvalues of the Kronecker product are the products of the eigenvalues of the matrices, λmax (B) = λmax (I − (1/K) 1 1T )/2. [sent-192, score-0.1]

</p><p>55 5  Stationary Gaussian Field Priors  Consider a Gaussian prior of form (3), where Ai,j only depends on the relative position of i and j and the neighborhood system deﬁned by A has periodic boundary conditions. [sent-206, score-0.183]
</p><p>56 In this case, both A and ∆ are block-circulant matrices, with circulant blocks [2], thus diagonalizable by a 2D discrete Fourier transform (2D-DFT). [sent-207, score-0.115]
</p><p>57 Formally, ∆ = UH DU, where D is diagonal, U is the orthogonal matrix representing the 2D-DFT, and (·)H denotes conjugate transpose. [sent-208, score-0.067]

</p><p>59 (17)  (k)  Observe that (17) corresponds to ﬁltering each image v , in the DFT domain, with a ﬁxed ﬁlter −1 with frequency response [ξK In + D] ; this inversion can be computed off-line and is trivial because ξK In + D is diagonal. [sent-214, score-0.232]
</p><p>60 Finally, it’s worth stressing that the matrix-vector products by U and UH are not carried out explicitly but more efﬁciently via the FFT algorithm, with cost O(n log n). [sent-215, score-0.064]
</p><p>61 6  Wavelet-Based Priors for Segmentation  It’s known that piece-wise smooth images have sparse wavelet-based representations (see [12] and the many references therein); this fact underlies the state-of-the-art denoising performance of wavelet-based methods. [sent-217, score-0.194]
</p><p>62 Consider a wavelet expansion of each z(k) z(k) = Wθ (k) ,  k = 1, . [sent-219, score-0.137]
</p><p>63 , K − 1,  (18)  (k)  where the θ are sets of coefﬁcients and W is the matrix representation of an inverse wavelet transform; W may be orthogonal or have more columns than lines (over-complete representations) [12]. [sent-222, score-0.239]
</p><p>64 A wavelet-based prior for z(k) is induced by placing a prior on the coefﬁcients θ (k) . [sent-223, score-0.194]
</p><p>65 A classical choice for p(θ (k) ) is a generalized Gaussian [14]. [sent-224, score-0.082]
</p><p>66 Without going into details, under this class of priors (and others), (16) becomes a non-linear wavelet-based denoising step, which has been widely studied in the image processing literature. [sent-225, score-0.475]
</p><p>67 This is computationally very efﬁcient, due to the existence of fast algorithms for computing direct and inverse wavelet transforms; e. [sent-227, score-0.172]
</p><p>68 , O(n) for an orthogonal wavelet transform or O(n log n) for a shift-invariant redundant transform. [sent-229, score-0.295]
</p><p>69 1  Extensions Semi-Supervised Segmentation  For semi-supervised image segmentation, the user deﬁnes regions in the image for which the true label is known. [sent-231, score-0.46]
</p><p>70 Our GEM algorithm is trivially modiﬁed to handle this case: if at location i the label  (k)  (j)  is known to be (say) k, we freeze yi = 1, and yi = 0, for j = k. [sent-232, score-0.716]
</p><p>71 2  Discriminative Features  Our formulation (as most probabilistic segmentation methods) adopts a generative perspective, where each p(·|φ(k) ) models the data generation mechanism in the corresponding class. [sent-236, score-0.529]
</p><p>72 However, discriminative methods (such as support vector machines) are seen as the current state-of-the-art in classiﬁcation [7]. [sent-237, score-0.107]
</p><p>73 We will now show how a pre-trained discriminative classiﬁer can be used in our GEM algorithm instead of the generative likelihoods. [sent-238, score-0.139]
</p><p>74 The E-step (see (9)) obtains the posterior probability that xi was generated by the k-th model, by (k)  combining (via Bayes law) the corresponding likelihood p(xi |φ ) with the local prior probability (k) P [yi = 1|zi ]. [sent-239, score-0.215]
</p><p>75 Consider that, instead of likelihoods derived from generative models, we have a discriminative classiﬁer, i. [sent-240, score-0.139]
</p><p>76 , one that directly provides estimates of the posterior class probabilities (k) P [yi = 1|xi ]. [sent-242, score-0.081]
</p><p>77 To use these values in our segmentation algorithm, we need a way to bias these (k) estimates according to the local prior probabilities P [yi = 1|zi ], which are responsible for encouraging spatial coherence. [sent-243, score-0.588]
</p><p>78 Let us assume that we know that the discriminative classiﬁer was trained using mk samples from the k-th class. [sent-244, score-0.16]
</p><p>79 It can thus be assumed that these posterior class probabilities (k) (k) verify P [yi = 1|xi ] ∝ mk p(xi |yi = 1). [sent-245, score-0.166]
</p><p>80 It is then possible to “bias” these classiﬁers, with the (k) local prior probabilities P [yi = 1|zi ], simply by computing  −1 K (k) (k) (j) (j) P [yi = 1|xi ] P [yi = 1|zi ]  P [yi = 1|xi ] P [yi = 1|zi ]  (k) P [yi = 1|xi ] = . [sent-246, score-0.149]
</p><p>81 mk mj j=1  5  Experiments  In this section we will show experimental results of image segmentation in supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and discriminative modes. [sent-247, score-0.734]
</p><p>82 Assessing the performance of a segmentation method is not a trivial task. [sent-248, score-0.432]
</p><p>83 Moreover, the performance of segmentation algorithms depends more critically on the adopted features (which is not the focus of this paper) than on the spatial coherence prior. [sent-249, score-0.512]
</p><p>84 For these reasons, we will not present any careful comparative study, but simply a set of experimental examples testifying for the promising behavior of the proposed approach. [sent-250, score-0.058]
</p><p>85 1, illustrates the algorithm on a synthetic gray scale image with four Gaussian classes of means 1, 2, 3, and 4, and standard deviation 0. [sent-253, score-0.187]
</p><p>86 For this image, both supervised and unsupervised segmentation lead to almost visually indistinguishable results, so we only show the supervised segmentation results. [sent-255, score-0.984]
</p><p>87 For wavelet-based segmentation, we have used undecimated Haar wavelets and the Bayes-shrink denoising procedure [6]. [sent-257, score-0.147]
</p><p>88 In the example in the ﬁrst row, the goal is to segment the image into skin, cloth, and background regions; in the second example, the goal is to segment the horses from the background. [sent-263, score-0.283]
</p><p>89 These examples show how the semi-supervised mode of our algorithm is able to segment the image into regions which “look like” the seed regions provided by the user. [sent-264, score-0.372]

</p><p>91 3  Discriminative Texture Segmentation  Finally, we illustrate the behavior of the algorithm when used with discriminative classiﬁers by applying it to texture segmentation. [sent-267, score-0.189]
</p><p>92 We build on the work in [8], where SVM classiﬁers are used for texture classiﬁcation (see [8] for complete details about the kernels and texture features used). [sent-268, score-0.199]
</p><p>93 3 shows two experiments; one with a two-texture 256×512 image and the other with a 5-texture 256 × 256 image. [sent-270, score-0.187]
</p><p>94 These examples show that our method is able to take class predictions produced by a classiﬁer lacking any spatial prior and produce segmentations with a high degree of spatial coherence. [sent-279, score-0.245]
</p><p>95 6  Conclusions  We have introduced an approach to probabilistic semi-supervised clustering which is particularly suited for image segmentation. [sent-280, score-0.353]
</p><p>96 The formulation allows supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and discriminative modes, and can be used with classical standard image priors (such as Gaussian ﬁelds, or wavelet-based priors). [sent-281, score-0.542]
</p><p>97 Unlike the usual Markov random ﬁeld approaches, which involve combinatorial optimization, our segmentation algorithm consists of a simple generalized EM algorithm. [sent-282, score-0.488]

<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>2 0.20227721 <a title="51-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Switched_Gaussian_Process_for_Estimating_Disparity_and_Segmentation_in_Binocular_Stereo.html">15 nips-2006-A Switched Gaussian Process for Estimating Disparity and Segmentation in Binocular Stereo</a></p>
<p>Author: Oliver Williams</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a Gaussian process framework for inferring pixel-wise disparity and bi-layer segmentation of a scene given a stereo pair of images. The Gaussian process covariance is parameterized by a foreground-backgroundocclusion segmentation label to model both smooth regions and discontinuities. As such, we call our model a switched Gaussian process. We propose a greedy incremental algorithm for adding observations from the data and assigning segmentation labels. Two observation schedules are proposed: the ﬁrst treats scanlines as independent, the second uses an active learning criterion to select a sparse subset of points to measure. We show that this probabilistic framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>3 0.16770935 <a title="51-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Learning_to_Model_Spatial_Dependency%3A_Semi-Supervised_Discriminative_Random_Fields.html">118 nips-2006-Learning to Model Spatial Dependency: Semi-Supervised Discriminative Random Fields</a></p>

We formulate DRF training as a form of MAP estimation that combines conditional loglikelihood on labeled data, given a data-dependent prior, with a conditional entropy regularizer deﬁned on unlabeled data. Although the training objective is no longer concave, we develop an efﬁcient local optimization procedure that produces classiﬁers that are more accurate than ones based on standard supervised DRF training.

<p>Author: Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N (100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of signiﬁcance α = 1 − ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the inﬂuence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efﬁciently detect outliers at a given level of signiﬁcance and compute their empirical p-values. We illustrate GEM for several simulated and real data sets in high dimensional feature spaces. 1</p><p>5 0.13220705 <a title="51-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Online_Clustering_of_Moving_Hyperplanes.html">153 nips-2006-Online Clustering of Moving Hyperplanes</a></p>
<p>Author: René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefﬁcients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The ﬁnal result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird ﬂoating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefﬁcients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.</p><p>6 0.1320999 <a title="51-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Generalized_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_and_Unsupervised_Kernel_Learning.html">83 nips-2006-Generalized Maximum Margin Clustering and Unsupervised Kernel Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Siwei Lyu, Eero P. Simoncelli</p><p>Abstract: The local statistical properties of photographic images, when represented in a multi-scale basis, have been described using Gaussian scale mixtures (GSMs). Here, we use this local description to construct a global ﬁeld of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM). Speciﬁcally, we model subbands of wavelet coeﬃcients as a product of an exponentiated homogeneous Gaussian Markov random ﬁeld (hGMRF) and a second independent hGMRF. We show that parameter estimation for FoGSM is feasible, and that samples drawn from an estimated FoGSM model have marginal and joint statistics similar to wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. We develop an algorithm for image denoising based on the FoGSM model, and demonstrate substantial improvements over current state-ofthe-art denoising method based on the local GSM model. Many successful methods in image processing and computer vision rely on statistical models for images, and it is thus of continuing interest to develop improved models, both in terms of their ability to precisely capture image structures, and in terms of their tractability when used in applications. Constructing such a model is diﬃcult, primarily because of the intrinsic high dimensionality of the space of images. Two simplifying assumptions are usually made to reduce model complexity. The ﬁrst is Markovianity: the density of a pixel conditioned on a small neighborhood, is assumed to be independent from the rest of the image. The second assumption is homogeneity: the local density is assumed to be independent of its absolute position within the image. The set of models satisfying both of these assumptions constitute the class of homogeneous Markov random ﬁelds (hMRFs). Over the past two decades, studies of photographic images represented with multi-scale multiorientation image decompositions (loosely referred to as “wavelets”) have revealed striking nonGaussian regularities and inter and intra-subband dependencies. For instance, wavelet coeﬃcients generally have highly kurtotic marginal distributions [1, 2], and their amplitudes exhibit strong correlations with the amplitudes of nearby coeﬃcients [3, 4]. One model that can capture the nonGaussian marginal behaviors is a product of non-Gaussian scalar variables [5]. A number of authors have developed non-Gaussian MRF models based on this sort of local description [6, 7, 8], among which the recently developed ﬁelds of experts model [7] has demonstrated impressive performance in denoising (albeit at an extremely high computational cost in learning model parameters). An alternative model that can capture non-Gaussian local structure is a scale mixture model [9, 10, 11]. An important special case is Gaussian scale mixtures (GSM), which consists of a Gaussian random vector whose amplitude is modulated by a hidden scaling variable. The GSM model provides a particularly good description of local image statistics, and the Gaussian substructure of the model leads to eﬃcient algorithms for parameter estimation and inference. Local GSM-based methods represent the current state-of-the-art in image denoising [12]. The power of GSM models should be substantially improved when extended to describe more than a small neighborhood of wavelet coeﬃcients. To this end, several authors have embedded local Gaussian mixtures into tree-structured MRF models [e.g., 13, 14]. In order to maintain tractability, these models are arranged such that coeﬃcients are grouped in non-overlapping clusters, allowing a graphical probability model with no loops. Despite their global consistency, the artiﬁcially imposed cluster boundaries lead to substantial artifacts in applications such as denoising. In this paper, we use a local GSM as a basis for a globally consistent and spatially homogeneous ﬁeld of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM). Speciﬁcally, the FoGSM is formulated as the product of two mutually independent MRFs: a positive multiplier ﬁeld obtained by exponentiating a homogeneous Gaussian MRF (hGMRF), and a second hGMRF. We develop a parameter estimation procedure, and show that the model is able to capture important statistical regularities in the marginal and joint wavelet statistics of a photographic image. We apply the FoGSM to image denoising, demonstrating substantial improvement over the previous state-of-the-art results obtained with a local GSM model. 1 Gaussian scale mixtures A GSM random vector x is formed as the product of a zero-mean Gaussian random vector u and an d √ d independent random variable z, as x = zu, where = denotes equality in distribution. The density of x is determined by the covariance of the Gaussian vector, Σ, and the density of the multiplier, p z (z), through the integral Nx (0, zΣ)pz (z)dz ∝ p(x) = z z xT Σ−1 x 1 pz (z)dz. exp − √ 2z z|Σ| (1) A key property of GSMs is that when z determines the scale of the conditional variance of x given z, which is a Gaussian variable with zero mean and covariance zΣ. In addition, the normalized variable √ x z is a zero mean Gaussian with covariance matrix Σ. The GSM model has been used to describe the marginal and joint densities of local clusters of wavelet coeﬃcients, both within and across subbands [9], where the embedded Gaussian structure aﬀords simple and eﬃcient computation. This local GSM model has been be used for denoising, by independently estimating each coeﬃcient conditioned on its surrounding cluster [12]. This method achieves state-of-the-art performances, despite the fact that treating overlapping clusters as independent does not give rise to a globally consistent statistical model that satisﬁes all the local constraints. 2 Fields of Gaussian scale mixtures In this section, we develop ﬁelds of Gaussian scale mixtures (FoGSM) as a framework for modeling wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. Analogous to the local GSM model, we use a latent multiplier ﬁeld to modulate a homogeneous Gaussian MRF (hGMRF). Formally, we deﬁne a FoGSM x as the product of two mutually independent MRFs, √ d x = u ⊗ z, (2) where u is a zero-mean hGMRF, and z is a ﬁeld of positive multipliers that control the local coeﬃcient variances. The operator ⊗ denotes element-wise multiplication, and the square root operation is applied to each component. Note that x has a one-dimensional GSM marginal distributions, while its components have dependencies captured by the MRF structures of u and z. Analogous to the local GSM, when conditioned on z, x is an inhomogeneous GMRF p(x|z) ∝ √ 1 |Qu | exp − xT D z zi 2 i −1 Qu D √ z −1 x = 1 |Qu | exp − (x zi 2 i √ T z) Qu (x √ z) , (3) where Qu is the inverse covariance matrix of u (also known as the precision matrix), and D(·) denotes the operator that form a diagonal matrix from an input vector. Note also that the element√ wise division of the two ﬁelds, x z, yields a hGMRF with precision matrix Q u . To complete the FoGSM model, we need to specify the structure of the multiplier ﬁeld z. For tractability, we use another hGMRF as a substrate, and map it into positive values by exponentiation, x u log z Fig. 1. Decomposition of a subband from image “boat” (left) into the normalized subband u (middle) and the multiplier ﬁeld z (right, in the logarithm domain). Each image is rescaled individually to ﬁll the full range of grayscale intensities. as was done in [10]. To be more speciﬁc, we model log(z) as a hGMRF with mean µ and precision matrix Qz , where the log operator is applied element-wise, from which the density of z follows as: pz (z) ∝ |Qz | 1 exp − (log z − µ)T Qz (log z − µ) . zi 2 i (4) This is a natural extension of the univariate lognormal prior used previously for the scalar multiplier in the local GSM model [12]. The restriction to hGMRFs greatly simpliﬁes computation with FoGSM. Particularly, we take advantage of the fact that a 2D hGMRF with circular boundary handling has a sparse block-circulant precision matrix with a generating kernel θ specifying its nonzero elements. A block-circulant matrix is diagonalized by the Fourier transform, and its multiplication with a vector corresponds to convolution with the kernel θ. The diagonalizability with a ﬁxed and eﬃciently computed transform makes the parameter estimation, sampling, and inference with a hGMRF substantially more tractable than with a general MRF. Readers are referred to [15] for a detailed description of hGMRFs. Parameter estimation: The estimation of the latent multiplier ﬁeld z and the model parameters (µ, Qz , Qu ) may be achieved by maximizing log p(x, z; Q u, Qz , µ) with an iterative coordinate-ascent method, which is guaranteed to converge. Speciﬁcally, based on the statistical dependency structures in the FoGSM model, the following three steps are repeated until convergence: (i) z(t+1) = argmaxz log p(x|z; Q(t) ) + log p(z; Q(t) , µ(t) ) u z (ii) Q(t+1) = argmaxQu log p(x|z(t+1); Qu ) u (iii) (Q(t+1) , µ(t+1) ) = argmaxQz ,µ log p(z(t+1) ; Qz , µ) z (5) According to the FoGSM model structure, steps (ii) and (iii) correspond to maximum likelihood √ z(t+1) and log z(t+1) , respectively. Because of this, estimates of the parameters of hGMRFs, x both steps may be eﬃciently implemented by exploiting the diagonalization of the precision matrices with 2D Fourier transforms [15]. Step (i) in (5) may be implemented with conjugate gradient ascent [16]. To simplify description and computation, we introduce a new variable for the element-wise inverse square root of the multiplier: √ s=1 z. The likelihood in (3) is then changed to: p(x|s) ∝ i 1 si exp − (x ⊗ s)T Qu (x ⊗ s) = 2 i 1 si exp − sT D(x)Qu D(x)s . 2 (6) The joint density of s is obtained from (4), using the relations between densities of transformed variables, as 1 1 exp − (2 log s + µ)T Qz (2 log s + µ) . (7) p(s) ∝ si 2 i ˆ Combining . (6) and (7), step (i) in (5) is equivalent to computing s = argmaxs log p(x|s; Qu ) + log p(s; Qz , µ), which is further simpliﬁed into: argmin s 1 T 1 s D (x) Qu D (x) s + (2 log s + µ)T Qz (2 log s + µ) . 2 2 (8) boat house peppers x x x x log p(x) Barbara Fig. 2.

We the optimize (8) with conjugate gradient s ˆ ascent [16]. Speciﬁcally, the negative gradient of the objective function in (8) with respect to s is − ∂ log p(x|s)p(s) ∂s = D (x) Qu D (x) s + 2 D(s)−1 Qz (2 log s + µ) = x ⊗ (θu (x ⊗ s)) + 2(θz (2 log s + µ)) s, and the multiplication of any vector h with the Hessian matrix can be computed as: ∂2 log p(x|s)p(s) h = x ⊗ (θu (x ⊗ h)) + 4 (θz (h s)) s − 2 θz (log s + µ) ⊗ h (s ⊗ s). ∂s2 Both operations can be expressed entirely in terms of element-wise operations ( and ⊗) and 2D convolutions ( ) with the generating kernels of the two precision matrices θ u and θz , which allows for eﬃcient implementation. 3 Modeling photographic images We have applied the FoGSM model to subbands of a multi-scale image representation known as a steerable pyramid [17]. This decomposition is a tight frame, constructed from oriented multiscale derivative operators, and is overcomplete by a factor of 4K/3, where K is the number of orientation bands. Note that the marginal and joint statistics we describe are not speciﬁc to this decomposition, and are similar for other multi-scale oriented representations. We ﬁt a FoGSM model to each subband of a decomposed photographic image, using the algorithms described in the previous section. For precision matrices Q u and Qz , we assumed a 5 × 5 Markov neighborhood (corresponding to a 5 × 5 convolution kernel), which was loosely chosen to optimize the tradeoﬀ between accuracy and overﬁtting. Figure 1 shows the result of ﬁtting a FoGSM model to an example subband from the “boat” image (left panel). The subband is decomposed into the product of the u ﬁeld (middle panel) and the z ﬁeld (right panel, in the logarithm domain), along with model parameters Q u , µ and Qz (not shown). Visually, the changing spatial variances are represented in the estimated log z ﬁeld, and the estimated u is much more homogeneous than the original subband and has a marginal distribution close to Gaussian.1 However, the log z ﬁeld still has a non-Gaussian marginal distribution and is spatially inhomogeneous, suggesting limitations of FoGSM for modeling photographic image wavelet coeﬃcients (see Discussion). The statistical dependencies captured by the FoGSM model can be further revealed by examining marginal and joint statistics of samples synthesized with the estimated model parameters. A sample √ from FoGSM can be formed by multiplying samples of u and z. The former is obtained by sampling from hGMRF u, and the latter is obtained from the element-wise exponentiation followed by a element-wise square root operation of a sample of hGMRF log z. This procedure is again eﬃcient for FoGSM due to the use of hGMRFs as building blocks [15]. Marginal distributions: We start by comparing the marginal distributions of the samples and the original subband. Figure 2 shows empirical histograms in the log domain of a particular subband 1 This ”Gaussianizing” behavior was ﬁrst noted in photographic images by Ruderman [18], who observed that image derivative measurements that were normalized by a local estimate of their standard deviation had approximately Gaussian marginal distributions. close ∆ = 1 near ∆ = 4 far ∆ = 32 orientation scale real sim real sim Fig. 3.

See text for details. from four diﬀerent photographic images (blue dot-dashed line), and those of the synthesized samples of FoGSM models learned from each corresponding subband (red solid line). For comparison, a Gaussian with the same standard deviation as the image subband is also displayed (red dashed line). Note that the synthesized samples have conspicuous non-Gaussian characteristics similar to the real subbands, exempliﬁed by the high peak and heavy tails in the marginal distributions. On the other hand, they are typically less kurtotic than the real subbands. We believe this arises from the imprecise Gaussian approximation of log z (see Discussion). Joint distributions: In addition to one-dimensional marginal statistics, the FoGSM model is capable of capturing the joint behavior of wavelet coeﬃcients. As described in [4, 9], wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images present non-Gaussian dependencies. Shown in the ﬁrst and the third rows in Fig. 3 are empirical joint and conditional histograms for one subband of the “boat” image, for ﬁve pairs of coeﬃcients, corresponding to basis functions with spatial separations of ∆ = {1, 4, 32} samples, two orthogonal orientations and two adjacent scales. Contour lines in the joint histogram are drawn at equal intervals of log probability. Intensities in the conditional histograms correspond to probability, except that each column is independently rescaled to ﬁll the full range of intensity. For a pair of adjacent coeﬃcients, we observe an elliptical joint distribution and a “bow-tie” shaped conditional distribution. The latter is indicative of strong non-Gaussian dependencies. For coeﬃcients that are distant, the dependency becomes weaker and the corresponding joint and conditional histograms become more separable, as would be expected for two independent random variables. Random samples drawn from a FoGSM model, with parameters ﬁtted to the corresponding subband, have statistical characteristics consistent with the general description of wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. Shown in the second and the fourth rows of Fig. 3 are the joint and conditional histograms of synthesized samples from the FoGSM model estimated from the same subband as in the ﬁrst and the third rows. Note that the joint and conditional histograms of the synthesized samples have similar transition of spatial dependencies as the separation increases (column 1,2 and 3), suggesting that the FoGSM accounts well for pairwise joint dependencies of coeﬃcients over a full range of spatial separations. On the other hand, the dependencies between subbands of diﬀerent orientations and scales are not properly modeled by FoGSM (column 4 and 5). This is especially true for subbands at diﬀerent scales, which exhibit strong dependencies. The current FoGSM model original image noisy image (σ = 50) (PSNR = 14.15dB) GSM-BLS (PSNR = 26.34dB) FoGSM (PSNR = 27.01dB) Fig. 4. Denoising results using local GSM [12] and FoGSM.

In an overcomplete wavelet domain such as steerable pyramid, the white Gaussian noise is transformed into correlated Gaussian noise w ∼ N w (0, Σw ), whose covariance Σ w can be derived from the basis functions of the pyramid transform. With FoGSM as prior over x, commonly used denoising methods involve expensive high-dimensional integration: for instance, maximum ˆ a posterior estimate, x MAP = argmaxx log p(x|y), requires a high-dimensional integral over z, and ˆ the Bayesian least square estimation, x BLS = E(x|y) requires a double high-dimensional integral over x and z. Although it is possible to optimize with these criteria using Monte-Carlo Markov sampling or other approximations, we instead develop a more eﬃcient deterministic algorithm that takes advantage of the hGMRF structure in the FoGSM model. Speciﬁcally, we compute (ˆ , z, Qu , Qz , µ) = argmaxx,z,Qu ,Qz ,µ log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) x ˆ ˆ ˆ ˆ (9) ˆ and take x as the optimal denoised subband. Note that the model parameters are learned within the inference process rather than in a separate parameter learning step. This strategy, known as partial optimal solution [19], greatly reduces the computational complexity. We optimize (9) with coordinate ascent, iterating between maximizing each of (x, z, Q u , Qz , µ) while ﬁxing the others. With ﬁxed estimates of (z, Q u , Qz , µ), the optimization of x is argmaxx log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) = argmaxx log p(x|z, y; Q u, Qz , µ) + log p(z|y; Q u, Qz , µ) , which reduces to argmax x log p(x|z, y; Q u), with the second term independent of x and can be dropped from optimization. Given the Gaussian structure of x given z, this step is then equivalent to a Wiener ﬁlter (linear in y). Fixing (x, Q u , Qz , µ), the optimization of z is argmaxz log p(x, z|y; Q u, Qz , µ)= argmaxz log p(y|x, z; Q u)+log p(x, z; Q u, Qz , µ)−log p(y; Qu , Qz , µ) , which is further reduced to argmax z log p(x, z; Qu , Qz , µ). Here, the ﬁrst term was dropped since y is independent of z when conditioned on x. The last term was also dropped since it is also independent of z. Therefore, optimizing z given (x, Q u , Qz , µ) is equivalent to the ﬁrst step of the algorithm in section 2, which can be implemented with eﬃcient gradient descent. Finally, given (x, z), the FoGSM √ z(t+1) and log z(t+1) , similar to the model parameters (Q u , Qz , µ) are estimated from hGMRFs x second and third step in the algorithm of section 2. However, to reduce the overall computation time, instead of a complete maximum likelihood estimation, these parameters are estimated with a maximum pseudo-likelihood procedure [20], which ﬁnds the parameters maximizing the product of all conditional distributions (which are 1D Gaussians in the GMRF case), followed by a projection to the subspace of FoGSM parameters that results in positive deﬁnite precision matrices. We tested this denoising method on a standard set of test images [12]. The noise corrupted images were ﬁrst decomposed these into a steerable pyramid with multiple levels (5 levels for a 512 × 512 image and 4 levels for a 256 × 256 image ) and 8 orientations. We assumed a FoGSM model for each subband, with a 5 × 5 neighborhood for ﬁeld u and a 1 × 1 neighborhood for ﬁeld log z. These sizes were chosen to provide a reasonable combination of performance and computational eﬃciency. We then estimate the optimal x with the algorithm described previously, with the initial values of x and z computed from subband denoised with the local GSM model [12]. Shown in Fig. 4 is an example of denoising the “boat” image corrupted with simulated additive white Gaussian noise of strength σ = 50, corresponding to a peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR), of 14.15 dB. We compare this with the local GSM method in [12], which, assuming a local GSM model for the neighborhood consisting of 3 × 3 spatial neighbors plus parent in the next coarsest scale, computes a Bayes least squares estimate of each coeﬃcient conditioned on its surrounding neighborhood. The FoGSM denoising achieves substantial improvement (+0.68 in PSNR) and is seen to exhibit better contrast and continuation of oriented features (see Fig. 4). On the other hand, FoGSM introduces some noticeable artifacts in low contrast areas, which is caused by numerical instability at locations with small z. We ﬁnd that the improvement in terms of PSNR is consistent across photographic images and noise levels, as reported in Table 1. But even with a restricted neighborhood for the multiplier ﬁeld, this PSNR improvement does come at a substantial computational cost. As a rough indication, running on a PowerPC G5 workstation with 2.3 Ghz processor and 16 Gb RAM memory, using unoptimized MATLAB (version R14) code, denoising a 512 × 512 image takes on average 4.5 hours (results averaging over 5 images), and denoising a 256×256 image takes on average 2.4 hours (result averaging over 2 images), to a convergence precision producing the reported results. Our preliminary investigation indicates that the slow running time is mainly due to the nature of coordinate ascent and the landscape of (9), which requires many iterations to converge. 5 Discussion We have introduced ﬁelds of Gaussian scale mixtures as a ﬂexible and eﬃcient tool for modeling the statistics of wavelet coeﬃcients of photographic images. We developed a feasible (although admittedly computationally costly) parameter estimation method, and showed that samples synthesized from the ﬁtted FoGSM model are able to capture structures in the marginal and joint wavelet statistics of photographic images. Preliminary results of applying FoGSM to image denoising indicate substantial improvements over the state-of-the-art methods based on the local GSM model. Although FoGSM has a structure that is similar to the local scale mixture model [9, 10], there is a fundamental diﬀerence between them. In FoGSM, hGMRF structures are enforced in u and log z, while the local scale mixture models impose minimal statistical structure on these variables. Because of this, our model easily extends to images of arbitrary size, while the local scale mixture models are essentially conﬁned to describing small image patches (the curse of dimensionality, and the increase in computational cost prevent one from scaling the patch size up). On the other hand, the close relation to Gaussian MRF makes the analysis and computation of FoGSM signiﬁcantly easier than other non-Gaussian MRF based image models [6, 7, 5]. We envision, and are currently working on, a number of model improvements. First, the model should beneﬁt from the introduction of more general Markov neighborhoods, including wavelet coeﬃcients from subbands at other scales and orientations [4, 12], since the current model is clearly not accounting for these dependencies (see Fig. 3). Secondly, the log transformation used to derive the multiplier ﬁeld from a hGMRF is somewhat ad hoc, and we believe that substitution of another nonlinear transformation (e.g., a power law [14]) might lead to a more accurate description of the image statistics. Thirdly, the current denoising method estimates model parameter during the process of denoising, which produces image adaptive model parameters. We are exploring the possibility of using a set of generic model parameter learned a priori on a large set of photographic images, so that a generic statistical model for all photographic images based on FoGSM can be built. Finally, there exist residual inhomogeneous structures in the log z ﬁeld (see Fig. 1) that can likely be captured by explicitly incorporating local orientation [21] or phase into the model. Finding tractable models and algorithms for handling such circular variables is challenging, but we believe their inclusion will result in substantial improvements in modeling and in denoising performance. σ/PSNR 10/28.13 25/20.17 50/14.15 100/8.13 σ/PSNR 10/28.13 25/20.17 50/14.15 100/8.13 Barbara 35.01 (34.01) 30.10 (29.07) 26.40 (25.45) 23.01 (22.61) Flintstones 32.47 (31.78) 28.29 (27.48) 24.82 (24.02) 21.24 (20.49) barco 35.05 (34.42) 30.44 (29.73) 27.36 (26.63) 24.44 (23.84) house 35.63 (35.27) 31.64 (31.32) 28.51 (28.23) 25.33 (25.31) boat 34.12 (33.58) 30.03 (29.34) 27.01 (26.35) 24.20 (23.79) Lena 35.94 (35.60) 32.11 (31.70) 29.12 (28.62) 26.12 (25.77) ﬁngerprint 33.28 (32.45) 28.45 (27.44) 25.11 (24.13) 21.78 (21.21) peppers 34.38 (33.73) 29.78 (29.18) 26.43 (25.93) 23.17 (22.80) Table 1.

<p>Author: Oliver Williams</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a Gaussian process framework for inferring pixel-wise disparity and bi-layer segmentation of a scene given a stereo pair of images. The Gaussian process covariance is parameterized by a foreground-backgroundocclusion segmentation label to model both smooth regions and discontinuities. As such, we call our model a switched Gaussian process. We propose a greedy incremental algorithm for adding observations from the data and assigning segmentation labels. Two observation schedules are proposed: the ﬁrst treats scanlines as independent, the second uses an active learning criterion to select a sparse subset of points to measure. We show that this probabilistic framework has comparable performance to the state-of-the-art. 1</p><p>5 0.60076666 <a title="51-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Online_Clustering_of_Moving_Hyperplanes.html">153 nips-2006-Online Clustering of Moving Hyperplanes</a></p>
<p>Author: René Vidal</p><p>Abstract: We propose a recursive algorithm for clustering trajectories lying in multiple moving hyperplanes. Starting from a given or random initial condition, we use normalized gradient descent to update the coefﬁcients of a time varying polynomial whose degree is the number of hyperplanes and whose derivatives at a trajectory give an estimate of the vector normal to the hyperplane containing that trajectory. As time proceeds, the estimates of the hyperplane normals are shown to track their true values in a stable fashion. The segmentation of the trajectories is then obtained by clustering their associated normal vectors. The ﬁnal result is a simple recursive algorithm for segmenting a variable number of moving hyperplanes. We test our algorithm on the segmentation of dynamic scenes containing rigid motions and dynamic textures, e.g., a bird ﬂoating on water. Our method not only segments the bird motion from the surrounding water motion, but also determines patterns of motion in the scene (e.g., periodic motion) directly from the temporal evolution of the estimated polynomial coefﬁcients. Our experiments also show that our method can deal with appearing and disappearing motions in the scene.</p><p>6 0.53245223 <a title="51-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Similarity_by_Composition.html">174 nips-2006-Similarity by Composition</a></p>

<p>Author: Dong S. Cheng, Vittorio Murino, Mário Figueiredo</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to model-based clustering under prior knowledge. The proposed formulation can be interpreted from two different angles: as penalized logistic regression, where the class labels are only indirectly observed (via the probability density of each class); as ﬁnite mixture learning under a grouping prior. To estimate the parameters of the proposed model, we derive a (generalized) EM algorithm with a closed-form E-step, in contrast with other recent approaches to semi-supervised probabilistic clustering which require Gibbs sampling or suboptimal shortcuts. We show that our approach is ideally suited for image segmentation: it avoids the combinatorial nature Markov random ﬁeld priors, and opens the door to more sophisticated spatial priors (e.g., wavelet-based) in a simple and computationally efﬁcient way. Finally, we extend our formulation to work in unsupervised, semi-supervised, or discriminative modes. 1</p><p>2 0.87618512 <a title="51-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Analysis_of_Empirical_Bayesian_Methods_for_Neuroelectromagnetic_Source_Localization.html">32 nips-2006-Analysis of Empirical Bayesian Methods for Neuroelectromagnetic Source Localization</a></p>
<p>Author: Rey Ramírez, Jason Palmer, Scott Makeig, Bhaskar D. Rao, David P. Wipf</p><p>Abstract: The ill-posed nature of the MEG/EEG source localization problem requires the incorporation of prior assumptions when choosing an appropriate solution out of an inﬁnite set of candidates. Bayesian methods are useful in this capacity because they allow these assumptions to be explicitly quantiﬁed. Recently, a number of empirical Bayesian approaches have been proposed that attempt a form of model selection by using the data to guide the search for an appropriate prior. While seemingly quite different in many respects, we apply a unifying framework based on automatic relevance determination (ARD) that elucidates various attributes of these methods and suggests directions for improvement. We also derive theoretical properties of this methodology related to convergence, local minima, and localization bias and explore connections with established algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.873456 <a title="51-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Denoising_and_Dimension_Reduction_in_Feature_Space.html">65 nips-2006-Denoising and Dimension Reduction in Feature Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information about a classiﬁcation problem in feature space is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem. Thus, kernels not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved even by linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economic use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data to perform classiﬁcation. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the subspace and dimensionality relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to help in model selection, and to (3) de-noise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results. 1</p><p>4 0.86601734 <a title="51-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Recursive_ICA.html">167 nips-2006-Recursive ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghao Shan, Lingyun Zhang, Garrison W. Cottrell</p><p>Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular method for extracting independent features from visual data. However, as a fundamentally linear technique, there is always nonlinear residual redundancy that is not captured by ICA. Hence there have been many attempts to try to create a hierarchical version of ICA, but so far none of the approaches have a natural way to apply them more than once. Here we show that there is a relatively simple technique that transforms the absolute values of the outputs of a previous application of ICA into a normal distribution, to which ICA maybe applied again. This results in a recursive ICA algorithm that may be applied any number of times in order to extract higher order structure from previous layers. 1</p><p>5 0.8650279 <a title="51-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-PG-means%3A_learning_the_number_of_clusters_in_data.html">158 nips-2006-PG-means: learning the number of clusters in data</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Feng, Greg Hamerly</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel algorithm called PG-means which is able to learn the number of clusters in a classical Gaussian mixture model. Our method is robust and efﬁcient; it uses statistical hypothesis tests on one-dimensional projections of the data and model to determine if the examples are well represented by the model. In so doing, we are applying a statistical test for the entire model at once, not just on a per-cluster basis. We show that our method works well in difﬁcult cases such as non-Gaussian data, overlapping clusters, eccentric clusters, high dimension, and many true clusters. Further, our new method provides a much more stable estimate of the number of clusters than existing methods. 1</p><p>6 0.86465085 <a title="51-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Generalized_Maximum_Margin_Clustering_and_Unsupervised_Kernel_Learning.html">83 nips-2006-Generalized Maximum Margin Clustering and Unsupervised Kernel Learning</a></p>

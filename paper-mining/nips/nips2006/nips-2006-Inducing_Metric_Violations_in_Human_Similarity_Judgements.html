<p>Author: Amit Kagian, Gideon Dror, Tommer Leyvand, Daniel Cohen-or, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general. 1 I n trod u cti on Philosophers, artists and scientists have been trying to capture the nature of beauty since the early days of philosophy. Although in modern days a common layman's notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion, recent findings suggest that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness and that their preferences may be an innate part of the primary constitution of our nature. Several experiments have shown that 2 to 8 months old infants prefer looking at faces which adults rate as being more attractive [1]. In addition, attractiveness ratings show very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures [2]. Such findings give rise to the quest for common factors which determine human facial attractiveness. Accordingly, various hypotheses, from cognitive, evolutional and social perspectives, have been put forward to describe the common preferences for facial beauty. Inspired by Sir Francis Galton’s photographic method of composing faces [3], Rubenstein, Langlois and Roggman created averaged faces by morphing multiple images together and proposed that averageness is the answer for facial attractiveness [4, 5]. Human judges found these averaged faces to be attractive and rated them with attractiveness ratings higher than the mean rating of the component faces composing them. Grammer and Thornhill have investigated symmetry and averageness of faces and concluded that symmetry was more important than averageness in facial attractiveness [6]. Little and colleagues have agreed that average faces are attractive but claim that faces with certain extreme features, such as extreme sexually dimorphic traits, may be more attractive than average faces [7]. Other researchers have suggested various conditions which may contribute to facial attractiveness such as neonate features, pleasant expressions and familiarity. Cunningham and his associates suggest a multiple fitness model in which there is no single constructing line that determines attractiveness. Instead, different categories of features signal different desirable qualities of the perceived target [8]. Even so, the multiple fitness model agrees that some facial qualities are universally physically attractive to people. Apart from eliciting the facial characteristics which account for attractiveness, modern researchers try to describe underlying mechanisms for these preferences. Many contributors refer to the evolutionary origins of attractiveness preferences [9]-[11]. According to this view, facial traits signal mate quality and imply chances for reproductive success and parasite resistance. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that preferred features might not signal mate quality but that the “good taste” by itself is an evolutionary adaptation (individuals with a preference for attractiveness will have attractive offspring that will be favored as mates) [9]. Another mechanism explains attractiveness' preferences through a cognitive theory - a preference for attractive faces might be induced as a by-product of general perception or recognition mechanisms [5, 12]: Attractive faces might be pleasant to look at since they are closer to the cognitive representation of the face category in the mind. These cognitive representations are described as a part of a cognitive mechanism that abstracts prototypes from distinct classes of objects. These prototypes relate to average faces when considering the averageness hypothesis. A third view has suggested that facial attractiveness originates in a social mechanism, where preferences may be dependent on the learning history of the individual and even on his social goals [12]. Different studies have tried to use computational methods in order to analyze facial attractiveness. Averaging faces with morph tools was done in several cases (e.g. [5, 13]). In [14], laser scans of faces were put into complete correspondence with the average face in order to examine the relationship between facial attractiveness, age, and averageness. Another approach was used in [15] where a genetic algorithm, guided by interactive user selections, was programmed to evolve a “most beautiful” female face. [16] used machine learning methods to investigate whether a machine can predict attractiveness ratings by learning a mapping from facial images to their attractiveness scores. Their predictor achieved a significant correlation of 0.6 with average human ratings, demonstrating that facial beauty can be learned by a machine, at least to some degree. However, as human raters still do significantly outperform the predictor of [16], the challenge of constructing a facial attractiveness machine with human level evaluation accuracy has remained open. A primary goal of this study is to surpass these results by developing a machine which obtains human level performance in predicting facial attractiveness. Having accomplished this, our second main goal is to conduct a series of simulated psychophysical experiments and study the resemblance between human and machine judgments. This latter task carries two potential rewards: A. To determine whether the machine can aid in understanding the psychophysics of human facial attractiveness, capitalizing on the ready accessibility of the analysis of its inner workings, and B. To study whether learning an explicit operational ratings prediction task also entails learning implicit humanlike biases, at least for the case of facial attractiveness. 2 2.1 T h e f aci al trai n in g d atab as e: Acq u i s i ti on , p rep roces s i n g an d rep res en tati on Rating facial attractiveness The chosen database was composed of 91 facial images of American females, taken by the Japanese photographer Akira Gomi. All 91 samples were frontal color photographs of young Caucasian females with a neutral expression. All samples were of similar age, skin color and gender. The subjects’ portraits had no accessories or other distracting items such as jewelry. All 91 facial images in the dataset were rated for attractiveness by 28 human raters (15 males, 13 females) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive). Ratings were collected with a specifically designed html interface. Each rater was asked to view the entire set before rating in order to acquire a notion of attractiveness scale. There was no time limit for judging the attractiveness of each sample and raters could go back and adjust the ratings of already rated samples. The images were presented to each rater in a random order and each image was presented on a separate page. The final attractiveness rating of each sample was its mean rating across all raters. To validate that the number of ratings collected adequately represented the ``collective attractiveness rating'' we randomly divided the raters into two disjoint groups of equal size. For each facial image, we calculated the mean rating on each group, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean ratings of the two groups. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The mean correlation between two groups was 0.92 ( = 0.01). This corresponds well to the known level of consistency among groups of raters reported in the literature (e.g. [2]). Hence, the mean ratings collected are stable indicators of attractiveness that can be used for the learning task. The facial set contained faces in all ranges of attractiveness. Final attractiveness ratings range from 1.42 to 5.75 and the mean rating was 3.33 ( = 0.94). 2.2 Data preprocessing and representation Preliminary experimentation with various ways of representing a facial image have systematically shown that features based on measured proportions, distances and angles of faces are most effective in capturing the notion of facial attractiveness (e.g. [16]). To extract facial features we developed an automatic engine that is capable of identifying eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and head contour. In total, we measured 84 coordinates describing the locations of those facial features (Figure 1). Several regions are suggested for extracting mean hair color, mean skin color and skin texture. The feature extraction process was basically automatic but some coordinates needed to be manually adjusted in some of the images. The facial coordinates are used to create a distances-vector of all 3,486 distances between all pairs of coordinates in the complete graph created by all coordinates. For each image, all distances are normalized by face length. In a similar manner, a slopes-vector of all the 3,486 slopes of the lines connecting the facial coordinates is computed. Central fluctuating asymmetry (CFA), which is described in [6], is calculated from the coordinates as well. The application also provides, for each face, Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) values of hair color and skin color, and a measurement of skin smoothness. Figure 1: Facial coordinates with hair and skin sample regions as represented by the facial feature extractor. Coordinates are used for calculating geometric features and asymmetry. Sample regions are used for calculating color values and smoothness. The sample image, used for illustration only, is of T.G. and is presented with her full consent. Combining the distances-vector and the slopes-vector yields a vector representation of 6,972 geometric features for each image. Since strong correlations are expected among the features in such representation, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to these geometric features, producing 90 principal components which span the sub-space defined by the 91 image vector representations. The geometric features are projected on those 90 principal components and supply 90 orthogonal eigenfeatures representing the geometric features. Eight measured features were not included in the PCA analysis, including CFA, smoothness, hair color coordinates (HSV) and skin color coordinates. These features are assumed to be directly connected to human perception of facial attractiveness and are hence kept at their original values. These 8 features were added to the 90 geometric eigenfeatures, resulting in a total of 98 image-features representing each facial image in the dataset. 3 3.1 E xp eri men ts an d resu l ts Predictor construction and validation We experimented with several induction algorithms including simple Linear Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) (both linear as well as non-linear) and Gaussian Processes (GP). However, as the LS-SVM and GP showed no substantial advantage over Linear Regression, the latter was used and is presented in the sequel. A key ingredient in our methods is to use a proper image-features selection strategy. To this end we used subset feature selection, implemented by ranking the image-features by their Pearson correlation with the target. Other ranking functions produced no substantial gain. To measure the performance of our method we removed one sample from the whole dataset. This sample served as a test set. We found, for each left out sample, the optimal number of image-features by performing leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) on the remaining samples and selecting the number of features that minimizes the absolute difference between the algorithm's output and the targets of the training set. In other words, the score for a test example was predicted using a single model based on the training set only. This process was repeated n=91 times, once for each image sample. The vector of attractiveness predictions of all images is then compared with the true targets. These scores are found to be in a high Pearson correlation of 0.82 with the mean ratings of humans (P-value < 10 -23), which corresponds to a normalized Mean Squared Error of 0.39. This accuracy is a marked improvement over the recently published performance results of a Pearson correlation of 0.6 on a similar dataset [16]. The average correlation of an individual human rater to the mean correlations of all other raters in our dataset is 0.67 and the average correlation between the mean ratings of groups of raters is 0.92 (section 2.1). It should be noted that we tried to use this feature selection and training procedure with the original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures, ranking them by their correlation to the targets and selecting up to 300 best ranked features. This, however, has failed to produce good predictors due to strong correlations between the original geometric features (maximal Pearson correlation obtained was 0.26). 3.2 S i m i l a r i t y o f ma c h i n e a n d h u m a n j u d g m e n t s Each rater (human and machine) has a 91 dimensional rating vector describing its Figure 2: Distribution of mean Euclidean distance from each human rater to all other raters in the ratings space. The machine’s average distance form all other raters (left bar) is smaller than the average distance of each of the human raters to all others. attractiveness ratings of all 91 images. These vectors can be embedded in a 91 dimensional ratings space. The Euclidian distance between all raters (human and machine) in this space was computed. Compared with each of the human raters, the ratings of the machine were the closest, on average, to the ratings of all other human raters (Figure 2). To verify that the machine ratings are not outliers that fall out of clusters of human raters (even though their mean distance from the other ratings is small) we surrounded each of the rating vectors in the ratings space with multidimensional spheres of several radius sizes. The machine had more human neighbors than the mean number of neighbors of human raters, testifying that it does not fall between clusters. Finally, for a graphic display of machine ratings among human ratings we applied PCA to machine and human ratings in the rating space and projected all ratings onto the resulting first 2 and 3 principal components. Indeed, the machine is well placed in a mid-zone of human raters (Figure 3). 5 Machine 0 Machine 0 -4 -8 -5 7 5 0 -10 -10 -5 0 5 10 (a) 0 -7 -5 (b) Figure 3: Location of machine ratings among the 28 human ratings: Ratings were projected into 2 dimensions (a) and 3 dimensions (b) by performing PCA on all ratings and projecting them on the first principal components. The projected data explain 29.8% of the variance in (a) and 36.6% in (b). 3.3 Psychophysical experiments in silico A number of simulated psychophysical experiments reveal humanlike biases of the machine's performance. Rubenstein et al. discuss a morphing technique to create mathematically averaged faces from multiple face images [5]. They reported that averaged faces made of 16 and 32 original component images were rated higher in attractiveness than the mean attractiveness ratings of their component faces and higher than composites consisting of fewer faces. In their experiment, 32-component composites were found to be the most attractive. We used a similar technique to create averaged virtually-morphed faces with various numbers of components, nc, and have let the machine predict their attractiveness. To this end, coordinate values of the original component faces were averaged to create a new set of coordinates for the composite. These coordinates were used to calculate the geometrical features and CFA of the averaged face. Smoothness and HSV values for the composite faces were calculated by averaging the corresponding values of the component faces 1. To study the effect of nc on the attractiveness score we produced 1,000 virtual morph images for each value of n c between 2 and 50, and used our attractiveness predictor (section 3.1) to compute the attractiveness scores of the resulting composites. In accordance with the experimental results of [5], the machine manifests a humanlike bias for higher scores of averaged composites over their components’ mean score. Figure 4a, presenting these results, shows the percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite, for each number of components n c. As evident, the attractiveness rating of a composite surpasses a larger percent of its components’ ratings as nc increases. Figure 4a also shows the mean scores of 1,000 1 HSV values are converted to RGB before averaging composites and the mean scores of their components, for each n c (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]). Their actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1. As expected, the mean scores of the components images are independent of n c, while composites’ scores increase with nc. Mean values of smoothness and asymmetry of the composites are presented in Figure 4b. 0.4 Smoothness Asymmetry 0.8 0.2 0.75 0 -0.2 0.7 -0.4 0.65 -0.6 0.6 Fraction of less attractive components Composite's score (normalized) Components' mean score (normalized) 0.55 2 10 20 30 40 -0.8 50 -1 2 Number of components in composite 10 20 30 40 50 Number of components in composite (a) (b) Figure 4: Mean results over 1,000 composites made of varying numbers of image components: (a) Percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite accompanied with mean scores of composites and the mean scores of their components (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1).

Since blurring and smoothing of faces occur when faces are averaged together [5], the smooth complexion of composites may underlie the attractiveness of averaged composites. In our experiment, a preference for averageness is found even though our method of virtual-morphing does not produce the smoothening effect and the mean smoothness value of composites corresponds to the mean smoothness value in the original dataset, for all nc (see Figure 4b). Researchers have also suggested that averaged faces are attractive since they are exceptionally symmetric [18]. Figure 4b shows that the mean level of asymmetry is indeed highly correlated with the mean scores of the morphs (Pearson correlation of -0.91, P-value < 10 -19). However, examining the correlation between the rest of the features and the composites' scores reveals that this high correlation is not at all unique to asymmetry. In fact, 45 of the 98 features are strongly correlated with attractiveness scores (|Pearson correlation| > 0.9). The high correlation between these numerous features and attractiveness scores of averaged faces indicates that symmetry level is not an exceptional factor in the machine’s preference for averaged faces. Instead, it suggests that averaging causes many features, including both geometric features and symmetry, to change in a direction which causes an increase in attractiveness. It has been argued that although averaged faces are found to be attractive, very attractive faces are not average [18]. A virtual composite made of the 12 most attractive faces in the set (as rated by humans) was rated by the machine with a high score of 5.6 while 1,000 composites made of 50 faces got a maximum score of only 5.3. This type of preference resembles the findings of an experiment by Perrett et al. in which a highly attractive composite, morphed from only attractive faces, was preferred by humans over a composite made of 60 images of all levels of attractiveness [13]. Another study by Zaidel et al. examined the asymmetry of attractiveness perception and offered a relationship between facial attractiveness and hemispheric specialization [19]. In this research right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created by attaching each half of the face to its mirror image. Subjects were asked to look at left-left and right-right composites of the same image and judge which one is more attractive. For women’s faces, right-right composites got twice as many ‘more attractive’ responses than left-left composites. Interestingly, similar results were found when simulating the same experiment with the machine: Right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created from the extracted coordinates of each image and the machine was used to predict their attractiveness ratings (taking care to exclude the original image used for the chimeric composition from the training set, as it contains many features which are identical to those of the composite). The machine gave 63 out of 91 right-right composites a higher rating than their matching left-left composite, while only 28 left-left composites were judged as more attractive. A paired t-test shows these results to be statistically significant with P-value < 10 -7 (scores of chimeric composites are normally distributed). It is interesting to see that the machine manifests the same kind of asymmetry bias reported by Zaidel et al, though it has never been explicitly trained for that. 4 Di s cu s s i on In this work we produced a high quality training set for learning facial attractiveness of human faces. Using supervised learning methodologies we were able to construct the first predictor that achieves accurate, humanlike performance for this task. Our results add the task of facial attractiveness prediction to a collection of abstract tasks that has been successfully accomplished with current machine learning techniques. Examining the machine and human raters' representations in the ratings space identifies the ratings of the machine in the center of human raters, and closest, in average, to other human raters. The similarity between human and machine preferences has prompted us to further study the machine’s operation in order to capitalize on the accessibility of its inner workings and learn more about human perception of facial attractiveness. To this end, we have found that that the machine favors averaged faces made of several component faces. While this preference is known to be common to humans as well, researchers have previously offered different reasons for favoring averageness. Our analysis has revealed that symmetry is strongly related to the attractiveness of averaged faces, but is definitely not the only factor in the equation since about half of the image-features relate to the ratings of averaged composites in a similar manner as the symmetry measure. This suggests that a general movement of features toward attractiveness, rather than a simple increase in symmetry, is responsible for the attractiveness of averaged faces. Obviously, strictly speaking this can be held true only for the machine, but, in due of the remarkable ``humnalike'' behavior of the machine, it also brings important support to the idea that this finding may well extend also to human perception of facial attractiveness. Overall, it is quite surprising and pleasing to see that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases related to facial attractiveness. It is likely that while the machine learns the ratings in an explicit supervised manner, it also concomitantly and implicitly learns other basic characteristics of human facial ratings, as revealed by studying its</p><p>3 0.11172957 <a title="97-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-A_Nonparametric_Bayesian_Method_for_Inferring_Features_From_Similarity_Judgments.html">9 nips-2006-A Nonparametric Bayesian Method for Inferring Features From Similarity Judgments</a></p>
<p>Author: Daniel J. Navarro, Thomas L. Griffiths</p><p>Abstract: The additive clustering model is widely used to infer the features of a set of stimuli from their similarities, on the assumption that similarity is a weighted linear function of common features. This paper develops a fully Bayesian formulation of the additive clustering model, using methods from nonparametric Bayesian statistics to allow the number of features to vary. We use this to explore several approaches to parameter estimation, showing that the nonparametric Bayesian approach provides a straightforward way to obtain estimates of both the number of features used in producing similarity judgments and their importance. 1</p><p>4 0.092065401 <a title="97-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Theory_and_Dynamics_of_Perceptual_Bistability.html">192 nips-2006-Theory and Dynamics of Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>5 0.091965705 <a title="97-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Denoising_and_Dimension_Reduction_in_Feature_Space.html">65 nips-2006-Denoising and Dimension Reduction in Feature Space</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikio L. Braun, Klaus-Robert Müller, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: We show that the relevant information about a classiﬁcation problem in feature space is contained up to negligible error in a ﬁnite number of leading kernel PCA components if the kernel matches the underlying learning problem. Thus, kernels not only transform data sets such that good generalization can be achieved even by linear discriminant functions, but this transformation is also performed in a manner which makes economic use of feature space dimensions. In the best case, kernels provide efﬁcient implicit representations of the data to perform classiﬁcation. Practically, we propose an algorithm which enables us to recover the subspace and dimensionality relevant for good classiﬁcation. Our algorithm can therefore be applied (1) to analyze the interplay of data set and kernel in a geometric fashion, (2) to help in model selection, and to (3) de-noise in feature space in order to yield better classiﬁcation results. 1</p><p>6 0.090665706 <a title="97-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Emergence_of_conjunctive_visual_features_by_quadratic_independent_component_analysis.html">76 nips-2006-Emergence of conjunctive visual features by quadratic independent component analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Felix A. Wichmann, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Attempting to model human categorization and similarity judgements is both a very interesting but also an exceedingly difﬁcult challenge. Some of the difﬁculty arises because of conﬂicting evidence whether human categorization and similarity judgements should or should not be modelled as to operate on a mental representation that is essentially metric. Intuitively, this has a strong appeal as it would allow (dis)similarity to be represented geometrically as distance in some internal space. Here we show how a single stimulus, carefully constructed in a psychophysical experiment, introduces l2 violations in what used to be an internal similarity space that could be adequately modelled as Euclidean. We term this one inﬂuential data point a conﬂictual judgement. We present an algorithm of how to analyse such data and how to identify the crucial point. Thus there may not be a strict dichotomy between either a metric or a non-metric internal space but rather degrees to which potentially large subsets of stimuli are represented metrically with a small subset causing a global violation of metricity.</p><p>2 0.87242264 <a title="97-lsi-2" href="./nips-2006-A_Humanlike_Predictor_of_Facial_Attractiveness.html">4 nips-2006-A Humanlike Predictor of Facial Attractiveness</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Kagian, Gideon Dror, Tommer Leyvand, Daniel Cohen-or, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general. 1 I n trod u cti on Philosophers, artists and scientists have been trying to capture the nature of beauty since the early days of philosophy. Although in modern days a common layman's notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion, recent findings suggest that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness and that their preferences may be an innate part of the primary constitution of our nature. Several experiments have shown that 2 to 8 months old infants prefer looking at faces which adults rate as being more attractive [1]. In addition, attractiveness ratings show very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures [2]. Such findings give rise to the quest for common factors which determine human facial attractiveness. Accordingly, various hypotheses, from cognitive, evolutional and social perspectives, have been put forward to describe the common preferences for facial beauty. Inspired by Sir Francis Galton’s photographic method of composing faces [3], Rubenstein, Langlois and Roggman created averaged faces by morphing multiple images together and proposed that averageness is the answer for facial attractiveness [4, 5]. Human judges found these averaged faces to be attractive and rated them with attractiveness ratings higher than the mean rating of the component faces composing them. Grammer and Thornhill have investigated symmetry and averageness of faces and concluded that symmetry was more important than averageness in facial attractiveness [6]. Little and colleagues have agreed that average faces are attractive but claim that faces with certain extreme features, such as extreme sexually dimorphic traits, may be more attractive than average faces [7]. Other researchers have suggested various conditions which may contribute to facial attractiveness such as neonate features, pleasant expressions and familiarity. Cunningham and his associates suggest a multiple fitness model in which there is no single constructing line that determines attractiveness. Instead, different categories of features signal different desirable qualities of the perceived target [8]. Even so, the multiple fitness model agrees that some facial qualities are universally physically attractive to people. Apart from eliciting the facial characteristics which account for attractiveness, modern researchers try to describe underlying mechanisms for these preferences. Many contributors refer to the evolutionary origins of attractiveness preferences [9]-[11]. According to this view, facial traits signal mate quality and imply chances for reproductive success and parasite resistance. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that preferred features might not signal mate quality but that the “good taste” by itself is an evolutionary adaptation (individuals with a preference for attractiveness will have attractive offspring that will be favored as mates) [9]. Another mechanism explains attractiveness' preferences through a cognitive theory - a preference for attractive faces might be induced as a by-product of general perception or recognition mechanisms [5, 12]: Attractive faces might be pleasant to look at since they are closer to the cognitive representation of the face category in the mind. These cognitive representations are described as a part of a cognitive mechanism that abstracts prototypes from distinct classes of objects. These prototypes relate to average faces when considering the averageness hypothesis. A third view has suggested that facial attractiveness originates in a social mechanism, where preferences may be dependent on the learning history of the individual and even on his social goals [12]. Different studies have tried to use computational methods in order to analyze facial attractiveness. Averaging faces with morph tools was done in several cases (e.g. [5, 13]). In [14], laser scans of faces were put into complete correspondence with the average face in order to examine the relationship between facial attractiveness, age, and averageness. Another approach was used in [15] where a genetic algorithm, guided by interactive user selections, was programmed to evolve a “most beautiful” female face. [16] used machine learning methods to investigate whether a machine can predict attractiveness ratings by learning a mapping from facial images to their attractiveness scores. Their predictor achieved a significant correlation of 0.6 with average human ratings, demonstrating that facial beauty can be learned by a machine, at least to some degree. However, as human raters still do significantly outperform the predictor of [16], the challenge of constructing a facial attractiveness machine with human level evaluation accuracy has remained open. A primary goal of this study is to surpass these results by developing a machine which obtains human level performance in predicting facial attractiveness. Having accomplished this, our second main goal is to conduct a series of simulated psychophysical experiments and study the resemblance between human and machine judgments. This latter task carries two potential rewards: A. To determine whether the machine can aid in understanding the psychophysics of human facial attractiveness, capitalizing on the ready accessibility of the analysis of its inner workings, and B. To study whether learning an explicit operational ratings prediction task also entails learning implicit humanlike biases, at least for the case of facial attractiveness. 2 2.1 T h e f aci al trai n in g d atab as e: Acq u i s i ti on , p rep roces s i n g an d rep res en tati on Rating facial attractiveness The chosen database was composed of 91 facial images of American females, taken by the Japanese photographer Akira Gomi. All 91 samples were frontal color photographs of young Caucasian females with a neutral expression. All samples were of similar age, skin color and gender. The subjects’ portraits had no accessories or other distracting items such as jewelry. All 91 facial images in the dataset were rated for attractiveness by 28 human raters (15 males, 13 females) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive). Ratings were collected with a specifically designed html interface. Each rater was asked to view the entire set before rating in order to acquire a notion of attractiveness scale. There was no time limit for judging the attractiveness of each sample and raters could go back and adjust the ratings of already rated samples. The images were presented to each rater in a random order and each image was presented on a separate page. The final attractiveness rating of each sample was its mean rating across all raters. To validate that the number of ratings collected adequately represented the ``collective attractiveness rating'' we randomly divided the raters into two disjoint groups of equal size. For each facial image, we calculated the mean rating on each group, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean ratings of the two groups. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The mean correlation between two groups was 0.92 ( = 0.01). This corresponds well to the known level of consistency among groups of raters reported in the literature (e.g. [2]). Hence, the mean ratings collected are stable indicators of attractiveness that can be used for the learning task. The facial set contained faces in all ranges of attractiveness. Final attractiveness ratings range from 1.42 to 5.75 and the mean rating was 3.33 ( = 0.94). 2.2 Data preprocessing and representation Preliminary experimentation with various ways of representing a facial image have systematically shown that features based on measured proportions, distances and angles of faces are most effective in capturing the notion of facial attractiveness (e.g. [16]). To extract facial features we developed an automatic engine that is capable of identifying eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and head contour. In total, we measured 84 coordinates describing the locations of those facial features (Figure 1). Several regions are suggested for extracting mean hair color, mean skin color and skin texture. The feature extraction process was basically automatic but some coordinates needed to be manually adjusted in some of the images. The facial coordinates are used to create a distances-vector of all 3,486 distances between all pairs of coordinates in the complete graph created by all coordinates. For each image, all distances are normalized by face length. In a similar manner, a slopes-vector of all the 3,486 slopes of the lines connecting the facial coordinates is computed. Central fluctuating asymmetry (CFA), which is described in [6], is calculated from the coordinates as well. The application also provides, for each face, Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) values of hair color and skin color, and a measurement of skin smoothness. Figure 1: Facial coordinates with hair and skin sample regions as represented by the facial feature extractor. Coordinates are used for calculating geometric features and asymmetry. Sample regions are used for calculating color values and smoothness. The sample image, used for illustration only, is of T.G. and is presented with her full consent. Combining the distances-vector and the slopes-vector yields a vector representation of 6,972 geometric features for each image. Since strong correlations are expected among the features in such representation, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to these geometric features, producing 90 principal components which span the sub-space defined by the 91 image vector representations. The geometric features are projected on those 90 principal components and supply 90 orthogonal eigenfeatures representing the geometric features. Eight measured features were not included in the PCA analysis, including CFA, smoothness, hair color coordinates (HSV) and skin color coordinates. These features are assumed to be directly connected to human perception of facial attractiveness and are hence kept at their original values. These 8 features were added to the 90 geometric eigenfeatures, resulting in a total of 98 image-features representing each facial image in the dataset. 3 3.1 E xp eri men ts an d resu l ts Predictor construction and validation We experimented with several induction algorithms including simple Linear Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) (both linear as well as non-linear) and Gaussian Processes (GP). However, as the LS-SVM and GP showed no substantial advantage over Linear Regression, the latter was used and is presented in the sequel. A key ingredient in our methods is to use a proper image-features selection strategy. To this end we used subset feature selection, implemented by ranking the image-features by their Pearson correlation with the target. Other ranking functions produced no substantial gain. To measure the performance of our method we removed one sample from the whole dataset. This sample served as a test set. We found, for each left out sample, the optimal number of image-features by performing leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) on the remaining samples and selecting the number of features that minimizes the absolute difference between the algorithm's output and the targets of the training set. In other words, the score for a test example was predicted using a single model based on the training set only. This process was repeated n=91 times, once for each image sample. The vector of attractiveness predictions of all images is then compared with the true targets. These scores are found to be in a high Pearson correlation of 0.82 with the mean ratings of humans (P-value < 10 -23), which corresponds to a normalized Mean Squared Error of 0.39. This accuracy is a marked improvement over the recently published performance results of a Pearson correlation of 0.6 on a similar dataset [16]. The average correlation of an individual human rater to the mean correlations of all other raters in our dataset is 0.67 and the average correlation between the mean ratings of groups of raters is 0.92 (section 2.1). It should be noted that we tried to use this feature selection and training procedure with the original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures, ranking them by their correlation to the targets and selecting up to 300 best ranked features. This, however, has failed to produce good predictors due to strong correlations between the original geometric features (maximal Pearson correlation obtained was 0.26). 3.2 S i m i l a r i t y o f ma c h i n e a n d h u m a n j u d g m e n t s Each rater (human and machine) has a 91 dimensional rating vector describing its Figure 2: Distribution of mean Euclidean distance from each human rater to all other raters in the ratings space. The machine’s average distance form all other raters (left bar) is smaller than the average distance of each of the human raters to all others. attractiveness ratings of all 91 images. These vectors can be embedded in a 91 dimensional ratings space. The Euclidian distance between all raters (human and machine) in this space was computed. Compared with each of the human raters, the ratings of the machine were the closest, on average, to the ratings of all other human raters (Figure 2). To verify that the machine ratings are not outliers that fall out of clusters of human raters (even though their mean distance from the other ratings is small) we surrounded each of the rating vectors in the ratings space with multidimensional spheres of several radius sizes. The machine had more human neighbors than the mean number of neighbors of human raters, testifying that it does not fall between clusters. Finally, for a graphic display of machine ratings among human ratings we applied PCA to machine and human ratings in the rating space and projected all ratings onto the resulting first 2 and 3 principal components. Indeed, the machine is well placed in a mid-zone of human raters (Figure 3). 5 Machine 0 Machine 0 -4 -8 -5 7 5 0 -10 -10 -5 0 5 10 (a) 0 -7 -5 (b) Figure 3: Location of machine ratings among the 28 human ratings: Ratings were projected into 2 dimensions (a) and 3 dimensions (b) by performing PCA on all ratings and projecting them on the first principal components. The projected data explain 29.8% of the variance in (a) and 36.6% in (b). 3.3 Psychophysical experiments in silico A number of simulated psychophysical experiments reveal humanlike biases of the machine's performance. Rubenstein et al. discuss a morphing technique to create mathematically averaged faces from multiple face images [5]. They reported that averaged faces made of 16 and 32 original component images were rated higher in attractiveness than the mean attractiveness ratings of their component faces and higher than composites consisting of fewer faces. In their experiment, 32-component composites were found to be the most attractive. We used a similar technique to create averaged virtually-morphed faces with various numbers of components, nc, and have let the machine predict their attractiveness. To this end, coordinate values of the original component faces were averaged to create a new set of coordinates for the composite. These coordinates were used to calculate the geometrical features and CFA of the averaged face. Smoothness and HSV values for the composite faces were calculated by averaging the corresponding values of the component faces 1. To study the effect of nc on the attractiveness score we produced 1,000 virtual morph images for each value of n c between 2 and 50, and used our attractiveness predictor (section 3.1) to compute the attractiveness scores of the resulting composites. In accordance with the experimental results of [5], the machine manifests a humanlike bias for higher scores of averaged composites over their components’ mean score. Figure 4a, presenting these results, shows the percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite, for each number of components n c. As evident, the attractiveness rating of a composite surpasses a larger percent of its components’ ratings as nc increases. Figure 4a also shows the mean scores of 1,000 1 HSV values are converted to RGB before averaging composites and the mean scores of their components, for each n c (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]). Their actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1. As expected, the mean scores of the components images are independent of n c, while composites’ scores increase with nc. Mean values of smoothness and asymmetry of the composites are presented in Figure 4b. 0.4 Smoothness Asymmetry 0.8 0.2 0.75 0 -0.2 0.7 -0.4 0.65 -0.6 0.6 Fraction of less attractive components Composite's score (normalized) Components' mean score (normalized) 0.55 2 10 20 30 40 -0.8 50 -1 2 Number of components in composite 10 20 30 40 50 Number of components in composite (a) (b) Figure 4: Mean results over 1,000 composites made of varying numbers of image components: (a) Percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite accompanied with mean scores of composites and the mean scores of their components (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1).

Since blurring and smoothing of faces occur when faces are averaged together [5], the smooth complexion of composites may underlie the attractiveness of averaged composites. In our experiment, a preference for averageness is found even though our method of virtual-morphing does not produce the smoothening effect and the mean smoothness value of composites corresponds to the mean smoothness value in the original dataset, for all nc (see Figure 4b). Researchers have also suggested that averaged faces are attractive since they are exceptionally symmetric [18]. Figure 4b shows that the mean level of asymmetry is indeed highly correlated with the mean scores of the morphs (Pearson correlation of -0.91, P-value < 10 -19). However, examining the correlation between the rest of the features and the composites' scores reveals that this high correlation is not at all unique to asymmetry. In fact, 45 of the 98 features are strongly correlated with attractiveness scores (|Pearson correlation| > 0.9). The high correlation between these numerous features and attractiveness scores of averaged faces indicates that symmetry level is not an exceptional factor in the machine’s preference for averaged faces. Instead, it suggests that averaging causes many features, including both geometric features and symmetry, to change in a direction which causes an increase in attractiveness. It has been argued that although averaged faces are found to be attractive, very attractive faces are not average [18]. A virtual composite made of the 12 most attractive faces in the set (as rated by humans) was rated by the machine with a high score of 5.6 while 1,000 composites made of 50 faces got a maximum score of only 5.3. This type of preference resembles the findings of an experiment by Perrett et al. in which a highly attractive composite, morphed from only attractive faces, was preferred by humans over a composite made of 60 images of all levels of attractiveness [13]. Another study by Zaidel et al. examined the asymmetry of attractiveness perception and offered a relationship between facial attractiveness and hemispheric specialization [19]. In this research right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created by attaching each half of the face to its mirror image. Subjects were asked to look at left-left and right-right composites of the same image and judge which one is more attractive. For women’s faces, right-right composites got twice as many ‘more attractive’ responses than left-left composites. Interestingly, similar results were found when simulating the same experiment with the machine: Right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created from the extracted coordinates of each image and the machine was used to predict their attractiveness ratings (taking care to exclude the original image used for the chimeric composition from the training set, as it contains many features which are identical to those of the composite). The machine gave 63 out of 91 right-right composites a higher rating than their matching left-left composite, while only 28 left-left composites were judged as more attractive. A paired t-test shows these results to be statistically significant with P-value < 10 -7 (scores of chimeric composites are normally distributed). It is interesting to see that the machine manifests the same kind of asymmetry bias reported by Zaidel et al, though it has never been explicitly trained for that. 4 Di s cu s s i on In this work we produced a high quality training set for learning facial attractiveness of human faces. Using supervised learning methodologies we were able to construct the first predictor that achieves accurate, humanlike performance for this task. Our results add the task of facial attractiveness prediction to a collection of abstract tasks that has been successfully accomplished with current machine learning techniques. Examining the machine and human raters' representations in the ratings space identifies the ratings of the machine in the center of human raters, and closest, in average, to other human raters. The similarity between human and machine preferences has prompted us to further study the machine’s operation in order to capitalize on the accessibility of its inner workings and learn more about human perception of facial attractiveness. To this end, we have found that that the machine favors averaged faces made of several component faces. While this preference is known to be common to humans as well, researchers have previously offered different reasons for favoring averageness. Our analysis has revealed that symmetry is strongly related to the attractiveness of averaged faces, but is definitely not the only factor in the equation since about half of the image-features relate to the ratings of averaged composites in a similar manner as the symmetry measure. This suggests that a general movement of features toward attractiveness, rather than a simple increase in symmetry, is responsible for the attractiveness of averaged faces. Obviously, strictly speaking this can be held true only for the machine, but, in due of the remarkable ``humnalike'' behavior of the machine, it also brings important support to the idea that this finding may well extend also to human perception of facial attractiveness. Overall, it is quite surprising and pleasing to see that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases related to facial attractiveness. It is likely that while the machine learns the ratings in an explicit supervised manner, it also concomitantly and implicitly learns other basic characteristics of human facial ratings, as revealed by studying its</p><p>3 0.54334444 <a title="97-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-Large_Margin_Component_Analysis.html">105 nips-2006-Large Margin Component Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Lorenzo Torresani, Kuang-chih Lee</p><p>Abstract: Metric learning has been shown to signiﬁcantly improve the accuracy of k-nearest neighbor (kNN) classiﬁcation. In problems involving thousands of features, distance learning algorithms cannot be used due to overﬁtting and high computational complexity. In such cases, previous work has relied on a two-step solution: ﬁrst apply dimensionality reduction methods to the data, and then learn a metric in the resulting low-dimensional subspace. In this paper we show that better classiﬁcation performance can be achieved by unifying the objectives of dimensionality reduction and metric learning. We propose a method that solves for the low-dimensional projection of the inputs, which minimizes a metric objective aimed at separating points in different classes by a large margin. This projection is deﬁned by a signiﬁcantly smaller number of parameters than metrics learned in input space, and thus our optimization reduces the risks of overﬁtting. Theory and results are presented for both a linear as well as a kernelized version of the algorithm. Overall, we achieve classiﬁcation rates similar, and in several cases superior, to those of support vector machines. 1</p><p>4 0.45132741 <a title="97-lsi-4" href="./nips-2006-Context_Effects_in_Category_Learning%3A_An_Investigation_of_Four_Probabilistic_Models.html">58 nips-2006-Context Effects in Category Learning: An Investigation of Four Probabilistic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Michael Shettel, Michael P. Holmes</p><p>Abstract: Categorization is a central activity of human cognition. When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Speciﬁcally, when experimental subjects are shown an exemplar of some target category, the category prototype appears to be pulled toward the exemplar, and the prototypes of all nontarget categories appear to be pushed away. These push and pull effects diminish with experience, and likely reﬂect long-term learning of category boundaries. We propose and evaluate four principled probabilistic (Bayesian) accounts of context effects in categorization. In all four accounts, the probability of an exemplar given a category is encoded as a Gaussian density in feature space, and categorization involves computing category posteriors given an exemplar. The models differ in how the uncertainty distribution of category prototypes is represented (localist or distributed), and how it is updated following each experience (using a maximum likelihood gradient ascent, or a Kalman ﬁlter update). We ﬁnd that the distributed maximum-likelihood model can explain the key experimental phenomena. Further, the model predicts other phenomena that were conﬁrmed via reanalysis of the experimental data. Categorization is a key cognitive activity. We continually make decisions about characteristics of objects and individuals: Is the fruit ripe? Does your friend seem unhappy? Is your car tire ﬂat? When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Intuitive naturalistic scenarios in which context effects occur are easy to imagine. For example, if one lifts a medium-weight object after lifting a light-weight or heavy-weight object, the medium weight feels heavier following the light weight than following the heavy weight. Although the object-contrast effect might be due to fatigue of sensory-motor systems, many context effects in categorization are purely cognitive and cannot easily be attributed to neural habituation. For example, if you are reviewing a set of conference papers, and the ﬁrst three in the set are dreadful, then even a mediocre paper seems like it might be above threshold for acceptance. Another example of a category boundary shift due to context is the following. Suppose you move from San Diego to Pittsburgh and notice that your neighbors repeatedly describe muggy, somewhat overcast days as ”lovely.” Eventually, your notion of what constitutes a lovely day accommodates to your new surroundings. As we describe shortly, experimental studies have shown a fundamental link between context effects in categorization and long-term learning of category boundaries. We believe that context effects can be viewed as a reﬂection of a trial-to-trial learning, and the cumulative effect of these trial-to-trial modulations corresponds to what we classically consider to be category learning. Consequently, any compelling model of category learning should also be capable of explaining context effects. 1 Experimental Studies of Context Effects in Categorization Consider a set of stimuli that vary along a single continuous dimension. Throughout this paper, we use as an illustration circles of varying diameters, and assume four categories of circles deﬁned ranges of diameters; call them A, B, C, and D, in order from smallest to largest diameter. In a classiﬁcation paradigm, experimental subjects are given an exemplar drawn from one category and are asked to respond with the correct category label (Zotov, Jones, & Mewhort, 2003). After making their response, subjects receive feedback as to the correct label, which we’ll refer to as the target. In a production paradigm, subjects are given a target category label and asked to produce an exemplar of that category, e.g., using a computer mouse to indicate the circle diameter (Jones & Mewhort, 2003). Once a response is made, subjects receive feedback as to the correct or true category label for the exemplar they produced. Neither classiﬁcation nor production task has sequential structure, because the order of trial is random in both experiments. The production task provides direct information about the subjects’ internal representations, because subjects are producing exemplars that they consider to be prototypes of a category, whereas the categorization task requires indirect inferences to be made about internal representations from reaction time and accuracy data. Nonetheless, the ﬁndings in the production and classiﬁcation tasks mirror one another nicely, providing converging evidence as to the nature of learning. The production task reveals how mental representations shift as a function of trial-to-trial sequences, and these shifts cause the sequential pattern of errors and response times typically observed in the classiﬁcation task. We focus on the production task in this paper because it provides a richer source of data. However, we address the categorization task with our models as well. Figure 1 provides a schematic depiction of the key sequential effects in categorization. The horizontal line represents the stimulus dimension, e.g., circle diameter. The dimension is cut into four regions labeled with the corresponding category. The category center, which we’ll refer to as the prototype, is indicated by a vertical dashed line. The long solid vertical line marks the current exemplar—whether it is an exemplar presented to subjects in the classiﬁcation task or an exemplar generated by subjects in the production task. Following an experimental trial with this exemplar, category prototypes appear to shift: the target-category prototype moves toward the exemplar, which we refer to as a pull effect, and all nontarget-category prototypes move away from the exemplar, which we refer to as a push effect. Push and pull effects are assessed in the production task by examining the exemplar produced on the following trial, and in the categorization task by examining the likelihood of an error response near category boundaries. The set of phenomena to be explained are as follows, described in terms of the production task. All numerical results referred to are from Jones and Mewhort (2003). This experiment consisted of 12 blocks of 40 trials, with each category label given as target 10 times within a block. • Within-category pull: When a target category is repeated on successive trials, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves toward the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial, with respect to the true category prototype. Across the experiment, a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.524 is obtained, and remains fairly constant over trials. • Between-category push: When the target category changes from one trial to the next, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves away from the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial (or equivalently, from the prototype of the target category on the ﬁrst trial). Figure 2a summarizes the sequential push effects from Jones and Mewhort. The diameter of the circle produced on trial t is plotted as a function of the target category on trial t − 1, with one line for each of the four trial t targets. The mean diameter for each target category is subtracted out, so the absolute vertical offset of each line is unimportant. The main feature of the data to note is that all four curves have a negative slope, which has the following meaning: the smaller that target t − 1 is (i.e., the further to the left on the x axis in Figure 1), the larger the response to target t is (further to the right in Figure 1), and vice versa, reﬂecting a push away from target t − 1. Interestingly and importantly, the magnitude of the push increases with the ordinal distance between targets t − 1 and t. Figure 2a is based on data from only eight subjects and is therefore noisy, though the effect is statistically reliable. As further evidence, Figure 2b shows data from a categorization task (Zotov et al., 2003), where the y-axis is a different dependent measure, but the negative slope has the same interpretation as in Figure 2a. example Figure 1: Schematic depiction of sequential effects in categorization A B C D stimulus dimension C 0 B −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 −0.1 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation D 0.02 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label (b) humans: classification (d) KFU−distrib 0.08 D previous category label C D 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation response deviation C B (f) MLGA−distrib 0.08 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 B A previous category label 0.06 A (e) MLGA−local 0.08 0.06 A 0.04 (c) KFU−local 0.08 response deviation response deviation 0.06 response bias from (a) production task of Jones and Mewhort (2003), (b) classiﬁcation task of Zotov et al.

In quantitative estimation of push and pull effects, trial t is included in the data only if the response on trial t − 1 is correct. Thus, the effects follow trials in which no error feedback is given to the subjects, and therefore the adjustments are not due to explicit error correction. • Push and pull effects diminish over the course of the experiment. The magnitude of push effects can be measured by the slope of the regression lines ﬁt to the data in Figure 2a. The slopes get shallower over successive trial blocks. The magnitude of pull effects can be measured by the standard deviation (SD) of the produced exemplars, which also decreases over successive trial blocks. • Accuracy increases steadily over the course of the experiment, from 78% correct responses in the ﬁrst block to 91% in the ﬁnal block. This improvement occurs despite the fact that error feedback is relatively infrequent and becomes even less frequent as performance improves. 2 Four Models In this paper, we explore four probabilistic (Bayesian) models to explain data described in the previous section. The key phenomenon to explain turns out to be the push effect, for which three of the four models fail to account. Modelers typically discard the models that they reject, and present only their pet model. In this work, we ﬁnd it useful to report on the rejected models for three reasons. First, they help to set up and motivate the one successful model. Second, they include several obvious candidates, and we therefore have the imperative to address them. Third, in order to evaluate a model that can explain certain data, one needs to know the degree to which the the data constrain the space of models. If many models exist that are consistent with the data, one has little reason to prefer our pet candidate. Underlying all of the models is a generative probabilistic framework in which a category i is represented by a prototype value, di , on the dimension that discriminates among the categories. In the example used throughout this paper, the dimension is the diameter of a circle (hence the notation d for the prototype). An exemplar, E, of category i is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean di and variance vi , denoted E ∼ N (di , vi ). Category learning involves determining d ≡ {di }. In this work, we assume that the {vi } are ﬁxed and given. Because d is unknown at the start of the experiment, it is treated as the value of a random vector, D ≡ {Di }. Figure 3a shows a simple graphical model representing the generative framework, in which E is the exemplar and C the category label. To formalize our discussion so far, we adopt the following notation: P (E|C = c, D = d) ∼ N (hc d, vc ), (1) where, for the time being, hc is a unary column vector all of whose elements are zero except for element c which has value 1. (Subscripts may indicate either an index over elements of a vector, or an index over vectors. Boldface is used for vectors and matrices.) Figure 3: (a) Graphical model depicting selection of an exemplar, E, of a category, C, based on the prototype vector, D; (b) Dynamic version of model indexed by trials, t (a) D (b) C Dt-1 Ct-1 E Dt Ct Et-1 Et We assume that the prototype representation, D, is multivariate Gaussian, D ∼ N (Ψ, Σ), where Ψ and Σ encode knowledge—and uncertainty in the knowledge—of the category prototype structure. Given this formulation, the uncertainty in D can be integrated out: P (E|C) ∼ N (hc Ψ, hc ΣhT + vc ). c (2) For the categorization task, a category label can be assigned by evaluating the category posterior, P (C|E), via Bayes rule, Equation 1, and the category priors, P (C). In this framework, learning takes place via trial-to-trial adaptation of the category prototype distribution, D. In Figure 3b, we add the subscript t to each random variable to denote the trial, yielding a dynamic graphical model for the sequential updating of the prototype vector, Dt . (The reader should be attentive to the fact that we use subscripted indices to denote both trials and category labels. We generally use the index t to denote trial, and c or i to denote a category label.) The goal of our modeling work is to show that the sequential updating process leads to context effects, such as the push and pull effects discussed earlier. We propose four alternative models to explore within this framework. The four models are obtained via the Cartesian product of two binary choices: the learning rule and the prototype representation. 2.1 Learning rule The ﬁrst learning rule, maximum likelihood gradient ascent (MLGA), attempts to adjust the prototype representation so as to maximize the log posterior of the category given the exemplar. (The category, C = c, is the true label associated with the exemplar, i.e., either the target label the subject was asked to produce, or—if an error was made—the actual category label the subject did produce.) Gradient ascent is performed in all parameters of Ψ and Σ: ∆ψi = ψ ∂ log(P (c|e)) and ∂ψi ∆σij = σ ∂ log(P (c|e)), ∂σij (3) where ψ and σ are step sizes. To ensure that Σ remains a covariance matrix, constrained gradient 2 steps are applied. The constraints are: (1) diagonal terms are nonnegative, i.e., σi ≥ 0; (2) offdiagonal terms are symmetric, i.e., σij = σji ; and (3) the matrix remains positive deﬁnite, ensured σ by −1 ≤ σiijj ≤ 1. σ The second learning rule, a Kalman ﬁlter update (KFU), reestimates the uncertainty distribution of the prototypes given evidence provided by the current exemplar and category label. To draw the correspondence between our framework and a Kalman ﬁlter: the exemplar is a scalar measurement that pops out of the ﬁlter, the category prototypes are the hidden state of the ﬁlter, the measurement noise is vc , and the linear mapping from state to measurement is achieved by hc . Technically, the model is a measurement-switched Kalman ﬁlter, where the switching is determined by the category label c, i.e., the measurement function, hc , and noise, vc , are conditioned on c. The Kalman ﬁlter also allows temporal dynamics via the update equation, dt = Adt−1 , as well as internal process noise, whose covariance matrix is often denoted Q in standard Kalman ﬁlter notation. We investigated the choice of A and R, but because they did not impact the qualitative outcome of the simulations, we used A = I and R = 0. Given the correspondence we’ve established, the KFU equations—which specify Ψt+1 and Σt+1 as a function of ct , et , Ψt , and Σt —can be found in an introductory text (e.g., Maybeck, 1979). Change to a category prototype for each category following a trial of a given category. Solid (open) bars indicate trials in which the exemplar is larger (smaller) than the prototype. 2.2 prototype mvt.

To select the appropriate prototype given a current category c, we deﬁned the unary vector hc and applied hc as a linear transform on D. The identical operations can be performed in conjunction with a distributed representation of the prototype. But we step back momentarily to motivate the distributed representation. The localist representation suffers from a key weakness: it does not exploit interrelatedness constraints on category structure. The task given to experimental subjects speciﬁes that there are four categories, and they have an ordering; the circle diameters associated with category A are smaller than the diameters associated with B, etc. Consequently, dA < dB < dC < dD . One might make a further assumption that the category prototypes are equally spaced. Exploiting these two sources of domain knowledge leads to the distributed representation of category structure. A simple sort of distributed representation involves deﬁning the prototype for category i not as di but as a linear function of an underlying two-dimensional state-space representation of structure. In this state space, d1 indicates the distance between categories and d2 an offset for all categories. This representation of state can be achieved by applying Equation 1 and deﬁning hc = (nc , 1), where nc is the ordinal position of the category (nA = 1, nB = 2, etc.). We augment this representation with a bit of redundancy by incorporating not only the ordinal positions but also the reverse ordinal positions; this addition yields a symmetry in the representation between the two ends of the ordinal category scale. As a result of this augmentation, d becomes a three-dimensional state space, and hc = (nc , N + 1 − nc , 1), where N is the number of categories. To summarize, both the localist and distributed representations posit the existence of a hidden-state space—unknown at the start of learning—that speciﬁes category prototypes. The localist model assumes one dimension in the state space per prototype, whereas the distributed model assumes fewer dimensions in the state space—three, in our proposal—than there are prototypes, and computes the prototype location as a function of the state. Both localist and distributed representations assume a ﬁxed, known {hc } that specify the interpretation of the state space, or, in the case of the distributed model, the subject’s domain knowledge about category structure. 3 Simulation Methodology We deﬁned a one-dimensional feature space in which categories A-D corresponded to the ranges [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), and [4, 5), respectively. In the human experiment, responses were considered incorrect if they were smaller than A or larger than D; we call these two cases out-of-bounds-low (OOBL) and out-of-bounds-high (OOBH). OOBL and OOBH were treated as two additional categories, resulting in 6 categories altogether for the simulation. Subjects and the model were never asked to produce exemplars of OOBL or OOBH, but feedback was given if a response fell into these categories. As in the human experiment, our simulation involved 480 trials. We performed 100 replications of each simulation with identical initial conditions but different trial sequences, and averaged results over replications. All prototypes were initialized to have the same mean, 3.0, at the start of the simulation. Because subjects had some initial practice on the task before the start of the experimental trials, we provided the models with 12 initial trials of a categorization (not production) task, two for each of the 6 categories. (For the MLGA models, it was necessary to use a large step size on these trials to move the prototypes to roughly the correct neighborhood.) To perform the production task, the models must generate an exemplar given a category. It seems natural to draw an exemplar from the distribution in Equation 2 for P (E|C). However, this distribu- tion reﬂects the full range of exemplars that lie within the category boundaries, and presumably in the production task, subjects attempt to produce a prototypical exemplar. Consequently, we exclude the intrinsic category variance, vc , from Equation 2 in generating exemplars, leaving variance only via uncertainty about the prototype. Each model involved selection of various parameters and initial conditions. We searched the parameter space by hand, attempting to ﬁnd parameters that satisﬁed basic properties of the data: the accuracy and response variance in the ﬁrst and second halves of the experiment. We report only parameters for the one model that was successful, the MLGA-Distrib: ψ = 0.0075, σ = 1.5 × 10−6 for off-diagonal terms and 1.5 × 10−7 for diagonal terms (the gradient for the diagonal terms was relatively steep), Σ0 = 0.01I, and for all categories c, vc = 0.42 . 4 4.1 Results Push effect The phenomenon that most clearly distinguishes the models is the push effect. The push effect is manifested in sequential-dependency functions, which plot the (relative) response on trial t as a function of trial t − 1. As we explained using Figures 2a,b, the signature of the push effect is a negatively sloped line for each of the different trial t target categories. The sequential-dependency functions for the four models are presented in Figures 2c-f. KFU-Local (Figure 2c) produces a ﬂat line, indicating no push whatsoever. The explanation for this result is straightforward: the Kalman ﬁlter update alters only the variable that is responsible for the measurement (exemplar) obtained on that trial. That variable is the prototype of the target class c, Dc . We thought the lack of an interaction among the category prototypes might be overcome with KFU-Distrib, because with a distributed prototype representation, all of the state variables jointly determine the target category prototype. However, our intuition turned out to be incorrect. We experimented with many different representations and parameter settings, but KFU-Distrib consistently obtained ﬂat or shallow positive sloping lines (Figure 2d). MLGA-Local (Figure 2e) obtains a push effect for neighboring classes, but not distant classes. For example, examining the dashed magenta line, note that B is pushed away by A and C, but is not affected by D. MLGA-Local maximizes the likelihood of the target category both by pulling the classconditional density of the target category toward the exemplar and by pushing the class-conditional densities of the other categories away from the exemplar. However, if a category has little probability mass at the location of the exemplar, the increase in likelihood that results from pushing it further away is negligible, and consequently, so is the push effect. MLGA-Distrib obtains a lovely result (Figure 2f)—a negatively-sloped line, diagnostic of the push effect. The effect magnitude matches that in the human data (Figure 2a), and captures the key property that the push effect increases with the ordinal distance of the categories. We did not build a mechanism into MLGA-Distrib to produce the push effect; it is somewhat of an emergent property of the model. The state representation of MLGA-Distrib has three components: d1 , the weight of the ordinal position of a category prototype, d2 , the weight of the reverse ordinal position, and d3 , an offset. The last term, d3 , cannot be responsible for a push effect, because it shifts all prototypes equally, and therefore can only produce a ﬂat sequential dependency function. Figure 4 helps provide an intuition how d1 and d2 work together to produce the push effect. Each graph shows the average movement of the category prototype (units on the y-axis are arbitrary) observed on trial t, for each of the four categories, following presentation of a given category on trial t − 1. Positve values on the y axis indicate increases in the prototype (movement to the right in Figure 1), and negative values decreases. Each solid vertical bar represents the movement of a given category prototype following a trial in which the exemplar is larger than its current prototype; each open vertical bar represents movement when the exemplar is to the left of its prototype. Notice that all category prototypes get larger or smaller on a given trial. But over the course of the experiment, the exemplar should be larger than the prototype as often as it is smaller, and the two shifts should sum together and partially cancel out. The result is the value indicated by the small horizontal bar along each line. The balance between the shifts in the two directions exactly corresponds to the push effect. Thus, the model produce a push-effect graph, but it is not truly producing a push effect as was originally conceived by the experimentalists. We are currently considering empirical consequences of this simulation result. Figure 5 shows a trial-by-trial trace from MLGA-Distrib.

Like all of the other models, MLGA-Distrib readily produces a pull effect, which is shown in the movement of category prototypes in Figure 5e. More observably, a pull effect is manifested when two successive trials of the same category are positively correlated: when trial t − 1 is to the left of the true category prototype, trial t is likely to be to the left as well. In the human data, the correlation coefﬁcient over the experiment is 0.524; in the model, the coefﬁcient is 0.496. The explanation for the pull effect is apparent: moving the category prototype to the exemplar increases the category likelihood. Although many learning effects in humans are based on error feedback, the experimental studies showed that push and pull effects occur even in the absence of errors, as they do in MLGA-Distrib. The model simply assumes that the target category it used to generate an exemplar is the correct category when no feedback to the contrary is provided. As long as the likelihood gradient is nonzero, category prototypes will be shifted. Pull and push effects shrink over the course of the experiment in human studies, as they do in the simulation. Figure 5e shows a reduction in both pull and push, as measured by the shift of the prototype means toward or away from the exemplar. We measured the slope of MLGA-Distrib’s push function (Figure 2f) for trials in the ﬁrst and second half of the simulation. The slope dropped from −0.042 to −0.025, as one would expect from Figure 5e. (These slopes are obtained by combining responses from 100 replications of the simulation. Consequently, each point on the push function was an average over 6000 trials, and therefore the regression slopes are highly reliable.) A quantitative, observable measure of pull is the standard deviation (SD) of responses. As push and pull effects diminish, SDs should decrease. In human subjects, the response SDs in the ﬁrst and second half of the experiment are 0.43 and 0.33, respectively. In the simulation, the response SDs are 0.51 and 0.38. Shrink reﬂects the fact that the model is approaching a local optimum in log likelihood, causing gradients—and learning steps—to become smaller. Not all model parameter settings lead to shrink; as in any gradient-based algorithm, step sizes that are too large do not lead to converge. However, such parameter settings make little sense in the context of the learning objective. 4.3 Model predictions MLGA-Distrib produces greater pull of the target category toward the exemplar than push of the neighboring categories away from the exemplar. In the simulation, the magnitude of the target pull— measured by the movement of the prototype mean—is 0.105, contrasted with the neighbor push, which is 0.017. After observing this robust result in the simulation, we found pertinent experimental data. Using the categorization paradigm, Zotov et al. (2003) found that if the exemplar on trial t is near a category border, subjects are more likely to produce an error if the category on trial t − 1 is repeated (i.e., a pull effect just took place) than if the previous trial is of the neighboring category (i.e., a push effect), even when the distance between exemplars on t − 1 and t is matched. The greater probability of error translates to a greater magnitude of pull than push. The experimental studies noted a phenomenon termed snap back. If the same target category is presented on successive trials, and an error is made on the ﬁrst trial, subjects perform very accurately on the second trial, i.e., they generate an exemplar near the true category prototype. It appears as if subjects, realizing they have been slacking, reawaken and snap the category prototype back to where it belongs. We tested the model, but observed a sort of anti snap back. If the model made an error on the ﬁrst trial, the mean deviation was larger—not smaller—on the second trial: 0.40 versus 0.32. Thus, MLGA-Distrib fails to explain this phenomenon. However, the phenomenon is not inconsistent with the model. One might suppose that on an error trial, subjects become more attentive, and increased attention might correspond to a larger learning rate on an error trial, which should yield a more accurate response on the following trial. McLaren et al. (1995) studied a phenomenon in humans known as peak shift, in which subjects are trained to categorize unidimensional stimuli into one of two categories. Subjects are faster and more accurate when presented with exemplars far from the category boundary than those near the boundary. In fact, they respond more efﬁciently to far exemplars than they do to the category prototype. The results are characterized in terms of the prototype of one category being pushed away from the prototype of the other category. It seems straightforward to explain these data in MLGA-Distrib as a type of long-term push effect. 5 Related Work and Conclusions Stewart, Brown, and Chater (2002) proposed an account of categorization context effects in which responses are based solely on the relative difference between the previous and present exemplars. No representation of the category prototype is maintained. However, classiﬁcation based solely on relative difference cannot account for a diminished bias effects as a function of experience. A long-term stable prototype representation, of the sort incorporated into our models, seems necessary. We considered four models in our investigation, and the fact that only one accounts for the experimental data suggests that the data are nontrivial. All four models have principled theoretical underpinnings, and they space they deﬁne may suggest other elegant frameworks for understanding mechanisms of category learning. The successful model, MLDA-Distrib, offers a deep insight into understanding multiple-category domains: category structure must be considered. MLGA-Distrib exploits knowledge available to subjects performing the task concerning the ordinal relationships among categories. A model without this knowledge, MLGA-Local, fails to explain data. Thus, the interrelatedness of categories appears to provide a source of constraint that individuals use in learning about the structure of the world.

<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>6 0.40346584 <a title="97-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Subordinate_class_recognition_using_relational_object_models.html">185 nips-2006-Subordinate class recognition using relational object models</a></p>

<p>Author: Alborz Geramifard, Michael Bowling, Martin Zinkevich, Richard S. Sutton</p><p>Abstract: We present new theoretical and empirical results with the iLSTD algorithm for policy evaluation in reinforcement learning with linear function approximation. iLSTD is an incremental method for achieving results similar to LSTD, the dataefﬁcient, least-squares version of temporal difference learning, without incurring the full cost of the LSTD computation. LSTD is O(n2 ), where n is the number of parameters in the linear function approximator, while iLSTD is O(n). In this paper, we generalize the previous iLSTD algorithm and present three new results: (1) the ﬁrst convergence proof for an iLSTD algorithm; (2) an extension to incorporate eligibility traces without changing the asymptotic computational complexity; and (3) the ﬁrst empirical results with an iLSTD algorithm for a problem (mountain car) with feature vectors large enough (n = 10, 000) to show substantial computational advantages over LSTD. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.78082228 <a title="97-lda-2" href="./nips-2006-Inducing_Metric_Violations_in_Human_Similarity_Judgements.html">97 nips-2006-Inducing Metric Violations in Human Similarity Judgements</a></p>
<p>Author: Julian Laub, Klaus-Robert Müller, Felix A. Wichmann, Jakob H. Macke</p><p>Abstract: Attempting to model human categorization and similarity judgements is both a very interesting but also an exceedingly difﬁcult challenge. Some of the difﬁculty arises because of conﬂicting evidence whether human categorization and similarity judgements should or should not be modelled as to operate on a mental representation that is essentially metric. Intuitively, this has a strong appeal as it would allow (dis)similarity to be represented geometrically as distance in some internal space. Here we show how a single stimulus, carefully constructed in a psychophysical experiment, introduces l2 violations in what used to be an internal similarity space that could be adequately modelled as Euclidean. We term this one inﬂuential data point a conﬂictual judgement. We present an algorithm of how to analyse such data and how to identify the crucial point. Thus there may not be a strict dichotomy between either a metric or a non-metric internal space but rather degrees to which potentially large subsets of stimuli are represented metrically with a small subset causing a global violation of metricity.</p><p>3 0.77207267 <a title="97-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Context_Effects_in_Category_Learning%3A_An_Investigation_of_Four_Probabilistic_Models.html">58 nips-2006-Context Effects in Category Learning: An Investigation of Four Probabilistic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael C. Mozer, Michael Shettel, Michael P. Holmes</p><p>Abstract: Categorization is a central activity of human cognition. When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Speciﬁcally, when experimental subjects are shown an exemplar of some target category, the category prototype appears to be pulled toward the exemplar, and the prototypes of all nontarget categories appear to be pushed away. These push and pull effects diminish with experience, and likely reﬂect long-term learning of category boundaries. We propose and evaluate four principled probabilistic (Bayesian) accounts of context effects in categorization. In all four accounts, the probability of an exemplar given a category is encoded as a Gaussian density in feature space, and categorization involves computing category posteriors given an exemplar. The models differ in how the uncertainty distribution of category prototypes is represented (localist or distributed), and how it is updated following each experience (using a maximum likelihood gradient ascent, or a Kalman ﬁlter update). We ﬁnd that the distributed maximum-likelihood model can explain the key experimental phenomena. Further, the model predicts other phenomena that were conﬁrmed via reanalysis of the experimental data. Categorization is a key cognitive activity. We continually make decisions about characteristics of objects and individuals: Is the fruit ripe? Does your friend seem unhappy? Is your car tire ﬂat? When an individual is asked to categorize a sequence of items, context effects arise: categorization of one item inﬂuences category decisions for subsequent items. Intuitive naturalistic scenarios in which context effects occur are easy to imagine. For example, if one lifts a medium-weight object after lifting a light-weight or heavy-weight object, the medium weight feels heavier following the light weight than following the heavy weight. Although the object-contrast effect might be due to fatigue of sensory-motor systems, many context effects in categorization are purely cognitive and cannot easily be attributed to neural habituation. For example, if you are reviewing a set of conference papers, and the ﬁrst three in the set are dreadful, then even a mediocre paper seems like it might be above threshold for acceptance. Another example of a category boundary shift due to context is the following. Suppose you move from San Diego to Pittsburgh and notice that your neighbors repeatedly describe muggy, somewhat overcast days as ”lovely.” Eventually, your notion of what constitutes a lovely day accommodates to your new surroundings. As we describe shortly, experimental studies have shown a fundamental link between context effects in categorization and long-term learning of category boundaries. We believe that context effects can be viewed as a reﬂection of a trial-to-trial learning, and the cumulative effect of these trial-to-trial modulations corresponds to what we classically consider to be category learning. Consequently, any compelling model of category learning should also be capable of explaining context effects. 1 Experimental Studies of Context Effects in Categorization Consider a set of stimuli that vary along a single continuous dimension. Throughout this paper, we use as an illustration circles of varying diameters, and assume four categories of circles deﬁned ranges of diameters; call them A, B, C, and D, in order from smallest to largest diameter. In a classiﬁcation paradigm, experimental subjects are given an exemplar drawn from one category and are asked to respond with the correct category label (Zotov, Jones, & Mewhort, 2003). After making their response, subjects receive feedback as to the correct label, which we’ll refer to as the target. In a production paradigm, subjects are given a target category label and asked to produce an exemplar of that category, e.g., using a computer mouse to indicate the circle diameter (Jones & Mewhort, 2003). Once a response is made, subjects receive feedback as to the correct or true category label for the exemplar they produced. Neither classiﬁcation nor production task has sequential structure, because the order of trial is random in both experiments. The production task provides direct information about the subjects’ internal representations, because subjects are producing exemplars that they consider to be prototypes of a category, whereas the categorization task requires indirect inferences to be made about internal representations from reaction time and accuracy data. Nonetheless, the ﬁndings in the production and classiﬁcation tasks mirror one another nicely, providing converging evidence as to the nature of learning. The production task reveals how mental representations shift as a function of trial-to-trial sequences, and these shifts cause the sequential pattern of errors and response times typically observed in the classiﬁcation task. We focus on the production task in this paper because it provides a richer source of data. However, we address the categorization task with our models as well. Figure 1 provides a schematic depiction of the key sequential effects in categorization. The horizontal line represents the stimulus dimension, e.g., circle diameter. The dimension is cut into four regions labeled with the corresponding category. The category center, which we’ll refer to as the prototype, is indicated by a vertical dashed line. The long solid vertical line marks the current exemplar—whether it is an exemplar presented to subjects in the classiﬁcation task or an exemplar generated by subjects in the production task. Following an experimental trial with this exemplar, category prototypes appear to shift: the target-category prototype moves toward the exemplar, which we refer to as a pull effect, and all nontarget-category prototypes move away from the exemplar, which we refer to as a push effect. Push and pull effects are assessed in the production task by examining the exemplar produced on the following trial, and in the categorization task by examining the likelihood of an error response near category boundaries. The set of phenomena to be explained are as follows, described in terms of the production task. All numerical results referred to are from Jones and Mewhort (2003). This experiment consisted of 12 blocks of 40 trials, with each category label given as target 10 times within a block. • Within-category pull: When a target category is repeated on successive trials, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves toward the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial, with respect to the true category prototype. Across the experiment, a correlation coefﬁcient of 0.524 is obtained, and remains fairly constant over trials. • Between-category push: When the target category changes from one trial to the next, the exemplar generated on the second trial moves away from the exemplar generated on the ﬁrst trial (or equivalently, from the prototype of the target category on the ﬁrst trial). Figure 2a summarizes the sequential push effects from Jones and Mewhort. The diameter of the circle produced on trial t is plotted as a function of the target category on trial t − 1, with one line for each of the four trial t targets. The mean diameter for each target category is subtracted out, so the absolute vertical offset of each line is unimportant. The main feature of the data to note is that all four curves have a negative slope, which has the following meaning: the smaller that target t − 1 is (i.e., the further to the left on the x axis in Figure 1), the larger the response to target t is (further to the right in Figure 1), and vice versa, reﬂecting a push away from target t − 1. Interestingly and importantly, the magnitude of the push increases with the ordinal distance between targets t − 1 and t. Figure 2a is based on data from only eight subjects and is therefore noisy, though the effect is statistically reliable. As further evidence, Figure 2b shows data from a categorization task (Zotov et al., 2003), where the y-axis is a different dependent measure, but the negative slope has the same interpretation as in Figure 2a. example Figure 1: Schematic depiction of sequential effects in categorization A B C D stimulus dimension C 0 B −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 −0.1 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation D 0.02 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 A B C −0.1 D previous category label (b) humans: classification (d) KFU−distrib 0.08 D previous category label C D 0.06 0.04 0.04 response deviation response deviation C B (f) MLGA−distrib 0.08 0.02 0 −0.02 −0.04 −0.06 −0.08 B A previous category label 0.06 A (e) MLGA−local 0.08 0.06 A 0.04 (c) KFU−local 0.08 response deviation response deviation 0.06 response bias from (a) production task of Jones and Mewhort (2003), (b) classiﬁcation task of Zotov et al.

In quantitative estimation of push and pull effects, trial t is included in the data only if the response on trial t − 1 is correct. Thus, the effects follow trials in which no error feedback is given to the subjects, and therefore the adjustments are not due to explicit error correction. • Push and pull effects diminish over the course of the experiment. The magnitude of push effects can be measured by the slope of the regression lines ﬁt to the data in Figure 2a. The slopes get shallower over successive trial blocks. The magnitude of pull effects can be measured by the standard deviation (SD) of the produced exemplars, which also decreases over successive trial blocks. • Accuracy increases steadily over the course of the experiment, from 78% correct responses in the ﬁrst block to 91% in the ﬁnal block. This improvement occurs despite the fact that error feedback is relatively infrequent and becomes even less frequent as performance improves. 2 Four Models In this paper, we explore four probabilistic (Bayesian) models to explain data described in the previous section. The key phenomenon to explain turns out to be the push effect, for which three of the four models fail to account. Modelers typically discard the models that they reject, and present only their pet model. In this work, we ﬁnd it useful to report on the rejected models for three reasons. First, they help to set up and motivate the one successful model. Second, they include several obvious candidates, and we therefore have the imperative to address them. Third, in order to evaluate a model that can explain certain data, one needs to know the degree to which the the data constrain the space of models. If many models exist that are consistent with the data, one has little reason to prefer our pet candidate. Underlying all of the models is a generative probabilistic framework in which a category i is represented by a prototype value, di , on the dimension that discriminates among the categories. In the example used throughout this paper, the dimension is the diameter of a circle (hence the notation d for the prototype). An exemplar, E, of category i is drawn from a Gaussian distribution with mean di and variance vi , denoted E ∼ N (di , vi ). Category learning involves determining d ≡ {di }. In this work, we assume that the {vi } are ﬁxed and given. Because d is unknown at the start of the experiment, it is treated as the value of a random vector, D ≡ {Di }. Figure 3a shows a simple graphical model representing the generative framework, in which E is the exemplar and C the category label. To formalize our discussion so far, we adopt the following notation: P (E|C = c, D = d) ∼ N (hc d, vc ), (1) where, for the time being, hc is a unary column vector all of whose elements are zero except for element c which has value 1. (Subscripts may indicate either an index over elements of a vector, or an index over vectors. Boldface is used for vectors and matrices.) Figure 3: (a) Graphical model depicting selection of an exemplar, E, of a category, C, based on the prototype vector, D; (b) Dynamic version of model indexed by trials, t (a) D (b) C Dt-1 Ct-1 E Dt Ct Et-1 Et We assume that the prototype representation, D, is multivariate Gaussian, D ∼ N (Ψ, Σ), where Ψ and Σ encode knowledge—and uncertainty in the knowledge—of the category prototype structure. Given this formulation, the uncertainty in D can be integrated out: P (E|C) ∼ N (hc Ψ, hc ΣhT + vc ). c (2) For the categorization task, a category label can be assigned by evaluating the category posterior, P (C|E), via Bayes rule, Equation 1, and the category priors, P (C). In this framework, learning takes place via trial-to-trial adaptation of the category prototype distribution, D. In Figure 3b, we add the subscript t to each random variable to denote the trial, yielding a dynamic graphical model for the sequential updating of the prototype vector, Dt . (The reader should be attentive to the fact that we use subscripted indices to denote both trials and category labels. We generally use the index t to denote trial, and c or i to denote a category label.) The goal of our modeling work is to show that the sequential updating process leads to context effects, such as the push and pull effects discussed earlier. We propose four alternative models to explore within this framework. The four models are obtained via the Cartesian product of two binary choices: the learning rule and the prototype representation. 2.1 Learning rule The ﬁrst learning rule, maximum likelihood gradient ascent (MLGA), attempts to adjust the prototype representation so as to maximize the log posterior of the category given the exemplar. (The category, C = c, is the true label associated with the exemplar, i.e., either the target label the subject was asked to produce, or—if an error was made—the actual category label the subject did produce.) Gradient ascent is performed in all parameters of Ψ and Σ: ∆ψi = ψ ∂ log(P (c|e)) and ∂ψi ∆σij = σ ∂ log(P (c|e)), ∂σij (3) where ψ and σ are step sizes. To ensure that Σ remains a covariance matrix, constrained gradient 2 steps are applied. The constraints are: (1) diagonal terms are nonnegative, i.e., σi ≥ 0; (2) offdiagonal terms are symmetric, i.e., σij = σji ; and (3) the matrix remains positive deﬁnite, ensured σ by −1 ≤ σiijj ≤ 1. σ The second learning rule, a Kalman ﬁlter update (KFU), reestimates the uncertainty distribution of the prototypes given evidence provided by the current exemplar and category label. To draw the correspondence between our framework and a Kalman ﬁlter: the exemplar is a scalar measurement that pops out of the ﬁlter, the category prototypes are the hidden state of the ﬁlter, the measurement noise is vc , and the linear mapping from state to measurement is achieved by hc . Technically, the model is a measurement-switched Kalman ﬁlter, where the switching is determined by the category label c, i.e., the measurement function, hc , and noise, vc , are conditioned on c. The Kalman ﬁlter also allows temporal dynamics via the update equation, dt = Adt−1 , as well as internal process noise, whose covariance matrix is often denoted Q in standard Kalman ﬁlter notation. We investigated the choice of A and R, but because they did not impact the qualitative outcome of the simulations, we used A = I and R = 0. Given the correspondence we’ve established, the KFU equations—which specify Ψt+1 and Σt+1 as a function of ct , et , Ψt , and Σt —can be found in an introductory text (e.g., Maybeck, 1979). Change to a category prototype for each category following a trial of a given category. Solid (open) bars indicate trials in which the exemplar is larger (smaller) than the prototype. 2.2 prototype mvt.

To select the appropriate prototype given a current category c, we deﬁned the unary vector hc and applied hc as a linear transform on D. The identical operations can be performed in conjunction with a distributed representation of the prototype. But we step back momentarily to motivate the distributed representation. The localist representation suffers from a key weakness: it does not exploit interrelatedness constraints on category structure. The task given to experimental subjects speciﬁes that there are four categories, and they have an ordering; the circle diameters associated with category A are smaller than the diameters associated with B, etc. Consequently, dA < dB < dC < dD . One might make a further assumption that the category prototypes are equally spaced. Exploiting these two sources of domain knowledge leads to the distributed representation of category structure. A simple sort of distributed representation involves deﬁning the prototype for category i not as di but as a linear function of an underlying two-dimensional state-space representation of structure. In this state space, d1 indicates the distance between categories and d2 an offset for all categories. This representation of state can be achieved by applying Equation 1 and deﬁning hc = (nc , 1), where nc is the ordinal position of the category (nA = 1, nB = 2, etc.). We augment this representation with a bit of redundancy by incorporating not only the ordinal positions but also the reverse ordinal positions; this addition yields a symmetry in the representation between the two ends of the ordinal category scale. As a result of this augmentation, d becomes a three-dimensional state space, and hc = (nc , N + 1 − nc , 1), where N is the number of categories. To summarize, both the localist and distributed representations posit the existence of a hidden-state space—unknown at the start of learning—that speciﬁes category prototypes. The localist model assumes one dimension in the state space per prototype, whereas the distributed model assumes fewer dimensions in the state space—three, in our proposal—than there are prototypes, and computes the prototype location as a function of the state. Both localist and distributed representations assume a ﬁxed, known {hc } that specify the interpretation of the state space, or, in the case of the distributed model, the subject’s domain knowledge about category structure. 3 Simulation Methodology We deﬁned a one-dimensional feature space in which categories A-D corresponded to the ranges [1, 2), [2, 3), [3, 4), and [4, 5), respectively. In the human experiment, responses were considered incorrect if they were smaller than A or larger than D; we call these two cases out-of-bounds-low (OOBL) and out-of-bounds-high (OOBH). OOBL and OOBH were treated as two additional categories, resulting in 6 categories altogether for the simulation. Subjects and the model were never asked to produce exemplars of OOBL or OOBH, but feedback was given if a response fell into these categories. As in the human experiment, our simulation involved 480 trials. We performed 100 replications of each simulation with identical initial conditions but different trial sequences, and averaged results over replications. All prototypes were initialized to have the same mean, 3.0, at the start of the simulation. Because subjects had some initial practice on the task before the start of the experimental trials, we provided the models with 12 initial trials of a categorization (not production) task, two for each of the 6 categories. (For the MLGA models, it was necessary to use a large step size on these trials to move the prototypes to roughly the correct neighborhood.) To perform the production task, the models must generate an exemplar given a category. It seems natural to draw an exemplar from the distribution in Equation 2 for P (E|C). However, this distribu- tion reﬂects the full range of exemplars that lie within the category boundaries, and presumably in the production task, subjects attempt to produce a prototypical exemplar. Consequently, we exclude the intrinsic category variance, vc , from Equation 2 in generating exemplars, leaving variance only via uncertainty about the prototype. Each model involved selection of various parameters and initial conditions. We searched the parameter space by hand, attempting to ﬁnd parameters that satisﬁed basic properties of the data: the accuracy and response variance in the ﬁrst and second halves of the experiment. We report only parameters for the one model that was successful, the MLGA-Distrib: ψ = 0.0075, σ = 1.5 × 10−6 for off-diagonal terms and 1.5 × 10−7 for diagonal terms (the gradient for the diagonal terms was relatively steep), Σ0 = 0.01I, and for all categories c, vc = 0.42 . 4 4.1 Results Push effect The phenomenon that most clearly distinguishes the models is the push effect. The push effect is manifested in sequential-dependency functions, which plot the (relative) response on trial t as a function of trial t − 1. As we explained using Figures 2a,b, the signature of the push effect is a negatively sloped line for each of the different trial t target categories. The sequential-dependency functions for the four models are presented in Figures 2c-f. KFU-Local (Figure 2c) produces a ﬂat line, indicating no push whatsoever. The explanation for this result is straightforward: the Kalman ﬁlter update alters only the variable that is responsible for the measurement (exemplar) obtained on that trial. That variable is the prototype of the target class c, Dc . We thought the lack of an interaction among the category prototypes might be overcome with KFU-Distrib, because with a distributed prototype representation, all of the state variables jointly determine the target category prototype. However, our intuition turned out to be incorrect. We experimented with many different representations and parameter settings, but KFU-Distrib consistently obtained ﬂat or shallow positive sloping lines (Figure 2d). MLGA-Local (Figure 2e) obtains a push effect for neighboring classes, but not distant classes. For example, examining the dashed magenta line, note that B is pushed away by A and C, but is not affected by D. MLGA-Local maximizes the likelihood of the target category both by pulling the classconditional density of the target category toward the exemplar and by pushing the class-conditional densities of the other categories away from the exemplar. However, if a category has little probability mass at the location of the exemplar, the increase in likelihood that results from pushing it further away is negligible, and consequently, so is the push effect. MLGA-Distrib obtains a lovely result (Figure 2f)—a negatively-sloped line, diagnostic of the push effect. The effect magnitude matches that in the human data (Figure 2a), and captures the key property that the push effect increases with the ordinal distance of the categories. We did not build a mechanism into MLGA-Distrib to produce the push effect; it is somewhat of an emergent property of the model. The state representation of MLGA-Distrib has three components: d1 , the weight of the ordinal position of a category prototype, d2 , the weight of the reverse ordinal position, and d3 , an offset. The last term, d3 , cannot be responsible for a push effect, because it shifts all prototypes equally, and therefore can only produce a ﬂat sequential dependency function. Figure 4 helps provide an intuition how d1 and d2 work together to produce the push effect. Each graph shows the average movement of the category prototype (units on the y-axis are arbitrary) observed on trial t, for each of the four categories, following presentation of a given category on trial t − 1. Positve values on the y axis indicate increases in the prototype (movement to the right in Figure 1), and negative values decreases. Each solid vertical bar represents the movement of a given category prototype following a trial in which the exemplar is larger than its current prototype; each open vertical bar represents movement when the exemplar is to the left of its prototype. Notice that all category prototypes get larger or smaller on a given trial. But over the course of the experiment, the exemplar should be larger than the prototype as often as it is smaller, and the two shifts should sum together and partially cancel out. The result is the value indicated by the small horizontal bar along each line. The balance between the shifts in the two directions exactly corresponds to the push effect. Thus, the model produce a push-effect graph, but it is not truly producing a push effect as was originally conceived by the experimentalists.

Like all of the other models, MLGA-Distrib readily produces a pull effect, which is shown in the movement of category prototypes in Figure 5e. More observably, a pull effect is manifested when two successive trials of the same category are positively correlated: when trial t − 1 is to the left of the true category prototype, trial t is likely to be to the left as well. In the human data, the correlation coefﬁcient over the experiment is 0.524; in the model, the coefﬁcient is 0.496. The explanation for the pull effect is apparent: moving the category prototype to the exemplar increases the category likelihood. Although many learning effects in humans are based on error feedback, the experimental studies showed that push and pull effects occur even in the absence of errors, as they do in MLGA-Distrib. The model simply assumes that the target category it used to generate an exemplar is the correct category when no feedback to the contrary is provided. As long as the likelihood gradient is nonzero, category prototypes will be shifted. Pull and push effects shrink over the course of the experiment in human studies, as they do in the simulation. Figure 5e shows a reduction in both pull and push, as measured by the shift of the prototype means toward or away from the exemplar. We measured the slope of MLGA-Distrib’s push function (Figure 2f) for trials in the ﬁrst and second half of the simulation. The slope dropped from −0.042 to −0.025, as one would expect from Figure 5e. (These slopes are obtained by combining responses from 100 replications of the simulation. Consequently, each point on the push function was an average over 6000 trials, and therefore the regression slopes are highly reliable.) A quantitative, observable measure of pull is the standard deviation (SD) of responses. As push and pull effects diminish, SDs should decrease. In human subjects, the response SDs in the ﬁrst and second half of the experiment are 0.43 and 0.33, respectively. In the simulation, the response SDs are 0.51 and 0.38. Shrink reﬂects the fact that the model is approaching a local optimum in log likelihood, causing gradients—and learning steps—to become smaller. Not all model parameter settings lead to shrink; as in any gradient-based algorithm, step sizes that are too large do not lead to converge. However, such parameter settings make little sense in the context of the learning objective. 4.3 Model predictions MLGA-Distrib produces greater pull of the target category toward the exemplar than push of the neighboring categories away from the exemplar. In the simulation, the magnitude of the target pull— measured by the movement of the prototype mean—is 0.105, contrasted with the neighbor push, which is 0.017. After observing this robust result in the simulation, we found pertinent experimental data. Using the categorization paradigm, Zotov et al. (2003) found that if the exemplar on trial t is near a category border, subjects are more likely to produce an error if the category on trial t − 1 is repeated (i.e., a pull effect just took place) than if the previous trial is of the neighboring category (i.e., a push effect), even when the distance between exemplars on t − 1 and t is matched. The greater probability of error translates to a greater magnitude of pull than push. The experimental studies noted a phenomenon termed snap back. If the same target category is presented on successive trials, and an error is made on the ﬁrst trial, subjects perform very accurately on the second trial, i.e., they generate an exemplar near the true category prototype. It appears as if subjects, realizing they have been slacking, reawaken and snap the category prototype back to where it belongs. We tested the model, but observed a sort of anti snap back. If the model made an error on the ﬁrst trial, the mean deviation was larger—not smaller—on the second trial: 0.40 versus 0.32. Thus, MLGA-Distrib fails to explain this phenomenon. However, the phenomenon is not inconsistent with the model. One might suppose that on an error trial, subjects become more attentive, and increased attention might correspond to a larger learning rate on an error trial, which should yield a more accurate response on the following trial. McLaren et al. (1995) studied a phenomenon in humans known as peak shift, in which subjects are trained to categorize unidimensional stimuli into one of two categories. Subjects are faster and more accurate when presented with exemplars far from the category boundary than those near the boundary. In fact, they respond more efﬁciently to far exemplars than they do to the category prototype. The results are characterized in terms of the prototype of one category being pushed away from the prototype of the other category. It seems straightforward to explain these data in MLGA-Distrib as a type of long-term push effect. 5 Related Work and Conclusions Stewart, Brown, and Chater (2002) proposed an account of categorization context effects in which responses are based solely on the relative difference between the previous and present exemplars. No representation of the category prototype is maintained. However, classiﬁcation based solely on relative difference cannot account for a diminished bias effects as a function of experience. A long-term stable prototype representation, of the sort incorporated into our models, seems necessary. We considered four models in our investigation, and the fact that only one accounts for the experimental data suggests that the data are nontrivial. All four models have principled theoretical underpinnings, and they space they deﬁne may suggest other elegant frameworks for understanding mechanisms of category learning. The successful model, MLDA-Distrib, offers a deep insight into understanding multiple-category domains: category structure must be considered. MLGA-Distrib exploits knowledge available to subjects performing the task concerning the ordinal relationships among categories. A model without this knowledge, MLGA-Local, fails to explain data. Thus, the interrelatedness of categories appears to provide a source of constraint that individuals use in learning about the structure of the world.

<p>Author: Kai Zhang, James T. Kwok</p><p>Abstract: Finite mixture model is a powerful tool in many statistical learning problems. In this paper, we propose a general, structure-preserving approach to reduce its model complexity, which can bring signiﬁcant computational beneﬁts in many applications. The basic idea is to group the original mixture components into compact clusters, and then minimize an upper bound on the approximation error between the original and simpliﬁed models. By adopting the L2 norm as the distance measure between mixture models, we can derive closed-form solutions that are more robust and reliable than using the KL-based distance measure. Moreover, the complexity of our algorithm is only linear in the sample size and dimensionality. Experiments on density estimation and clustering-based image segmentation demonstrate its outstanding performance in terms of both speed and accuracy.</p><p>5 0.58167815 <a title="97-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Theory_and_Dynamics_of_Perceptual_Bistability.html">192 nips-2006-Theory and Dynamics of Perceptual Bistability</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul R. Schrater, Rashmi Sundareswara</p><p>Abstract: Perceptual Bistability refers to the phenomenon of spontaneously switching between two or more interpretations of an image under continuous viewing. Although switching behavior is increasingly well characterized, the origins remain elusive. We propose that perceptual switching naturally arises from the brain’s search for best interpretations while performing Bayesian inference. In particular, we propose that the brain explores a posterior distribution over image interpretations at a rapid time scale via a sampling-like process and updates its interpretation when a sampled interpretation is better than the discounted value of its current interpretation. We formalize the theory, explicitly derive switching rate distributions and discuss qualitative properties of the theory including the effect of changes in the posterior distribution on switching rates. Finally, predictions of the theory are shown to be consistent with measured changes in human switching dynamics to Necker cube stimuli induced by context.</p><p>6 0.58153808 <a title="97-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-A_Complexity-Distortion_Approach_to_Joint_Pattern_Alignment.html">3 nips-2006-A Complexity-Distortion Approach to Joint Pattern Alignment</a></p>

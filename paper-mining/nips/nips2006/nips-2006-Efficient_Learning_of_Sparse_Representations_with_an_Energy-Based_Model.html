<p>Author: Honglak Lee, Alexis Battle, Rajat Raina, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: Sparse coding provides a class of algorithms for ﬁnding succinct representations of stimuli; given only unlabeled input data, it discovers basis functions that capture higher-level features in the data. However, ﬁnding sparse codes remains a very difﬁcult computational problem. In this paper, we present efﬁcient sparse coding algorithms that are based on iteratively solving two convex optimization problems: an L1 -regularized least squares problem and an L2 -constrained least squares problem. We propose novel algorithms to solve both of these optimization problems. Our algorithms result in a signiﬁcant speedup for sparse coding, allowing us to learn larger sparse codes than possible with previously described algorithms. We apply these algorithms to natural images and demonstrate that the inferred sparse codes exhibit end-stopping and non-classical receptive ﬁeld surround suppression and, therefore, may provide a partial explanation for these two phenomena in V1 neurons. 1</p><p>3 0.25336778 <a title="72-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2006-Recursive_ICA.html">167 nips-2006-Recursive ICA</a></p>
<p>Author: Honghao Shan, Lingyun Zhang, Garrison W. Cottrell</p><p>Abstract: Independent Component Analysis (ICA) is a popular method for extracting independent features from visual data. However, as a fundamentally linear technique, there is always nonlinear residual redundancy that is not captured by ICA. Hence there have been many attempts to try to create a hierarchical version of ICA, but so far none of the approaches have a natural way to apply them more than once. Here we show that there is a relatively simple technique that transforms the absolute values of the outputs of a previous application of ICA into a normal distribution, to which ICA maybe applied again. This results in a recursive ICA algorithm that may be applied any number of times in order to extract higher order structure from previous layers. 1</p><p>4 0.2467726 <a title="72-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2006-Nonlinear_physically-based_models_for_decoding_motor-cortical_population_activity.html">148 nips-2006-Nonlinear physically-based models for decoding motor-cortical population activity</a></p>
<p>Author: Gregory Shakhnarovich, Sung-phil Kim, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: Neural motor prostheses (NMPs) require the accurate decoding of motor cortical population activity for the control of an artiﬁcial motor system. Previous work on cortical decoding for NMPs has focused on the recovery of hand kinematics. Human NMPs however may require the control of computer cursors or robotic devices with very different physical and dynamical properties. Here we show that the ﬁring rates of cells in the primary motor cortex of non-human primates can be used to control the parameters of an artiﬁcial physical system exhibiting realistic dynamics. The model represents 2D hand motion in terms of a point mass connected to a system of idealized springs. The nonlinear spring coefﬁcients are estimated from the ﬁring rates of neurons in the motor cortex. We evaluate linear and a nonlinear decoding algorithms using neural recordings from two monkeys performing two different tasks. We found that the decoded spring coefﬁcients produced accurate hand trajectories compared with state-of-the-art methods for direct decoding of hand kinematics. Furthermore, using a physically-based system produced decoded movements that were more “natural” in that their frequency spectrum more closely matched that of natural hand movements. 1</p><p>5 0.18281667 <a title="72-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2006-Greedy_Layer-Wise_Training_of_Deep_Networks.html">88 nips-2006-Greedy Layer-Wise Training of Deep Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Pascal Lamblin, Dan Popovici, Hugo Larochelle</p><p>Abstract: Complexity theory of circuits strongly suggests that deep architectures can be much more efﬁcient (sometimes exponentially) than shallow architectures, in terms of computational elements required to represent some functions. Deep multi-layer neural networks have many levels of non-linearities allowing them to compactly represent highly non-linear and highly-varying functions. However, until recently it was not clear how to train such deep networks, since gradient-based optimization starting from random initialization appears to often get stuck in poor solutions. Hinton et al. recently introduced a greedy layer-wise unsupervised learning algorithm for Deep Belief Networks (DBN), a generative model with many layers of hidden causal variables. In the context of the above optimization problem, we study this algorithm empirically and explore variants to better understand its success and extend it to cases where the inputs are continuous or where the structure of the input distribution is not revealing enough about the variable to be predicted in a supervised task. Our experiments also conﬁrm the hypothesis that the greedy layer-wise unsupervised training strategy mostly helps the optimization, by initializing weights in a region near a good local minimum, giving rise to internal distributed representations that are high-level abstractions of the input, bringing better generalization.</p><p>6 0.17595474 <a title="72-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2006-Sparse_Representation_for_Signal_Classification.html">179 nips-2006-Sparse Representation for Signal Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Ke Huang, Selin Aviyente</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, application of sparse representation (factorization) of signals over an overcomplete basis (dictionary) for signal classiﬁcation is discussed. Searching for the sparse representation of a signal over an overcomplete dictionary is achieved by optimizing an objective function that includes two terms: one that measures the signal reconstruction error and another that measures the sparsity. This objective function works well in applications where signals need to be reconstructed, like coding and denoising. On the other hand, discriminative methods, such as linear discriminative analysis (LDA), are better suited for classiﬁcation tasks. However, discriminative methods are usually sensitive to corruption in signals due to lacking crucial properties for signal reconstruction. In this paper, we present a theoretical framework for signal classiﬁcation with sparse representation. The approach combines the discrimination power of the discriminative methods with the reconstruction property and the sparsity of the sparse representation that enables one to deal with signal corruptions: noise, missing data and outliers. The proposed approach is therefore capable of robust classiﬁcation with a sparse representation of signals. The theoretical results are demonstrated with signal classiﬁcation tasks, showing that the proposed approach outperforms the standard discriminative methods and the standard sparse representation in the case of corrupted signals. 1</p><p>5 0.61314249 <a title="72-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Nonnegative_Sparse_PCA.html">149 nips-2006-Nonnegative Sparse PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Ron Zass, Amnon Shashua</p><p>Abstract: We describe a nonnegative variant of the ”Sparse PCA” problem. The goal is to create a low dimensional representation from a collection of points which on the one hand maximizes the variance of the projected points and on the other uses only parts of the original coordinates, and thereby creating a sparse representation. What distinguishes our problem from other Sparse PCA formulations is that the projection involves only nonnegative weights of the original coordinates — a desired quality in various ﬁelds, including economics, bioinformatics and computer vision. Adding nonnegativity contributes to sparseness, where it enforces a partitioning of the original coordinates among the new axes. We describe a simple yet efﬁcient iterative coordinate-descent type of scheme which converges to a local optimum of our optimization criteria, giving good results on large real world datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.59741902 <a title="72-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Large_Margin_Multi-channel_Analog-to-Digital_Conversion_with_Applications_to_Neural_Prosthesis.html">107 nips-2006-Large Margin Multi-channel Analog-to-Digital Conversion with Applications to Neural Prosthesis</a></p>

<p>Author: Alfred O. Hero</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a novel adaptive non-parametric anomaly detection approach, called GEM, that is based on the minimal covering properties of K-point entropic graphs when constructed on N training samples from a nominal probability distribution. Such graphs have the property that as N → ∞ their span recovers the entropy minimizing set that supports at least ρ = K/N (100)% of the mass of the Lebesgue part of the distribution. When a test sample falls outside of the entropy minimizing set an anomaly can be declared at a statistical level of signiﬁcance α = 1 − ρ. A method for implementing this non-parametric anomaly detector is proposed that approximates this minimum entropy set by the inﬂuence region of a K-point entropic graph built on the training data. By implementing an incremental leave-one-out k-nearest neighbor graph on resampled subsets of the training data GEM can efﬁciently detect outliers at a given level of signiﬁcance and compute their empirical p-values.

The goal is to create a low dimensional representation from a collection of points which on the one hand maximizes the variance of the projected points and on the other uses only parts of the original coordinates, and thereby creating a sparse representation. What distinguishes our problem from other Sparse PCA formulations is that the projection involves only nonnegative weights of the original coordinates — a desired quality in various ﬁelds, including economics, bioinformatics and computer vision. Adding nonnegativity contributes to sparseness, where it enforces a partitioning of the original coordinates among the new axes. We describe a simple yet efﬁcient iterative coordinate-descent type of scheme which converges to a local optimum of our optimization criteria, giving good results on large real world datasets. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.83655095 <a title="72-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Efficient_Learning_of_Sparse_Representations_with_an_Energy-Based_Model.html">72 nips-2006-Efficient Learning of Sparse Representations with an Energy-Based Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Marc'aurelio Ranzato, Christopher Poultney, Sumit Chopra, Yann L. Cun</p><p>Abstract: We describe a novel unsupervised method for learning sparse, overcomplete features. The model uses a linear encoder, and a linear decoder preceded by a sparsifying non-linearity that turns a code vector into a quasi-binary sparse code vector. Given an input, the optimal code minimizes the distance between the output of the decoder and the input patch while being as similar as possible to the encoder output. Learning proceeds in a two-phase EM-like fashion: (1) compute the minimum-energy code vector, (2) adjust the parameters of the encoder and decoder so as to decrease the energy. The model produces “stroke detectors” when trained on handwritten numerals, and Gabor-like ﬁlters when trained on natural image patches. Inference and learning are very fast, requiring no preprocessing, and no expensive sampling. Using the proposed unsupervised method to initialize the ﬁrst layer of a convolutional network, we achieved an error rate slightly lower than the best reported result on the MNIST dataset. Finally, an extension of the method is described to learn topographical ﬁlter maps. 1</p><p>5 0.77508378 <a title="72-lda-5" href="./nips-2006-Distributed_Inference_in_Dynamical_Systems.html">69 nips-2006-Distributed Inference in Dynamical Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Stanislav Funiak, Carlos Guestrin, Rahul Sukthankar, Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: We present a robust distributed algorithm for approximate probabilistic inference in dynamical systems, such as sensor networks and teams of mobile robots. Using assumed density ﬁltering, the network nodes maintain a tractable representation of the belief state in a distributed fashion. At each time step, the nodes coordinate to condition this distribution on the observations made throughout the network, and to advance this estimate to the next time step. In addition, we identify a signiﬁcant challenge for probabilistic inference in dynamical systems: message losses or network partitions can cause nodes to have inconsistent beliefs about the current state of the system. We address this problem by developing distributed algorithms that guarantee that nodes will reach an informative consistent distribution when communication is re-established. We present a suite of experimental results on real-world sensor data for two real sensor network deployments: one with 25 cameras and another with 54 temperature sensors. 1</p><p>6 0.77222854 <a title="72-lda-6" href="./nips-2006-Real-time_adaptive_information-theoretic_optimization_of_neurophysiology_experiments.html">165 nips-2006-Real-time adaptive information-theoretic optimization of neurophysiology experiments</a></p>

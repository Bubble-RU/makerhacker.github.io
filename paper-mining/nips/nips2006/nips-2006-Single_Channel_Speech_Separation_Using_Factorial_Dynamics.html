Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task. Human: average human error rate, IBM: our best result, Next Best: the best of the eight other published results on this task, and Chance: the theoretical error rate for random guessing. System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task. Human: average human error rate, IBM: our best result, Next Best: the best of the eight other published results on this task, and Chance: the theoretical error rate for random guessing. System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: Fei Sha, Lawrence K. Saul</p><p>Abstract: We study the problem of parameter estimation in continuous density hidden Markov models (CD-HMMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR). As in support vector machines, we propose a learning algorithm based on the goal of margin maximization. Unlike earlier work on max-margin Markov networks, our approach is speciﬁcally geared to the modeling of real-valued observations (such as acoustic feature vectors) using Gaussian mixture models. Unlike previous discriminative frameworks for ASR, such as maximum mutual information and minimum classiﬁcation error, our framework leads to a convex optimization, without any spurious local minima. The objective function for large margin training of CD-HMMs is deﬁned over a parameter space of positive semideﬁnite matrices. Its optimization can be performed efﬁciently with simple gradient-based methods that scale well to large problems.

<p>Author: David Barber, Silvia Chiappa</p><p>Abstract: Linear Gaussian State-Space Models are widely used and a Bayesian treatment of parameters is therefore of considerable interest. The approximate Variational Bayesian method applied to these models is an attractive approach, used successfully in applications ranging from acoustics to bioinformatics. The most challenging aspect of implementing the method is in performing inference on the hidden state sequence of the model. We show how to convert the inference problem so that standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions from the literature may be applied. This is in contrast to previously published approaches based on Belief Propagation. Our framework both simpliﬁes and uniﬁes the inference problem, so that future applications may be more easily developed. We demonstrate the elegance of the approach on Bayesian temporal ICA, with an application to ﬁnding independent dynamical processes underlying noisy EEG signals. 1 Linear Gaussian State-Space Models Linear Gaussian State-Space Models (LGSSMs)1 are fundamental in time-series analysis [1, 2, 3]. In these models the observations v1:T 2 are generated from an underlying dynamical system on h1:T according to: v v vt = Bht + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0V , ΣV ), h h ht = Aht−1 + ηt , ηt ∼ N (0H , ΣH ) , where N (µ, Σ) denotes a Gaussian with mean µ and covariance Σ, and 0X denotes an Xdimensional zero vector. The observation vt has dimension V and the hidden state ht has dimension H. Probabilistically, the LGSSM is deﬁned by: T p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ) = p(v1 |h1 )p(h1 ) p(vt |ht )p(ht |ht−1 ), t=2 with p(vt |ht ) = N (Bht , ΣV ), p(ht |ht−1 ) = N (Aht−1 , ΣH ), p(h1 ) = N (µ, Σ) and where Θ = {A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ} denotes the model parameters. Because of the widespread use of these models, a Bayesian treatment of parameters is of considerable interest [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. An exact implementation of the Bayesian LGSSM is formally intractable [8], and recently a Variational Bayesian (VB) approximation has been studied [4, 5, 6, 7, 9]. The most challenging part of implementing the VB method is performing inference over h1:T , and previous authors have developed their own specialized routines, based on Belief Propagation, since standard LGSSM inference routines appear, at ﬁrst sight, not to be applicable. 1 2 Also called Kalman Filters/Smoothers, Linear Dynamical Systems. v1:T denotes v1 , . . . , vT . A key contribution of this paper is to show how the Variational Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM can be implemented using standard LGSSM inference routines. Based on the insight we provide, any standard inference method may be applied, including those speciﬁcally addressed to improve numerical stability [2, 10, 11]. In this article, we decided to describe the predictor-corrector and Rauch-Tung-Striebel recursions [2], and also suggest a small modiﬁcation that reduces computational cost. The Bayesian LGSSM is particularly of interest when strong prior constraints are needed to ﬁnd adequate solutions. One such case is in EEG signal analysis, whereby we wish to extract sources that evolve independently through time. Since EEG is particularly noisy [12], a prior that encourages sources to have preferential dynamics is advantageous. This application is discussed in Section 4, and demonstrates the ease of applying our VB framework. 2 Bayesian Linear Gaussian State-Space Models In the Bayesian treatment of the LGSSM, instead of considering the model parameters Θ as ﬁxed, ˆ ˆ we deﬁne a prior distribution p(Θ|Θ), where Θ is a set of hyperparameters. Then: ˆ p(v1:T |Θ) = ˆ p(v1:T |Θ)p(Θ|Θ) . (1) Θ In a full Bayesian treatment we would deﬁne additional prior distributions over the hyperparameters ˆ Θ. Here we take instead the ML-II (‘evidence’) framework, in which the optimal set of hyperpaˆ ˆ rameters is found by maximizing p(v1:T |Θ) with respect to Θ [6, 7, 9]. For the parameter priors, here we deﬁne Gaussians on the columns of A and B 3 : H e− p(A|α, ΣH ) ∝ αj 2 ˆ ( A j −A j ) T ˆ Σ−1 (Aj −Aj ) H H , e− p(B|β, ΣV ) ∝ j=1 βj 2 T ˆ (Bj −Bj ) ˆ Σ−1 (Bj −Bj ) V , j=1 ˆ ˆ which has the effect of biasing the transition and emission matrices to desired forms A and B. The −1 −1 4 conjugate priors for general inverse covariances ΣH and ΣV are Wishart distributions [7] . In the simpler case assumed here of diagonal covariances these become Gamma distributions [5, 7]. The ˆ hyperparameters are then Θ = {α, β}5 . Variational Bayes ˆ Optimizing Eq. (1) with respect to Θ is difﬁcult due to the intractability of the integrals. Instead, in VB, one considers the lower bound [6, 7, 9]6 : ˆ ˆ L = log p(v1:T |Θ) ≥ Hq (Θ, h1:T ) + log p(Θ|Θ) q(Θ) + E(h1:T , Θ) q(Θ,h1:T ) ≡ F, where E(h1:T , Θ) ≡ log p(v1:T , h1:T |Θ). Hd (x) signiﬁes the entropy of the distribution d(x), and · d(x) denotes the expectation operator. The key approximation in VB is q(Θ, h1:T ) ≡ q(Θ)q(h1:T ), from which one may show that, for optimality of F, ˆ E(h1:T ,Θ) q(h1:T ) . q(h1:T ) ∝ e E(h1:T ,Θ) q(Θ) , q(Θ) ∝ p(Θ|Θ)e These coupled equations need to be iterated to convergence. The updates for the parameters q(Θ) are straightforward and are given in Appendices A and B. Once converged, the hyperparameters are ˆ updated by maximizing F with respect to Θ, which lead to simple update formulae [7]. Our main concern is with the update for q(h1:T ), for which this paper makes a departure from treatments previously presented. 3 More general Gaussian priors may be more suitable depending on the application. For expositional simplicity, we do not put priors on µ and Σ. 5 For simplicity, we keep the parameters of the Gamma priors ﬁxed. 6 Strictly we should write throughout q(·|v1:T ). We omit the dependence on v1:T for notational convenience. 4 Uniﬁed Inference on q(h1:T ) 3 Optimally q(h1:T ) is Gaussian since, up to a constant, E(h1:T , Θ) − 1 2 q(Θ) is quadratic in h1:T 7 : T T (vt −Bht )T Σ−1 (vt −Bht ) V q(B,ΣV ) + (ht −Aht−1 ) Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H t=1 q(A,ΣH ) . (2) In addition, optimally, q(A|ΣH ) and q(B|ΣV ) are Gaussians (see Appendix A), so we can easily carry out the averages in Eq. (2). The further averages over q(ΣH ) and q(ΣV ) are also easy due to conjugacy. Whilst this deﬁnes the distribution q(h1:T ), quantities such as q(ht ), required for example for the parameter updates (see the Appendices), need to be inferred from this distribution. Clearly, in the non-Bayesian case, the averages over the parameters are not present, and the above simply represents the posterior distribution of an LGSSM whose visible variables have been clamped into their evidential states. In that case, inference can be performed using any standard LGSSM routine. Our aim, therefore, is to try to represent the averaged Eq. (2) directly as the posterior distribution q (h1:T |˜1:T ) of an LGSSM , for some suitable parameter settings. ˜ v Mean + Fluctuation Decomposition A useful decomposition is to write (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT SB ht , t V q(B,ΣV ) f luctuation mean and similarly (ht −Aht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht −Aht−1 ) H = (ht − A ht−1 )T Σ−1 (ht − A ht−1 ) +hT SA ht−1 , t−1 H q(A,ΣH ) mean f luctuation T −1 where the parameter covariances are SB ≡ B T Σ−1 B − B Σ−1 B = V HB and SA ≡ V V T −1 −1 −1 AT ΣH A − A ΣH A = HHA (for HA and HB deﬁned in Appendix A). The mean terms simply represent a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. However, the extra contributions from the ﬂuctuations mean that Eq. (2) cannot be written as a clamped LGSSM with averaged parameters. In order to deal with these extra terms, our idea is to treat the ﬂuctuations as arising from an augmented visible variable, for which Eq. (2) can then be considered as a clamped LGSSM. Inference Using an Augmented LGSSM To represent Eq. (2) as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), we may augment vt and B as8 : ˜ v vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0H ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UB ), T where UA is the Cholesky decomposition of SA , so that UA UA = SA . Similarly, UB is the Cholesky decomposition of SB . The equivalent LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is then completed by specifying9 ˜ v ˜ A≡ A , ˜ ΣH ≡ Σ−1 H −1 , ˜ ΣV ≡ diag( Σ−1 V −1 , IH , IH ), µ ≡ µ, ˜ ˜ Σ ≡ Σ. The validity of this parameter assignment can be checked by showing that, up to negligible constants, the exponent of this augmented LGSSM has the same form as Eq. (2)10 . Now that this has been written as an LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ), standard inference routines in the literature may be applied to ˜ v compute q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) [1, 2, 11]11 . ˜ v 7 For simplicity of exposition, we ignore the ﬁrst time-point here. The notation vert(x1 , . . . , xn ) stands for vertically concatenating the arguments x1 , . . . , xn . 9 ˜ ˜ ˜ Strictly, we need a time-dependent emission Bt = B, for t = 1, . . . , T − 1. For time T , BT has the Cholesky factor UA replaced by 0H,H . 10 There are several ways of achieving a similar augmentation. We chose this since, in the non-Bayesian limit UA = UB = 0H,H , no numerical instabilities would be introduced. 11 Note that, since the augmented LGSSM q (h1:T |˜1:T ) is designed to match the fully clamped distribution ˜ v q(h1:T |v1:T ), the ﬁltered posterior q (ht |˜1:t ) does not correspond to q(ht |v1:t ). ˜ v 8 Algorithm 1 LGSSM: Forward and backward recursive updates.

These are given in Algorithm 1, where q (ht |˜1:T ) is computed by calling the FORWARD and BACKWARD procedures. ˜ v We present two variants of the FORWARD pass. Either we may call procedure FORWARD in ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ Algorithm 1 with parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV , µ, Σ and the augmented visible variables vt in which ˜ we use steps 1a, 2a, 5a and 6a. This is exactly the predictor-corrector form of a Kalman Filter [2]. Otherwise, in order to reduce the computational cost, we may call procedure FORWARD with the −1 ˜ ˜ parameters A, B , ΣH , Σ−1 , µ, Σ and the original visible variable vt in which we use steps ˜ ˜ V T 1b (where UAB UAB ≡ SA +SB ), 2b, 5b and 6b. The two algorithms are mathematically equivalent. Computing q(ht |v1:T ) = q (ht |˜1:T ) is then completed by calling the common BACKWARD pass. ˜ v The important point here is that the reader may supply any standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing routine, and simply call it with the appropriate parameters. In some parameter regimes, or in very long time-series, numerical stability may be a serious concern, for which several stabilized algorithms have been developed over the years, for example the square-root forms [2, 10, 11]. By converting the problem to a standard form, we have therefore uniﬁed and simpliﬁed inference, so that future applications may be more readily developed12 . 3.1 Relation to Previous Approaches An alternative approach to the one above, and taken in [5, 7], is to write the posterior as T log q(h1:T ) = φt (ht−1 , ht ) + const. t=2 for suitably deﬁned quadratic forms φt (ht−1 , ht ). Here the potentials φt (ht−1 , ht ) encode the averaging over the parameters A, B, ΣH , ΣV . The approach taken in [7] is to recognize this as a 12 The computation of the log-likelihood bound does not require any augmentation. pairwise Markov chain, for which the Belief Propagation recursions may be applied. The approach in [5] is based on a Kullback-Leibler minimization of the posterior with a chain structure, which is algorithmically equivalent to Belief Propagation. Whilst mathematically valid procedures, the resulting algorithms do not correspond to any of the standard forms in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, whose properties have been well studied [14]. 4 An Application to Bayesian ICA A particular case for which the Bayesian LGSSM is of interest is in extracting independent source signals underlying a multivariate timeseries [5, 15]. This will demonstrate how the approach developed in Section 3 makes VB easily to apply. The sources si are modeled as independent in the following sense: p(si , sj ) = p(si )p(sj ), 1:T 1:T 1:T 1:T for i = j, i, j = 1, . . . , C. Independence implies block diagonal transition and state noise matrices A, ΣH and Σ, where each block c has dimension Hc . A one dimensional source sc for each independent dynamical subsystem is then t formed from sc = 1T hc , where 1c is a unit vector and hc is the state of t c t t dynamical system c. Combining the sources, we can write st = P ht , where P = diag(1T , . . . , 1T ), ht = vert(h1 , . . . , hC ). The resulting 1 C t t emission matrix is constrained to be of the form B = W P , where W is the V × C mixing matrix. This means that the observations v are formed from linearly mixing the sources, vt = W st + ηt . The Figure 1: The structure of graphical structure of this model is presented in Fig 1. To encourage redundant components to be removed, we place a zero mean Gaussian the LGSSM for ICA. prior on W . In this case, we do not deﬁne a prior for the parameters ΣH and ΣV which are instead considered as hyperparameters. More details of the model are given in [15]. The constraint B = W P requires a minor modiﬁcation from Section 3, as we discuss below. Inference on q(h1:T ) A small modiﬁcation of the mean + ﬂuctuation decomposition for B occurs, namely: (vt − Bht )T Σ−1 (vt − Bht ) V q(W ) = (vt − B ht )T Σ−1 (vt − B ht ) + hT P T SW P ht , t V −1 where B ≡ W P and SW = V HW . The quantities W and HW are obtained as in Appendix A.1 with the replacement ht ← P ht . To represent the above as a LGSSM, we augment vt and B as vt = vert(vt , 0H , 0C ), ˜ ˜ B = vert( B , UA , UW P ), where UW is the Cholesky decomposition of SW . The equivalent LGSSM is then completed by ˜ ˜ ˜ ˜ specifying A ≡ A , ΣH ≡ ΣH , ΣV ≡ diag(ΣV , IH , IC ), µ ≡ µ, Σ ≡ Σ, and inference for ˜ q(h1:T ) performed using Algorithm 1. This demonstrates the elegance and unity of the approach in Section 3, since no new algorithm needs to be developed to perform inference, even in this special constrained parameter case. 4.1 Demonstration As a simple demonstration, we used an LGSSM to generate 3 sources sc with random 5×5 transition t matrices Ac , µ = 0H and Σ ≡ ΣH ≡ IH . The sources were mixed into three observations v vt = W st + ηt , for W chosen with elements from a zero mean unit variance Gaussian distribution, and ΣV = IV . We then trained a Bayesian LGSSM with 5 sources and 7 × 7 transition matrices Ac . ˆ To bias the model to ﬁnd the simplest sources, we used Ac ≡ 0Hc ,Hc for all sources. In Fig2a and Fig 2b we see the original sources and the noisy observations respectively. In Fig2c we see the estimated sources from our method after convergence of the hyperparameter updates. Two of the 5 sources have been removed, and the remaining three are a reasonable estimation of the original sources. Another possible approach for introducing prior knowledge is to use a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 100 (a) 150 200 250 300 0 50 (b) 100 150 200 250 300 0 50 (c) 100 150 200 250 300 (d) Figure 2: (a) Original sources st .

However, it is not clear how to reliably ﬁnd the hyperparameters α and β in this case. One solution is to estimate them by optimizing the new objective function jointly with respect to the parameters and hyperparameters (this is the so-called joint map estimation – see for example [16]). A typical result of using this joint MAP approach on the artiﬁcial data is presented in Fig 2d. The joint MAP does not estimate the hyperparameters well, and the incorrect number of sources is identiﬁed. 4.2 Application to EEG Analysis In Fig 3a we plot three seconds of EEG data recorded from 4 channels (located in the right hemisphere) while a person is performing imagined movement of the right hand. As is typical in EEG, each channel shows drift terms below 1 Hz which correspond to artifacts of the instrumentation, together with the presence of 50 Hz mains contamination and masks the rhythmical activity related to the mental task, mainly centered at 10 and 20 Hz [17]. We would therefore like a method which enables us to extract components in these information-rich 10 and 20 Hz frequency bands. Standard ICA methods such as FastICA do not ﬁnd satisfactory sources based on raw ‘noisy’ data, and preprocessing with band-pass ﬁlters is usually required. Additionally, in EEG research, ﬂexibility in the number of recovered sources is important since there may be many independent oscillators of interest underlying the observations and we would like some way to automatically determine their effective number. To preferentially ﬁnd sources at particular frequencies, we speciﬁed a block ˆ diagonal matrix Ac for each source c, where each block is a 2 × 2 rotation matrix at the desired frequency. We deﬁned the following 16 groups of frequencies: [0.5], [0.5], [0.5], [0.5]; [10,11], [10,11], [10,11], [10,11]; [20,21], [20,21], [20,21], [20,21]; [50], [50], [50], [50]. The temporal evolution of the sources obtained after training the Bayesian LGSSM is given in Fig3(b,c,d,e) (grouped by frequency range). The Bayes LGSSM removed 4 unnecessary sources from the mixing matrix W , that is one [10,11] Hz and three [20,21] Hz sources. The ﬁrst 4 sources contain dominant low frequency drift, sources 5, 6 and 8 contain [10,11] Hz, while source 10 contains [20,21] Hz centered activity. Of the 4 sources initialized to 50 Hz, only 2 retained 50 Hz activity, while the Ac of the other two have changed to model other frequencies present in the EEG. This method demonstrates the usefulness and applicability of the VB method in a real-world situation. 5 Conclusion We considered the application of Variational Bayesian learning to Linear Gaussian State-Space Models. This is an important class of models with widespread application, and ﬁnding a simple way to implement this approximate Bayesian procedure is of considerable interest. The most demanding part of the procedure is inference of the hidden states of the model. Previously, this has been achieved using Belief Propagation, which differs from inference in the Kalman Filtering/Smoothing literature, for which highly efﬁcient and stabilized procedures exist. A central contribution of this paper is to show how inference can be written using the standard Kalman Filtering/Smoothing recursions by augmenting the original model. Additionally, a minor modiﬁcation to the standard Kalman Filtering routine may be applied for computational efﬁciency. We demonstrated the elegance and unity of our approach by showing how to easily apply a Variational Bayes analysis of temporal ICA. Speciﬁcally, our Bayes ICA approach successfully extracts independent processes underlying EEG signals, biased towards preferred frequency ranges. We hope that this simple and unifying interpretation of Variational Bayesian LGSSMs may therefore facilitate the further application to related models. A A.1 Parameter Updates for A and B Determining q(B|ΣV ) By examining F, the contribution of q(B|ΣV ) can be interpreted as the negative KL divergence between q(B|ΣV ) and a Gaussian. Hence, optimally, q(B|ΣV ) is a Gaussian. The covariance [ΣB ]ij,kl ≡ Bij − Bij Bkl − Bkl (averages wrt q(B|ΣV )) is given by: T hj hl t t −1 [ΣB ]ij,kl = [HB ]jl [ΣV ]ik , where [HB ]jl ≡ t=1 −1 The mean is given by B = NB HB , where [NB ]ij ≡ T t=1 hj t q(ht ) q(ht ) + βj δjl . i ˆ vt + βj Bij . Determining q(A|ΣH ) Optimally, q(A|ΣH ) is a Gaussian with covariance T −1 hj hl t t −1 [ΣA ]ij,kl = [HA ]jl [ΣH ]ik , where [HA ]jl ≡ t=1 −1 The mean is given by A = NA HA , where [NA ]ij ≡ B T t=2 q(ht ) hj hi t−1 t + αj δjl . q(ht−1:t ) ˆ + αj Aij . Covariance Updates By specifying a Wishart prior for the inverse of the covariances, conjugate update formulae are possible. In practice, it is more common to specify diagonal inverse covariances, for which the corresponding priors are simply Gamma distributions [7, 5]. For this simple diagonal case, the explicit updates are given below. Determining q(ΣV ) For the constraint Σ−1 = diag(ρ), where each diagonal element follows a Gamma prior V Ga(b1 , b2 ) [7], q(ρ) factorizes and the optimal updates are  q(ρi ) = Ga b1 + where GB ≡ −1 T NB HB NB .   T T 1 i , b2 +  (vt )2 − [GB ]ii + 2 2 t=1 j ˆ2 βj Bij  , Determining q(ΣH ) Analogously, for Σ−1 = diag(τ ) with prior Ga(a1 , a2 ) [5], the updates are H    T T −1 1 ˆij , a2 + (hi )2 − [GA ]ii + αj A2  , q(τi ) = Ga a1 + t 2 2 t=2 j −1 T where GA ≡ NA HA NA .

<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task.

System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: Mark Johnson, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sharon Goldwater</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces adaptor grammars, a class of probabilistic models of language that generalize probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). Adaptor grammars augment the probabilistic rules of PCFGs with “adaptors” that can induce dependencies among successive uses. With a particular choice of adaptor, based on the Pitman-Yor process, nonparametric Bayesian models of language using Dirichlet processes and hierarchical Dirichlet processes can be written as simple grammars. We present a general-purpose inference algorithm for adaptor grammars, making it easy to deﬁne and use such models, and illustrate how several existing nonparametric Bayesian models can be expressed within this framework. 1</p><p>3 0.37472945 <a title="176-lsi-3" href="./nips-2006-implicit_Online_Learning_with_Kernels.html">203 nips-2006-implicit Online Learning with Kernels</a></p>

In particular, information-theoretic and psycholinguistic considerations suggest that this may include maximizing the uniformity of information density in an utterance. We investigate this possibility in the context of syntactic reduction, where the speaker has the option of either marking a higher-order unit (a phrase) with an extra word, or leaving it unmarked. We demonstrate that speakers are more likely to reduce less information-dense phrases. In a second step, we combine a stochastic model of structured utterance production with a logistic-regression model of syntactic reduction to study which types of cues speakers employ when estimating the predictability of upcoming elements. We demonstrate that the trend toward predictability-sensitive syntactic reduction (Jaeger, 2006) is robust in the face of a wide variety of control variables, and present evidence that speakers use both surface and structural cues for predictability estimation.</p><p>5 0.33131692 <a title="176-lsi-5" href="./nips-2006-Multiple_timescales_and_uncertainty_in_motor_adaptation.html">141 nips-2006-Multiple timescales and uncertainty in motor adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Konrad P. Körding, Joshua B. Tenenbaum, Reza Shadmehr</p><p>Abstract: Our motor system changes due to causes that span multiple timescales. For example, muscle response can change because of fatigue, a condition where the disturbance has a fast timescale or because of disease where the disturbance is much slower. Here we hypothesize that the nervous system adapts in a way that reﬂects the temporal properties of such potential disturbances. According to a Bayesian formulation of this idea, movement error results in a credit assignment problem: what timescale is responsible for this disturbance? The adaptation schedule inﬂuences the behavior of the optimal learner, changing estimates at different timescales as well as the uncertainty. A system that adapts in this way predicts many properties observed in saccadic gain adaptation. It well predicts the timecourses of motor adaptation in cases of partial sensory deprivation and reversals of the adaptation direction.</p><p>6 0.31748268 <a title="176-lsi-6" href="./nips-2006-Unsupervised_Learning_of_a_Probabilistic_Grammar_for_Object_Detection_and_Parsing.html">199 nips-2006-Unsupervised Learning of a Probabilistic Grammar for Object Detection and Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: John R. Hershey, Trausti Kristjansson, Steven Rennie, Peder A. Olsen</p><p>Abstract: Human listeners have the extraordinary ability to hear and recognize speech even when more than one person is talking. Their machine counterparts have historically been unable to compete with this ability, until now. We present a modelbased system that performs on par with humans in the task of separating speech of two talkers from a single-channel recording. Remarkably, the system surpasses human recognition performance in many conditions. The models of speech use temporal dynamics to help infer the source speech signals, given mixed speech signals. The estimated source signals are then recognized using a conventional speech recognition system. We demonstrate that the system achieves its best performance when the model of temporal dynamics closely captures the grammatical constraints of the task. One of the hallmarks of human perception is our ability to solve the auditory cocktail party problem: we can direct our attention to a given speaker in the presence of interfering speech, and understand what was said remarkably well. Until now the same could not be said for automatic speech recognition systems. However, we have recently introduced a system which in many conditions performs this task better than humans [1][2]. The model addresses the Pascal Speech Separation Challenge task [3], and outperforms all other published results by more than 10% word error rate (WER). In this model, dynamics are modeled using a layered combination of one or two Markov chains: one for long-term dependencies and another for short-term dependencies. The combination of the two speakers was handled via an iterative Laplace approximation method known as Algonquin [4]. Here we describe experiments that show better performance on the same task with a simpler version of the model. The task we address is provided by the PASCAL Speech Separation Challenge [3], which provides standard training, development, and test data sets of single-channel speech mixtures following an arbitrary but simple grammar. In addition, the challenge organizers have conducted human-listening experiments to provide an interesting baseline for comparison of computational techniques. The overall system we developed is composed of the three components: a speaker identiﬁcation and gain estimation component, a signal separation component, and a speech recognition system. In this paper we focus on the signal separation component, which is composed of the acoustic and grammatical models. The details of the other components are discussed in [2]. Single-channel speech separation has previously been attempted using Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) on individual frames of acoustic features. However such models tend to perform well only when speakers are of different gender or have rather different voices [4]. When speakers have similar voices, speaker-dependent mixture models cannot unambiguously identify the component speakers. In such cases it is helpful to model the temporal dynamics of the speech. Several models in the literature have attempted to do so either for recognition [5, 6] or enhancement [7, 8] of speech. Such models have typically been based on a discrete-state hidden Markov model (HMM) operating on a frame-based acoustic feature vector. Modeling the dynamics of the log spectrum of speech is challenging in that different speech components evolve at different time-scales. For example the excitation, which carries mainly pitch, versus the ﬁlter, which consists of the formant structure, are somewhat independent of each other. The formant structure closely follows the sequences of phonemes in each word, which are pronounced at a rate of several per second. In non-tonal languages such as English, the pitch ﬂuctuates with prosody over the course of a sentence, and is not directly coupled with the words being spoken. Nevertheless, it seems to be important in separating speech, because the pitch harmonics carry predictable structure that stands out against the background. We address the various dynamic components of speech by testing different levels of dynamic constraints in our models. We explore four different levels of dynamics: no dynamics, low-level acoustic dynamics, high-level grammar dynamics, and a layered combination, dual dynamics, of the acoustic and grammar dynamics. The grammar dynamics and dual dynamics models perform the best in our experiments. The acoustic models are combined to model mixtures of speech using two methods: a nonlinear model known as Algonquin, which models the combination of log-spectrum models as a sum in the power spectrum, and a simpler max model that combines two log spectra using the max function. It turns out that whereas Algonquin works well, our formulation of the max model does better overall. With the combination of the max model and grammar-level dynamics, the model produces remarkable results: it is often able to extract two utterances from a mixture even when they are from the same speaker 1 . Overall results are given in Table 1, which shows that our closest competitors are human listeners. Table 1: Overall word error rates across all conditions on the challenge task. Human: average human error rate, IBM: our best result, Next Best: the best of the eight other published results on this task, and Chance: the theoretical error rate for random guessing. System: Word Error Rate: 1 Human 22.3% IBM 22.6% Next Best 34.2% Chance 93.0% Speech Models The model consists of an acoustic model and temporal dynamics model for each source, and a mixing model, which models how the source models are combined to describe the mixture. The acoustic features were short-time log spectrum frames computed every 15 ms. Each frame was of length 40 ms and a 640-point mixed-radix FFT was used. The DC component was discarded, producing a 319-dimensional log-power-spectrum feature vector yt . The acoustic model consists of a set of diagonal-covariance Gaussians in the features. For a given speaker, a, we model the conditional probability of the log-power spectrum of each source signal xa given a discrete acoustic state sa as Gaussian, p(xa |sa ) = N (xa ; µsa , Σsa ), with mean µsa , and covariance matrix Σsa . We used 256 Gaussians, one per acoustic state, to model the acoustic space of each speaker. For efﬁciency and tractability we restrict the covariance to be diagonal. A model with no dynamics can be formulated by producing state probabilities p(sa ), and is depicted in 1(a). Acoustic Dynamics: To capture the low-level dynamics of the acoustic signal, we modeled the acoustic dynamics of a given speaker, a, via state transitions p(sa |sa ) as shown in Figure 1(b). t t−1 There are 256 acoustic states, hence for each speaker a, we estimated a 256 × 256 element transition matrix Aa . Grammar Dynamics: The grammar dynamics are modeled by grammar state transitions, a a p(vt |vt−1 ), which consist of left-to-right phone models. The legal word sequences are given by the Speech Separation Challenge grammar [3] and are modeled using a set of pronunciations that 1 Demos and information can be found at: http : //www.research.ibm.com/speechseparation sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (a) No Dynamics (b) Acoustic Dynamics a vt−1 a vt a vt−1 a vt sa t−1 sa t sa t−1 sa t xt−1 xt xt−1 xt (c) Grammar Dynamics (d) Dual Dynamics Figure 1: Graph of models for a given source.

Note that (a) (b) and (c) are special cases of (d), where different nodes are assumed independent. map from words to three-state context-dependent phone models. The state transition probabilities derived from these phone models are sparse in the sense that most transition probabilities are zero. We model speaker dependent distributions p(sa |v a ) that associate the grammar states, v a to the speaker-dependent acoustic states. These are learned from training data where the grammar state sequences and acoustic state sequences are known for each utterance. The grammar of our system has 506 states, so we estimate a 506 × 256 element conditional probability matrix B a for each speaker. Dual Dynamics: The dual-dynamics model combines the acoustic dynamics with the grammar dynamics. It is useful in this case to avoid modeling the full combination of s and v states in the joint transitions p(sa |sa , vt ). Instead we make a naive-Bayes assumption to approximate this as t t−1 1 p(sa |sa )α p(sa |vt )β , where α and β adjust the relative inﬂuence of the two probabilities, and z t t−1 t z is the normalizing constant. Here we simply use the probability matrices Aa and B a , deﬁned above. 2 Mixed Speech Models The speech separation challenge involves recognizing speech in mixtures of signals from two speakers, a and b. We consider only mixing models that operate independently on each frequency for analytical and computational tractability. The short-time log spectrum of the mixture yt , in a given frequency band, is related to that of the two sources xa and xb via the mixing model given by the t t conditional probability distribution, p(y|xa , xb ). The joint distribution of the observation and source in one feature dimension, given the source states is thus: p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb ) = p(yt |xa , xb )p(xa |sa )p(xb |sb ). t t t t t t t t t t (1) In general, to infer and reconstruct speech we need to compute the likelihood of the observed mixture p(yt |sa , sb ) = t t p(yt , xa , xb |sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t (2) and the posterior expected values of the sources given the states, E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) = t t t xa p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb )dxa dxb , t t t t t t t (3) and similarly for xb . These quantities, combined with a prior model for the joint state set quences {sa , sb }, allow us to compute the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estima1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ tors E(xa |y1..T ) or the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate E(xa |y1..T , sa 1..T , sb 1..T ), 1..T 1..T ˆ ˆ where sa 1..T , sb 1..T = arg maxsa ,sb p(sa , sb |y1..T ), where the subscript, 1..T , refers to 1..T 1..T 1..T 1..T all frames in the signal. The mixing model can be deﬁned in a number of ways. We explore two popular candidates, for which the above integrals can be readily computed: Algonquin, and the max model. s a s xa b xb y (a) Mixing Model (v a v b )t−1 (v a v b )t (sa sb )t−1 (sa sb )t yt yt (b) Dual Dynamics Factorial Model Figure 2: Model combination for two talkers. In (a) all dependencies are shown. In (b) the full dual-dynamics model is graphed with the xa and xb integrated out, and corresponding states from each speaker combined into product states. The other models are special cases of this graph with different edges removed, as in Figure 1. Algonquin: The relationship between the sources and mixture in the log power spectral domain is approximated as p(yt |xa , xb ) = N (yt ; log(exp(xa ) + exp(xb )), Ψ) (4) t t t t where Ψ is introduced to model the error due to the omission of phase [4]. An iterative NewtonLaplace method accurately approximates the conditional posterior p(xa , xb |yt , sa , sb ) from (1) as t t t t Gaussian. This Gaussian allows us to analytically compute the observation likelihood p(yt |sa , sb ) t t and expected value E(xa |yt , sa , sb ), as in [4]. t t t Max model: The mixing model is simpliﬁed using the fact that log of a sum is approximately the log of the maximum: p(y|xa , xb ) = δ y − max(xa , xb ) (5) In this model the likelihood is p(yt |sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb ) + pxb (yt |sb )Φxa (yt |sa ), (6) t t t t t t t t t y t where Φxa (yt |sa ) = −∞ N (xa ; µsa , Σsa )dxa is a Gaussian cumulative distribution function [5]. t t t t t t In [5], such a model was used to compute state likelihoods and ﬁnd the optimal state sequence. In [8], a simpliﬁed model was used to infer binary masking values for reﬁltering. We take the max model a step further and derive source posteriors, so that we can compute the MMSE estimators for the log power spectrum. Note that the source posteriors in xa and xb are each t t a mixture of a delta function and a truncated Gaussian. Thus we analytically derive the necessary expected value: E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) t t t p(xa = yt |yt , sa , sb )yt + p(xa < yt |yt , sa , sb )E(xa |xa < yt , sa ) t t t t t t t t t pxa (yt |sa ) t a b , = πt yt + πt µsa − Σsa t t t Φxa (yt |sa ) t t = (7) (8) a b a with weights πt = p(xa=yt |yt , sa , sb ) = pxa (yt |sa )Φxb (yt |sb )/p(yt |sa , sb ), and πt = 1 − πt . For t t t t t t t t a ≫ µ b in a given frequency many pairs of states one model is signiﬁcantly louder than another µs s band, relative to their variances. In such cases it is reasonable to approximate the likelihood as p(yt |sa , sb ) ≈ pxa (yt |sa ), and the posterior expected values according to E(xa |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ yt and t t t t t t t E(xb |yt , sa , sb ) ≈ min(yt , µsb ), and similarly for µsa ≪ µsb . t t t t 3 Likelihood Estimation Because of the large number of state combinations, the model would not be practical without techniques to reduce computation time. To speed up the evaluation of the joint state likelihood, we employed both band quantization of the acoustic Gaussians and joint-state pruning. Band Quantization: One source of computational savings stems from the fact that some of the Gaussians in our model may differ only in a few features. Band quantization addresses this by approximating each of the D Gaussians of each model with a shared set of d Gaussians, where d ≪ D, in each of the F frequency bands of the feature vector. A similar idea is described in [9]. It relies on the use of a diagonal covariance matrix, so that p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,sa , Σf,sa ), where Σf,sa f are the diagonal elements of covariance matrix Σsa . The mapping Mf (si ) associates each of the D Gaussians with one of the d Gaussians in band f . Now p(xa |sa ) = f N (xa ; µf,Mf (sa ) , Σf,Mf (sa ) ) ˆ f is used as a surrogate for p(xa |sa ). Figure 3 illustrates the idea. Figure 3: In band quantization, many multi-dimensional Gaussians are mapped to a few unidimensional Gaussians. Under this model the d Gaussians are optimized by minimizing the KL-divergence D( sa p(sa )p(xa |sa )|| sa p(sa )ˆ(xa |sa )), and likewise for sb . Then in each frequency band, p only d×d, instead of D ×D combinations of Gaussians have to be evaluated to compute p(y|sa , sb ). Despite the relatively small number of components d in each band, taken across bands, band quantization is capable of expressing dF distinct patterns, in an F -dimensional feature space, although in practice only a subset of these will be used to approximate the Gaussians in a given model. We used d = 8 and D = 256, which reduced the likelihood computation time by three orders of magnitude. Joint State Pruning: Another source of computational savings comes from the sparseness of the model. Only a handful of sa , sb combinations have likelihoods that are signiﬁcantly larger than the rest for a given observation. Only these states are required to adequately explain the observation. By pruning the total number of combinations down to a smaller number we can speed up the likelihood calculation, estimation of the components signals, as well as the temporal inference. However, we must estimate the likelihoods in order to determine which states to retain. We therefore used band-quantization to estimate likelihoods for all states, perform state pruning, and then the full model on the pruned states using the exact parameters. In the experiments reported here, we pruned down to 256 state combinations. The effect of these speedup methods on accuracy will be reported in a future publication. 4 Inference In our experiments we performed inference in four different conditions: no dynamics, with acoustic dynamics only, with grammar dynamics only, and with dual dynamics (acoustic and grammar). With no dynamics the source models reduce to GMMs and we infer MMSE estimates of the sources based on p(xa , xb |y) as computed from (1), using Algonquin or the max model. Once the log spectrum of each source is estimated, we estimate the corresponding time-domain signal as shown in [4]. In the acoustic dynamics condition the exact inference algorithm uses a 2-Dimensional Viterbi search, described below, with acoustic temporal constraints p(st |st−1 ) and likelihoods from Eqn. (1), to ﬁnd the most likely joint state sequence s1..T . Similarly in the grammar dynamics condition, 2-D Viterbi search is used to infer the grammar state sequences, v1..T . Instead of single Gaussians as the likelihood models, however, we have mixture models in this case. So we can perform an MMSE estimate of the sources by averaging over the posterior probability of the mixture components given the grammar Viterbi sequence, and the observations. It is critical to use the 2-D Viterbi algorithm in both cases, rather than the forward-backward algorithm, because in the same-speaker condition at 0dB, the acoustic models and dynamics are symmetric. This symmetry means that the posterior is essentially bimodal and averaging over these modes would yield identical estimates for both speakers. By ﬁnding the best path through the joint state space, the 2-D Viterbi algorithm breaks this symmetry and allows the model to make different estimates for each speaker. In the dual-dynamics condition we use the model of section 2(b). With two speakers, exact inference is computationally complex because the full joint distribution of the grammar and acoustic states, (v a × sa ) × (v b × sb ) is required and is very large in number. Instead we perform approximate inference by alternating the 2-D Viterbi search between two factors: the Cartesian product sa × sb of the acoustic state sequences and the Cartesian product v a × v b of the grammar state sequences. When evaluating each state sequence we hold the other chain constant, which decouples its dynamics and allows for efﬁcient inference. This is a useful factorization because the states sa and sb interact strongly with each other and similarly for v a and v b . Again, in the same-talker condition, the 2-D Viterbi search breaks the symmetry in each factor. 2-D Viterbi search: The Viterbi algorithm estimates the maximum-likelihood state sequence s1..T given the observations x1..T . The complexity of the Viterbi search is O(T D2 ) where D is the number of states and T is the number of frames. For producing MAP estimates of the 2 sources, we require a 2 dimensional Viterbi search which ﬁnds the most likely joint state sequences sa and 1..T sb given the mixed signal y1..T as was proposed in [5]. 1..T On the surface, the 2-D Viterbi search appears to be of complexity O(T D4 ). Surprisingly, it can be computed in O(T D3 ) operations. This stems from the fact that the dynamics for each chain are independent. The forward-backward algorithm for a factorial HMM with N state variables requires only O(T N DN +1 ) rather than the O(T D2N ) required for a naive implementation [10]. The same is true for the Viterbi algorithm. In the Viterbi algorithm, we wish to ﬁnd the most probable paths leading to each state by ﬁnding the two arguments sa and sb of the following maximization: t−1 t−1 {ˆa , sb } = st−1 ˆt−1 = arg max p(sa |sa )p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ) t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 sa sb t−1 t−1 arg max p(sa |sa ) max p(sb |sb )p(sa , sb |y1..t−1 ). t t−1 t t−1 t−1 t−1 a st−1 sb t−1 (9) The two maximizations can be done in sequence, requiring O(D3 ) operations with O(D2 ) storage for each step. In general, as with the forward-backward algorithm, the N -dimensional Viterbi search requires O(T N DN +1 ) operations. We can also exploit the sparsity of the transition matrices and observation likelihoods, by pruning unlikely values. Using both of these methods our implementation of 2-D Viterbi search is faster than the acoustic likelihood computation that serves as its input, for the model sizes and grammars chosen in the speech separation task. Speaker and Gain Estimation: In the challenge task, the gains and identities of the two speakers were unknown at test time and were selected from a set of 34 speakers which were mixed at SNRs ranging from 6dB to -9dB. We used speaker-dependent acoustic models because of their advantages when separating different speakers. These models were trained on gain-normalized data, so the models are not well matched to the different gains of the signals at test time. This means that we have to estimate both the speaker identities and the gain in order to adapt our models to the source signals for each test utterance. The number of speakers and range of SNRs in the test set makes it too expensive to consider every possible combination of models and gains. Instead, we developed an efﬁcient model-based method for identifying the speakers and gains, described in [2]. The algorithm is based upon a very simple idea: identify and utilize frames that are dominated by a single source – based on their likelihoods under each speaker-dependent acoustic model – to determine what sources are present in the mixture. Using this criteria we can eliminate most of the unlikely speakers, and explore all combinations of the remaining speakers. An approximate EM procedure is then used to select a single pair of speakers and estimate their gains. Recognition: Although inference in the system may involve recognition of the words– for models that contain a grammar –we still found that a separately trained recognizer performed better. After reconstruction, each of the two signals is therefore decoded with a speech recognition system that incorporates Speaker Dependent Labeling (SDL) [2]. This method uses speaker dependent models for each of the 34 speakers. Instead of using the speaker identities provided by the speaker ID and gain module, we followed the approach for gender dependent labeling (GDL) described in [11]. This technique provides better results than if the true speaker ID is speciﬁed. 5 Results The Speech Separation Challenge [3] involves separating the mixed speech of two speakers drawn from of a set of 34 speakers. An example utterance is place white by R 4 now. In each recording, one of the speakers says white while the other says blue, red or green. The task is to recognize the letter and the digit of the speaker that said white. Using the SDL recognizer, we decoded the two estimated signals under the assumption that one signal contains white and the other does not, and vice versa. We then used the association that yielded the highest combined likelihood. 80 WER (%) 60 40 20 0 Same Talker No Separation No dynamics Same Gender Acoustic Dyn. Different Gender Grammar Dyn All Dual Dyn Human Figure 4: Average word error rate (WER) as a function of model dynamics, in different talker conditions, compared to Human error rates, using Algonquin. Human listener performance [3] is compared in Figure 4 to results using the SDL recognizer without speech separation, and for each the proposed models. Performance is poor without separation in all conditions. With no dynamics the models do surprisingly well in the different talker conditions, but poorly when the signals come from the same talker. Acoustic dynamics gives some improvement, mainly in the same-talker condition. The grammar dynamics seems to give the most beneﬁt, bringing the error rate in the same-gender condition below that of humans. The dual-dynamics model performed about the same as the grammar dynamics model, despite our intuitions. Replacing Algonquin with the max model reduced the error rate in the dual dynamics model (from 24.3% to 23.5%) and grammar dynamics model (from 24.6% to 22.6%), which brings the latter closer than any other model to the human recognition rate of 22.3%. Figure 5 shows the relative word error rate of the best system compared to human subjects. When both speakers are around the same loudness, the system exceeds human performance, and in the same-gender condition makes less than half the errors of the humans. Human listeners do better when the two signals are at different levels, even if the target is below the masker (i.e., in -9dB), suggesting that they are better able to make use of differences in amplitude as a cue for separation.

Shaded area is where the system outperforms human listeners. An interesting question is to what extent different grammar constraints affect the results. To test this, we limited the grammar to just the two test utterances, and the error rate on the estimated sources dropped to around 10%. This may be a useful paradigm for separating speech from background noise when the text is known, such as in closed-captioned recordings. At the other extreme, in realistic speech recognition scenarios, there is little knowledge of the background speaker’s grammar. In such cases the beneﬁts of models of low-level acoustic continuity over purely grammar-based systems may be more apparent. It is our hope that further experiments with both human and machine listeners will provide us with a better understanding of the differences in their performance characteristics, and provide insights into how the human auditory system functions, as well as how automatic speech perception in general can be brought to human levels of performance.

<p>Author: Amit Kagian, Gideon Dror, Tommer Leyvand, Daniel Cohen-or, Eytan Ruppin</p><p>Abstract: This work presents a method for estimating human facial attractiveness, based on supervised learning techniques. Numerous facial features that describe facial geometry, color and texture, combined with an average human attractiveness score for each facial image, are used to train various predictors. Facial attractiveness ratings produced by the final predictor are found to be highly correlated with human ratings, markedly improving previous machine learning achievements. Simulated psychophysical experiments with virtually manipulated images reveal preferences in the machine's judgments which are remarkably similar to those of humans. These experiments shed new light on existing theories of facial attractiveness such as the averageness, smoothness and symmetry hypotheses. It is intriguing to find that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as attractiveness rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases characterizing the perception of facial attractiveness in general. 1 I n trod u cti on Philosophers, artists and scientists have been trying to capture the nature of beauty since the early days of philosophy. Although in modern days a common layman's notion is that judgments of beauty are a matter of subjective opinion, recent findings suggest that people might share a common taste for facial attractiveness and that their preferences may be an innate part of the primary constitution of our nature. Several experiments have shown that 2 to 8 months old infants prefer looking at faces which adults rate as being more attractive [1]. In addition, attractiveness ratings show very high agreement between groups of raters belonging to the same culture and even across cultures [2]. Such findings give rise to the quest for common factors which determine human facial attractiveness. Accordingly, various hypotheses, from cognitive, evolutional and social perspectives, have been put forward to describe the common preferences for facial beauty. Inspired by Sir Francis Galton’s photographic method of composing faces [3], Rubenstein, Langlois and Roggman created averaged faces by morphing multiple images together and proposed that averageness is the answer for facial attractiveness [4, 5]. Human judges found these averaged faces to be attractive and rated them with attractiveness ratings higher than the mean rating of the component faces composing them. Grammer and Thornhill have investigated symmetry and averageness of faces and concluded that symmetry was more important than averageness in facial attractiveness [6]. Little and colleagues have agreed that average faces are attractive but claim that faces with certain extreme features, such as extreme sexually dimorphic traits, may be more attractive than average faces [7]. Other researchers have suggested various conditions which may contribute to facial attractiveness such as neonate features, pleasant expressions and familiarity. Cunningham and his associates suggest a multiple fitness model in which there is no single constructing line that determines attractiveness. Instead, different categories of features signal different desirable qualities of the perceived target [8]. Even so, the multiple fitness model agrees that some facial qualities are universally physically attractive to people. Apart from eliciting the facial characteristics which account for attractiveness, modern researchers try to describe underlying mechanisms for these preferences. Many contributors refer to the evolutionary origins of attractiveness preferences [9]-[11]. According to this view, facial traits signal mate quality and imply chances for reproductive success and parasite resistance. Some evolutionary theorists suggest that preferred features might not signal mate quality but that the “good taste” by itself is an evolutionary adaptation (individuals with a preference for attractiveness will have attractive offspring that will be favored as mates) [9]. Another mechanism explains attractiveness' preferences through a cognitive theory - a preference for attractive faces might be induced as a by-product of general perception or recognition mechanisms [5, 12]: Attractive faces might be pleasant to look at since they are closer to the cognitive representation of the face category in the mind. These cognitive representations are described as a part of a cognitive mechanism that abstracts prototypes from distinct classes of objects. These prototypes relate to average faces when considering the averageness hypothesis. A third view has suggested that facial attractiveness originates in a social mechanism, where preferences may be dependent on the learning history of the individual and even on his social goals [12]. Different studies have tried to use computational methods in order to analyze facial attractiveness. Averaging faces with morph tools was done in several cases (e.g. [5, 13]). In [14], laser scans of faces were put into complete correspondence with the average face in order to examine the relationship between facial attractiveness, age, and averageness. Another approach was used in [15] where a genetic algorithm, guided by interactive user selections, was programmed to evolve a “most beautiful” female face. [16] used machine learning methods to investigate whether a machine can predict attractiveness ratings by learning a mapping from facial images to their attractiveness scores. Their predictor achieved a significant correlation of 0.6 with average human ratings, demonstrating that facial beauty can be learned by a machine, at least to some degree. However, as human raters still do significantly outperform the predictor of [16], the challenge of constructing a facial attractiveness machine with human level evaluation accuracy has remained open. A primary goal of this study is to surpass these results by developing a machine which obtains human level performance in predicting facial attractiveness. Having accomplished this, our second main goal is to conduct a series of simulated psychophysical experiments and study the resemblance between human and machine judgments. This latter task carries two potential rewards: A. To determine whether the machine can aid in understanding the psychophysics of human facial attractiveness, capitalizing on the ready accessibility of the analysis of its inner workings, and B. To study whether learning an explicit operational ratings prediction task also entails learning implicit humanlike biases, at least for the case of facial attractiveness. 2 2.1 T h e f aci al trai n in g d atab as e: Acq u i s i ti on , p rep roces s i n g an d rep res en tati on Rating facial attractiveness The chosen database was composed of 91 facial images of American females, taken by the Japanese photographer Akira Gomi. All 91 samples were frontal color photographs of young Caucasian females with a neutral expression. All samples were of similar age, skin color and gender. The subjects’ portraits had no accessories or other distracting items such as jewelry. All 91 facial images in the dataset were rated for attractiveness by 28 human raters (15 males, 13 females) on a 7-point Likert scale (1 = very unattractive, 7 = very attractive). Ratings were collected with a specifically designed html interface. Each rater was asked to view the entire set before rating in order to acquire a notion of attractiveness scale. There was no time limit for judging the attractiveness of each sample and raters could go back and adjust the ratings of already rated samples. The images were presented to each rater in a random order and each image was presented on a separate page. The final attractiveness rating of each sample was its mean rating across all raters. To validate that the number of ratings collected adequately represented the ``collective attractiveness rating'' we randomly divided the raters into two disjoint groups of equal size. For each facial image, we calculated the mean rating on each group, and calculated the Pearson correlation between the mean ratings of the two groups. This process was repeated 1,000 times. The mean correlation between two groups was 0.92 ( = 0.01). This corresponds well to the known level of consistency among groups of raters reported in the literature (e.g. [2]). Hence, the mean ratings collected are stable indicators of attractiveness that can be used for the learning task. The facial set contained faces in all ranges of attractiveness. Final attractiveness ratings range from 1.42 to 5.75 and the mean rating was 3.33 ( = 0.94). 2.2 Data preprocessing and representation Preliminary experimentation with various ways of representing a facial image have systematically shown that features based on measured proportions, distances and angles of faces are most effective in capturing the notion of facial attractiveness (e.g. [16]). To extract facial features we developed an automatic engine that is capable of identifying eyes, nose, lips, eyebrows, and head contour. In total, we measured 84 coordinates describing the locations of those facial features (Figure 1). Several regions are suggested for extracting mean hair color, mean skin color and skin texture. The feature extraction process was basically automatic but some coordinates needed to be manually adjusted in some of the images. The facial coordinates are used to create a distances-vector of all 3,486 distances between all pairs of coordinates in the complete graph created by all coordinates. For each image, all distances are normalized by face length. In a similar manner, a slopes-vector of all the 3,486 slopes of the lines connecting the facial coordinates is computed. Central fluctuating asymmetry (CFA), which is described in [6], is calculated from the coordinates as well. The application also provides, for each face, Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) values of hair color and skin color, and a measurement of skin smoothness. Figure 1: Facial coordinates with hair and skin sample regions as represented by the facial feature extractor. Coordinates are used for calculating geometric features and asymmetry. Sample regions are used for calculating color values and smoothness. The sample image, used for illustration only, is of T.G. and is presented with her full consent. Combining the distances-vector and the slopes-vector yields a vector representation of 6,972 geometric features for each image. Since strong correlations are expected among the features in such representation, principal component analysis (PCA) was applied to these geometric features, producing 90 principal components which span the sub-space defined by the 91 image vector representations. The geometric features are projected on those 90 principal components and supply 90 orthogonal eigenfeatures representing the geometric features. Eight measured features were not included in the PCA analysis, including CFA, smoothness, hair color coordinates (HSV) and skin color coordinates. These features are assumed to be directly connected to human perception of facial attractiveness and are hence kept at their original values. These 8 features were added to the 90 geometric eigenfeatures, resulting in a total of 98 image-features representing each facial image in the dataset. 3 3.1 E xp eri men ts an d resu l ts Predictor construction and validation We experimented with several induction algorithms including simple Linear Regression, Least Squares Support Vector Machine (LS-SVM) (both linear as well as non-linear) and Gaussian Processes (GP). However, as the LS-SVM and GP showed no substantial advantage over Linear Regression, the latter was used and is presented in the sequel. A key ingredient in our methods is to use a proper image-features selection strategy. To this end we used subset feature selection, implemented by ranking the image-features by their Pearson correlation with the target. Other ranking functions produced no substantial gain. To measure the performance of our method we removed one sample from the whole dataset. This sample served as a test set. We found, for each left out sample, the optimal number of image-features by performing leave-one-out-cross-validation (LOOCV) on the remaining samples and selecting the number of features that minimizes the absolute difference between the algorithm's output and the targets of the training set. In other words, the score for a test example was predicted using a single model based on the training set only. This process was repeated n=91 times, once for each image sample. The vector of attractiveness predictions of all images is then compared with the true targets. These scores are found to be in a high Pearson correlation of 0.82 with the mean ratings of humans (P-value < 10 -23), which corresponds to a normalized Mean Squared Error of 0.39. This accuracy is a marked improvement over the recently published performance results of a Pearson correlation of 0.6 on a similar dataset [16]. The average correlation of an individual human rater to the mean correlations of all other raters in our dataset is 0.67 and the average correlation between the mean ratings of groups of raters is 0.92 (section 2.1). It should be noted that we tried to use this feature selection and training procedure with the original geometric features instead of the eigenfeatures, ranking them by their correlation to the targets and selecting up to 300 best ranked features. This, however, has failed to produce good predictors due to strong correlations between the original geometric features (maximal Pearson correlation obtained was 0.26). 3.2 S i m i l a r i t y o f ma c h i n e a n d h u m a n j u d g m e n t s Each rater (human and machine) has a 91 dimensional rating vector describing its Figure 2: Distribution of mean Euclidean distance from each human rater to all other raters in the ratings space. The machine’s average distance form all other raters (left bar) is smaller than the average distance of each of the human raters to all others. attractiveness ratings of all 91 images. These vectors can be embedded in a 91 dimensional ratings space. The Euclidian distance between all raters (human and machine) in this space was computed. Compared with each of the human raters, the ratings of the machine were the closest, on average, to the ratings of all other human raters (Figure 2). To verify that the machine ratings are not outliers that fall out of clusters of human raters (even though their mean distance from the other ratings is small) we surrounded each of the rating vectors in the ratings space with multidimensional spheres of several radius sizes. The machine had more human neighbors than the mean number of neighbors of human raters, testifying that it does not fall between clusters. Finally, for a graphic display of machine ratings among human ratings we applied PCA to machine and human ratings in the rating space and projected all ratings onto the resulting first 2 and 3 principal components. Indeed, the machine is well placed in a mid-zone of human raters (Figure 3). 5 Machine 0 Machine 0 -4 -8 -5 7 5 0 -10 -10 -5 0 5 10 (a) 0 -7 -5 (b) Figure 3: Location of machine ratings among the 28 human ratings: Ratings were projected into 2 dimensions (a) and 3 dimensions (b) by performing PCA on all ratings and projecting them on the first principal components. The projected data explain 29.8% of the variance in (a) and 36.6% in (b). 3.3 Psychophysical experiments in silico A number of simulated psychophysical experiments reveal humanlike biases of the machine's performance. Rubenstein et al. discuss a morphing technique to create mathematically averaged faces from multiple face images [5]. They reported that averaged faces made of 16 and 32 original component images were rated higher in attractiveness than the mean attractiveness ratings of their component faces and higher than composites consisting of fewer faces. In their experiment, 32-component composites were found to be the most attractive. We used a similar technique to create averaged virtually-morphed faces with various numbers of components, nc, and have let the machine predict their attractiveness. To this end, coordinate values of the original component faces were averaged to create a new set of coordinates for the composite. These coordinates were used to calculate the geometrical features and CFA of the averaged face. Smoothness and HSV values for the composite faces were calculated by averaging the corresponding values of the component faces 1. To study the effect of nc on the attractiveness score we produced 1,000 virtual morph images for each value of n c between 2 and 50, and used our attractiveness predictor (section 3.1) to compute the attractiveness scores of the resulting composites. In accordance with the experimental results of [5], the machine manifests a humanlike bias for higher scores of averaged composites over their components’ mean score. Figure 4a, presenting these results, shows the percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite, for each number of components n c. As evident, the attractiveness rating of a composite surpasses a larger percent of its components’ ratings as nc increases. Figure 4a also shows the mean scores of 1,000 1 HSV values are converted to RGB before averaging composites and the mean scores of their components, for each n c (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]). Their actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1. As expected, the mean scores of the components images are independent of n c, while composites’ scores increase with nc. Mean values of smoothness and asymmetry of the composites are presented in Figure 4b. 0.4 Smoothness Asymmetry 0.8 0.2 0.75 0 -0.2 0.7 -0.4 0.65 -0.6 0.6 Fraction of less attractive components Composite's score (normalized) Components' mean score (normalized) 0.55 2 10 20 30 40 -0.8 50 -1 2 Number of components in composite 10 20 30 40 50 Number of components in composite (a) (b) Figure 4: Mean results over 1,000 composites made of varying numbers of image components: (a) Percent of components which were rated as less attractive than their corresponding composite accompanied with mean scores of composites and the mean scores of their components (scores are normalized to the range [0, 1]. actual attractiveness scores are reported in Table 1).

Since blurring and smoothing of faces occur when faces are averaged together [5], the smooth complexion of composites may underlie the attractiveness of averaged composites. In our experiment, a preference for averageness is found even though our method of virtual-morphing does not produce the smoothening effect and the mean smoothness value of composites corresponds to the mean smoothness value in the original dataset, for all nc (see Figure 4b). Researchers have also suggested that averaged faces are attractive since they are exceptionally symmetric [18]. Figure 4b shows that the mean level of asymmetry is indeed highly correlated with the mean scores of the morphs (Pearson correlation of -0.91, P-value < 10 -19). However, examining the correlation between the rest of the features and the composites' scores reveals that this high correlation is not at all unique to asymmetry. In fact, 45 of the 98 features are strongly correlated with attractiveness scores (|Pearson correlation| > 0.9). The high correlation between these numerous features and attractiveness scores of averaged faces indicates that symmetry level is not an exceptional factor in the machine’s preference for averaged faces. Instead, it suggests that averaging causes many features, including both geometric features and symmetry, to change in a direction which causes an increase in attractiveness. It has been argued that although averaged faces are found to be attractive, very attractive faces are not average [18]. A virtual composite made of the 12 most attractive faces in the set (as rated by humans) was rated by the machine with a high score of 5.6 while 1,000 composites made of 50 faces got a maximum score of only 5.3. This type of preference resembles the findings of an experiment by Perrett et al. in which a highly attractive composite, morphed from only attractive faces, was preferred by humans over a composite made of 60 images of all levels of attractiveness [13]. Another study by Zaidel et al. examined the asymmetry of attractiveness perception and offered a relationship between facial attractiveness and hemispheric specialization [19]. In this research right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created by attaching each half of the face to its mirror image. Subjects were asked to look at left-left and right-right composites of the same image and judge which one is more attractive. For women’s faces, right-right composites got twice as many ‘more attractive’ responses than left-left composites. Interestingly, similar results were found when simulating the same experiment with the machine: Right-right and left-left chimeric composites were created from the extracted coordinates of each image and the machine was used to predict their attractiveness ratings (taking care to exclude the original image used for the chimeric composition from the training set, as it contains many features which are identical to those of the composite). The machine gave 63 out of 91 right-right composites a higher rating than their matching left-left composite, while only 28 left-left composites were judged as more attractive. A paired t-test shows these results to be statistically significant with P-value < 10 -7 (scores of chimeric composites are normally distributed). It is interesting to see that the machine manifests the same kind of asymmetry bias reported by Zaidel et al, though it has never been explicitly trained for that. 4 Di s cu s s i on In this work we produced a high quality training set for learning facial attractiveness of human faces. Using supervised learning methodologies we were able to construct the first predictor that achieves accurate, humanlike performance for this task. Our results add the task of facial attractiveness prediction to a collection of abstract tasks that has been successfully accomplished with current machine learning techniques. Examining the machine and human raters' representations in the ratings space identifies the ratings of the machine in the center of human raters, and closest, in average, to other human raters. The similarity between human and machine preferences has prompted us to further study the machine’s operation in order to capitalize on the accessibility of its inner workings and learn more about human perception of facial attractiveness. To this end, we have found that that the machine favors averaged faces made of several component faces. While this preference is known to be common to humans as well, researchers have previously offered different reasons for favoring averageness. Our analysis has revealed that symmetry is strongly related to the attractiveness of averaged faces, but is definitely not the only factor in the equation since about half of the image-features relate to the ratings of averaged composites in a similar manner as the symmetry measure. This suggests that a general movement of features toward attractiveness, rather than a simple increase in symmetry, is responsible for the attractiveness of averaged faces. Obviously, strictly speaking this can be held true only for the machine, but, in due of the remarkable ``humnalike'' behavior of the machine, it also brings important support to the idea that this finding may well extend also to human perception of facial attractiveness. Overall, it is quite surprising and pleasing to see that a machine trained explicitly to capture an operational performance criteria such as rating, implicitly captures basic human psychophysical biases related to facial attractiveness. It is likely that while the machine learns the ratings in an explicit supervised manner, it also concomitantly and implicitly learns other basic characteristics of human facial ratings, as revealed by studying its</p><p>3 0.54968792 <a title="176-lda-3" href="./nips-2006-Fast_Iterative_Kernel_PCA.html">79 nips-2006-Fast Iterative Kernel PCA</a></p>
<p>Author: Nicol N. Schraudolph, Simon Günter, S.v.n. Vishwanathan</p><p>Abstract: We introduce two methods to improve convergence of the Kernel Hebbian Algorithm (KHA) for iterative kernel PCA. KHA has a scalar gain parameter which is either held constant or decreased as 1/t, leading to slow convergence. Our KHA/et algorithm accelerates KHA by incorporating the reciprocal of the current estimated eigenvalues as a gain vector. We then derive and apply Stochastic MetaDescent (SMD) to KHA/et; this further speeds convergence by performing gain adaptation in RKHS. Experimental results for kernel PCA and spectral clustering of USPS digits as well as motion capture and image de-noising problems conﬁrm that our methods converge substantially faster than conventional KHA. 1</p><p>4 0.39643425 <a title="176-lda-4" href="./nips-2006-Correcting_Sample_Selection_Bias_by_Unlabeled_Data.html">62 nips-2006-Correcting Sample Selection Bias by Unlabeled Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Graham W. Taylor, Geoffrey E. Hinton, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear generative model for human motion data that uses an undirected model with binary latent variables and real-valued “visible” variables that represent joint angles. The latent and visible variables at each time step receive directed connections from the visible variables at the last few time-steps. Such an architecture makes on-line inference efﬁcient and allows us to use a simple approximate learning procedure. After training, the model ﬁnds a single set of parameters that simultaneously capture several different kinds of motion. We demonstrate the power of our approach by synthesizing various motion sequences and by performing on-line ﬁlling in of data lost during motion capture.

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2011-18-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4485-action-gap-phenomenon-in-reinforcement-learning.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Amir-massoud Farahmand</p><p>Abstract: Many practitioners of reinforcement learning problems have observed that oftentimes the performance of the agent reaches very close to the optimal performance even though the estimated (action-)value function is still far from the optimal one. The goal of this paper is to explain and formalize this phenomenon by introducing the concept of the action-gap regularity. As a typical result, we prove that for an ˆ agent following the greedy policy π with respect to an action-value function Q, the ˆ ˆ ˆ performance loss E V ∗ (X) − V π (X) is upper bounded by O( Q − Q∗ 1+ζ ), ∞ in which ζ ≥ 0 is the parameter quantifying the action-gap regularity. For ζ > 0, our results indicate smaller performance loss compared to what previous analyses had suggested. Finally, we show how this regularity affects the performance of the family of approximate value iteration algorithms. 1</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2011-225-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4284-probabilistic-amplitude-and-frequency-demodulation.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Richard Turner, Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: A number of recent scientiﬁc and engineering problems require signals to be decomposed into a product of a slowly varying positive envelope and a quickly varying carrier whose instantaneous frequency also varies slowly over time. Although signal processing provides algorithms for so-called amplitude- and frequencydemodulation (AFD), there are well known problems with all of the existing methods. Motivated by the fact that AFD is ill-posed, we approach the problem using probabilistic inference. The new approach, called probabilistic amplitude and frequency demodulation (PAFD), models instantaneous frequency using an auto-regressive generalization of the von Mises distribution, and the envelopes using Gaussian auto-regressive dynamics with a positivity constraint. A novel form of expectation propagation is used for inference. We demonstrate that although PAFD is computationally demanding, it outperforms previous approaches on synthetic and real signals in clean, noisy and missing data settings. 1</p><br/>

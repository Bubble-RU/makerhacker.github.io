<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2011-213-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4185-phase-transition-in-the-family-of-p-resistances.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Morteza Alamgir, Ulrike V. Luxburg</p><p>Abstract: We study the family of p-resistances on graphs for p 1. This family generalizes the standard resistance distance. We prove that for any ﬁxed graph, for p = 1 the p-resistance coincides with the shortest path distance, for p = 2 it coincides with the standard resistance distance, and for p ! 1 it converges to the inverse of the minimal s-t-cut in the graph. Secondly, we consider the special case of random geometric graphs (such as k-nearest neighbor graphs) when the number n of vertices in the graph tends to inﬁnity. We prove that an interesting phase transition takes place. There exist two critical thresholds p⇤ and p⇤⇤ such that if p < p⇤ , then the p-resistance depends on meaningful global properties of the graph, whereas if p > p⇤⇤ , it only depends on trivial local quantities and does not convey any useful information. We can explicitly compute the critical values: p⇤ = 1 + 1/(d 1) and p⇤⇤ = 1 + 1/(d 2) where d is the dimension of the underlying space (we believe that the fact that there is a small gap between p⇤ and p⇤⇤ is an artifact of our proofs). We also relate our ﬁndings to Laplacian regularization and suggest to use q-Laplacians as regularizers, where q satisﬁes 1/p⇤ + 1/q = 1. 1</p><br/>

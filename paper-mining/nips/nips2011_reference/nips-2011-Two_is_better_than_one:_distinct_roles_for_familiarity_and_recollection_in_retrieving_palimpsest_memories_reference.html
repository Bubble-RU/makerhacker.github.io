<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2011-292-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4364-two-is-better-than-one-distinct-roles-for-familiarity-and-recollection-in-retrieving-palimpsest-memories.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Cristina Savin, Peter Dayan, Máté Lengyel</p><p>Abstract: Storing a new pattern in a palimpsest memory system comes at the cost of interfering with the memory traces of previously stored items. Knowing the age of a pattern thus becomes critical for recalling it faithfully. This implies that there should be a tight coupling between estimates of age, as a form of familiarity, and the neural dynamics of recollection, something which current theories omit. Using a normative model of autoassociative memory, we show that a dual memory system, consisting of two interacting modules for familiarity and recollection, has best performance for both recollection and recognition. This ﬁnding provides a new window onto actively contentious psychological and neural aspects of recognition memory. 1</p><br/>

<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We discuss an idea for collecting data in a relatively efﬁcient manner. Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual information between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quantiﬁes the effectiveness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadaptive experimental design. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative efﬁciency of the “staircase method” widely employed in psychophysics research, and to demonstrate the dependence of this efﬁciency on the form of the “psychometric function” underlying the output responses. 1</p><p>5 0.10749737 <a title="103-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Information_Maximization_in_Noisy_Channels_%3A_A_Variational_Approach.html">94 nips-2003-Information Maximization in Noisy Channels : A Variational Approach</a></p>

We approach the diﬃculty of computing the mutual information for noisy channels by using a variational approximation. The resulting IM algorithm is analagous to the EM algorithm, yet maximises mutual information, as opposed to likelihood. We apply the method to several practical examples, including linear compression, population encoding and CDMA. 1</p><p>6 0.1058797 <a title="103-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Large_Margin_Classifiers%3A_Convex_Loss%2C_Low_Noise%2C_and_Convergence_Rates.html">101 nips-2003-Large Margin Classifiers: Convex Loss, Low Noise, and Convergence Rates</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Derbeko, Ran El-Yaniv, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with transductive learning. Although transduction appears to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many provably useful algorithms and bounds for transduction. We present explicit error bounds for transduction and derive a general technique for devising bounds within this setting. The technique is applied to derive error bounds for compression schemes such as (transductive) SVMs and for transduction algorithms based on clustering. 1 Introduction and Related Work In contrast to inductive learning, in the transductive setting the learner is given both the training and test sets prior to learning. The goal of the learner is to infer (or “transduce”) the labels of the test points. The transduction setting was introduced by Vapnik [1, 2] who proposed basic bounds and an algorithm for this setting. Clearly, inferring the labels of points in the test set can be done using an inductive scheme. However, as pointed out in [2], it makes little sense to solve an easier problem by ‘reducing’ it to a much more difﬁcult one. In particular, the prior knowledge carried by the (unlabeled) test points can be incorporated into an algorithm, potentially leading to superior performance. Indeed, a number of papers have demonstrated empirically that transduction can offer substantial advantage over induction whenever the training set is small or moderate (see e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]). However, unlike the current state of affairs in induction, the question of what are provably effective learning principles for transduction is quite far from being resolved. In this paper we provide new error bounds and a general technique for transductive learning. Our technique is based on bounds that can be viewed as an extension of McAllester’s PAC-Bayesian framework [7, 8] to transductive learning. The main advantage of using this framework in transduction is that here priors can be selected after observing the unlabeled data (but before observing the labeled sample). This ﬂexibility allows for the choice of “compact priors” (with small support) and therefore, for tight bounds. Another simple observation is that the PAC-Bayesian framework can be operated with polynomially (in m, the training sample size) many different priors simultaneously. Altogether, this added ﬂexibility, of using data-dependent multiple priors allows for easy derivation of tight error bounds for “compression schemes” such as (transductive) SVMs and for clustering algorithms. We brieﬂy review some previous results. The idea of transduction, and a speciﬁc algorithm for SVM transductive learning, was introduced and studied by Vapnik (e.g. [2]), where an error bound is also proposed. However, this bound is implicit and rather unwieldy and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been applied in practical situations. A PAC-Bayes bound [7] for transduction with Perceptron Decision Trees is given in [9]. The bound is data-dependent depending on the number of decision nodes, the margins at each node and the sample size. However, the authors state that the transduction bound is not much tighter than the induction bound. Empirical tests show that this transduction algorithm performs slightly better than induction in terms of the test error, however, the advantage is usually statistically insigniﬁcant. Reﬁning the algorithm of [2] a transductive algorithm based on a SVMs is proposed in [3]. The paper also provides empirical tests indicating that transduction is advantageous in the text categorization domain. An error bound for transduction, based on the effective VC Dimension, is given in [10]. More recently Lanckriet et al. [11] derived a transductive bound for kernel methods based on spectral properties of the kernel matrix. Blum and Langford [12] recently also established an implicit bound for transduction, in the spirit of the results in [2]. 2 The Transduction Setup We consider the following setting proposed by Vapnik ([2] Chp. 8), which for simplicity is described in the context of binary classiﬁcation (the general case will be discussed in the full paper). Let H be a set of binary hypotheses consisting of functions from input space X to {±1} and let Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } be a set of points from X each of which is chosen i.i.d. according to some unknown distribution µ(x). We call Xm+u the full sample. Let Xm = {x1 , . . . , xm } and Ym = {y1 , . . . , ym }, where Xm is drawn uniformly from Xm+u and yi ∈ {±1}. The set Sm = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} is referred to as a training sample. In this paper we assume that yi = φ(xi ) for some unknown function φ. The remaining subset Xu = Xm+u \ Xm is referred to as the unlabeled sample. Based on Sm and Xu our goal is to choose h ∈ H which predicts the labels of points in Xu as accurately as possible. For each h ∈ H and a set Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| of samples deﬁne 1 Rh (Z) = |Z| |Z| (h(xi ), yi ), (1) i=1 where in our case (·, ·) is the zero-one loss function. Our goal in transduction is to learn an h such that Rh (Xu ) is as small as possible. This problem setup is summarized by the following transduction “protocol” introduced in [2] and referred to as Setting 1: (i) A full sample Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } consisting of arbitrary m + u points is given.1 (ii) We then choose uniformly at random the training sample Xm ⊆ Xm+u and receive its labeling Ym ; the resulting training set is Sm = (Xm , Ym ) and the remaining set Xu is the unlabeled sample, Xu = Xm+u \ Xm ; (iii) Using both Sm and Xu we select a classiﬁer h ∈ H whose quality is measured by Rh (Xu ). Vapnik [2] also considers another formulation of transduction, referred to as Setting 2: (i) We are given a training set Sm = (Xm , Ym ) selected i.i.d according to µ(x, y). (ii) An independent test set Su = (Xu , Yu ) of u samples is then selected in the same manner. 1 The original Setting 1, as proposed by Vapnik, discusses a full sample whose points are chosen independently at random according to some source distribution µ(x). (iii) We are required to choose our best h ∈ H based on Sm and Xu so as to minimize m+u Rm,u (h) = 1 (h(xi ), yi ) dµ(x1 , y1 ) · · · dµ(xm+u , ym+u ). u i=m+1 (2) Even though Setting 2 may appear more applicable in practical situations than Setting 1, the derivation of theoretical results can be easier within Setting 1. Nevertheless, as far as the expected losses are concerned, Vapnik [2] shows that an error bound in Setting 1 implies an equivalent bound in Setting 2. In view of this result we restrict ourselves in the sequel to Setting 1. We make use of the following quantities, which are all instances of (1). The quantity Rh (Xm+u ) is called the full sample risk of the hypothesis h, Rh (Xu ) is referred to as the transduction risk (of h), and Rh (Xm ) is the training error (of h). Thus, Rh (Xm ) is ˆ the standard training error denoted by Rh (Sm ). While our objective in transduction is to achieve small error over the unlabeled set (i.e. to minimize Rh (Xu )), it turns out that it is much easier to derive error bounds for the full sample risk. The following simple lemma translates an error bound on Rh (Xm+u ), the full sample risk, to an error bound on the transduction risk Rh (Xu ). Lemma 2.1 For any h ∈ H and any C ˆ Rh (Xm+u ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C ⇔ ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + m+u · C. u (3) Proof: For any h Rh (Xm+u ) = mRh (Xm ) + uRh (Xu ) . m+u (4) ˆ Substituting Rh (Sm ) for Rh (Xm ) in (4) and then substituting the result for the left-hand side of (3) we get Rh (Xm+u ) = ˆ mRh (Sm ) + uRh (Xu ) ˆ ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C. m+u The equivalence (3) is now obtained by isolating Rh (Xu ) on the left-hand side. 2 3 General Error Bounds for Transduction Consider a hypothesis class H and assume for simplicity that H is countable; in fact, in the case of transduction it sufﬁces to consider a ﬁnite hypothesis class. To see this note that all m + u points are known in advance. Thus, in the case of binary classiﬁcation (for example) it sufﬁces to consider at most 2m+u possible dichotomies. Recall that in the setting considered we select a sub-sample of m points from the set Xm+u of cardinality m+u. This corresponds to a selection of m points without replacement from a set of m+u points, leading to the m points being dependent. A naive utilization of large deviation bounds would therefore not be directly applicable in this setting. However, Hoeffding (see Theorem 4 in [13]) pointed out a simple procedure to transform the problem into one involving independent data. While this procedure leads to non-trivial bounds, it does not fully take advantage of the transductive setting and will not be used here. Consider for simplicity the case of binary classiﬁcation. In this case we make use of the following concentration inequality, based on [14]. Theorem 3.1 Let C = {c1 , . . . , cN }, ci ∈ {0, 1}, be a ﬁnite set of binary numbers, and N set c = (1/N ) i=1 ci . Let Z1 , . . . , Zm , be random variables obtaining their values ¯ by sampling C uniformly at random without replacement. Set Z = (1/m) β = m/N . Then, if 2 ε ≤ min{1 − c, c(1 − β)/β}, ¯¯ Pr {Z − EZ > ε} ≤ exp −mD(¯ + ε c) − (N − m) D c − c ¯ ¯ m i=1 Zi and βε c + 7 log(N + 1) ¯ 1−β where D(p q) = p log(p/q) = (1 − p) log(1 − p)/(1 − q), p, q, ∈ [0, 1] is the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using this result we obtain the following error bound for transductive classiﬁcation. Theorem 3.2 Let Xm+u = Xm ∪Xu be the full sample and let p = p(Xm+u ) be a (prior) distribution over the class of binary hypotheses H that may depend on the full sample. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm (from the full sample) the following bound holds for any h ∈ H, ˆ 2Rh (Sm )(m + u) u ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + + 2 log 1 p(h) log + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 1 p(h) . (5) Proof: (sketch) In our transduction setting the set Xm (and therefore Sm ) is obtained by sampling the full sample Xm+u uniformly at random without replacement. We ﬁrst claim that ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = Rh (Xm+u ), (6) where EΣm (·) is the expectation with respect to a random choice of Sm from Xm+u without replacement. This is shown as follows. ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = 1 m+u m ˆ Rh (Sm ) = Sm 1 m+u m Xm ⊆Xm+n 1 m (h(x), φ(x)). x∈Sm By symmetry, all points x ∈ Xm+u are counted on the right-hand side an equal number of times; this number is precisely m+u − m+u−1 = m+u−1 . The equality (6) is obtained m m m−1 m by considering the deﬁnition of Rh (Xm+u ) and noting that m+u−1 / m+u = m+u . m−1 m The remainder of the proof combines Theorem 3.1 and the techniques presented in [15]. The details will be provided in the full paper. 2 ˆ Notice that when Rh (Sm ) → 0 the square root in (5) vanishes and faster rates are obtained. An important feature of Theorem 3.2 is that it allows one to use the sample Xm+u in order to choose the prior distribution p(h). This advantage has already been alluded to in [2], but does not seem to have been widely used in practice. Additionally, observe that (5) holds with probability at least 1 − δ with respect to the random selection of sub-samples of size m from the ﬁxed set Xm+u . This should be contrasted with the standard inductive setting results where the probabilities are with respect to a random choice of m training points chosen i.i.d. from µ(x, y). The next bound we present is analogous to McAllester’s Theorem 1 in [8]. This theorem concerns Gibbs composite classiﬁers, which are distributions over the base classiﬁers in H. For any distribution q over H denote by Gq the Gibbs classiﬁer, which classiﬁes an 2 The second condition, ε ≤ c(1 − β)/β, simply guarantees that the number of ‘ones’ in the ¯ sub-sample does not exceed their number in the original sample. , instance (in Xu ) by randomly choosing, according to q, one hypothesis h ∈ H. For Gibbs classiﬁers we now extend deﬁnition (1) as follows. Let Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| be any set of samples and let Gq be a Gibbs classiﬁer over H. The risk of Gq over Z is RGq (Z) = Eh∼q (1/|Z|) |Z| i=1 (h(xi ), φ(xi )) . As before, when Z = Xm (the training set) we ˆ use the standard notation RGq (Sm ) = RGq (Xm ). Due to space limitations, the proof of the following theorem will appear in the full paper. Theorem 3.3 Let Xm+u be the full sample. Let p be a distribution over H that may depend on Xm+u and let q be a (posterior) distribution over H that may depend on both Sm and Xu . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. With probability at least 1 − δ over the choices of Sm for any distribution q ˆ RGq (Xu ) ≤ RGq (Sm ) + + ˆ 2RGq (Sm )(m + u) u D(q p) + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 7 2 D(q p) + ln m + m log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 . In the context of inductive learning, a major obstacle in generating meaningful and effective bounds using the PAC-Bayesian framework [8] is the construction of “compact priors”. Here we discuss two extensions to the PAC-Bayesian scheme, which together allow for easy choices of compact priors that can yield tight error bounds. The ﬁrst extension we offer is the use of multiple priors. Instead of a single prior p in the original PACBayesian framework we observe that one can use all PAC-Bayesian bounds with a number of priors p1 , . . . , pk and then replace the complexity term ln(1/p(h)) (in Theorem 3.2) by mini ln(1/pi (h)), at a cost of an additional ln k term (see below). Similarly, in Theorem 3.3 we can replace the KL-divergence term in the bound with mini D(q||pi ). The penalty for using k priors is logarithmic in k (speciﬁcally the ln(1/δ) term in the original bound becomes ln(k/δ)). As long as k is sub-exponential in m we still obtain effective generalization bounds. The second “extension” is simply the feature of our transduction bounds (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3), which allows for the priors to be dependent on the full sample Xm+u . The combination of these two simple ideas yields a powerful technique for deriving error bounds in realistic transductive settings. After stating the extended result we later use it for deriving tight bounds for known learning algorithms and for deriving new algorithms. Suppose that instead of a single prior p over H we want to utilize k priors, p1 , . . . , pk and in retrospect choose the best among the k corresponding PAC-Bayesian bounds. The following theorem shows that one can use polynomially many priors with a minor penalty. The proof, which is omitted due to space limitations, utilizes the union bound in a straightforward manner. Theorem 3.4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.2 hold, except that we now have k prior distributions p1 , . . . , pk deﬁned over H, each of which may depend on Xm+u . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over random choices of sub-samples of size m from the full-sample, for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with p(h) replaced by min1≤i≤k pi (h) and log 1 is replaced by log k . δ δ Remark: A similar result holds for the Gibbs algorithm of Theorem 3.3. Also, as noted by one of the reviewers, when the supports of the k priors intersect (i.e. there is at least one pair of priors pi and pj with overlapping support), then one can do better by utilizing the 1 “super prior” p = k i pi within the original Theorem 3.2. However, note that when the supports are disjoint, these two views (of multiple priors and a super prior) are equivalent. In the applications below we utilize non-intersecting priors. 4 Bounds for Compression Algorithms Here we propose a technique for bounding the error of “compression” algorithms based on appropriate construction of prior probabilities. Let A be a learning algorithm. Intuitively, A is a “compression scheme” if it can generate the same hypothesis using a subset of the data. More formally, a learning algorithm A (viewed as a function from samples to some hypothesis class) is a compression scheme with respect to a sample Z if there is a subsample Z , Z ⊂ Z, such that A(Z ) = A(Z). Observe that the SVM approach is a compression scheme, with Z being determined by the set of support vectors. Let A be a deterministic compression scheme and consider the full sample Xm+u . For each integer τ = 1, . . . , m, consider all subsets of Xm+u of size τ , and for each subset construct all possible dichotomies of that subset (note that we are not proposing this approach as an algorithm, but rather as a means to derive bounds; in practice one need not construct all these dichotomies). A deterministic algorithm A uniquely determines at most one hypothesis h ∈ H for each dichotomy.3 For each τ , let the set of hypotheses generated by this procedure be denoted by Hτ . For the rest of this discussion we assume the worst case where |Hτ | = m+u (i.e. if Hτ does not contains one hypothesis for each dichotomy τ the bounds improve). The prior pτ is then deﬁned to be a uniform distribution over Hτ . In this way we have m priors, p1 , . . . , pm which are constructed using only Xm+u (and are independent of Sm ). Any hypothesis selected by the learning algorithm A based on the labeled sample Sm and on the test set Xu belongs to ∪m Hτ . The motivation for this τ =1 construction is as follows. Each τ can be viewed as our “guess” for the maximal number of compression points that will be utilized by a resulting classiﬁer. For each such τ the prior pτ is constructed over all possible classiﬁers that use τ compression points. By systematically considering all possible dichotomies of τ points we can characterize a relatively small subset of H without observing labels of the training points. Thus, each prior pτ represents one such guess. Using Theorem 3.4 we are later allowed to choose in retrospect the bound corresponding to the best “guess”. The following corollary identiﬁes an upper bound on the divergence in terms of the observed size of the compression set of the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Corollary 4.1 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.4 hold. Let A be a deterministic learning algorithm leading to a hypothesis h ∈ H based on a compression set of size s. Then with probability at least 1 − δ for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by s log(2e(m + u)/s) and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(m2 /δ). Proof: Recall that Hs ⊆ H is the support set of ps and that ps (h) = 1/|Hs | for all h ∈ Hs , implying that ln(1/ps (h)) = |Hs |. Using the inequality m+u ≤ (e(m + u)/s)s s we have that |Hs | = 2s m+u ≤ (2e(m + u)/s)s . Substituting this result in Theorem 3.4 s while restricting the minimum over i to be over i ≥ s, leads to the desired result. 2 The bound of Corollary 4.1 can be easily computed once the classiﬁer is trained. If the size of the compression set happens to be small, we obtain a tight bound. SVM classiﬁcation is one of the best studied compression schemes. The compression set for a sample Sm is given by the subset of support vectors. Thus the bound in Corollary 4.1 immediately applies with s being the number of observed support vectors (after training). We note that this bound is similar to a recently derived compression bound for inductive learning (Theorem 5.18 in [16]). Also, observe that the algorithm itself (inductive SVM) did not use in this case the unlabeled sample (although the bound does use this sample). Nevertheless, using exactly the same technique we obtain error bounds for the transductive SVM algorithms in [2, 3].4 3 It might be that for some dichotomies the algorithm will fail. For example, an SVM in feature space without soft margin will fail to classify non linearly-separable dichotomies of Xm+u . 4 Note however that our bounds are optimized with a “minimum number of support vectors” approach rather than “maximum margin”. 5 Bounds for Clustering Algorithms Some learning problems do not allow for high compression rates using compression schemes such as SVMs (i.e. the number of support vectors can sometimes be very large). A considerably stronger type of compression can often be achieved by clustering algorithms. While there is lack of formal links between entirely unsupervised clustering and classiﬁcation, within a transduction setting we can provide a principled approach to using clustering algorithms for classiﬁcation. Let A be any (deterministic) clustering algorithm which, given the full sample Xm+u , can cluster this sample into any desired number of clusters. We use A to cluster Xm+u into 2, 3 . . . , c clusters where c ≤ m. Thus, the algorithm generates a collection of partitions of Xm+u into τ = 2, 3, . . . , c clusters, where each partition is denoted by Cτ . For each value of τ , let Hτ consist of those hypotheses which assign an identical label to all points in the same cluster of partition Cτ , and deﬁne the prior pτ (h) = 1/2τ for each h ∈ Hτ and zero otherwise (note that there are 2τ possible dichotomies). The learning algorithm selects a hypothesis as follows. Upon observing the labeled sample Sm = (Xm , Ym ), for each of the clusterings C2 , . . . , Cc constructed above, it assigns a label to each cluster based on the majority vote from the labels Ym of points falling within the cluster (in case of ties, or if no points from Xm belong to the cluster, choose a label arbitrarily). Doing this leads to c − 1 classiﬁers hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c. For each hτ there is a valid error bound as given by Theorem 3.4 and all these bounds are valid simultaneously. Thus we choose the best classiﬁer (equivalently, number of clusters) for which the best bound holds. We thus have the following corollary of Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 2.1. Corollary 5.1 Let A be any clustering algorithm and let hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c be classiﬁcations of test set Xu as determined by clustering of the full sample Xm+u (into τ clusters) and the training set Sm , as described above. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, for all τ , (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by τ and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(mc/δ). Error bounds obtained using Corollary 5.1 can be rather tight when the clustering algorithm is successful (i.e. when it captures the class structure in the data using a small number of clusters). Corollary 5.1 can be extended in a number of ways. One simple extension is the use of an ensemble of clustering algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we can concurrently apply k clustering algorithm (using each algorithm to cluster the data into τ = 2, . . . , c clusters). We thus obtain kc hypotheses (partitions of Xm+u ). By a simple application of the union bound we can replace ln cm by ln kcm in Corollary 5.1 and guarantee that kc bounds hold siδ δ multaneously for all kc hypotheses (with probability at least 1 − δ). We thus choose the hypothesis which minimizes the resulting bound. This extension is particularly attractive since typically without prior knowledge we do not know which clustering algorithm will be effective for the dataset at hand. 6 Concluding Remarks We presented new bounds for transductive learning algorithms. We also developed a new technique for deriving tight error bounds for compression schemes and for clustering algorithms in the transductive setting. We expect that these bounds and new techniques will be useful for deriving new error bounds for other known algorithms and for deriving new types of transductive learning algorithms. It would be interesting to see if tighter transduction bounds can be obtained by reducing the “slacks” in the inequalities we use in our analysis. Another promising direction is the construction of better (multiple) priors. For example, in our compression bound (Corollary 4.1), for each number of compression points we assigned the same prior to each possible point subset and each possible dichotomy. However, in practice a vast majority of all these subsets and dichotomies are unlikely to occur.

<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We discuss an idea for collecting data in a relatively efﬁcient manner. Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual information between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quantiﬁes the effectiveness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadaptive experimental design. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative efﬁciency of the “staircase method” widely employed in psychophysics research, and to demonstrate the dependence of this efﬁciency on the form of the “psychometric function” underlying the output responses. 1</p><p>6 0.43977255 <a title="103-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-An_Infinity-sample_Theory_for_Multi-category_Large_Margin_Classification.html">23 nips-2003-An Infinity-sample Theory for Multi-category Large Margin Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we obtain convergence bounds for the concentration of Bayesian posterior distributions (around the true distribution) using a novel method that simpliﬁes and enhances previous results. Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distribution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist “bad” prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.7343272 <a title="103-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Information_Bottleneck_for_Gaussian_Variables.html">92 nips-2003-Information Bottleneck for Gaussian Variables</a></p>
<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, Naftali Tishby, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data was addressed through the information bottleneck (IB) method, by (soft) clustering one variable while preserving information about another - relevance - variable. An interesting question addressed in the current work is the extension of these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than discrete clusters. We give a formal deﬁnition of the general continuous IB problem and obtain an analytic solution for the optimal representation for the important case of multivariate Gaussian variables. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized correlation matrix Σx|y Σ−1 , which x is also the basis obtained in Canonical Correlation Analysis. However, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeoﬀ parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of diﬀerent ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides an analytic expression for the optimal tradeoﬀ - the information curve - in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum. 1</p><p>4 0.72627574 <a title="103-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Decoding_V1_Neuronal_Activity_using_Particle_Filtering_with_Volterra_Kernels.html">49 nips-2003-Decoding V1 Neuronal Activity using Particle Filtering with Volterra Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan C. Kelly, Tai Sing Lee</p><p>Abstract: Decoding is a strategy that allows us to assess the amount of information neurons can provide about certain aspects of the visual scene. In this study, we develop a method based on Bayesian sequential updating and the particle ﬁltering algorithm to decode the activity of V1 neurons in awake monkeys. A distinction in our method is the use of Volterra kernels to ﬁlter the particles, which live in a high dimensional space. This parametric Bayesian decoding scheme is compared to the optimal linear decoder and is shown to work consistently better than the linear optimal decoder. Interestingly, our results suggest that for decoding in real time, spike trains of as few as 10 independent but similar neurons would be sufﬁcient for decoding a critical scene variable in a particular class of visual stimuli. The reconstructed variable can predict the neural activity about as well as the actual signal with respect to the Volterra kernels. 1</p><p>5 0.72416854 <a title="103-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Identifying_Structure_across_Pre-partitioned_Data.html">87 nips-2003-Identifying Structure across Pre-partitioned Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zvika Marx, Ido Dagan, Eli Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We propose an information-theoretic clustering approach that incorporates a pre-known partition of the data, aiming to identify common clusters that cut across the given partition. In the standard clustering setting the formation of clusters is guided by a single source of feature information. The newly utilized pre-partition factor introduces an additional bias that counterbalances the impact of the features whenever they become correlated with this known partition. The resulting algorithmic framework was applied successfully to synthetic data, as well as to identifying text-based cross-religion correspondences. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n The standard task of feature-based data clustering deals with a single set of elements that are characterized by a unified set of features. The goal of the clustering task is to identify implicit constructs, or themes, within the clustered set, grouping together elements that are characterized similarly by the features. In recent years there has been growing interest in more complex clustering settings, in which additional information is incorporated [1], [2]. Several such extensions ([3]-[5]) are based on the information bottleneck (IB) framework [6], which facilitates coherent information-theoretic representation of different information types. In a recent line of research we have investigated the cross-dataset clustering task [7], [8]. In this setting, some inherent a-priori partition of the clustered data to distinct subsets is given. The clustering goal it to identify corresponding (analogous) structures that cut across the different subsets, while ignoring internal structures that characterize individual subsets. To accomplish this task, those features that commonly characterize elements across the different subsets guide the clustering process, while within-subset regularities are neutralized. In [7], we presented a distance-based hard clustering algorithm for the coupledclustering problem, in which the clustered data is pre-partitioned to two subsets. In [8], our setting, generalized to pre-partitions of any number of subsets, was addressed by a heuristic extension of the probabilistic IB algorithm, yielding improved empirical results. Specifically, the algorithm in [8] was based on a modification of the IB stable-point equation, which amplified the impact of features characterizing a formed cluster across all, or most, subsets. This paper describes an information-theoretic framework that motivates and extends the algorithm proposed in [8]. The given pre-partitioning is represented via a probability distribution variable, which may represent “soft” pre-partitioning of the data, versus the strictly disjoint subsets assumed in the earlier cross-dataset framework. Further, we present a new functional that captures the cross-partition motivation. From the new functional, we derive a stable-point equation underlying our algorithmic framework in conjunction with the corresponding IB equation. Our algorithm was tested empirically on synthetic data and on a real-world textbased task that aimed to identify corresponding themes across distinct religions. We have cross-clustered five sets of keywords that were extracted from topical corpora of texts about Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. In distinction from standard clustering results, our algorithm reveals themes that are common to all religions, such as sacred writings, festivals, narratives and myths and theological principles, and avoids topical clusters that correspond to individual religions (for example, ‘Christmas’ and ‘Easter’ are clustered together with ‘Ramadan’ rather than with ‘Church’). Finally, we have paid specific attention to the framework of clustering with side information [4]. While this approach was presented for a somewhat different mindset, it might be used directly to address clustering across pre-partitioned data. We compare the technical details of the two approaches and demonstrate empirically that clustering with side information does not seem appropriate for the kind of cross-partition tasks that we explored. 2 Th e In fo rmat i o n B ot t len eck M et h od Probabilistic (“soft”) data clustering outputs, for each element x of the set being clustered and each cluster c, an assignment probability p(c|x). The IB method [6] interprets probabilistic clustering as lossy data compression. The given data is represented by a random variable X ranging over the clustered elements. X is compressed through another random variable C, ranging over the clusters. Every element x is characterized by conditional probability distribution p(Y|x), where Y is a third random variable taking the members y of a given set of features as values. The IB method formalizes the clustering task as minimizing the IB functional: L(IB) = I(C; X) − β I(C; Y) . (1) As known from information theory (Ch. 13 of [9]), minimizing the mutual information I(C; X) optimizes distorted compression rate. A complementary bias to maximize I(C; Y) is interpreted in [6] as articulating the level of relevance of Y to the obtained clustering, inferred from the level by which C can predict Y. β is a free parameter counterbalancing the two biases. It is shown in [6] that p(c|x) values that minimize L(IB) satisfy the following equation: p(c|x) = 1 p (c )e −β DKL [ p ( Y |x )|| p (Y |c ) ] , z( β , x) (2) where DKL stands for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, between two distributions and z(β ,x) is a normalization function over C. Eq. (2) implies that, optimally, x is assigned to c in proportion to their KL distance in a feature distribution space, where the distribution p(Y|c) takes the role of a Start at time t = 0 and iterate the following update-steps, till convergence: IB1: initialize p t (c|x) randomly or arbitrarily −β DKL [ p (Y | x )|| pt −1 (Y |c ) ] pt (c|x) ∝ IB2: pt (c) = IB3: pt (y|c) = pt −1 (c ) e ∑ x (t = 0) (t > 0) p t (c | x ) p ( x ) 1 ∑ pt ( c | x) p ( y | x ) p ( x) p t (c ) x Figure 1: The Information Bottleneck iterative algorithm (with fixed β and |C|). representative, or centroid, of c. The feature variable Y is hence utilized as the (exclusive) means to guide clustering, beyond the random nature of compression. Figure 1 presents the IB iterative algorithm for a fixed value of β . The IB1 update step follows Eq. (2). The other two steps, which are derived from the IB functional as well, estimate the p(c) and p(y|c) values required for the next iteration. The algorithm converges to a local minimum of the IB functional. The IB setting, particularly the derivation of steps IB1 and IB3 of the algorithm, assumes that Y and C are independent given X, that is: I(C; Y|X) = ∑x p(x) I(C|x; Y|x) = 0. The balancing parameter β affects the number of distinct clusters being formed in a manner that resembles (inverse) temperature in physical systems. The higher β is (i.e., the stronger the bias to construct C that predicts Y well), more distinct clusters are required for encoding the data. For each |C| = 2, 3, …, there is a minimal β value, enabling the formation of |C| distinct clusters. Setting β to be smaller than this critical value corresponding to the current |C| would result in two or more clusters that are identical to one another. Based on this, the iterative algorithm is applied repeatedly within a gradual cooling-like (deterministic annealing) scheme: starting with random initialization of the p0 (c|x)'s, generate two clusters with the critical β value, found empirically, for |C| = 2. Then, use a perturbation on the obtained two-cluster configuration to initialize the p0(c|x)'s for a larger set of clusters and execute additional runs of the algorithm to identify the critical β value for the larger |C|. And so on: each output configuration is used as a basis for a more granular one. The final outcome is a “soft hierarchy” of probabilistic clusters. 3 Cro ss- p a rt i t i o n Clu st eri n g Cross-partition (CP) clustering introduces a factor – a pre-given partition of the clustered data – additional to what considered in a standard clustering setting. For representing this factor we introduce the pre-partitioning variable W, ranging over all parts w of the pre-given partition. Every data element x is associated with W through a given probability distribution p(W|x). Our goal is to cluster the data, so that the clusters C would not be correlated with W. We notice that Y, which is intended to direct the formation of clusters, might be a-priori correlated with W, so the formed clusters might end up being correlated with W as well. Our method aims at eliminating this aspect of Y. 3.1 I n f or ma t i o n D e f oc us i n g As noted, some of the information conveyed by Y characterizes structures correlated with W, while the other part of the information characterizes the target cross-W structures. We are interested in detecting the latter while filtering out the former. However, there is no direct a-priori separation between the two parts of the Ymediated information. Our strategy in tackling this difficulty is: we follow in general Y's directions, as the IB method does, while avoiding Y's impact whenever it entails undesired inter-dependencies of C and W. Our strategy implies conflicting biases with regard to the mutual information I(C,Y): it should be maximized in order to form meaningful clusters, but be minimized as well in the specific context where Y entails C–W dependencies. Accordingly, we propose a computational procedure directed by two distinct cost-terms in tandem. The first one is the IB functional (Eq. 1), introducing the bias to maximize I(C,Y). With this bias alone, Y might dictate (or “explain”, in retrospect) substantial C–W dependencies, implying a low I(C;W|Y) value. 1 Hence, the guideline of preventing Y from accounting for C–W dependencies is realized through an opposing bias of maximizing I(C;W|Y) = ∑y p(y) I(C|y; W|y). The second cost term – the Information Defocusing (ID) functional – consequently counterbalances minimization of I(C,Y) against the new bias: L(ID) = I(C; Y) − η I(C;W|Y) , (3) where η is a free parameter articulating the tradeoff between the biases. The ID functional captures our goal of reducing the impact of Y selectively: “defocusing” a specific aspect of the information Y conveys: the information correlated with W. In a like manner to the stable-point equation of the IB functional (Eq. 2), we derive the following stable-point equation for the ID functional: η p ( w) 1 p ( c )∏ w p ( y | c, w) η +1 , p(c|y) = z (η , y ) (4) where z(η,y) is a normalization function over C. The derivation relies on an additional assumption, I(C;W) = 0, imposing the intended independence between C and W (the detailed derivation will be described elsewhere). The intuitive interpretation of Eq. (4) is as follows: a feature y is to be associated with a cluster c in proportion to a weighted, though flattened, geometric mean of the “W-projected centroids” p(y|c,w), priored by p(c). 2 This scheme overweighs y's that contribute to c evenly across W. Thus, clusters satisfying Eq. (4) are situated around centroids biased towards evenly contributing features. The higher η is, heavier emphasis is put on suppressing disagreements between the w's. For η → ∞ a plain weighted geometric-mean scheme is obtained. The inclusion of a step derived from Eq. (4) in our algorithm (see below) facilitates convergence on a configuration with centroids dominated by features that are evenly distributed across W. 3.2 T h e Cr os s - p a r t i t i on C l us t e r i n g A l g or i t h m Our proposed cross partition (CP) clustering algorithm (Fig. 2) seeks a clustering configuration that optimizes simultaneously both the IB and ID functionals, 1 Notice that “Z explaining well the dependencies between A and B” is equivalent with “A and B sharing little information in common given Z”, i.e. low I(A;B|Z) . Complete conditional independence is exemplified in the IB framework, assuming I(C;Y|X) = 0. 2 Eq. (4) resembles our suggestion in [8] to compute a geometric average over the subsets; in the current paper this scheme is analytically derived from the ID functional. Start at time t = 0 and iterate the following update-steps, till convergence: CP1: Initialize p t (c|x) randomly or arbitrarily −β DKL [ p (Y | x )|| pt −1 (Y |c ) ] pt (c|x) ∝ CP2: pt (c) = CP3: p*t (y|c,w) = CP4: (t = 0) p t −1 (c ) e ∑ x (t > 0) p t (c | x ) p ( x ) 1 ∑ pt ( c | x ) p ( y | x ) p ( w | x ) p ( x ) p t ( c ) p ( w) x Initialize p*t (c) randomly or arbitrarily (t = 0) p*t (c) (t > 0) = ∑ y p *t −1 (c | y ) p ( y ) η CP5: p*t (c|y) ∝ p *t (c)∏w p *t ( y | c, w) η +1 CP6: pt (y|c) = p ( w) p *t (c | y ) p ( y ) p *t (c ) Figure 2: The cross-partition clustering iterative algorithm (with fixed β, η, and |C|). thus obtaining clusters that cut across the pre-given partition W. To this end, the algorithm interleaves an iterative computation of the stable-point equations, and the additional estimated parameters, for both functionals. Steps CP1, CP2 and CP6 correspond to the computations related to the IB functional, while steps CP3, CP4 and CP5, which compute a separate set of parameters (denoted by an asterisk), correspond to the ID functional. Figure 3 summarizes the roles of the two functionals in the dynamics of the CP algorithm. The two components of the iterative cycle are tied together in steps CP3 and CP6, in which parameters from one set are used as input to compute a parameter of other set. The derivation of step CP3 relies on an additional assumption, namely that C, Y and W are jointly independent given X. This assumption, which extends to W the underlying assumption of the IB setting that C and Y are independent given X, still entails the IB stable point equation. At convergence, the stable point equations for both the IB and ID functionals are satisfied, each by its own set of parameters (in steps CP1 and CP5). The deterministic annealing scheme, which gradually increases β over repeated runs (see Sec. 2), is applied for the CP algorithm as well with η held fixed. For a given target number of clusters |C|, the algorithm empirically converges with a wide range of η values 3. I(C;X) ↓ IB β↑ I(C;Y) ↓ ID η↑ I(C; W|Y) I(C; Y; W|X) = 0 ← assumptions → I(C;W) = 0 Figure 3: The interplay of the IB and the ID functionals in the CP algorithm. High η values tend to dictate centroids with features that are unevenly distributed across W, resulting in shrinkage of some of the clusters. Further analysis will be provided in future work. 3 4 Exp e ri men t a l Resu lt s Our synthetic setting consisted of 75 virtual elements, evenly pre-partitioned into three 25-element parts denoted X 1 , X2 and X3 (in our formalism, for each clustered element x, p(w|x) = 1 holds for either w = 1, 2, or 3). On top of this pre-partition, we partitioned the data twice, getting two (exhaustive) clustering configurations: 1. Target cross-W clustering: five clusters, each with representatives from all X w's; 2. Masking within-w clustering: six clusters, each consisting of roughly half the elements of either X 1, X 2 or X3 with no representatives from the other X w's. Each cluster, of both configurations, was characterized by a designated subset of features. Masking clusters were designed to be more salient than target clusters: they had more designated features (60 vs. 48 per cluster, i.e., 360 vs. 240 in total) and their elements shared higher feature-element (virtual) co-occurrence counts with those designated features (900 vs. 450 per element-feature pair). Noise (random positive integer < 200) was added to all counts associating elements with their designated features (for both within-w and cross-W clusters), as well as to roughly quarter of the zero counts associating elements with the rest of the features. The plain IB method consistently produced configurations strongly correlated with the masking clustering, while the CP algorithm revealed the target configuration. We got (see Table 1A) almost perfect results in configurations of nearly equal-sized cross-W clusters, and somewhat less perfect reconstruction in configurations of diverging sizes (6, 9, 15, 21 and 24). Performance level was measured relatively to optimal target-output cluster match by the proportion of elements correctly assigned, where assignment of an element x follows its highest p(c|x). The results indicated were averaged over 200 runs. They were obtained for the optimal η, which was found to be higher in the diverging-sizes task. In the text-based task, the clustered elements – keywords – were automatically extracted from five distinct corpora addressing five religions: introductory web pages, online magazines, encyclopedic entries etc., all downloaded from the Internet. The clustered keyword set X was consequently pre-partitioned to disjoint subsets {X w} w∈W, one for each religion4 (|X w| ≈ 200 for each w). We conducted experiments simultaneously involving religion pairs as well as all five religions. We took the features Y to be a set of words that commonly occur within all five corpora (|Y| ≈ 7000). x–y co-occurrences were recorded within ±5-word sliding window truncated by sentence boundaries. η was fixed to a value (1.0) enabling the formation of 20 clusters in all settings. The obtained clusters revealed interesting cross religion themes (see Sec. 1). For instance, the cluster (one of nine) capturing the theme of sacred festivals: the three highest p(c/x) members within each religion were Full-moon, Ceremony, Celebration (Buddhism); Easter, Sunday, Christmas Table 1: Average correct assignment proportion scores for the synthetic task (A) and Jaccard-coefficient scores for the religion keyword classification task (B).

(Chrsitianity); Puja, Ceremony, Festival (Hinduism); Id-al-Fitr, Friday, Ramadan, (Islam); and Sukkoth, Shavuot, Rosh-Hodesh (Judaism). The closest cluster produced by the plain IB method was poorer by far, including Islamic Ramadan, and Id and Jewish Passover, Rosh-Hashanah and Sabbath (which our method ranked high too), but no single related term from the other religions. Our external evaluation standards were cross-religion keyword classes constructed manually by experts of comparative religion studies. One such expert classification involved all five religions, and eight classifications addressed religions in pairs. Each of the eight religion-pair classifications was contributed by two independent experts using the same keywords, so we could also assess the agreement between experts. As an overlap measure we employed the Jaccard coefficient: the number of element pairs co-assigned together by both one of the evaluated clusters and one of the expert classes, divided by the number of pairs co-assigned by either our clusters or the expert (or both). We did not assume the number of expert classes is known in advance (as done in the synthetic experiments), so the results were averaged over all configurations of 2–16 cluster hierarchy, for each experiment. The results shown in Table 1B – clear improvement relatively to plain IB and the distance-based coupled clustering [7] – are, however, persistent when the number of clusters is taken to be equal to the number of classes, or if only the best score in hierarchy is considered. The level of cross-expert agreement indicates that our results are reasonably close to the scores expected in such subjective task. 5 C o mp a ri so n t o R e la t ed W o r k The information bottleneck framework served as the basis for several approaches that represent additional information in their clustering setting. The multivariate information bottleneck (MIB) adapts the IB framework for networks of multiple variables [3]. However, all variables in such networks are either compressed (like X), or predicted (like Y). The incorporation of an empirical variable to be masked or defocused in the sense of our W is not possible. Including such variables in the MIB framework might be explored in future work. Particularly relevant to our work is the IB-based method for extracting relevant constructs with side information [4]. This approach addresses settings in which two different types of features are distinguished explicitly: relevant versus irrelevant ones, denoted by Y+ and Y−. Both types of features are incorporated within a single functional to be minimized: L(IB-side-info) = I(C; X) − β ( I(C; Y +) − γ I(C; Y−) ), which directly drives clustering to de-correlate C and Y−. Formally, our setting can be mapped to the side information setting by regarding the pre-partition W simply as the additional set of irrelevant features, giving symmetric (and opposite) roles to W and Y. However, it seems that this view does not address properly the desired cross-partition setting. In our setting, it is assumed that clustering should be guided in general by Y, while W should only neutralize particular information within Y that would otherwise yield the undesired correlation between C and W (as described in Section 3.1). For that reason, the defocusing functional tie the three variables together by conditioning the de-correlation of C and W on Y, while its underlying assumption ensures the global de-correlation. Indeed, our method was found empirically superior on the cross-dataset task. The side-information IB method (the iterative algorithm with best scoring γ) achieves correct assignment proportion of 0.52 in both synthetic tasks, where our method scored 0.99 and 0.83 (see Table 1A) and, in the religion-pair keyword classification task, Jaccard coefficient improved by 20% relatively to plain IB (compared to our 100% improvement, see Table 1B). 6 C o n c lu si o n s This paper addressed the problem of clustering a pre-partitioned dataset, aiming to detect new internal structures that are not correlated with the pre-given partition but rather cut across its components. The proposed framework extends the cross-dataset clustering algorithm [8], providing better formal grounding and representing any pre-given (soft) partition of the dataset. Supported by empirical evidence, we suggest that our framework is better suited for the cross-partition task than applying the side-information framework [4], which was originally developed to address a somewhat different setting. We also demonstrate substantial empirical advantage over the distance-based coupled-clustering algorithm [7]. As an applied real-world goal, the algorithm successfully detects cross-religion commonalities. This goal exemplifies the more general notion of detecting analogies across different systems, which is a somewhat vague and non-consensual task and therefore especially challenging for a computational framework. Our approach can be viewed as an initial step towards principled identification of “hidden” commonalities between substantially different real world systems, while suppressing the vast majority of attributes that are irrelevant for the analogy. Further research may study the role of defocusing in supervised learning, where some pre-given partitions might mask the role of underlying discriminative features. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore relationships to other disciplines, e.g., network information theory ([9], Ch. 14) which provided motivation for the side-information approach. Finally, both frameworks (ours and side-information) suggest the importance of dealing wisely with information that should not dictate the clustering output directly.

<p>Author: Georgios Theocharous, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that useful POMDP solutions do not require consideration of the entire belief space. We extend this idea with the notion of temporal abstraction. We present and explore a new reinforcement learning algorithm over grid-points in belief space, which uses macro-actions and Monte Carlo updates of the Q-values. We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>3 0.081322476 <a title="6-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Feature_Selection_in_Clustering_Problems.html">73 nips-2003-Feature Selection in Clustering Problems</a></p>
<p>Author: Volker Roth, Tilman Lange</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach to combining clustering and feature selection is presented. It implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. On the technical side, we present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of this method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is able to infer both meaningful partitions and meaningful subsets of features. 1</p><p>4 0.078152612 <a title="6-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Gene_Expression_Clustering_with_Functional_Mixture_Models.html">79 nips-2003-Gene Expression Clustering with Functional Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Darya Chudova, Christopher Hart, Eric Mjolsness, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: We propose a functional mixture model for simultaneous clustering and alignment of sets of curves measured on a discrete time grid. The model is speciﬁcally tailored to gene expression time course data. Each functional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed proﬁles, (b) align the proﬁles in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA in the course of an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy proﬁles by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared to regular Gaussian mixtures. 1</p><p>5 0.070224658 <a title="6-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Efficient_Multiscale_Sampling_from_Products_of_Gaussian_Mixtures.html">58 nips-2003-Efficient Multiscale Sampling from Products of Gaussian Mixtures</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, Erik B. Sudderth, William T. Freeman, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating the product of several Gaussian mixture distributions arises in a number of contexts, including the nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) inference algorithm and the training of product of experts models. This paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a product of Gaussian mixtures, and compares their performance to existing methods. The ﬁrst is a multiscale variant of previously proposed Monte Carlo techniques, with comparable theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates. The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter of their true probability. We compare both multiscale samplers on a set of computational examples motivated by NBP, demonstrating signiﬁcant improvements over existing methods. 1</p><p>6 0.065654054 <a title="6-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Algorithms_for_Large-State-Space_HMMs_with_Applications_to_Web_Usage_Analysis.html">70 nips-2003-Fast Algorithms for Large-State-Space HMMs with Applications to Web Usage Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Woojae Kim, Daniel J. Navarro, Mark A. Pitt, In J. Myung</p><p>Abstract: Despite the popularity of connectionist models in cognitive science, their performance can often be diﬃcult to evaluate. Inspired by the geometric approach to statistical model selection, we introduce a conceptually similar method to examine the global behavior of a connectionist model, by counting the number and types of response patterns it can simulate. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm that we constructed Þnds these patterns eﬃciently. We demonstrate the approach using two localist network models of speech perception. 1</p><p>3 0.50541317 <a title="6-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Wormholes_Improve_Contrastive_Divergence.html">196 nips-2003-Wormholes Improve Contrastive Divergence</a></p>
<p>Author: Max Welling, Andriy Mnih, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: In models that deﬁne probabilities via energies, maximum likelihood learning typically involves using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the model’s distribution. If the Markov chain is started at the data distribution, learning often works well even if the chain is only run for a few time steps [3]. But if the data distribution contains modes separated by regions of very low density, brief MCMC will not ensure that different modes have the correct relative energies because it cannot move particles from one mode to another. We show how to improve brief MCMC by allowing long-range moves that are suggested by the data distribution. If the model is approximately correct, these long-range moves have a reasonable acceptance rate.</p><p>4 0.50344193 <a title="6-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Near-Minimax_Optimal_Classification_with_Dyadic_Classification_Trees.html">134 nips-2003-Near-Minimax Optimal Classification with Dyadic Classification Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper reports on a family of computationally practical classiﬁers that converge to the Bayes error at near-minimax optimal rates for a variety of distributions. The classiﬁers are based on dyadic classiﬁcation trees (DCTs), which involve adaptively pruned partitions of the feature space. A key aspect of DCTs is their spatial adaptivity, which enables local (rather than global) ﬁtting of the decision boundary. Our risk analysis involves a spatial decomposition of the usual concentration inequalities, leading to a spatially adaptive, data-dependent pruning criterion. For any distribution on (X, Y ) whose Bayes decision boundary behaves locally like a Lipschitz smooth function, we show that the DCT error converges to the Bayes error at a rate within a logarithmic factor of the minimax optimal rate. We also study DCTs equipped with polynomial classiﬁcation rules at each leaf, and show that as the smoothness of the boundary increases their errors converge to the Bayes error at a rate approaching n−1/2 , the parametric rate. We are not aware of any other practical classiﬁers that provide similar rate of convergence guarantees. Fast algorithms for tree pruning are discussed. 1</p><p>5 0.49856251 <a title="6-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Statistical_Debugging_of_Sampled_Programs.html">181 nips-2003-Statistical Debugging of Sampled Programs</a></p>

Our goal is to pinpoint those features that are most correlated with crashes. This is accomplished by maximizing an appropriately deﬁned utility function. It has analogies with intuitive debugging heuristics, and, as we demonstrate, is able to deal with various types of bugs that occur in real programs. 1</p><p>6 0.49459952 <a title="6-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Algorithms_for_Large-State-Space_HMMs_with_Applications_to_Web_Usage_Analysis.html">70 nips-2003-Fast Algorithms for Large-State-Space HMMs with Applications to Web Usage Analysis</a></p>

We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>3 0.46331769 <a title="6-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Wormholes_Improve_Contrastive_Divergence.html">196 nips-2003-Wormholes Improve Contrastive Divergence</a></p>

<p>Author: Ciamac C. Moallemi, Benjamin V. Roy</p><p>Abstract: We develop a protocol for optimizing dynamic behavior of a network of simple electronic components, such as a sensor network, an ad hoc network of mobile devices, or a network of communication switches. This protocol requires only local communication and simple computations which are distributed among devices. The protocol is scalable to large networks. As a motivating example, we discuss a problem involving optimization of power consumption, delay, and buffer overﬂow in a sensor network. Our approach builds on policy gradient methods for optimization of Markov decision processes. The protocol can be viewed as an extension of policy gradient methods to a context involving a team of agents optimizing aggregate performance through asynchronous distributed communication and computation. We establish that the dynamics of the protocol approximate the solution to an ordinary differential equation that follows the gradient of the performance objective. 1</p><p>5 0.46243751 <a title="6-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-AUC_Optimization_vs._Error_Rate_Minimization.html">3 nips-2003-AUC Optimization vs. Error Rate Minimization</a></p>
<p>Author: Corinna Cortes, Mehryar Mohri</p><p>Abstract: The area under an ROC curve (AUC) is a criterion used in many applications to measure the quality of a classiﬁcation algorithm. However, the objective function optimized in most of these algorithms is the error rate and not the AUC value. We give a detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between the AUC and the error rate, including the ﬁrst exact expression of the expected value and the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate. Our results show that the average AUC is monotonically increasing as a function of the classiﬁcation accuracy, but that the standard deviation for uneven distributions and higher error rates is noticeable. Thus, algorithms designed to minimize the error rate may not lead to the best possible AUC values. We show that, under certain conditions, the global function optimized by the RankBoost algorithm is exactly the AUC. We report the results of our experiments with RankBoost in several datasets demonstrating the beneﬁts of an algorithm speciﬁcally designed to globally optimize the AUC over other existing algorithms optimizing an approximation of the AUC or only locally optimizing the AUC. 1 Motivation In many applications, the overall classiﬁcation error rate is not the most pertinent performance measure, criteria such as ordering or ranking seem more appropriate. Consider for example the list of relevant documents returned by a search engine for a speciﬁc query. That list may contain several thousand documents, but, in practice, only the top ﬁfty or so are examined by the user. Thus, a search engine’s ranking of the documents is more critical than the accuracy of its classiﬁcation of all documents as relevant or not. More generally, for a binary classiﬁer assigning a real-valued score to each object, a better correlation between output scores and the probability of correct classiﬁcation is highly desirable. A natural criterion or summary statistic often used to measure the ranking quality of a classiﬁer is the area under an ROC curve (AUC) [8].1 However, the objective function optimized by most classiﬁcation algorithms is the error rate and not the AUC. Recently, several algorithms have been proposed for maximizing the AUC value locally [4] or maximizing some approximations of the global AUC value [9, 15], but, in general, these algorithms do not obtain AUC values signiﬁcantly better than those obtained by an algorithm designed to minimize the error rates. Thus, it is important to determine the relationship between the AUC values and the error rate. ∗ This author’s new address is: Google Labs, 1440 Broadway, New York, NY 10018, corinna@google.com. 1 The AUC value is equivalent to the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [8] and closely related to the Gini index [1]. It has been re-invented under the name of L-measure by [11], as already pointed out by [2], and slightly modiﬁed under the name of Linear Ranking by [13, 14]. True positive rate ROC Curve. AUC=0.718 (1,1) True positive rate = (0,0) False positive rate = False positive rate correctly classiﬁed positive total positive incorrectly classiﬁed negative total negative Figure 1: An example of ROC curve. The line connecting (0, 0) and (1, 1), corresponding to random classiﬁcation, is drawn for reference. The true positive (negative) rate is sometimes referred to as the sensitivity (resp. speciﬁcity) in this context. In the following sections, we give a detailed statistical analysis of the relationship between the AUC and the error rate, including the ﬁrst exact expression of the expected value and the variance of the AUC for a ﬁxed error rate.2 We show that, under certain conditions, the global function optimized by the RankBoost algorithm is exactly the AUC. We report the results of our experiments with RankBoost in several datasets and demonstrate the beneﬁts of an algorithm speciﬁcally designed to globally optimize the AUC over other existing algorithms optimizing an approximation of the AUC or only locally optimizing the AUC. 2 Deﬁnition and properties of the AUC The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves were originally developed in signal detection theory [3] in connection with radio signals, and have been used since then in many other applications, in particular for medical decision-making. Over the last few years, they have found increased interest in the machine learning and data mining communities for model evaluation and selection [12, 10, 4, 9, 15, 2]. The ROC curve for a binary classiﬁcation problem plots the true positive rate as a function of the false positive rate. The points of the curve are obtained by sweeping the classiﬁcation threshold from the most positive classiﬁcation value to the most negative. For a fully random classiﬁcation, the ROC curve is a straight line connecting the origin to (1, 1). Any improvement over random classiﬁcation results in an ROC curve at least partially above this straight line. Fig. (1) shows an example of ROC curve. The AUC is deﬁned as the area under the ROC curve and is closely related to the ranking quality of the classiﬁcation as shown more formally by Lemma 1 below. Consider a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples. We will assume that a classiﬁer outputs a strictly ordered list for these examples and will denote by 1X the indicator function of a set X. Lemma 1 ([8]) Let c be a ﬁxed classiﬁer. Let x1 , . . . , xm be the output of c on the positive examples and y1 , . . . , yn its output on the negative examples. Then, the AUC, A, associated to c is given by: m n i=1 j=1 1xi >yj (1) A= mn that is the value of the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic [8]. Proof. The proof is based on the observation that the AUC value is exactly the probability P (X > Y ) where X is the random variable corresponding to the distribution of the outputs for the positive examples and Y the one corresponding to the negative examples [7]. The Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney statistic is clearly the expression of that probability in the discrete case, which proves the lemma [8]. Thus, the AUC can be viewed as a measure based on pairwise comparisons between classiﬁcations of the two classes. With a perfect ranking, all positive examples are ranked higher than the negative ones and A = 1. Any deviation from this ranking decreases the AUC. 2 An attempt in that direction was made by [15], but, unfortunately, the authors’ analysis and the result are both wrong. Threshold θ k − x Positive examples x Negative examples n − x Negative examples m − (k − x) Positive examples Figure 2: For a ﬁxed number of errors k, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false negative examples. 3 The Expected Value of the AUC In this section, we compute exactly the expected value of the AUC over all classiﬁcations with a ﬁxed number of errors and compare that to the error rate. Different classiﬁers may have the same error rate but different AUC values. Indeed, for a given classiﬁcation threshold θ, an arbitrary reordering of the examples with outputs more than θ clearly does not affect the error rate but leads to different AUC values. Similarly, one may reorder the examples with output less than θ without changing the error rate. Assume that the number of errors k is ﬁxed. We wish to compute the average value of the AUC over all classiﬁcations with k errors. Our model is based on the simple assumption that all classiﬁcations or rankings with k errors are equiprobable. One could perhaps argue that errors are not necessarily evenly distributed, e.g., examples with very high or very low ranks are less likely to be errors, but we cannot justify such biases in general. For a given classiﬁcation, there may be x, 0 ≤ x ≤ k, false positive examples. Since the number of errors is ﬁxed, there are k − x false negative examples. Figure 3 shows the corresponding conﬁguration. The two regions of examples with classiﬁcation outputs above and below the threshold are separated by a vertical line. For a given x, the computation of the AUC, A, as given by Eq. (1) can be divided into the following three parts: A1 + A2 + A3 A= , with (2) mn A1 = the sum over all pairs (xi , yj ) with xi and yj in distinct regions; A2 = the sum over all pairs (xi , yj ) with xi and yj in the region above the threshold; A3 = the sum over all pairs (xi , yj ) with xi and yj in the region below the threshold. The ﬁrst term, A1 , is easy to compute. Since there are (m − (k − x)) positive examples above the threshold and n − x negative examples below the threshold, A1 is given by: A1 = (m − (k − x))(n − x) (3) To compute A2 , we can assign to each negative example above the threshold a position based on its classiﬁcation rank. Let position one be the ﬁrst position above the threshold and let α1 < . . . < αx denote the positions in increasing order of the x negative examples in the region above the threshold. The total number of examples classiﬁed as positive is N = m − (k − x) + x. Thus, by deﬁnition of A2 , x A2 = (N − αi ) − (x − i) (4) i=1 where the ﬁrst term N − αi represents the number of examples ranked higher than the ith example and the second term x − i discounts the number of negative examples incorrectly ranked higher than the ith example. Similarly, let α1 < . . . < αk−x denote the positions of the k − x positive examples below the threshold, counting positions in reverse by starting from the threshold. Then, A3 is given by: x A3 = (N − αj ) − (x − j) (5) j=1 with N = n − x + (k − x) and x = k − x. Combining the expressions of A1 , A2 , and A3 leads to: A= A1 + A2 + A3 (k − 2x)2 + k ( =1+ − mn 2mn x i=1 αi + mn x j=1 αj ) (6) Lemma 2 For a ﬁxed x, the average value of the AUC A is given by: < A >x = 1 − x n + k−x m 2 (7) x Proof. The proof is based on the computation of the average values of i=1 αi and x j=1 αj for a given x. We start by computing the average value < αi >x for a given i, 1 ≤ i ≤ x. Consider all the possible positions for α1 . . . αi−1 and αi+1 . . . αx , when the value of αi is ﬁxed at say αi = l. We have i ≤ l ≤ N − (x − i) since there need to be at least i − 1 positions before αi and N − (x − i) above. There are l − 1 possible positions for α1 . . . αi−1 and N − l possible positions for αi+1 . . . αx . Since the total number of ways of choosing the x positions for α1 . . . αx out of N is N , the average value < αi >x is: x N −(x−i) l=i < αi >x = l l−1 i−1 N −l x−i (8) N x Thus, x < αi >x = x i=1 i=1 Using the classical identity: x < αi >x = N −(x−i) l−1 l i−1 l=i N x u p1 +p2 =p p1 N l=1 l N −1 x−1 N x i=1 N −l x−i v p2 = = N l=1 = u+v p N (N + 1) 2 x l−1 i=1 i−1 N x l N −l x−i (9) , we can write: N −1 x−1 N x = x(N + 1) 2 (10) Similarly, we have: x < αj >x = j=1 x Replacing < i=1 αi >x and < Eq. (10) and Eq. (11) leads to: x j=1 x (N + 1) 2 (11) αj >x in Eq. (6) by the expressions given by (k − 2x)2 + k − x(N + 1) − x (N + 1) =1− 2mn which ends the proof of the lemma. < A >x = 1 + x n + k−x m 2 (12) Note that Eq. (7) shows that the average AUC value for a given x is simply one minus the average of the accuracy rates for the positive and negative classes. Proposition 1 Assume that a binary classiﬁcation task with m positive examples and n negative examples is given. Then, the expected value of the AUC A over all classiﬁcations with k errors is given by: < A >= 1 − k (n − m)2 (m + n + 1) − m+n 4mn k−1 m+n x=0 x k m+n+1 x=0 x k − m+n (13) Proof. Lemma 2 gives the average value of the AUC for a ﬁxed value of x. To compute the average over all possible values of x, we need to weight the expression of Eq. (7) with the total number of possible classiﬁcations for a given x. There are N possible ways of x choosing the positions of the x misclassiﬁed negative examples, and similarly N possible x ways of choosing the positions of the x = k − x misclassiﬁed positive examples. Thus, in view of Lemma 2, the average AUC is given by: < A >= k N x=0 x N x (1 − k N x=0 x N x k−x x n+ m 2 ) (14) r=0.05 r=0.01 r=0.1 r=0.25 0.0 0.1 0.2 r=0.5 0.3 Error rate 0.4 0.5 .00 .05 .10 .15 .20 .25 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1.0 Mean value of the AUC Relative standard deviation r=0.01 r=0.05 r=0.1 0.0 0.1 r=0.25 0.2 0.3 Error rate r=0.5 0.4 0.5 Figure 3: Mean (left) and relative standard deviation (right) of the AUC as a function of the error rate. Each curve corresponds to a ﬁxed ratio of r = n/(n + m). The average AUC value monotonically increases with the accuracy. For n = m, as for the top curve in the left plot, the average AUC coincides with the accuracy. The standard deviation decreases with the accuracy, and the lowest curve corresponds to n = m. This expression can be simpliﬁed into Eq. (13)3 using the following novel identities: k X N x x=0 k X N x x x=0 ! N x ! ! N x ! = = ! k X n+m+1 x x=0 (15) ! k X (k − x)(m − n) + k n + m + 1 2 x x=0 (16) that we obtained by using Zeilberger’s algorithm4 and numerous combinatorial ’tricks’. From the expression of Eq. (13), it is clear that the average AUC value is identical to the accuracy of the classiﬁer only for even distributions (n = m). For n = m, the expected value of the AUC is a monotonic function of the accuracy, see Fig. (3)(left). For a ﬁxed ratio of n/(n + m), the curves are obtained by increasing the accuracy from n/(n + m) to 1. The average AUC varies monotonically in the range of accuracy between 0.5 and 1.0. In other words, on average, there seems nothing to be gained in designing speciﬁc learning algorithms for maximizing the AUC: a classiﬁcation algorithm minimizing the error rate also optimizes the AUC. However, this only holds for the average AUC. Indeed, we will show in the next section that the variance of the AUC value is not null for any ratio n/(n + m) when k = 0. 4 The Variance of the AUC 2 Let D = mn + (k−2x) +k , a = i=1 αi , a = j=1 αj , and α = a + a . Then, by 2 Eq. (6), mnA = D − α. Thus, the variance of the AUC, σ 2 (A), is given by: (mn)2 σ 2 (A) x x = < (D − α)2 − (< D > − < α >)2 > = < D2 > − < D >2 + < α2 > − < α >2 −2(< αD > − < α >< D >) (17) As before, to compute the average of a term X over all classiﬁcations, we can ﬁrst determine its average < X >x for a ﬁxed x, and then use the function F deﬁned by: F (Y ) = k N N x=0 x x k N N x=0 x x Y (18) and < X >= F (< X >x ). A crucial step in computing the exact value of the variance of x the AUC is to determine the value of the terms of the type < a2 >x =< ( i=1 αi )2 >x . 3 An essential difference between Eq. (14) and the expression given by [15] is the weighting by the number of conﬁgurations. The authors’ analysis leads them to the conclusion that the average AUC is identical to the accuracy for all ratios n/(n + m), which is false. 4 We thank Neil Sloane for having pointed us to Zeilberger’s algorithm and Maple package. x Lemma 3 For a ﬁxed x, the average of ( i=1 αi )2 is given by: x(N + 1) < a2 > x = (3N x + 2x + N ) 12 (19) Proof.

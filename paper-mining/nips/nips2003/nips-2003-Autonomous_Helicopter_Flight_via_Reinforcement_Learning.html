<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, Sham M. Kakade, Jeff G. Schneider, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a ﬁnite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem. 1</p><p>3 0.10011864 <a title="38-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time. We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>4 0.095875017 <a title="38-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Policy_Iteration_with_a_Policy_Language_Bias.html">34 nips-2003-Approximate Policy Iteration with a Policy Language Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon, Robert Givan</p><p>Abstract: We explore approximate policy iteration, replacing the usual costfunction learning step with a learning step in policy space. We give policy-language biases that enable solution of very large relational Markov decision processes (MDPs) that no previous technique can solve. In particular, we induce high-quality domain-speciﬁc planners for classical planning domains (both deterministic and stochastic variants) by solving such domains as extremely large MDPs. 1</p><p>5 0.063435979 <a title="38-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-All_learning_is_Local%3A_Multi-agent_Learning_in_Global_Reward_Games.html">20 nips-2003-All learning is Local: Multi-agent Learning in Global Reward Games</a></p>

We provide a simple and efﬁcient algorithm that in part uses a linear system to model the world from a single agent’s limited perspective, and takes advantage of Kalman ﬁltering to allow an agent to construct a good training signal and learn an effective policy. 1</p><p>6 0.058936238 <a title="38-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Bounded_Finite_State_Controllers.html">42 nips-2003-Bounded Finite State Controllers</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia H. Gardiol, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: A mobile robot acting in the world is faced with a large amount of sensory data and uncertainty in its action outcomes. Indeed, almost all interesting sequential decision-making domains involve large state spaces and large, stochastic action sets. We investigate a way to act intelligently as quickly as possible in domains where ﬁnding a complete policy would take a hopelessly long time. This approach, Relational Envelopebased Planning (REBP) tackles large, noisy problems along two axes. First, describing a domain as a relational MDP (instead of as an atomic or propositionally-factored MDP) allows problem structure and dynamics to be captured compactly with a small set of probabilistic, relational rules. Second, an envelope-based approach to planning lets an agent begin acting quickly within a restricted part of the full state space and to judiciously expand its envelope as resources permit. 1</p><p>6 0.60533965 <a title="38-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Distributed_Optimization_in_Adaptive_Networks.html">55 nips-2003-Distributed Optimization in Adaptive Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: D. Philipona, J.k. O'regan, J.-p. Nadal, Olivier Coenen</p><p>Abstract: Is there a way for an algorithm linked to an unknown body to infer by itself information about this body and the world it is in? Taking the case of space for example, is there a way for this algorithm to realize that its body is in a three dimensional world? Is it possible for this algorithm to discover how to move in a straight line? And more basically: do these questions make any sense at all given that the algorithm only has access to the very high-dimensional data consisting of its sensory inputs and motor outputs? We demonstrate in this article how these questions can be given a positive answer. We show that it is possible to make an algorithm that, by analyzing the law that links its motor outputs to its sensory inputs, discovers information about the structure of the world regardless of the devices constituting the body it is linked to. We present results from simulations demonstrating a way to issue motor orders resulting in “fundamental” movements of the body as regards the structure of the physical world. 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.67259359 <a title="38-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Autonomous_Helicopter_Flight_via_Reinforcement_Learning.html">38 nips-2003-Autonomous Helicopter Flight via Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

Here we propose a simple universal ranking algorithm for data lying in the Euclidean space, such as text or image data. The core idea of our method is to rank the data with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure collectively revealed by a great amount of data. Encouraging experimental results from synthetic, image, and text data illustrate the validity of our method. 1</p><p>5 0.42745858 <a title="38-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Planning_in_POMDPs_with_Macro-Actions.html">33 nips-2003-Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Macro-Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Theocharous, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that useful POMDP solutions do not require consideration of the entire belief space. We extend this idea with the notion of temporal abstraction. We present and explore a new reinforcement learning algorithm over grid-points in belief space, which uses macro-actions and Monte Carlo updates of the Q-values. We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>6 0.41159111 <a title="38-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Auction_Mechanism_Design_for_Multi-Robot_Coordination.html">36 nips-2003-Auction Mechanism Design for Multi-Robot Coordination</a></p>

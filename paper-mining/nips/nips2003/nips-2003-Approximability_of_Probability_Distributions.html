</p><p>3 1  Introduction  One of the major concerns in probabilistic reasoning using graphical models, such as Bayesian networks, is the computational complexity of inference. [sent-12, score-0.173]
</p><p>4 In general, probabilistic inference is NP-hard and a typical approach to handling this complexity is to use an approximate inference algorithm that trades accuracy for efﬁciency. [sent-13, score-0.266]
</p><p>5 However, as demonstrated in [2], such criteria are unable to capture the inference complexity: two models that have similar representation complexity and ﬁt data equally well may have quite different graph structures, making one model exponentially slower for inference than the other. [sent-22, score-0.343]
</p><p>6 Thus the treewidth arises as a natural measure of inference complexity in graphical models. [sent-26, score-0.866]
</p><p>7 Intuitively, a probability distribution is approximable, or easy, if it is close to a distribution represented by an efﬁcient, low-treewidth graphical model. [sent-28, score-0.219]

</p><p>9 It is easy to see that any approximation Q that decomposes over a network whose moralized graph misses at least one edge, is precisely as inaccurate as the one that assumes all variables to be independent (i. [sent-39, score-0.401]
</p><p>10 This follows from the fact that the probability distribution induced on any proper subset of the 1 variables is uniform, and thus for any subset {Xi1 , . [sent-42, score-0.227]

</p><p>12 , absolutely no gain in accuracy and a potentially exponential loss of efﬁciency) in using a model more complex than the empty graph (i. [sent-55, score-0.286]
</p><p>13 dKL  On the other hand, one can easily construct a distribution with large weak dependencies such that representing this distribution exactly requires a network with large treewidth; however, if we are willing to sacriﬁce just a bit of accuracy, we get a very simple model. [sent-59, score-0.232]
</p><p>14 Or, what is the best achievable approximation accuracy given a constraint on the complexity (i. [sent-78, score-0.215]
</p><p>15 The tradeoff between the complexity and accuracy is monotonic; however, it may be far from linear. [sent-81, score-0.201]
</p><p>16 complexity trade-offs is based on the results from random graph theory which suggest that graph properties monotone in edge addition (e. [sent-84, score-0.65]
</p><p>17 , such as graph connectivity) appear rather suddenly: the transition from the property being very unlikely to it being very likely occurs during a small change of the edge probability p (density) in the random graph [7, 8]. [sent-86, score-0.543]
</p><p>18 First, we show that both important properties of random graphical models, the property of “being efﬁcient” (i. [sent-88, score-0.178]
</p><p>19 , having treewidth at most some ﬁxed integer k) and the property of “being accurate” (i. [sent-90, score-0.819]
</p><p>20 , being at distance at most some δ from the target distribution), are monotone and demonstrate a threshold behavior, giving us two families of threshold curves parameterized by k and by δ, respectively. [sent-92, score-0.442]
</p><p>21 Second, we introduce the notion of effective treewidth k(δ), which denotes the smallest 1 Note that minimizing dKL from the empirical distribution (induced by a given set of samples) also corresponds to maximizing the likelihood of observed data. [sent-93, score-0.822]
</p><p>22 achievable treewidth k given a constraint δ on KL-divergence (error) from the target (we also introduce a notion of -achievable k(δ) which requires at least -fraction of models in a given set to achieve treewidth k and error δ). [sent-95, score-1.585]
</p><p>23 The effective treewidth captures the approximability of the distribution, and is determined by relative position of the threshold curves, an inherent property of the target distribution. [sent-96, score-1.026]
</p><p>24 2  Preliminaries and Related Work  Let P be a probability distribution on n discrete random variables X1 , X2 , . [sent-99, score-0.185]
</p><p>25 A Bayesian network exploits the independences among the Xi to provide a compact representation of P as a product of low-order conditional probability distributions. [sent-103, score-0.168]
</p><p>26 The independences are encoded by a directed acyclic graph (DAG) G with nodes corresponding to X1 , X2 , . [sent-104, score-0.326]
</p><p>27 Each Xi is independent of its non-descendants given its parents in the graph [12]. [sent-108, score-0.222]
</p><p>28 The dependencies are quantiﬁed by associating each node Xi with a local conditional probability distribution PB (Xi | Πi ), where Πi is the set of parents of Xi in G. [sent-109, score-0.24]
</p><p>29 We say that a distribution P decomposes over a DAG G if there exist local conditional probability distributions corresponding to G such that P can be written in such a form. [sent-114, score-0.243]
</p><p>30 In order to use this algorithm in the presence of cycles, one typically constructs a junction tree of the network and runs the algorithm on this tree [12]. [sent-119, score-0.211]
</p><p>31 Exact inference can then be done in time and space linear in the representation of clique marginals in the junction tree, which is exponential in the size of the largest clique induced during triangulation. [sent-126, score-0.365]
</p><p>32 The minimum width over all possible triangulations is called the treewidth of the graph. [sent-128, score-0.729]
</p><p>33 The triangulation procedure is deﬁned for undirected graphs, so we must ﬁrst make the network undirected while preserving the set of independence assumptions; this can be done by moralizing the network, i. [sent-129, score-0.276]
</p><p>34 Restricting the size of dependencies controls both overﬁtting and the complexity of inference in the resulting model. [sent-133, score-0.184]
</p><p>35 Given a target distribution P (X) and an approximation Q(X), the information divergence (or Kullback-Leibler P (x) distance) between P and Q is deﬁned as dKL (P, Q) = x P (x) log Q(x) , where x ranges over all possible assignments to the variables in X (See [5]. [sent-141, score-0.264]
</p><p>36 Let Dk denote the class of distributions decomposable on graphs with treewidth at most k (0 ≤ k < n), with D1 corresponding to the set of  tree-decomposable distributions. [sent-144, score-0.936]
</p><p>37 The distribution within Dk minimizing the information divergence from the target distribution P is called the projection of P onto Dk . [sent-145, score-0.359]
</p><p>38 For a ﬁxed tree T , the projection of P onto the set of T -decomposable distributions is uniquely given by the distribution in which the conditional probabilities along the edges of T coincide with those computed from P . [sent-148, score-0.425]
</p><p>39 Fix a network structure G, and let Q be a distribution decomposable over G. [sent-153, score-0.203]
</p><p>40 If P is the empirical distribution induced by the given sample of size N (i. [sent-155, score-0.216]
</p><p>41 Hence if G is ﬁxed, the projection onto the set of Gdecomposable distributions is uniquely deﬁned, and we will identify G with this projection (ignoring some notational abuse). [sent-161, score-0.198]
</p><p>42 Srebro [13] showed that a similar undirected decomposition holds for bounded treewidth Markov networks (probabilistic models that use undirected graphs to represent dependencies). [sent-165, score-1.041]
</p><p>43 Threshold behavior of random graphs We use the model of random directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) deﬁned by Barak and Erd˝ s [1]. [sent-170, score-0.387]
</p><p>44 Consider the probability space G(n, p) o of random undirected graphs on n nodes with edge probability p (i. [sent-171, score-0.425]
</p><p>45 Let Gn,p stand for a random graph from this probability space. [sent-174, score-0.242]
</p><p>46 We will also occasionally use Gn,m to denote a graph chosen randomly from among all graphs with n nodes and m edges. [sent-175, score-0.322]
</p><p>47 3 Since the true distribution P is given only by the sample, we let P also denote the empirical distribution induced by the sample, ignoring some abuse of notation. [sent-180, score-0.282]
</p><p>48 A graph property P is naturally associated with the set of graphs having P. [sent-181, score-0.37]
</p><p>49 A property is monotone increasing if it is preserved under edge addition: If a graph G satisﬁes the property, then every graph on the same set of nodes containing G as a subgraph must satisfy it as well. [sent-182, score-0.704]
</p><p>50 It is easy to see (and intuitively clear) that if P is a monotone increasing property then the probability that Gn,p satisﬁes P is a non-decreasing function of p. [sent-183, score-0.362]
</p><p>51 For example, the property of having treewidth at most some ﬁxed integer k is monotone decreasing: adding edges can only increase the treewidth. [sent-185, score-1.08]
</p><p>52 The theory of random graphs was initiated by Erd˝ s and R´ nyi [7], o e and one of the main observations they made was that many natural monotone properties appear rather suddenly, i. [sent-186, score-0.322]
</p><p>53 Friedgut [8] proved that every monotone graph property of undirected graphs has such a threshold behavior. [sent-189, score-0.684]
</p><p>54 Random DAGs (corresponding to random partially ordered sets) have received less attention then random undirected graphs, partially because of the additional structure that prevents the completely independent choice of edges. [sent-190, score-0.203]
</p><p>55 Accuracy Recall that the information divergence of a given DAG G from the target distribution P is given by dKL (P, G) = W (G) − H(P ), where W (G) = n − i=1 xi ,πi P (xi , πi ) log P (xi | πi ). [sent-195, score-0.271]
</p><p>56 (In our case, P is the empirical distribution induced by the given sample S of size N . [sent-196, score-0.216]
</p><p>57 Notice that Pδ is monotone increasing: Adding edges to a graph can only bring the graph closer to the target distribution, since any distribution decomposable on the original graph is also decomposable on the augmented one. [sent-199, score-1.071]
</p><p>58 Complexity Fix an integer k, and consider the property of n-node DAGs of having treewidth of their moralized graph at most k. [sent-201, score-1.01]
</p><p>59 Call this property Pk and note that it is a structural property of a DAG, which does not depend on the target distribution and its projection onto the DAG. [sent-202, score-0.441]
</p><p>60 It is also a monotone decreasing property, since if a graph has treewidth at most k, then certainly any of its subgraphs does. [sent-203, score-1.049]
</p><p>61 Recall that we identify each graph with the projection of the target distribution onto the graph. [sent-204, score-0.428]
</p><p>62 We call a pair (k, δ) achievable for a distribution P , if there exists a distribution Q decomposable on a graph with treewidth at most k such that dKL (P, Q) ≤ δ. [sent-205, score-1.194]
</p><p>63 The effective treewidth of P , with respect to a given δ, is deﬁned as the smallest k(δ) such that the pair (k, δ) is achievable, i. [sent-206, score-0.751]
</p><p>64 , if all distributions at distance at most δ from P are not decomposable on graphs with treewidth less than k(δ). [sent-208, score-0.936]
</p><p>65 4  Main Idea  Consider, for each treewidth bound k, the curve given by µk (p) = Pr[width(Gn,p ) ≤ k], 1 and let pk be such that µk (pk ) = 1/2 + , where 0 < < 2 is some ﬁxed constant. [sent-216, score-0.882]
</p><p>66 For reasons that will become clear in a moment, our goal will be to ﬁnd, for each feasible treewidth k, the value of δ such that pδ = pk . [sent-218, score-0.839]
</p><p>67 To ﬁnd each pk , the algorithm will simply do a binary search on the interval (0, 1): For the current value of edge probability p, the algorithm estimates µk (Gn,p ) by random sampling and branches according to the estimate. [sent-219, score-0.272]
</p><p>68 To estimate µk (Gn,p ) within an additive error ρ with probability at least 1 − γ, the algorithm samples m = ln(2/γ) independent copies of Gn,p , and outputs the average value 2ρ2 of the 0/1 random variable indicating whether the treewidth of the sampled DAG is at most k. [sent-221, score-0.868]
</p><p>69 Note that the values related to treewidth are independent of the target distribution and can be precomputed ofﬂine. [sent-223, score-0.88]
</p><p>70 To ﬁnd δ = δ(k) for a given value of k, the algorithm computes the values of W (Gn,pk ) for the m sampled random DAGs in G(n, pk ), orders them and chooses the median. [sent-224, score-0.185]
</p><p>71 We know that at least a (1/2 + )-fraction of the DAGs in G(n, pk ) satisfy Pk . [sent-226, score-0.173]
</p><p>72 Moreover, there is a very simple probabilistic algorithm for ﬁnding a model realizing the tradeoff: We just need to sample O(1/ ) DAGs in G(n, pk ) and choose the closest one. [sent-228, score-0.203]
</p><p>73 Clearly we are overcounting, since the same DAGs may contribute to both probabilities; however not absurdly, since intuitively the graphs in G(n, pk ) with small treewidth will not ﬁt the distribution better than the ones with larger treewidth. [sent-229, score-1.047]
</p><p>74 A distribution is called k-wise independent if any subset of k variables is mutually independent (however, there may exist dependencies on larger subsets). [sent-231, score-0.214]

</p><p>77 The monotone decreasing curves correspond to the properties Pk for k = {1, . [sent-236, score-0.273]
</p><p>78 The monotone increasing curves correspond to the property of having dKL at most δ. [sent-241, score-0.37]
</p><p>79 As m increases, the probability of having small treewidth decreases, while the probability of getting close to the target increases. [sent-247, score-0.866]

</p><p>81 As expected, graphs with treewidth at most 2 are as inaccurate as the empty graph since all triples are independent. [sent-250, score-1.066]
</p><p>82 Given the desired level of closeness δ, we want to ﬁnd the smallest treewidth k such that the corresponding curves meet above some cut-off probability. [sent-251, score-0.772]

</p><p>85 Recall that dKL (P, G) decomposes into sum of conditional entropies induced by G (minus the entropy of P ). [sent-262, score-0.217]
</p><p>86 H¨ ffgen [9] o showed how to estimate these conditional entropies with any ﬁxed additive precision ρ using polynomially many samples. [sent-263, score-0.176]
</p><p>87 More precisely, he showed that a sample of size m = k+1 m(γ, ρ) = O(( n )2 log2 n log n γ ) sufﬁces to obtain good estimations of all induced ρ ρ conditional entropies with probability at least 1 − γ, which in turn sufﬁces to estimate dKL (P, G) with the additive precision ρ.

</p><p>88 Estimating Treewidth We, of course, will not attempt to compute the treewidth of the randomly generated graphs exactly. [sent-265, score-0.808]
</p><p>89 There are no theoretical guarantees in general, but heuristics tend to perform reasonably well: used in combination with various lower bound techniques, they can often pin down the treewidth to a small range, or even identify it exactly 5 . [sent-268, score-0.722]

<p>Author: Quaid D. Morris, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets. We test our model (a) (b) 40 0 untangling baseline random empirical potential posterior −2 30 log Pr true positives (%) 50 20 10 −4 −6 −8 0 0 5 10 −10 0 false positives (%) 10 20 30 degree (# of nodes) Figure 3: Protein-protein interaction network untangling results.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

<p>Author: Yuan Qi, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: Approximation structure plays an important role in inference on loopy graphs. As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propagation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a “message” to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms. 1</p><p>5 0.083590358 <a title="30-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Sample_Propagation.html">169 nips-2003-Sample Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: Rao–Blackwellization is an approximation technique for probabilistic inference that ﬂexibly combines exact inference with sampling. It is useful in models where conditioning on some of the variables leaves a simpler inference problem that can be solved tractably. This paper presents Sample Propagation, an efﬁcient implementation of Rao–Blackwellized approximate inference for a large class of models. Sample Propagation tightly integrates sampling with message passing in a junction tree, and is named for its simple, appealing structure: it walks the clusters of a junction tree, sampling some of the current cluster’s variables and then passing a message to one of its neighbors. We discuss the application of Sample Propagation to conditional Gaussian inference problems such as switching linear dynamical systems. 1</p><p>6 0.082573533 <a title="30-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Design_of_Experiments_via_Information_Theory.html">51 nips-2003-Design of Experiments via Information Theory</a></p>

<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, Irina Rish</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of how well a given distribution can be approximated with probabilistic graphical models. We introduce a new parameter, effective treewidth, that captures the degree of approximability as a tradeoff between the accuracy and the complexity of approximation. We present a simple approach to analyzing achievable tradeoffs that exploits the threshold behavior of monotone graph properties, and provide experimental results that support the approach. 1</p><p>2 0.68522197 <a title="30-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Denoising_and_Untangling_Graphs_Using_Degree_Priors.html">50 nips-2003-Denoising and Untangling Graphs Using Degree Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Quaid D. Morris, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

<p>Author: Song Wang, Toshiro Kubota, Jeffrey M. Siskind</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-theoretic approach, named ratio contour, to extract perceptually salient boundaries from a set of noisy boundary fragments detected in real images. The boundary saliency is deﬁned using the Gestalt laws of closure, proximity, and continuity. This paper ﬁrst constructs an undirected graph with two different sets of edges: solid edges and dashed edges. The weights of solid and dashed edges measure the local saliency in and between boundary fragments, respectively. Then the most salient boundary is detected by searching for an optimal cycle in this graph with minimum average weight. The proposed approach guarantees the global optimality without introducing any biases related to region area or boundary length. We collect a variety of images for testing the proposed approach with encouraging results. 1</p><p>4 0.48831403 <a title="30-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Concentration_of_Expectation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Layered_Networks.html">142 nips-2003-On the Concentration of Expectation and Approximate Inference in Layered Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation (BP) has been successfully used in a number of diﬃcult graphical models to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration of the hidden variables. In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to ﬁnd not just the best conﬁguration but rather the top M . While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world problems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of ﬁnding the M best conﬁgurations when exact inference is impossible. We start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculating the best conﬁgurations that uses only max-marginals. For approximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show empirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best conﬁgurations in graphs with hundreds of variables. 1</p><p>6 0.48237863 <a title="30-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, Irina Rish</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of how well a given distribution can be approximated with probabilistic graphical models. We introduce a new parameter, effective treewidth, that captures the degree of approximability as a tradeoff between the accuracy and the complexity of approximation. We present a simple approach to analyzing achievable tradeoffs that exploits the threshold behavior of monotone graph properties, and provide experimental results that support the approach. 1</p><p>2 0.62196833 <a title="30-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Learning_Bounds_for_a_Generalized_Family_of_Bayesian_Posterior_Distributions.html">103 nips-2003-Learning Bounds for a Generalized Family of Bayesian Posterior Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we obtain convergence bounds for the concentration of Bayesian posterior distributions (around the true distribution) using a novel method that simpliﬁes and enhances previous results. Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distribution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist “bad” prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.62042546 <a title="30-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Learning_Spectral_Clustering.html">107 nips-2003-Learning Spectral Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Francis R. Bach, Michael I. Jordan</p><p>Abstract: Spectral clustering refers to a class of techniques which rely on the eigenstructure of a similarity matrix to partition points into disjoint clusters with points in the same cluster having high similarity and points in different clusters having low similarity. In this paper, we derive a new cost function for spectral clustering based on a measure of error between a given partition and a solution of the spectral relaxation of a minimum normalized cut problem. Minimizing this cost function with respect to the partition leads to a new spectral clustering algorithm. Minimizing with respect to the similarity matrix leads to an algorithm for learning the similarity matrix. We develop a tractable approximation of our cost function that is based on the power method of computing eigenvectors. 1</p><p>4 0.61878067 <a title="30-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Measure_Based_Regularization.html">126 nips-2003-Measure Based Regularization</a></p>
<p>Author: Olivier Bousquet, Olivier Chapelle, Matthias Hein</p><p>Abstract: We address in this paper the question of how the knowledge of the marginal distribution P (x) can be incorporated in a learning algorithm. We suggest three theoretical methods for taking into account this distribution for regularization and provide links to existing graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms. We also propose practical implementations. 1</p><p>5 0.61518425 <a title="30-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time. We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>6 0.61176324 <a title="30-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Unsupervised_Context_Sensitive_Language_Acquisition_from_a_Large_Corpus.html">191 nips-2003-Unsupervised Context Sensitive Language Acquisition from a Large Corpus</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Fanti, Marzia Polito, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Consider a number of moving points, where each point is attached to a joint of the human body and projected onto an image plane. Johannson showed that humans can eﬀortlessly detect and recognize the presence of other humans from such displays. This is true even when some of the body points are missing (e.g. because of occlusion) and unrelated clutter points are added to the display. We are interested in replicating this ability in a machine. To this end, we present a labelling and detection scheme in a probabilistic framework. Our method is based on representing the joint probability density of positions and velocities of body points with a graphical model, and using Loopy Belief Propagation to calculate a likely interpretation of the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a global variable representing the body’s centroid. Experiments on one motion-captured sequence suggest that our scheme improves on the accuracy of a previous approach based on triangulated graphical models, especially when very few parts are visible. The improvement is due both to the more general graph structure we use and, more signiﬁcantly, to the introduction of the centroid variable. 1</p><p>3 0.1812949 <a title="35-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Automatic_Annotation_of_Everyday_Movements.html">37 nips-2003-Automatic Annotation of Everyday Movements</a></p>

The system does not require a ﬁxed background, and is automatic. The system works by (1) tracking people in 2D and then, using an annotated motion capture dataset, (2) synthesizing an annotated 3D motion sequence matching the 2D tracks. The 3D motion capture data is manually annotated off-line using a class structure that describes everyday motions and allows motion annotations to be composed — one may jump while running, for example.

<p>Author: D. Philipona, J.k. O'regan, J.-p. Nadal, Olivier Coenen</p><p>Abstract: Is there a way for an algorithm linked to an unknown body to infer by itself information about this body and the world it is in? Taking the case of space for example, is there a way for this algorithm to realize that its body is in a three dimensional world? Is it possible for this algorithm to discover how to move in a straight line? And more basically: do these questions make any sense at all given that the algorithm only has access to the very high-dimensional data consisting of its sensory inputs and motor outputs? We demonstrate in this article how these questions can be given a positive answer. We show that it is possible to make an algorithm that, by analyzing the law that links its motor outputs to its sensory inputs, discovers information about the structure of the world regardless of the devices constituting the body it is linked to. We present results from simulations demonstrating a way to issue motor orders resulting in “fundamental” movements of the body as regards the structure of the physical world. 1</p><p>5 0.12998204 <a title="35-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Denoising_and_Untangling_Graphs_Using_Degree_Priors.html">50 nips-2003-Denoising and Untangling Graphs Using Degree Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Quaid D. Morris, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets. We test our model (a) (b) 40 0 untangling baseline random empirical potential posterior −2 30 log Pr true positives (%) 50 20 10 −4 −6 −8 0 0 5 10 −10 0 false positives (%) 10 20 30 degree (# of nodes) Figure 3: Protein-protein interaction network untangling results.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Michael Isard, Benjamin H. Sigelman, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: The detection and pose estimation of people in images and video is made challenging by the variability of human appearance, the complexity of natural scenes, and the high dimensionality of articulated body models. To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuousvalued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle ﬁlter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter. 1</p><p>2 0.75532085 <a title="35-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-An_Improved_Scheme_for_Detection_and_Labelling_in_Johansson_Displays.html">22 nips-2003-An Improved Scheme for Detection and Labelling in Johansson Displays</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Fanti, Marzia Polito, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Consider a number of moving points, where each point is attached to a joint of the human body and projected onto an image plane. Johannson showed that humans can eﬀortlessly detect and recognize the presence of other humans from such displays. This is true even when some of the body points are missing (e.g. because of occlusion) and unrelated clutter points are added to the display. We are interested in replicating this ability in a machine. To this end, we present a labelling and detection scheme in a probabilistic framework. Our method is based on representing the joint probability density of positions and velocities of body points with a graphical model, and using Loopy Belief Propagation to calculate a likely interpretation of the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a global variable representing the body’s centroid. Experiments on one motion-captured sequence suggest that our scheme improves on the accuracy of a previous approach based on triangulated graphical models, especially when very few parts are visible. The improvement is due both to the more general graph structure we use and, more signiﬁcantly, to the introduction of the centroid variable. 1</p><p>3 0.62705499 <a title="35-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Perception_of_the_Structure_of_the_Physical_World_Using_Unknown_Multimodal_Sensors_and_Effectors.html">154 nips-2003-Perception of the Structure of the Physical World Using Unknown Multimodal Sensors and Effectors</a></p>
<p>Author: D. Philipona, J.k. O'regan, J.-p. Nadal, Olivier Coenen</p><p>Abstract: Is there a way for an algorithm linked to an unknown body to infer by itself information about this body and the world it is in? Taking the case of space for example, is there a way for this algorithm to realize that its body is in a three dimensional world? Is it possible for this algorithm to discover how to move in a straight line? And more basically: do these questions make any sense at all given that the algorithm only has access to the very high-dimensional data consisting of its sensory inputs and motor outputs? We demonstrate in this article how these questions can be given a positive answer. We show that it is possible to make an algorithm that, by analyzing the law that links its motor outputs to its sensory inputs, discovers information about the structure of the world regardless of the devices constituting the body it is linked to. We present results from simulations demonstrating a way to issue motor orders resulting in “fundamental” movements of the body as regards the structure of the physical world. 1</p><p>4 0.50918561 <a title="35-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Denoising_and_Untangling_Graphs_Using_Degree_Priors.html">50 nips-2003-Denoising and Untangling Graphs Using Degree Priors</a></p>
<p>Author: Quaid D. Morris, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

<p>Author: David Donoho, Victoria Stodden</p><p>Abstract: We interpret non-negative matrix factorization geometrically, as the problem of ﬁnding a simplicial cone which contains a cloud of data points and which is contained in the positive orthant. We show that under certain conditions, basically requiring that some of the data are spread across the faces of the positive orthant, there is a unique such simplicial cone. We give examples of synthetic image articulation databases which obey these conditions; these require separated support and factorial sampling. For such databases there is a generative model in terms of ‘parts’ and NMF correctly identiﬁes the ‘parts’. We show that our theoretical results are predictive of the performance of published NMF code, by running the published algorithms on one of our synthetic image articulation databases. 1</p><p>6 0.47815952 <a title="35-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Automatic_Annotation_of_Everyday_Movements.html">37 nips-2003-Automatic Annotation of Everyday Movements</a></p>

<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Michael Isard, Benjamin H. Sigelman, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: The detection and pose estimation of people in images and video is made challenging by the variability of human appearance, the complexity of natural scenes, and the high dimensionality of articulated body models. To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuousvalued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle ﬁlter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter. 1</p><p>2 0.76275921 <a title="35-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-A_Recurrent_Model_of_Orientation_Maps_with_Simple_and_Complex_Cells.html">16 nips-2003-A Recurrent Model of Orientation Maps with Simple and Complex Cells</a></p>
<p>Author: Paul Merolla, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neuromorphic chip that utilizes transistor heterogeneity, introduced by the fabrication process, to generate orientation maps similar to those imaged in vivo. Our model consists of a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory cells in parallel with a push-pull stage. Similar to a previous model the recurrent network displays hotspots of activity that give rise to visual feature maps. Unlike previous work, however, the map for orientation does not depend on the sign of contrast. Instead, signindependent cells driven by both ON and OFF channels anchor the map, while push-pull interactions give rise to sign-preserving cells. These two groups of orientation-selective cells are similar to complex and simple cells observed in V1. 1 Orientation Maps Neurons in visual areas 1 and 2 (V1 and V2) are selectively tuned for a number of visual features, the most pronounced feature being orientation. Orientation preference of individual cells varies across the two-dimensional surface of the cortex in a stereotyped manner, as revealed by electrophysiology [1] and optical imaging studies [2]. The origin of these preferred orientation (PO) maps is debated, but experiments demonstrate that they exist in the absence of visual experience [3]. To the dismay of advocates of Hebbian learning, these results suggest that the initial appearance of PO maps rely on neural mechanisms oblivious to input correlations. Here, we propose a model that accounts for observed PO maps based on innate noise in neuron thresholds and synaptic currents. The network is implemented in silicon where heterogeneity is as ubiquitous as it is in biology. 2 Patterned Activity Model Ernst et al. have previously described a 2D rate model that can account for the origin of visual maps [4]. Individual units in their network receive isotropic feedforward input from the geniculate and recurrent connections from neighboring units in a Mexican hat profile, described by short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. If the recurrent connections are sufficiently strong, hotspots of activity (or ‘bumps’) form periodically across space. In a homogeneous network, these bumps of activity are equally stable at any position in the network and are free to wander. Introducing random jitter to the Mexican hat connectivity profiles breaks the symmetry and reduces the number of stable states for the bumps. Subsequently, the bumps are pinned down at the locations that maximize their net local recurrent feedback. In this regime, moving gratings are able to shift the bumps away from their stability points such that the responses of the network resemble PO maps. Therefore, the recurrent network, given an ample amount of noise, can innately generate its own orientation specificity without the need for specific hardwired connections or visually driven learning rules. 2.1 Criticisms of the Bump model We might posit that the brain uses a similar opportunistic model to derive and organize its feature maps – but the parallels between the primary visual cortex and the Ernst et al. bump model are unconvincing. For instance, the units in their model represent the collective activity of a column, reducing the network dynamics to a firing-rate approximation. But this simplification ignores the rich temporal dynamics of spiking networks, which are known to affect bump stability. More fundamentally, there is no role for functionally distinct neuron types. The primary criticism of the Ernst et al.’s bump model is that its input only consists of a luminance channel, and it is not obvious how to replace this channel with ON and OFF rectified channels to account for simple and complex cells. One possibility would be to segregate ON-driven and OFF-driven cells (referred to as simple cells in this paper) into two distinct recurrent networks. Because each network would have its own innate noise profile, bumps would form independently. Consequently, there is no guarantee that ON-driven maps would line up with OFF-driven maps, which would result in conflicting orientation signals when these simple cells converge onto sign-independent (complex) cells. 2.2 Simple Cells Solve a Complex Problem To ensure that both ON-driven and OFF-driven simple cells have the same orientation maps, both ON and OFF bumps must be computed in the same recurrent network so that they are subjected to the same noise profile. We achieve this by building our recurrent network out of cells that are sign-independent; that is both ON and OFF channels drive the network. These cells exhibit complex cell-like behavior (and are referred to as complex cells in this paper) because they are modulated at double the spatial frequency of a sinusoidal grating input. The simple cells subsequently derive their responses from two separate signals: an orientation selective feedback signal from the complex cells indicating the presence of either an ON or an OFF bump, and an ON–OFF selection signal that chooses the appropriate response flavor. Figure 1 left illustrates the formation of bumps (highlighted cells) by a recurrent network with a Mexican hat connectivity profile. Extending the Ernst et al. model, these complex bumps seed simple bumps when driven by a grating. Simple bumps that match the sign of the input survive, whereas out-of-phase bumps are extinguished (faded cells) by push-pull inhibition. Figure 1 right shows the local connections within a microcircuit. An EXC (excitatory) cell receives excitatory input from both ON and OFF channels, and projects to other EXC (not shown) and INH (inhibitory) cells. The INH cell projects back in a reciprocal configuration to EXC cells. The divergence is indicated in left. ON-driven and OFF-driven simple cells receive input in a push-pull configuration (i.e., ON cells are excited by ON inputs and inhibited by OFF inputs, and vise-versa), while additionally receiving input from the EXC–INH recurrent network. In this model, we implement our push-pull circuit using monosynaptic inhibitory connections, despite the fact that geniculate input is strictly excitatory. This simplification, while anatomically incorrect, yields a more efficient implementation that is functionally equivalent.

Luminance is transformed into ON (green) and OFF (red) pathways by retinal processing. Complex cells form a recurrent network through excitatory and inhibitory projections (yellow and blue lines, respectively), and clusters of activity occur at twice the spatial frequency of the grating. ON input activates ON-driven simple cells (bright green) and suppresses OFF-driven simple cells (faded red), and vise-versa. right, The bump model’s local microcircuit: circles represent neurons, curved lines represent axon arbors that end in excitatory synapses (v shape) or inhibitory synapses (open circles). For simplicity, inhibitory interneurons were omitted in our push-pull circuit. 2.3 Mathematical Description • The neurons in our network follow the equation CV = −∑ ∂(t − tn) + I syn − I KCa − I leak , • n where C is membrane capacitance, V is the temporal derivative of the membrane voltage, δ(·) is the Dirac delta function, which resets the membrane at the times tn when it crosses threshold, Isyn is synaptic current from the network, and Ileak is a constant leak current. Neurons receive synaptic current of the form: ON I syn = w+ I ON − w− I OFF + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH , EXC I syn = w+ ( I ON + I OFF ) + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH + I back , OFF INH I syn = w+ I OFF − w− I ON + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH , I syn = wIE I EXC where w+ is the excitatory synaptic strength for ON and OFF input synapses, w- is the strength of the push-pull inhibition, wEE is the synaptic strength for EXC cell projections to other EXC cells, wEI is the strength of INH cell projections to EXC cells, wIE is the strength of EXC cell projections to INH cells, Iback is a constant input current, and I{ON,OFF,EXC,INH} account for all impinging synapses from each of the four cell types. These terms are calculated for cell i using an arbor function that consists of a spatial weighting J(r) and a post-synaptic current waveform α(t): k ∑ J (i − k ) ⋅ α (t − t n ) , where k spans all cells of a given type and n indexes their spike k ,n times. The spatial weighting function is described by J (i − k ) = exp( − i − k σ ) , with σ as the space constant. The current waveform, which is non-zero for t>0, convolves a 1 t function with a decaying exponential: α (t ) = (t τ c + α 0 ) −1 ∗ exp(− t τ e ) , where τc is the decay-rate, and τe is the time constant of the exponential. Finally, we model spike-rate adaptation with a calcium-dependent potassium-channel (KCa), which integrates Ca triggered by spikes at times tn with a gain K and a time constant τk, as described by I KCa = ∑ K exp(tn − t τ k ) . n 3 Silicon Implementation We implemented our model in silicon using the TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) 0.25µm 5-metal layer CMOS process. The final chip consists of a 2-D core of 48x48 pixels, surrounded by asynchronous digital circuitry that transmits and receives spikes in real-time. Neurons that reach threshold within the array are encoded as address-events and sent off-chip, and concurrently, incoming address-events are sent to their appropriate synapse locations. This interface is compatible with other spike-based chips that use address-events [5]. The fabricated bump chip has close to 460,000 transistors packed in 10 mm2 of silicon area for a total of 9,216 neurons. 3.1 Circuit Design Our neural circuit was morphed into hardware using four building blocks. Figure 2 shows the transistor implementation for synapses, axonal arbors (diffuser), KCa analogs, and neurons. The circuits are designed to operate in the subthreshold region (except for the spiking mechanism of the neuron). Noise is not purposely designed into the circuits. Instead, random variations from the fabrication process introduce significant deviations in I-V curves of theoretically identical MOS transistors. The function of the synapse circuit is to convert a brief voltage pulse (neuron spike) into a postsynaptic current with biologically realistic temporal dynamics. Our synapse achieves this by cascading a current-mirror integrator with a log-domain low-pass filter. The current-mirror integrator has a current impulse response that decays as 1 t (with a decay rate set by the voltage τc and an amplitude set by A). This time-extended current pulse is fed into a log-domain low-pass filter (equivalent to a current-domain RC circuit) that imposes a rise-time on the post-synaptic current set by τe. ON and OFF input synapses receive presynaptic spikes from the off-chip link, whereas EXC and INH synapses receive presynaptic spikes from local on-chip neurons. Synapse Je Diffuser Ir A Ig Jc KCa Analog Neuron Jk Vmem Vspk K Figure 2: Transistor implementations are shown for a synapse, diffuser, KCa analog, and neuron (simplified), with circuit insignias in the top-left of each box. The circuits they interact with are indicated (e.g. the neuron receives synaptic current from the diffuser as well as adaptation current from the KCa analog; the neuron in turn drives the KCa analog). The far right shows layout for one pixel of the bump chip (vertical dimension is 83µm, horizontal is 30 µm). The diffuser circuit models axonal arbors that project to a local region of space with an exponential weighting. Analogous to resistive divider networks, diffusers [6] efficiently distribute synaptic currents to multiple targets. We use four diffusers to implement axonal projections for: the ON pathway, which excites ON and EXC cells and inhibits OFF cells; the OFF pathway, which excites OFF and EXC cells and inhibits ON cells; the EXC cells, which excite all cell types; and the INH cells, which inhibits EXC, ON, and OFF cells. Each diffuser node connects to its six neighbors through transistors that have a pseudo-conductance set by σr, and to its target site through a pseudo-conductance set by σg; the space-constant of the exponential synaptic decay is set by σr and σg’s relative levels. The neuron circuit integrates diffuser currents on its membrane capacitance. Diffusers either directly inject current (excitatory), or siphon off current (inhibitory) through a current-mirror. Spikes are generated by an inverter with positive feedback (modified from [7]), and the membrane is subsequently reset by the spike signal. We model a calcium concentration in the cell with a KCa analog. K controls the amount of calcium that enters the cell per spike; the concentration decays exponentially with a time constant set by τk. Elevated charge levels activate a KCa-like current that throttles the spike-rate of the neuron. 3.2 Experimental Setup Our setup uses either a silicon retina [8] or a National Instruments DIO (digital input–output) card as input to the bump chip. This allows us to test our V1 model with real-time visual stimuli, similar to the experimental paradigm of electrophysiologists. More specifically, the setup uses an address-event link [5] to establish virtual point-to-point connectivity between ON or OFF ganglion cells from the retina chip (or DIO card) with ON or OFF synapses on the bump chip. Both the input activity and the output activity of the bump chip is displayed in real-time using receiver chips, which integrate incoming spikes and displays their rates as pixel intensities on a monitor. A logic analyzer is used to capture spike output from the bump chip so it can be further analyzed. We investigated responses of the bump chip to gratings moving in sixteen different directions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative aspect, we created a PO map by taking each cell’s average activity for each stimulus direction and computing the vector sum. To obtain a quantitative measure, we looked at the normalized vector magnitude (NVM), which reveals the sharpness of a cell’s tuning. The NVM is calculated by dividing the vector sum by the magnitude sum for each cell. The NVM is 0 if a cell responds equally to all orientations, and 1 if a cell’s orientation selectivity is perfect such that it only responds at a single orientation. 4 Results We presented sixteen moving gratings to the network, with directions ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. The spatial frequency of the grating is tuned to match the size of the average bump, and the temporal frequency is 1 Hz. Figure 3a shows a resulting PO map for directions from 180 to 360 degrees, looking at the inhibitory cell population (the data looks similar for other cell types). Black contours represent stable bump regions, or equivalently, the regions that exceed a prescribed threshold (90 spikes) for all directions. The PO map from the bump chip reveals structure that resembles data from real cortex. Nearby cells tend to prefer similar orientations except at fractures. There are even regions that are similar to pinwheels (delimited by a white rectangle). A PO is a useful tool to describe a network’s selectivity, but it only paints part of the picture. So we have additionally computed a NVM map and a NVM histogram, shown in Figure 3b and 3c respectively. The NVM map shows that cells with sharp selectivity tend to cluster, particularly around the edge of the bumps. The histogram also reveals that the distribution of cell selectivity across the network varies considerably, skewed towards broadly tuned cells. We also looked at spike rasters from different cell-types to gain insight into their phase relationship with the stimulus. In particular, we present recordings for the site indicated by the arrow (see Figure 3a) for gratings moving in eight directions ranging from 0 to 360 degrees in 45-degree increments (this location was chosen because it is in the vicinity of a pinwheel, is reasonably selective, and shows considerable modulation in its firing rate). Figure 4 shows the luminance of the stimulus (bottom sinusoids), ON- (cyan) and OFF-input (magenta) spike trains, and the resulting spike trains from EXC (yellow), INH (blue), ON- (green), and OFFdriven (red) cell types for each of the eight directions. The center polar plot summarizes the orientation selectivity for each cell-type by showing the normalized number of spikes for each stimulus. Data is shown for one period. Even though all cells-types are selective for the same orientation (regardless of grating direction), complex cell responses tend to be phase-insensitive while the simple cell responses are modulated at the fundamental frequency. It is worth noting that the simple cells have sharper orientation selectivity compared to the complex cells. This trend is characteristic of our data. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 300 250 200 150 100 50 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 3: (a) PO map for the inhibitory cell population stimulated with eight different directions from 180 to 360 degrees (black represents no activity, contours delineate regions that exceed 90 spikes for all stimuli).

Each set of spike rasters represent from bottom to top, ON- (cyan) and OFF-input (magenta), INH (yellow), EXC (blue), and ON- (green) and OFF-driven (red). The stimulus period is 1 sec. 5 Discussion We have implemented a large-scale network of spiking neurons in a silicon chip that is based on layer 4 of the visual cortex. The initial testing of the network reveals a PO map, inherited from innate chip heterogeneities, resembling cortical maps. Our microcircuit proposes a novel function for complex-like cells; that is they create a sign-independent orientation selective signal, which through a push-pull circuit creates sharply tuned simple cells with the same orientation preference. Recently, Ringach et al. surveyed orientation selectivity in the macaque [9]. They observed that, in a population of V1 neurons (N=308) the distribution of orientation selectivity is quite broad, having a median NVM of 0.39. We have measured median NVM’s ranging from 0.25 to 0.32. Additionally, Ringach et al. found a negative correlation between spontaneous firing rate and NVM. This is consistent with our model because cells closer to the center of the bump have higher firing rates and broader tuning. While the results from the bump chip are promising, our maps are less consistent and noisier than the maps Ernst et al. have reported. We believe this is because our network is tuned to operate in a fluid state where bumps come on, travel a short distance and disappear (motivated by cortical imaging studies). But excessive fluidity can cause non-dominant bumps to briefly appear and adversely shift the PO maps. We are currently investigating the role of lateral connections between bumps as a means to suppress these spontaneous shifts. The neural mechanisms that underlie the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons are still highly debated. This may be because neuron responses are not only shaped by feedforward inputs, but are also influenced at the network level. If modeling is going to be a useful guide for electrophysiologists, we must model at the network level while retaining cell level detail. Our results demonstrate that a spike-based neuromorphic system is well suited to model layer 4 of the visual cortex. The same approach may be used to build large-scale models of other cortical regions. References 1. Hubel, D. and T.

<p>Author: Stuart Andrews, Thomas Hofmann</p><p>Abstract: Learning from ambiguous training data is highly relevant in many applications. We present a new learning algorithm for classiﬁcation problems where labels are associated with sets of pattern instead of individual patterns. This encompasses multiple instance learning as a special case. Our approach is based on a generalization of linear programming boosting and uses results from disjunctive programming to generate successively stronger linear relaxations of a discrete non-convex problem. 1</p><p>4 0.60933697 <a title="35-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-A_Model_for_Learning_the_Semantics_of_Pictures.html">12 nips-2003-A Model for Learning the Semantics of Pictures</a></p>
<p>Author: Victor Lavrenko, R. Manmatha, Jiwoon Jeon</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to learning the semantics of images which allows us to automatically annotate an image with keywords and to retrieve images based on text queries. We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated images. We assume that every image is divided into regions, each described by a continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations, we compute a joint probabilistic model of image features and words which allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments show that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the best of the previously reported results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval. 1</p><p>5 0.60880655 <a title="35-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Model_Uncertainty_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">130 nips-2003-Model Uncertainty in Classical Conditioning</a></p>
<p>Author: Aaron C. Courville, Geoffrey J. Gordon, David S. Touretzky, Nathaniel D. Daw</p><p>Abstract: We develop a framework based on Bayesian model averaging to explain how animals cope with uncertainty about contingencies in classical conditioning experiments. Traditional accounts of conditioning ﬁt parameters within a ﬁxed generative model of reinforcer delivery; uncertainty over the model structure is not considered. We apply the theory to explain the puzzling relationship between second-order conditioning and conditioned inhibition, two similar conditioning regimes that nonetheless result in strongly divergent behavioral outcomes. According to the theory, second-order conditioning results when limited experience leads animals to prefer a simpler world model that produces spurious correlations; conditioned inhibition results when a more complex model is justiﬁed by additional experience. 1</p><p>6 0.59885448 <a title="35-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Dynamics_of_Boosting.html">143 nips-2003-On the Dynamics of Boosting</a></p>

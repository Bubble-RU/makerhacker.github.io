Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has examined the estimation of models of stimulus-driven neural activity in which some linear ﬁltering process is followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spiking stage. We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-ﬁre mechanism with a spike-dependent aftercurrent. This model is a biophysically plausible alternative to models with Poisson (memory-less) spiking, and has been shown to effectively reproduce various spiking statistics of neurons in vivo. However, the problem of estimating the model from extracellular spike train data has not been examined in depth. We formulate the problem in terms of maximum likelihood estimation, and show that the computational problem of maximizing the likelihood is tractable. Our main contribution is an algorithm and a proof that this algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum with reasonable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with numerical simulations. A central issue in computational neuroscience is the characterization of the functional relationship between sensory stimuli and neural spike trains. A common model for this relationship consists of linear ﬁltering of the stimulus, followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spike generation process. The linear ﬁlter is typically interpreted as the neuron’s “receptive ﬁeld,” while the spiking mechanism accounts for simple nonlinearities like rectiﬁcation and response saturation. Given a set of stimuli and (extracellularly) recorded spike times, the characterization problem consists of estimating both the linear ﬁlter and the parameters governing the spiking mechanism. One widely used model of this type is the Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model, in which spikes are generated according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with rate determined by an instantaneous (“memoryless”) nonlinear function of the ﬁltered input. This model has a number of desirable features, including conceptual simplicity and computational tractability. Additionally, reverse correlation analysis provides a simple unbiased estimator for the linear ﬁlter [5], and the properties of estimators (for both the linear ﬁlter and static nonlinearity) have been thoroughly analyzed, even for the case of highly non-symmetric or “naturalistic” stimuli [12]. One important drawback of the LNP model, * JWP and LP contributed equally to this work. We thank E.J. Chichilnisky for helpful discussions.

In particular, the probability of observing a spike is not a functional of the stimulus only; it is also strongly affected by the recent history of spiking. The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (LIF) model provides a biophysically more realistic spike mechanism with a simple form of spike-history dependence. This model is simple, wellunderstood, and has dynamics that are entirely linear except for a nonlinear “reset” of the membrane potential following a spike. Although this model’s overriding linearity is often emphasized (due to the approximately linear relationship between input current and ﬁring rate, and lack of active conductances), the nonlinear reset has signiﬁcant functional importance for the model’s response properties. In previous work, we have shown that standard reverse correlation analysis fails when applied to a neuron with deterministic (noise-free) LIF spike generation; we developed a new estimator for this model, and demonstrated that a change in leakiness of such a mechanism might underlie nonlinear effects of contrast adaptation in macaque retinal ganglion cells [15]. We and others have explored other “adaptive” properties of the LIF model [17, 13, 19]. In this paper, we consider a model consisting of a linear ﬁlter followed by noisy LIF spike generation with a spike-dependent after-current; this is essentially the standard LIF model driven by a noisy, ﬁltered version of the stimulus, with an additional current waveform injected following each spike. We will refer to this as the the “L-NLIF” model. The probabilistic nature of this model provides several important advantages over the deterministic version we have considered previously. First, an explicit noise model allows us to couch the problem in the terms of classical estimation theory. This, in turn, provides a natural “cost function” (likelihood) for model assessment and leads to more efﬁcient estimation of the model parameters. Second, noise allows us to explicitly model neural ﬁring statistics, and could provide a rigorous basis for a metric distance between spike trains, useful in other contexts [18]. Finally, noise inﬂuences the behavior of the model itself, giving rise to phenomena not observed in the purely deterministic model [11]. Our main contribution here is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the L-NLIF model is computationally tractable. Speciﬁcally, we describe an algorithm for computing the likelihood function, and prove that this likelihood function contains no non-global maxima, implying that the MLE can be computed efﬁciently using standard ascent techniques. The desirable statistical properties of this estimator (e.g. consistency, efﬁciency) are all inherited “for free” from classical estimation theory. Thus, we have a compact and powerful model for the neural code, and a well-motivated, efﬁcient way to estimate the parameters of this model from extracellular data. The Model We consider a model for which the (dimensionless) subthreshold voltage variable V evolves according to i−1 dV = − gV (t) + k · x(t) + j=0 h(t − tj ) dt + σNt , (1) and resets to Vr whenever V = 1. Here, g denotes the leak conductance, k · x(t) the projection of the input signal x(t) onto the linear kernel k, h is an “afterpotential,” a current waveform of ﬁxed amplitude and shape whose value depends only on the time since the last spike ti−1 , and Nt is an unobserved (hidden) noise process with scale parameter σ. Without loss of generality, the “leak” and “threshold” potential are set at 0 and 1, respectively, so the cell spikes whenever V = 1, and V decays back to 0 with time constant 1/g in the absence of input. Note that the nonlinear behavior of the model is completely determined by only a few parameters, namely {g, σ, Vr }, and h (where the function h is allowed to take values in some low-dimensional vector space). The dynamical properties of this type of “spike response model” have been extensively studied [7]; for example, it is known that this class of models can effectively capture much of the behavior of apparently more biophysically realistic models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley). Figures 1 and 2 show several simple comparisons of the L-NLIF and LNP models. In 1, note the ﬁne structure of spike timing in the responses of the L-NLIF model, which is qualitatively similar to in vivo experimental observations [2, 16, 9]). The LNP model fails to capture this ﬁne temporal reproducibility. At the same time, the L-NLIF model is much more ﬂexible and representationally powerful, as demonstrated in Fig. 2: by varying V r or h, for example, we can match a wide variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. adaptation, bursting, bistability) known to exist in biological neurons. The Estimation Problem Our problem now is to estimate the model parameters {k, σ, g, Vr , h} from a sufﬁciently rich, dynamic input sequence x(t) together with spike times {ti }. A natural choice is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is easily proven to be consistent and statistically efﬁcient here. To compute the MLE, we need to compute the likelihood and develop an algorithm for maximizing it. The tractability of the likelihood function for this model arises directly from the linearity of the subthreshold dynamics of voltage V (t) during an interspike interval. In the noiseless case [15], the voltage trace during an interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ] is given by the solution to equation (1) with σ = 0:   V0 (t) = Vr e−gt + t ti−1 i−1 k · x(s) + j=0 h(s − tj ) e−g(t−s) ds, (2) A stimulus h current responses 0 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 2. 0 t stimulus x 0 B c responses c=1 h current 0 c=2 2. 0 c=5 1 )ces( t t 0 0 stimulus C 0 h current responses Figure 2: Illustration of diverse behaviors of L-NLIF model. A: Firing rate adaptation. A positive DC current (top) was injected into three model cells differing only in their h currents (shown on left: top, h = 0; middle, h depolarizing; bottom, h hyperpolarizing). Voltage traces of each cell’s response (right, with spikes superimposed) exhibit rate facilitation for depolarizing h (middle), and rate adaptation for hyperpolarizing h (bottom). B: Bursting. The response of a model cell with a biphasic h current (left) is shown as a function of the three different levels of DC current. For small current levels (top), the cell responds rhythmically. For larger currents (middle and bottom), the cell responds with regular bursts of spikes. C: Bistability. The stimulus (top) is a positive followed by a negative current pulse. Although a cell with no h current (middle) responds transiently to the positive pulse, a cell with biphasic h (bottom) exhibits a bistable response: the positive pulse puts it into a stable ﬁring regime which persists until the arrival of a negative pulse. 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 5 0. t 0 which is simply a linear convolution of the input current with a negative exponential. It is easy to see that adding Gaussian noise to the voltage during each time step induces a Gaussian density over V (t), since linear dynamics preserve Gaussianity [8]. This density is uniquely characterized by its ﬁrst two moments; the mean is given by (2), and its covariance T is σ 2 Eg Eg , where Eg is the convolution operator corresponding to e−gt . Note that this density is highly correlated for nearby points in time, since noise is integrated by the linear dynamics. Intuitively, smaller leak conductance g leads to stronger correlation in V (t) at nearby time points. We denote this Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), where index i indicates the ith spike and the corresponding stimulus chunk xi (i.e. the stimuli that inﬂuence V (t) during the ith interspike interval). Now, on any interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ], the only information we have is that V (t) is less than threshold for all times before ti , and exceeds threshold during the time bin containing ti . This translates to a set of linear constraints on V (t), expressed in terms of the set Ci = ti−1 ≤t < 1 ∩ V (ti ) ≥ 1 . Therefore, the likelihood that the neuron ﬁrst spikes at time ti , given a spike at time ti−1 , is the probability of the event V (t) ∈ Ci , which is given by Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), Ci the integral of the Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h) over the set Ci . sulumits Figure 3: Behavior of the L-NLIF model during a single interspike interval, for a single (repeated) input current (top).

This “renewal” property, in turn, implies that the density over V (t) for an entire experiment factorizes into a product of conditionally independent terms, where each of these terms is one of the Gaussian integrals derived above for a single interspike interval. The likelihood for the entire spike train is therefore the product of these terms over all observed spikes. Putting all the pieces together, then, the full likelihood is L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), i Ci where the product, again, is over all observed spike times {ti } and corresponding stimulus chunks {xi }. Now that we have an expression for the likelihood, we need to be able to maximize it. Our main result now states, basically, that we can use simple ascent algorithms to compute the MLE without getting stuck in local maxima. Theorem 1. The likelihood L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) has no non-global extrema in the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), for any data {xi , ti }. The proof [14] is based on the log-concavity of L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) under a certain parametrization of (k, σ, g, Vr , h). The classical approach for establishing the nonexistence of non-global maxima of a given function uses concavity, which corresponds roughly to the function having everywhere non-positive second derivatives. However, the basic idea can be extended with the use of any invertible function: if f has no non-global extrema, neither will g(f ), for any strictly increasing real function g. The logarithm is a natural choice for g in any probabilistic context in which independence plays a role, since sums are easier to work with than products. Moreover, concavity of a function f is strictly stronger than logconcavity, so logconcavity can be a powerful tool even in situations for which concavity is useless (the Gaussian density is logconcave but not concave, for example). Our proof relies on a particular theorem [3] establishing the logconcavity of integrals of logconcave functions, and proceeds by making a correspondence between this type of integral and the integrals that appear in the deﬁnition of the L-NLIF likelihood above. We should also note that the proof extends without difﬁculty to some other noise processes which generate logconcave densities (where white noise has the standard Gaussian density); for example, the proof is nearly identical if Nt is allowed to be colored or nonGaussian noise, with possibly nonzero drift. Computational methods and numerical results Theorem 1 tells us that we can ascend the likelihood surface without fear of getting stuck in local maxima. Now how do we actually compute the likelihood? This is a nontrivial problem: we need to be able to quickly compute (or at least approximate, in a rational way) integrals of multivariate Gaussian densities G over simple but high-dimensional orthants Ci . We discuss two ways to compute these integrals; each has its own advantages. The ﬁrst technique can be termed “density evolution” [10, 13]. The method is based on the following well-known fact from the theory of stochastic differential equations [8]: given the data (xi , ti−1 ), the probability density of the voltage process V (t) up to the next spike ti satisﬁes the following partial differential (Fokker-Planck) equation: ∂P (V, t) σ2 ∂ 2 P ∂[(V − Veq (t))P ] = , +g 2 ∂t 2 ∂V ∂V under the boundary conditions (3) P (V, ti−1 ) = δ(V − Vr ), P (Vth , t) = 0; where Veq (t) is the instantaneous equilibrium potential:   i−1 1 Veq (t) = h(t − tj ) . k · x(t) + g j=0 Moreover, the conditional ﬁring rate f (t) satisﬁes t ti−1 f (s)ds = 1 − P (V, t)dV. Thus standard techniques for solving the drift-diffusion evolution equation (3) lead to a fast method for computing f (t) (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Finally, the likelihood Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) is simply f (ti ). While elegant and efﬁcient, this density evolution technique turns out to be slightly more powerful than what we need for the MLE: recall that we do not need to compute the conditional rate function f at all times t, but rather just at the set of spike times {ti }, and thus we can turn to more specialized techniques for faster performance. We employ a rapid technique for computing the likelihood using an algorithm due to Genz [6], designed to compute exactly the kinds of multidimensional Gaussian probability integrals considered here. This algorithm works well when the orthants Ci are deﬁned by fewer than ≈ 10 linear constraints on V (t). The number of actual constraints on V (t) during an interspike interval (ti+1 − ti ) grows linearly in the length of the interval: thus, to use this algorithm in typical data situations, we adopt a strategy proposed in our work on the deterministic form of the model [15], in which we discard all but a small subset of the constraints. The key point is that, due to strong correlations in the noise and the fact that the constraints only ﬁgure signiﬁcantly when the V (t) is driven close to threshold, a small number of constraints often sufﬁce to approximate the true likelihood to a high degree of precision. h mitse h eurt K mitse ATS K eurt 0 0 06 )ekips retfa cesm( t 03 0 0 )ekips erofeb cesm( t 001- 002- Figure 4: Demonstration of the estimator’s performance on simulated data. Dashed lines show the true kernel k and aftercurrent h; k is a 12-sample function chosen to resemble the biphasic temporal impulse response of a macaque retinal ganglion cell, while h is function speciﬁed in a ﬁve-dimensional vector space, whose shape induces a slight degree of burstiness in the model’s spike responses. The L-NLIF model was stimulated with parameters g = 0.05 (corresponding to a membrane time constant of 20 time-samples), σ noise = 0.5, and Vr = 0. The stimulus was 30,000 time samples of white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5. With only 600 spikes of output, the estimator is able to retrieve an estimate of k (gray curve) which closely matches the true kernel. Note that the spike-triggered average (black curve), which is an unbiased estimator for the kernel of an LNP neuron [5], differs signiﬁcantly from this true kernel (see also [15]). The accuracy of this approach improves with the number of constraints considered, but performance is fastest with fewer constraints. Therefore, because ascending the likelihood function requires evaluating the likelihood at many different points, we can make this ascent process much quicker by applying a version of the coarse-to-ﬁne idea. Let L k denote the approximation to the likelihood given by allowing only k constraints in the above algorithm. Then we know, by a proof identical to that of Theorem 1, that Lk has no local maxima; in addition, by the above logic, Lk → L as k grows. It takes little additional effort to prove that argmax Lk → argmax L; thus, we can efﬁciently ascend the true likelihood surface by ascending the “coarse” approximants Lk , then gradually “reﬁning” our approximation by letting k increase. An application of this algorithm to simulated data is shown in Fig. 4. Further applications to both simulated and real data will be presented elsewhere. Discussion We have shown here that the L-NLIF model, which couples a linear ﬁltering stage to a biophysically plausible and ﬂexible model of neuronal spiking, can be efﬁciently estimated from extracellular physiological data using maximum likelihood. Moreover, this model lends itself directly to analysis via tools from the modern theory of point processes. For example, once we have obtained our estimate of the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), how do we verify that the resulting model provides an adequate description of the data? This important “model validation” question has been the focus of some recent elegant research, under the rubric of “time rescaling” techniques [4]. While we lack the room here to review these methods in detail, we can note that they depend essentially on knowledge of the conditional ﬁring rate function f (t). Recall that we showed how to efﬁciently compute this function in the last section and examined some of its qualitative properties in the L-NLIF context in Figs. 2 and 3. We are currently in the process of applying the model to physiological data recorded both in vivo and in vitro, in order to assess whether it accurately accounts for the stimulus preferences and spiking statistics of real neurons. One long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the different roles of stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent activity on the spiking patterns of both single cells and multineuronal ensembles.

Finally, noise inﬂuences the behavior of the model itself, giving rise to phenomena not observed in the purely deterministic model [11]. Our main contribution here is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the L-NLIF model is computationally tractable. Speciﬁcally, we describe an algorithm for computing the likelihood function, and prove that this likelihood function contains no non-global maxima, implying that the MLE can be computed efﬁciently using standard ascent techniques. The desirable statistical properties of this estimator (e.g. consistency, efﬁciency) are all inherited “for free” from classical estimation theory. Thus, we have a compact and powerful model for the neural code, and a well-motivated, efﬁcient way to estimate the parameters of this model from extracellular data. The Model We consider a model for which the (dimensionless) subthreshold voltage variable V evolves according to i−1 dV = − gV (t) + k · x(t) + j=0 h(t − tj ) dt + σNt , (1) and resets to Vr whenever V = 1. Here, g denotes the leak conductance, k · x(t) the projection of the input signal x(t) onto the linear kernel k, h is an “afterpotential,” a current waveform of ﬁxed amplitude and shape whose value depends only on the time since the last spike ti−1 , and Nt is an unobserved (hidden) noise process with scale parameter σ. Without loss of generality, the “leak” and “threshold” potential are set at 0 and 1, respectively, so the cell spikes whenever V = 1, and V decays back to 0 with time constant 1/g in the absence of input. Note that the nonlinear behavior of the model is completely determined by only a few parameters, namely {g, σ, Vr }, and h (where the function h is allowed to take values in some low-dimensional vector space). The dynamical properties of this type of “spike response model” have been extensively studied [7]; for example, it is known that this class of models can effectively capture much of the behavior of apparently more biophysically realistic models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley). Figures 1 and 2 show several simple comparisons of the L-NLIF and LNP models. In 1, note the ﬁne structure of spike timing in the responses of the L-NLIF model, which is qualitatively similar to in vivo experimental observations [2, 16, 9]). The LNP model fails to capture this ﬁne temporal reproducibility. At the same time, the L-NLIF model is much more ﬂexible and representationally powerful, as demonstrated in Fig. 2: by varying V r or h, for example, we can match a wide variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. adaptation, bursting, bistability) known to exist in biological neurons. The Estimation Problem Our problem now is to estimate the model parameters {k, σ, g, Vr , h} from a sufﬁciently rich, dynamic input sequence x(t) together with spike times {ti }. A natural choice is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is easily proven to be consistent and statistically efﬁcient here. To compute the MLE, we need to compute the likelihood and develop an algorithm for maximizing it. The tractability of the likelihood function for this model arises directly from the linearity of the subthreshold dynamics of voltage V (t) during an interspike interval. In the noiseless case [15], the voltage trace during an interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ] is given by the solution to equation (1) with σ = 0:   V0 (t) = Vr e−gt + t ti−1 i−1 k · x(s) + j=0 h(s − tj ) e−g(t−s) ds, (2) A stimulus h current responses 0 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 2. 0 t stimulus x 0 B c responses c=1 h current 0 c=2 2. 0 c=5 1 )ces( t t 0 0 stimulus C 0 h current responses Figure 2: Illustration of diverse behaviors of L-NLIF model. A: Firing rate adaptation. A positive DC current (top) was injected into three model cells differing only in their h currents (shown on left: top, h = 0; middle, h depolarizing; bottom, h hyperpolarizing). Voltage traces of each cell’s response (right, with spikes superimposed) exhibit rate facilitation for depolarizing h (middle), and rate adaptation for hyperpolarizing h (bottom). B: Bursting. The response of a model cell with a biphasic h current (left) is shown as a function of the three different levels of DC current. For small current levels (top), the cell responds rhythmically. For larger currents (middle and bottom), the cell responds with regular bursts of spikes. C: Bistability. The stimulus (top) is a positive followed by a negative current pulse. Although a cell with no h current (middle) responds transiently to the positive pulse, a cell with biphasic h (bottom) exhibits a bistable response: the positive pulse puts it into a stable ﬁring regime which persists until the arrival of a negative pulse. 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 5 0. t 0 which is simply a linear convolution of the input current with a negative exponential. It is easy to see that adding Gaussian noise to the voltage during each time step induces a Gaussian density over V (t), since linear dynamics preserve Gaussianity [8]. This density is uniquely characterized by its ﬁrst two moments; the mean is given by (2), and its covariance T is σ 2 Eg Eg , where Eg is the convolution operator corresponding to e−gt . Note that this density is highly correlated for nearby points in time, since noise is integrated by the linear dynamics. Intuitively, smaller leak conductance g leads to stronger correlation in V (t) at nearby time points. We denote this Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), where index i indicates the ith spike and the corresponding stimulus chunk xi (i.e. the stimuli that inﬂuence V (t) during the ith interspike interval). Now, on any interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ], the only information we have is that V (t) is less than threshold for all times before ti , and exceeds threshold during the time bin containing ti . This translates to a set of linear constraints on V (t), expressed in terms of the set Ci = ti−1 ≤t < 1 ∩ V (ti ) ≥ 1 . Therefore, the likelihood that the neuron ﬁrst spikes at time ti , given a spike at time ti−1 , is the probability of the event V (t) ∈ Ci , which is given by Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), Ci the integral of the Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h) over the set Ci . sulumits Figure 3: Behavior of the L-NLIF model during a single interspike interval, for a single (repeated) input current (top).

Note the strong correlation between neighboring time points, and the sparsening of the plot as traces are eliminated by spiking. Bottom Middle: Time evolution of P (V ). Each column represents the conditional distribution of V at the corresponding time (i.e. for all traces that have not yet crossed threshold).

This “renewal” property, in turn, implies that the density over V (t) for an entire experiment factorizes into a product of conditionally independent terms, where each of these terms is one of the Gaussian integrals derived above for a single interspike interval. The likelihood for the entire spike train is therefore the product of these terms over all observed spikes. Putting all the pieces together, then, the full likelihood is L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), i Ci where the product, again, is over all observed spike times {ti } and corresponding stimulus chunks {xi }. Now that we have an expression for the likelihood, we need to be able to maximize it. Our main result now states, basically, that we can use simple ascent algorithms to compute the MLE without getting stuck in local maxima. Theorem 1. The likelihood L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) has no non-global extrema in the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), for any data {xi , ti }. The proof [14] is based on the log-concavity of L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) under a certain parametrization of (k, σ, g, Vr , h). The classical approach for establishing the nonexistence of non-global maxima of a given function uses concavity, which corresponds roughly to the function having everywhere non-positive second derivatives. However, the basic idea can be extended with the use of any invertible function: if f has no non-global extrema, neither will g(f ), for any strictly increasing real function g. The logarithm is a natural choice for g in any probabilistic context in which independence plays a role, since sums are easier to work with than products. Moreover, concavity of a function f is strictly stronger than logconcavity, so logconcavity can be a powerful tool even in situations for which concavity is useless (the Gaussian density is logconcave but not concave, for example). Our proof relies on a particular theorem [3] establishing the logconcavity of integrals of logconcave functions, and proceeds by making a correspondence between this type of integral and the integrals that appear in the deﬁnition of the L-NLIF likelihood above. We should also note that the proof extends without difﬁculty to some other noise processes which generate logconcave densities (where white noise has the standard Gaussian density); for example, the proof is nearly identical if Nt is allowed to be colored or nonGaussian noise, with possibly nonzero drift. Computational methods and numerical results Theorem 1 tells us that we can ascend the likelihood surface without fear of getting stuck in local maxima. Now how do we actually compute the likelihood? This is a nontrivial problem: we need to be able to quickly compute (or at least approximate, in a rational way) integrals of multivariate Gaussian densities G over simple but high-dimensional orthants Ci . We discuss two ways to compute these integrals; each has its own advantages. The ﬁrst technique can be termed “density evolution” [10, 13]. The method is based on the following well-known fact from the theory of stochastic differential equations [8]: given the data (xi , ti−1 ), the probability density of the voltage process V (t) up to the next spike ti satisﬁes the following partial differential (Fokker-Planck) equation: ∂P (V, t) σ2 ∂ 2 P ∂[(V − Veq (t))P ] = , +g 2 ∂t 2 ∂V ∂V under the boundary conditions (3) P (V, ti−1 ) = δ(V − Vr ), P (Vth , t) = 0; where Veq (t) is the instantaneous equilibrium potential:   i−1 1 Veq (t) = h(t − tj ) . k · x(t) + g j=0 Moreover, the conditional ﬁring rate f (t) satisﬁes t ti−1 f (s)ds = 1 − P (V, t)dV. Thus standard techniques for solving the drift-diffusion evolution equation (3) lead to a fast method for computing f (t) (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Finally, the likelihood Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) is simply f (ti ). While elegant and efﬁcient, this density evolution technique turns out to be slightly more powerful than what we need for the MLE: recall that we do not need to compute the conditional rate function f at all times t, but rather just at the set of spike times {ti }, and thus we can turn to more specialized techniques for faster performance. We employ a rapid technique for computing the likelihood using an algorithm due to Genz [6], designed to compute exactly the kinds of multidimensional Gaussian probability integrals considered here. This algorithm works well when the orthants Ci are deﬁned by fewer than ≈ 10 linear constraints on V (t). The number of actual constraints on V (t) during an interspike interval (ti+1 − ti ) grows linearly in the length of the interval: thus, to use this algorithm in typical data situations, we adopt a strategy proposed in our work on the deterministic form of the model [15], in which we discard all but a small subset of the constraints. The key point is that, due to strong correlations in the noise and the fact that the constraints only ﬁgure signiﬁcantly when the V (t) is driven close to threshold, a small number of constraints often sufﬁce to approximate the true likelihood to a high degree of precision. h mitse h eurt K mitse ATS K eurt 0 0 06 )ekips retfa cesm( t 03 0 0 )ekips erofeb cesm( t 001- 002- Figure 4: Demonstration of the estimator’s performance on simulated data. Dashed lines show the true kernel k and aftercurrent h; k is a 12-sample function chosen to resemble the biphasic temporal impulse response of a macaque retinal ganglion cell, while h is function speciﬁed in a ﬁve-dimensional vector space, whose shape induces a slight degree of burstiness in the model’s spike responses. The L-NLIF model was stimulated with parameters g = 0.05 (corresponding to a membrane time constant of 20 time-samples), σ noise = 0.5, and Vr = 0. The stimulus was 30,000 time samples of white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5. With only 600 spikes of output, the estimator is able to retrieve an estimate of k (gray curve) which closely matches the true kernel. Note that the spike-triggered average (black curve), which is an unbiased estimator for the kernel of an LNP neuron [5], differs signiﬁcantly from this true kernel (see also [15]). The accuracy of this approach improves with the number of constraints considered, but performance is fastest with fewer constraints. Therefore, because ascending the likelihood function requires evaluating the likelihood at many different points, we can make this ascent process much quicker by applying a version of the coarse-to-ﬁne idea. Let L k denote the approximation to the likelihood given by allowing only k constraints in the above algorithm. Then we know, by a proof identical to that of Theorem 1, that Lk has no local maxima; in addition, by the above logic, Lk → L as k grows. It takes little additional effort to prove that argmax Lk → argmax L; thus, we can efﬁciently ascend the true likelihood surface by ascending the “coarse” approximants Lk , then gradually “reﬁning” our approximation by letting k increase. An application of this algorithm to simulated data is shown in Fig. 4. Further applications to both simulated and real data will be presented elsewhere. Discussion We have shown here that the L-NLIF model, which couples a linear ﬁltering stage to a biophysically plausible and ﬂexible model of neuronal spiking, can be efﬁciently estimated from extracellular physiological data using maximum likelihood. Moreover, this model lends itself directly to analysis via tools from the modern theory of point processes. For example, once we have obtained our estimate of the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), how do we verify that the resulting model provides an adequate description of the data? This important “model validation” question has been the focus of some recent elegant research, under the rubric of “time rescaling” techniques [4]. While we lack the room here to review these methods in detail, we can note that they depend essentially on knowledge of the conditional ﬁring rate function f (t). Recall that we showed how to efﬁciently compute this function in the last section and examined some of its qualitative properties in the L-NLIF context in Figs. 2 and 3. We are currently in the process of applying the model to physiological data recorded both in vivo and in vitro, in order to assess whether it accurately accounts for the stimulus preferences and spiking statistics of real neurons. One long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the different roles of stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent activity on the spiking patterns of both single cells and multineuronal ensembles.

<p>Author: Paul Merolla, Kwabena A. Boahen</p><p>Abstract: We describe a neuromorphic chip that utilizes transistor heterogeneity, introduced by the fabrication process, to generate orientation maps similar to those imaged in vivo. Our model consists of a recurrent network of excitatory and inhibitory cells in parallel with a push-pull stage. Similar to a previous model the recurrent network displays hotspots of activity that give rise to visual feature maps. Unlike previous work, however, the map for orientation does not depend on the sign of contrast. Instead, signindependent cells driven by both ON and OFF channels anchor the map, while push-pull interactions give rise to sign-preserving cells. These two groups of orientation-selective cells are similar to complex and simple cells observed in V1. 1 Orientation Maps Neurons in visual areas 1 and 2 (V1 and V2) are selectively tuned for a number of visual features, the most pronounced feature being orientation. Orientation preference of individual cells varies across the two-dimensional surface of the cortex in a stereotyped manner, as revealed by electrophysiology [1] and optical imaging studies [2]. The origin of these preferred orientation (PO) maps is debated, but experiments demonstrate that they exist in the absence of visual experience [3]. To the dismay of advocates of Hebbian learning, these results suggest that the initial appearance of PO maps rely on neural mechanisms oblivious to input correlations. Here, we propose a model that accounts for observed PO maps based on innate noise in neuron thresholds and synaptic currents. The network is implemented in silicon where heterogeneity is as ubiquitous as it is in biology. 2 Patterned Activity Model Ernst et al. have previously described a 2D rate model that can account for the origin of visual maps [4]. Individual units in their network receive isotropic feedforward input from the geniculate and recurrent connections from neighboring units in a Mexican hat profile, described by short-range excitation and long-range inhibition. If the recurrent connections are sufficiently strong, hotspots of activity (or ‘bumps’) form periodically across space. In a homogeneous network, these bumps of activity are equally stable at any position in the network and are free to wander. Introducing random jitter to the Mexican hat connectivity profiles breaks the symmetry and reduces the number of stable states for the bumps. Subsequently, the bumps are pinned down at the locations that maximize their net local recurrent feedback. In this regime, moving gratings are able to shift the bumps away from their stability points such that the responses of the network resemble PO maps. Therefore, the recurrent network, given an ample amount of noise, can innately generate its own orientation specificity without the need for specific hardwired connections or visually driven learning rules. 2.1 Criticisms of the Bump model We might posit that the brain uses a similar opportunistic model to derive and organize its feature maps – but the parallels between the primary visual cortex and the Ernst et al. bump model are unconvincing. For instance, the units in their model represent the collective activity of a column, reducing the network dynamics to a firing-rate approximation. But this simplification ignores the rich temporal dynamics of spiking networks, which are known to affect bump stability. More fundamentally, there is no role for functionally distinct neuron types. The primary criticism of the Ernst et al.’s bump model is that its input only consists of a luminance channel, and it is not obvious how to replace this channel with ON and OFF rectified channels to account for simple and complex cells. One possibility would be to segregate ON-driven and OFF-driven cells (referred to as simple cells in this paper) into two distinct recurrent networks. Because each network would have its own innate noise profile, bumps would form independently. Consequently, there is no guarantee that ON-driven maps would line up with OFF-driven maps, which would result in conflicting orientation signals when these simple cells converge onto sign-independent (complex) cells. 2.2 Simple Cells Solve a Complex Problem To ensure that both ON-driven and OFF-driven simple cells have the same orientation maps, both ON and OFF bumps must be computed in the same recurrent network so that they are subjected to the same noise profile. We achieve this by building our recurrent network out of cells that are sign-independent; that is both ON and OFF channels drive the network. These cells exhibit complex cell-like behavior (and are referred to as complex cells in this paper) because they are modulated at double the spatial frequency of a sinusoidal grating input. The simple cells subsequently derive their responses from two separate signals: an orientation selective feedback signal from the complex cells indicating the presence of either an ON or an OFF bump, and an ON–OFF selection signal that chooses the appropriate response flavor. Figure 1 left illustrates the formation of bumps (highlighted cells) by a recurrent network with a Mexican hat connectivity profile. Extending the Ernst et al. model, these complex bumps seed simple bumps when driven by a grating. Simple bumps that match the sign of the input survive, whereas out-of-phase bumps are extinguished (faded cells) by push-pull inhibition. Figure 1 right shows the local connections within a microcircuit. An EXC (excitatory) cell receives excitatory input from both ON and OFF channels, and projects to other EXC (not shown) and INH (inhibitory) cells. The INH cell projects back in a reciprocal configuration to EXC cells. The divergence is indicated in left. ON-driven and OFF-driven simple cells receive input in a push-pull configuration (i.e., ON cells are excited by ON inputs and inhibited by OFF inputs, and vise-versa), while additionally receiving input from the EXC–INH recurrent network. In this model, we implement our push-pull circuit using monosynaptic inhibitory connections, despite the fact that geniculate input is strictly excitatory. This simplification, while anatomically incorrect, yields a more efficient implementation that is functionally equivalent.

Neurons receive synaptic current of the form: ON I syn = w+ I ON − w− I OFF + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH , EXC I syn = w+ ( I ON + I OFF ) + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH + I back , OFF INH I syn = w+ I OFF − w− I ON + wEE I EXC − wEI I INH , I syn = wIE I EXC where w+ is the excitatory synaptic strength for ON and OFF input synapses, w- is the strength of the push-pull inhibition, wEE is the synaptic strength for EXC cell projections to other EXC cells, wEI is the strength of INH cell projections to EXC cells, wIE is the strength of EXC cell projections to INH cells, Iback is a constant input current, and I{ON,OFF,EXC,INH} account for all impinging synapses from each of the four cell types. These terms are calculated for cell i using an arbor function that consists of a spatial weighting J(r) and a post-synaptic current waveform α(t): k ∑ J (i − k ) ⋅ α (t − t n ) , where k spans all cells of a given type and n indexes their spike k ,n times. The spatial weighting function is described by J (i − k ) = exp( − i − k σ ) , with σ as the space constant. The current waveform, which is non-zero for t>0, convolves a 1 t function with a decaying exponential: α (t ) = (t τ c + α 0 ) −1 ∗ exp(− t τ e ) , where τc is the decay-rate, and τe is the time constant of the exponential. Finally, we model spike-rate adaptation with a calcium-dependent potassium-channel (KCa), which integrates Ca triggered by spikes at times tn with a gain K and a time constant τk, as described by I KCa = ∑ K exp(tn − t τ k ) . n 3 Silicon Implementation We implemented our model in silicon using the TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company) 0.25µm 5-metal layer CMOS process. The final chip consists of a 2-D core of 48x48 pixels, surrounded by asynchronous digital circuitry that transmits and receives spikes in real-time. Neurons that reach threshold within the array are encoded as address-events and sent off-chip, and concurrently, incoming address-events are sent to their appropriate synapse locations. This interface is compatible with other spike-based chips that use address-events [5]. The fabricated bump chip has close to 460,000 transistors packed in 10 mm2 of silicon area for a total of 9,216 neurons. 3.1 Circuit Design Our neural circuit was morphed into hardware using four building blocks. Figure 2 shows the transistor implementation for synapses, axonal arbors (diffuser), KCa analogs, and neurons. The circuits are designed to operate in the subthreshold region (except for the spiking mechanism of the neuron). Noise is not purposely designed into the circuits. Instead, random variations from the fabrication process introduce significant deviations in I-V curves of theoretically identical MOS transistors. The function of the synapse circuit is to convert a brief voltage pulse (neuron spike) into a postsynaptic current with biologically realistic temporal dynamics. Our synapse achieves this by cascading a current-mirror integrator with a log-domain low-pass filter. The current-mirror integrator has a current impulse response that decays as 1 t (with a decay rate set by the voltage τc and an amplitude set by A). This time-extended current pulse is fed into a log-domain low-pass filter (equivalent to a current-domain RC circuit) that imposes a rise-time on the post-synaptic current set by τe. ON and OFF input synapses receive presynaptic spikes from the off-chip link, whereas EXC and INH synapses receive presynaptic spikes from local on-chip neurons.

The circuits they interact with are indicated (e.g. the neuron receives synaptic current from the diffuser as well as adaptation current from the KCa analog; the neuron in turn drives the KCa analog). The far right shows layout for one pixel of the bump chip (vertical dimension is 83µm, horizontal is 30 µm). The diffuser circuit models axonal arbors that project to a local region of space with an exponential weighting. Analogous to resistive divider networks, diffusers [6] efficiently distribute synaptic currents to multiple targets. We use four diffusers to implement axonal projections for: the ON pathway, which excites ON and EXC cells and inhibits OFF cells; the OFF pathway, which excites OFF and EXC cells and inhibits ON cells; the EXC cells, which excite all cell types; and the INH cells, which inhibits EXC, ON, and OFF cells. Each diffuser node connects to its six neighbors through transistors that have a pseudo-conductance set by σr, and to its target site through a pseudo-conductance set by σg; the space-constant of the exponential synaptic decay is set by σr and σg’s relative levels. The neuron circuit integrates diffuser currents on its membrane capacitance. Diffusers either directly inject current (excitatory), or siphon off current (inhibitory) through a current-mirror. Spikes are generated by an inverter with positive feedback (modified from [7]), and the membrane is subsequently reset by the spike signal. We model a calcium concentration in the cell with a KCa analog. K controls the amount of calcium that enters the cell per spike; the concentration decays exponentially with a time constant set by τk. Elevated charge levels activate a KCa-like current that throttles the spike-rate of the neuron. 3.2 Experimental Setup Our setup uses either a silicon retina [8] or a National Instruments DIO (digital input–output) card as input to the bump chip. This allows us to test our V1 model with real-time visual stimuli, similar to the experimental paradigm of electrophysiologists. More specifically, the setup uses an address-event link [5] to establish virtual point-to-point connectivity between ON or OFF ganglion cells from the retina chip (or DIO card) with ON or OFF synapses on the bump chip. Both the input activity and the output activity of the bump chip is displayed in real-time using receiver chips, which integrate incoming spikes and displays their rates as pixel intensities on a monitor. A logic analyzer is used to capture spike output from the bump chip so it can be further analyzed. We investigated responses of the bump chip to gratings moving in sixteen different directions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative aspect, we created a PO map by taking each cell’s average activity for each stimulus direction and computing the vector sum. To obtain a quantitative measure, we looked at the normalized vector magnitude (NVM), which reveals the sharpness of a cell’s tuning. The NVM is calculated by dividing the vector sum by the magnitude sum for each cell. The NVM is 0 if a cell responds equally to all orientations, and 1 if a cell’s orientation selectivity is perfect such that it only responds at a single orientation. 4 Results We presented sixteen moving gratings to the network, with directions ranging from 0 to 360 degrees. The spatial frequency of the grating is tuned to match the size of the average bump, and the temporal frequency is 1 Hz. Figure 3a shows a resulting PO map for directions from 180 to 360 degrees, looking at the inhibitory cell population (the data looks similar for other cell types). Black contours represent stable bump regions, or equivalently, the regions that exceed a prescribed threshold (90 spikes) for all directions. The PO map from the bump chip reveals structure that resembles data from real cortex. Nearby cells tend to prefer similar orientations except at fractures. There are even regions that are similar to pinwheels (delimited by a white rectangle). A PO is a useful tool to describe a network’s selectivity, but it only paints part of the picture. So we have additionally computed a NVM map and a NVM histogram, shown in Figure 3b and 3c respectively. The NVM map shows that cells with sharp selectivity tend to cluster, particularly around the edge of the bumps. The histogram also reveals that the distribution of cell selectivity across the network varies considerably, skewed towards broadly tuned cells. We also looked at spike rasters from different cell-types to gain insight into their phase relationship with the stimulus. In particular, we present recordings for the site indicated by the arrow (see Figure 3a) for gratings moving in eight directions ranging from 0 to 360 degrees in 45-degree increments (this location was chosen because it is in the vicinity of a pinwheel, is reasonably selective, and shows considerable modulation in its firing rate). Figure 4 shows the luminance of the stimulus (bottom sinusoids), ON- (cyan) and OFF-input (magenta) spike trains, and the resulting spike trains from EXC (yellow), INH (blue), ON- (green), and OFFdriven (red) cell types for each of the eight directions. The center polar plot summarizes the orientation selectivity for each cell-type by showing the normalized number of spikes for each stimulus. Data is shown for one period. Even though all cells-types are selective for the same orientation (regardless of grating direction), complex cell responses tend to be phase-insensitive while the simple cell responses are modulated at the fundamental frequency. It is worth noting that the simple cells have sharper orientation selectivity compared to the complex cells. This trend is characteristic of our data. 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 300 250 200 150 100 50 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180 0 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 1 Figure 3: (a) PO map for the inhibitory cell population stimulated with eight different directions from 180 to 360 degrees (black represents no activity, contours delineate regions that exceed 90 spikes for all stimuli).

The stimulus period is 1 sec. 5 Discussion We have implemented a large-scale network of spiking neurons in a silicon chip that is based on layer 4 of the visual cortex. The initial testing of the network reveals a PO map, inherited from innate chip heterogeneities, resembling cortical maps. Our microcircuit proposes a novel function for complex-like cells; that is they create a sign-independent orientation selective signal, which through a push-pull circuit creates sharply tuned simple cells with the same orientation preference. Recently, Ringach et al. surveyed orientation selectivity in the macaque [9]. They observed that, in a population of V1 neurons (N=308) the distribution of orientation selectivity is quite broad, having a median NVM of 0.39. We have measured median NVM’s ranging from 0.25 to 0.32. Additionally, Ringach et al. found a negative correlation between spontaneous firing rate and NVM. This is consistent with our model because cells closer to the center of the bump have higher firing rates and broader tuning. While the results from the bump chip are promising, our maps are less consistent and noisier than the maps Ernst et al. have reported. We believe this is because our network is tuned to operate in a fluid state where bumps come on, travel a short distance and disappear (motivated by cortical imaging studies). But excessive fluidity can cause non-dominant bumps to briefly appear and adversely shift the PO maps. We are currently investigating the role of lateral connections between bumps as a means to suppress these spontaneous shifts. The neural mechanisms that underlie the orientation selectivity of V1 neurons are still highly debated. This may be because neuron responses are not only shaped by feedforward inputs, but are also influenced at the network level. If modeling is going to be a useful guide for electrophysiologists, we must model at the network level while retaining cell level detail. Our results demonstrate that a spike-based neuromorphic system is well suited to model layer 4 of the visual cortex. The same approach may be used to build large-scale models of other cortical regions. References 1. Hubel, D. and T.

<p>Author: Liam Paninski, Eero P. Simoncelli, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has examined the estimation of models of stimulus-driven neural activity in which some linear ﬁltering process is followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spiking stage. We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-ﬁre mechanism with a spike-dependent aftercurrent. This model is a biophysically plausible alternative to models with Poisson (memory-less) spiking, and has been shown to effectively reproduce various spiking statistics of neurons in vivo. However, the problem of estimating the model from extracellular spike train data has not been examined in depth. We formulate the problem in terms of maximum likelihood estimation, and show that the computational problem of maximizing the likelihood is tractable. Our main contribution is an algorithm and a proof that this algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum with reasonable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with numerical simulations. A central issue in computational neuroscience is the characterization of the functional relationship between sensory stimuli and neural spike trains. A common model for this relationship consists of linear ﬁltering of the stimulus, followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spike generation process. The linear ﬁlter is typically interpreted as the neuron’s “receptive ﬁeld,” while the spiking mechanism accounts for simple nonlinearities like rectiﬁcation and response saturation. Given a set of stimuli and (extracellularly) recorded spike times, the characterization problem consists of estimating both the linear ﬁlter and the parameters governing the spiking mechanism. One widely used model of this type is the Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model, in which spikes are generated according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with rate determined by an instantaneous (“memoryless”) nonlinear function of the ﬁltered input. This model has a number of desirable features, including conceptual simplicity and computational tractability. Additionally, reverse correlation analysis provides a simple unbiased estimator for the linear ﬁlter [5], and the properties of estimators (for both the linear ﬁlter and static nonlinearity) have been thoroughly analyzed, even for the case of highly non-symmetric or “naturalistic” stimuli [12]. One important drawback of the LNP model, * JWP and LP contributed equally to this work. We thank E.J. Chichilnisky for helpful discussions.

In particular, the probability of observing a spike is not a functional of the stimulus only; it is also strongly affected by the recent history of spiking. The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (LIF) model provides a biophysically more realistic spike mechanism with a simple form of spike-history dependence. This model is simple, wellunderstood, and has dynamics that are entirely linear except for a nonlinear “reset” of the membrane potential following a spike. Although this model’s overriding linearity is often emphasized (due to the approximately linear relationship between input current and ﬁring rate, and lack of active conductances), the nonlinear reset has signiﬁcant functional importance for the model’s response properties. In previous work, we have shown that standard reverse correlation analysis fails when applied to a neuron with deterministic (noise-free) LIF spike generation; we developed a new estimator for this model, and demonstrated that a change in leakiness of such a mechanism might underlie nonlinear effects of contrast adaptation in macaque retinal ganglion cells [15]. We and others have explored other “adaptive” properties of the LIF model [17, 13, 19]. In this paper, we consider a model consisting of a linear ﬁlter followed by noisy LIF spike generation with a spike-dependent after-current; this is essentially the standard LIF model driven by a noisy, ﬁltered version of the stimulus, with an additional current waveform injected following each spike. We will refer to this as the the “L-NLIF” model. The probabilistic nature of this model provides several important advantages over the deterministic version we have considered previously. First, an explicit noise model allows us to couch the problem in the terms of classical estimation theory. This, in turn, provides a natural “cost function” (likelihood) for model assessment and leads to more efﬁcient estimation of the model parameters. Second, noise allows us to explicitly model neural ﬁring statistics, and could provide a rigorous basis for a metric distance between spike trains, useful in other contexts [18]. Finally, noise inﬂuences the behavior of the model itself, giving rise to phenomena not observed in the purely deterministic model [11]. Our main contribution here is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the L-NLIF model is computationally tractable. Speciﬁcally, we describe an algorithm for computing the likelihood function, and prove that this likelihood function contains no non-global maxima, implying that the MLE can be computed efﬁciently using standard ascent techniques. The desirable statistical properties of this estimator (e.g. consistency, efﬁciency) are all inherited “for free” from classical estimation theory. Thus, we have a compact and powerful model for the neural code, and a well-motivated, efﬁcient way to estimate the parameters of this model from extracellular data. The Model We consider a model for which the (dimensionless) subthreshold voltage variable V evolves according to i−1 dV = − gV (t) + k · x(t) + j=0 h(t − tj ) dt + σNt , (1) and resets to Vr whenever V = 1. Here, g denotes the leak conductance, k · x(t) the projection of the input signal x(t) onto the linear kernel k, h is an “afterpotential,” a current waveform of ﬁxed amplitude and shape whose value depends only on the time since the last spike ti−1 , and Nt is an unobserved (hidden) noise process with scale parameter σ. Without loss of generality, the “leak” and “threshold” potential are set at 0 and 1, respectively, so the cell spikes whenever V = 1, and V decays back to 0 with time constant 1/g in the absence of input. Note that the nonlinear behavior of the model is completely determined by only a few parameters, namely {g, σ, Vr }, and h (where the function h is allowed to take values in some low-dimensional vector space). The dynamical properties of this type of “spike response model” have been extensively studied [7]; for example, it is known that this class of models can effectively capture much of the behavior of apparently more biophysically realistic models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley). Figures 1 and 2 show several simple comparisons of the L-NLIF and LNP models. In 1, note the ﬁne structure of spike timing in the responses of the L-NLIF model, which is qualitatively similar to in vivo experimental observations [2, 16, 9]). The LNP model fails to capture this ﬁne temporal reproducibility. At the same time, the L-NLIF model is much more ﬂexible and representationally powerful, as demonstrated in Fig. 2: by varying V r or h, for example, we can match a wide variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. adaptation, bursting, bistability) known to exist in biological neurons. The Estimation Problem Our problem now is to estimate the model parameters {k, σ, g, Vr , h} from a sufﬁciently rich, dynamic input sequence x(t) together with spike times {ti }. A natural choice is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is easily proven to be consistent and statistically efﬁcient here. To compute the MLE, we need to compute the likelihood and develop an algorithm for maximizing it. The tractability of the likelihood function for this model arises directly from the linearity of the subthreshold dynamics of voltage V (t) during an interspike interval. In the noiseless case [15], the voltage trace during an interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ] is given by the solution to equation (1) with σ = 0:   V0 (t) = Vr e−gt + t ti−1 i−1 k · x(s) + j=0 h(s − tj ) e−g(t−s) ds, (2) A stimulus h current responses 0 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 2. 0 t stimulus x 0 B c responses c=1 h current 0 c=2 2. 0 c=5 1 )ces( t t 0 0 stimulus C 0 h current responses Figure 2: Illustration of diverse behaviors of L-NLIF model. A: Firing rate adaptation. A positive DC current (top) was injected into three model cells differing only in their h currents (shown on left: top, h = 0; middle, h depolarizing; bottom, h hyperpolarizing). Voltage traces of each cell’s response (right, with spikes superimposed) exhibit rate facilitation for depolarizing h (middle), and rate adaptation for hyperpolarizing h (bottom). B: Bursting. The response of a model cell with a biphasic h current (left) is shown as a function of the three different levels of DC current. For small current levels (top), the cell responds rhythmically. For larger currents (middle and bottom), the cell responds with regular bursts of spikes. C: Bistability. The stimulus (top) is a positive followed by a negative current pulse. Although a cell with no h current (middle) responds transiently to the positive pulse, a cell with biphasic h (bottom) exhibits a bistable response: the positive pulse puts it into a stable ﬁring regime which persists until the arrival of a negative pulse. 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 5 0. t 0 which is simply a linear convolution of the input current with a negative exponential. It is easy to see that adding Gaussian noise to the voltage during each time step induces a Gaussian density over V (t), since linear dynamics preserve Gaussianity [8]. This density is uniquely characterized by its ﬁrst two moments; the mean is given by (2), and its covariance T is σ 2 Eg Eg , where Eg is the convolution operator corresponding to e−gt . Note that this density is highly correlated for nearby points in time, since noise is integrated by the linear dynamics. Intuitively, smaller leak conductance g leads to stronger correlation in V (t) at nearby time points. We denote this Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), where index i indicates the ith spike and the corresponding stimulus chunk xi (i.e. the stimuli that inﬂuence V (t) during the ith interspike interval). Now, on any interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ], the only information we have is that V (t) is less than threshold for all times before ti , and exceeds threshold during the time bin containing ti . This translates to a set of linear constraints on V (t), expressed in terms of the set Ci = ti−1 ≤t < 1 ∩ V (ti ) ≥ 1 . Therefore, the likelihood that the neuron ﬁrst spikes at time ti , given a spike at time ti−1 , is the probability of the event V (t) ∈ Ci , which is given by Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), Ci the integral of the Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h) over the set Ci . sulumits Figure 3: Behavior of the L-NLIF model during a single interspike interval, for a single (repeated) input current (top).

This “renewal” property, in turn, implies that the density over V (t) for an entire experiment factorizes into a product of conditionally independent terms, where each of these terms is one of the Gaussian integrals derived above for a single interspike interval. The likelihood for the entire spike train is therefore the product of these terms over all observed spikes. Putting all the pieces together, then, the full likelihood is L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), i Ci where the product, again, is over all observed spike times {ti } and corresponding stimulus chunks {xi }. Now that we have an expression for the likelihood, we need to be able to maximize it. Our main result now states, basically, that we can use simple ascent algorithms to compute the MLE without getting stuck in local maxima. Theorem 1. The likelihood L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) has no non-global extrema in the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), for any data {xi , ti }. The proof [14] is based on the log-concavity of L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) under a certain parametrization of (k, σ, g, Vr , h). The classical approach for establishing the nonexistence of non-global maxima of a given function uses concavity, which corresponds roughly to the function having everywhere non-positive second derivatives. However, the basic idea can be extended with the use of any invertible function: if f has no non-global extrema, neither will g(f ), for any strictly increasing real function g. The logarithm is a natural choice for g in any probabilistic context in which independence plays a role, since sums are easier to work with than products. Moreover, concavity of a function f is strictly stronger than logconcavity, so logconcavity can be a powerful tool even in situations for which concavity is useless (the Gaussian density is logconcave but not concave, for example). Our proof relies on a particular theorem [3] establishing the logconcavity of integrals of logconcave functions, and proceeds by making a correspondence between this type of integral and the integrals that appear in the deﬁnition of the L-NLIF likelihood above. We should also note that the proof extends without difﬁculty to some other noise processes which generate logconcave densities (where white noise has the standard Gaussian density); for example, the proof is nearly identical if Nt is allowed to be colored or nonGaussian noise, with possibly nonzero drift. Computational methods and numerical results Theorem 1 tells us that we can ascend the likelihood surface without fear of getting stuck in local maxima. Now how do we actually compute the likelihood? This is a nontrivial problem: we need to be able to quickly compute (or at least approximate, in a rational way) integrals of multivariate Gaussian densities G over simple but high-dimensional orthants Ci . We discuss two ways to compute these integrals; each has its own advantages. The ﬁrst technique can be termed “density evolution” [10, 13]. The method is based on the following well-known fact from the theory of stochastic differential equations [8]: given the data (xi , ti−1 ), the probability density of the voltage process V (t) up to the next spike ti satisﬁes the following partial differential (Fokker-Planck) equation: ∂P (V, t) σ2 ∂ 2 P ∂[(V − Veq (t))P ] = , +g 2 ∂t 2 ∂V ∂V under the boundary conditions (3) P (V, ti−1 ) = δ(V − Vr ), P (Vth , t) = 0; where Veq (t) is the instantaneous equilibrium potential:   i−1 1 Veq (t) = h(t − tj ) . k · x(t) + g j=0 Moreover, the conditional ﬁring rate f (t) satisﬁes t ti−1 f (s)ds = 1 − P (V, t)dV. Thus standard techniques for solving the drift-diffusion evolution equation (3) lead to a fast method for computing f (t) (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Finally, the likelihood Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) is simply f (ti ). While elegant and efﬁcient, this density evolution technique turns out to be slightly more powerful than what we need for the MLE: recall that we do not need to compute the conditional rate function f at all times t, but rather just at the set of spike times {ti }, and thus we can turn to more specialized techniques for faster performance. We employ a rapid technique for computing the likelihood using an algorithm due to Genz [6], designed to compute exactly the kinds of multidimensional Gaussian probability integrals considered here. This algorithm works well when the orthants Ci are deﬁned by fewer than ≈ 10 linear constraints on V (t). The number of actual constraints on V (t) during an interspike interval (ti+1 − ti ) grows linearly in the length of the interval: thus, to use this algorithm in typical data situations, we adopt a strategy proposed in our work on the deterministic form of the model [15], in which we discard all but a small subset of the constraints. The key point is that, due to strong correlations in the noise and the fact that the constraints only ﬁgure signiﬁcantly when the V (t) is driven close to threshold, a small number of constraints often sufﬁce to approximate the true likelihood to a high degree of precision. h mitse h eurt K mitse ATS K eurt 0 0 06 )ekips retfa cesm( t 03 0 0 )ekips erofeb cesm( t 001- 002- Figure 4: Demonstration of the estimator’s performance on simulated data. Dashed lines show the true kernel k and aftercurrent h; k is a 12-sample function chosen to resemble the biphasic temporal impulse response of a macaque retinal ganglion cell, while h is function speciﬁed in a ﬁve-dimensional vector space, whose shape induces a slight degree of burstiness in the model’s spike responses. The L-NLIF model was stimulated with parameters g = 0.05 (corresponding to a membrane time constant of 20 time-samples), σ noise = 0.5, and Vr = 0. The stimulus was 30,000 time samples of white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5. With only 600 spikes of output, the estimator is able to retrieve an estimate of k (gray curve) which closely matches the true kernel. Note that the spike-triggered average (black curve), which is an unbiased estimator for the kernel of an LNP neuron [5], differs signiﬁcantly from this true kernel (see also [15]). The accuracy of this approach improves with the number of constraints considered, but performance is fastest with fewer constraints. Therefore, because ascending the likelihood function requires evaluating the likelihood at many different points, we can make this ascent process much quicker by applying a version of the coarse-to-ﬁne idea. Let L k denote the approximation to the likelihood given by allowing only k constraints in the above algorithm. Then we know, by a proof identical to that of Theorem 1, that Lk has no local maxima; in addition, by the above logic, Lk → L as k grows. It takes little additional effort to prove that argmax Lk → argmax L; thus, we can efﬁciently ascend the true likelihood surface by ascending the “coarse” approximants Lk , then gradually “reﬁning” our approximation by letting k increase. An application of this algorithm to simulated data is shown in Fig. 4. Further applications to both simulated and real data will be presented elsewhere. Discussion We have shown here that the L-NLIF model, which couples a linear ﬁltering stage to a biophysically plausible and ﬂexible model of neuronal spiking, can be efﬁciently estimated from extracellular physiological data using maximum likelihood. Moreover, this model lends itself directly to analysis via tools from the modern theory of point processes. For example, once we have obtained our estimate of the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), how do we verify that the resulting model provides an adequate description of the data? This important “model validation” question has been the focus of some recent elegant research, under the rubric of “time rescaling” techniques [4]. While we lack the room here to review these methods in detail, we can note that they depend essentially on knowledge of the conditional ﬁring rate function f (t). Recall that we showed how to efﬁciently compute this function in the last section and examined some of its qualitative properties in the L-NLIF context in Figs. 2 and 3. We are currently in the process of applying the model to physiological data recorded both in vivo and in vitro, in order to assess whether it accurately accounts for the stimulus preferences and spiking statistics of real neurons. One long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the different roles of stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent activity on the spiking patterns of both single cells and multineuronal ensembles.

<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Ausra Saudargiene, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Spike timing plasticity (STDP) is a special form of synaptic plasticity where the relative timing of post- and presynaptic activity determines the change of the synaptic weight. On the postsynaptic side, active backpropagating spikes in dendrites seem to play a crucial role in the induction of spike timing dependent plasticity. We argue that postsynaptically the temporal change of the membrane potential determines the weight change. Coming from the presynaptic side induction of STDP is closely related to the activation of NMDA channels. Therefore, we will calculate analytically the change of the synaptic weight by correlating the derivative of the membrane potential with the activity of the NMDA channel. Thus, for this calculation we utilise biophysical variables of the physiological cell. The ﬁnal result shows a weight change curve which conforms with measurements from biology. The positive part of the weight change curve is determined by the NMDA activation. The negative part of the weight change curve is determined by the membrane potential change. Therefore, the weight change curve should change its shape depending on the distance from the soma of the postsynaptic cell. We ﬁnd temporally asymmetric weight change close to the soma and temporally symmetric weight change in the distal dendrite. 1</p><p>4 0.57514399 <a title="125-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Mechanism_of_Neural_Interference_by_Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation%3A_Network_or_Single_Neuron%3F.html">127 nips-2003-Mechanism of Neural Interference by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Network or Single Neuron?</a></p>

However, the neural mechanisms underlying TMSinduced interference are still unknown; a theoretical basis for TMS has not been developed. This paper provides computational evidence that inhibitory interactions in a neural population, not an isolated single neuron, play a critical role in yielding the neural interference induced by TMS.</p><p>5 0.57356387 <a title="125-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Synchrony_Detection_by_Analogue_VLSI_Neurons_with_Bimodal_STDP_Synapses.html">183 nips-2003-Synchrony Detection by Analogue VLSI Neurons with Bimodal STDP Synapses</a></p>

Here, we describe a neuromorphic implementation of a disparity selective complex cell using the binocular energy model, which has been proposed to model the response of disparity selective cells in the visual cortex. Our system consists of two silicon chips containing spiking neurons with monocular Gabor-type spatial receptive fields (RF) and circuits that combine the spike outputs to compute a disparity selective complex cell response. The disparity selectivity of the cell can be adjusted by both position and phase shifts between the monocular RF profiles, which are both used in biology. Our neuromorphic system performs better with phase encoding, because the relative responses of neurons tuned to different disparities by phase shifts are better matched than the responses of neurons tuned by position shifts.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.75521487 <a title="125-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Maximum_Likelihood_Estimation_of_a_Stochastic_Integrate-and-Fire_Neural_Model.html">125 nips-2003-Maximum Likelihood Estimation of a Stochastic Integrate-and-Fire Neural Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam Paninski, Eero P. Simoncelli, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has examined the estimation of models of stimulus-driven neural activity in which some linear ﬁltering process is followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spiking stage. We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-ﬁre mechanism with a spike-dependent aftercurrent. This model is a biophysically plausible alternative to models with Poisson (memory-less) spiking, and has been shown to effectively reproduce various spiking statistics of neurons in vivo. However, the problem of estimating the model from extracellular spike train data has not been examined in depth. We formulate the problem in terms of maximum likelihood estimation, and show that the computational problem of maximizing the likelihood is tractable. Our main contribution is an algorithm and a proof that this algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum with reasonable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with numerical simulations. A central issue in computational neuroscience is the characterization of the functional relationship between sensory stimuli and neural spike trains. A common model for this relationship consists of linear ﬁltering of the stimulus, followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spike generation process. The linear ﬁlter is typically interpreted as the neuron’s “receptive ﬁeld,” while the spiking mechanism accounts for simple nonlinearities like rectiﬁcation and response saturation. Given a set of stimuli and (extracellularly) recorded spike times, the characterization problem consists of estimating both the linear ﬁlter and the parameters governing the spiking mechanism. One widely used model of this type is the Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model, in which spikes are generated according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with rate determined by an instantaneous (“memoryless”) nonlinear function of the ﬁltered input. This model has a number of desirable features, including conceptual simplicity and computational tractability. Additionally, reverse correlation analysis provides a simple unbiased estimator for the linear ﬁlter [5], and the properties of estimators (for both the linear ﬁlter and static nonlinearity) have been thoroughly analyzed, even for the case of highly non-symmetric or “naturalistic” stimuli [12]. One important drawback of the LNP model, * JWP and LP contributed equally to this work. We thank E.J. Chichilnisky for helpful discussions.

In particular, the probability of observing a spike is not a functional of the stimulus only; it is also strongly affected by the recent history of spiking. The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (LIF) model provides a biophysically more realistic spike mechanism with a simple form of spike-history dependence. This model is simple, wellunderstood, and has dynamics that are entirely linear except for a nonlinear “reset” of the membrane potential following a spike. Although this model’s overriding linearity is often emphasized (due to the approximately linear relationship between input current and ﬁring rate, and lack of active conductances), the nonlinear reset has signiﬁcant functional importance for the model’s response properties. In previous work, we have shown that standard reverse correlation analysis fails when applied to a neuron with deterministic (noise-free) LIF spike generation; we developed a new estimator for this model, and demonstrated that a change in leakiness of such a mechanism might underlie nonlinear effects of contrast adaptation in macaque retinal ganglion cells [15]. We and others have explored other “adaptive” properties of the LIF model [17, 13, 19]. In this paper, we consider a model consisting of a linear ﬁlter followed by noisy LIF spike generation with a spike-dependent after-current; this is essentially the standard LIF model driven by a noisy, ﬁltered version of the stimulus, with an additional current waveform injected following each spike. We will refer to this as the the “L-NLIF” model. The probabilistic nature of this model provides several important advantages over the deterministic version we have considered previously. First, an explicit noise model allows us to couch the problem in the terms of classical estimation theory. This, in turn, provides a natural “cost function” (likelihood) for model assessment and leads to more efﬁcient estimation of the model parameters. Second, noise allows us to explicitly model neural ﬁring statistics, and could provide a rigorous basis for a metric distance between spike trains, useful in other contexts [18]. Finally, noise inﬂuences the behavior of the model itself, giving rise to phenomena not observed in the purely deterministic model [11]. Our main contribution here is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the L-NLIF model is computationally tractable. Speciﬁcally, we describe an algorithm for computing the likelihood function, and prove that this likelihood function contains no non-global maxima, implying that the MLE can be computed efﬁciently using standard ascent techniques. The desirable statistical properties of this estimator (e.g. consistency, efﬁciency) are all inherited “for free” from classical estimation theory. Thus, we have a compact and powerful model for the neural code, and a well-motivated, efﬁcient way to estimate the parameters of this model from extracellular data. The Model We consider a model for which the (dimensionless) subthreshold voltage variable V evolves according to i−1 dV = − gV (t) + k · x(t) + j=0 h(t − tj ) dt + σNt , (1) and resets to Vr whenever V = 1. Here, g denotes the leak conductance, k · x(t) the projection of the input signal x(t) onto the linear kernel k, h is an “afterpotential,” a current waveform of ﬁxed amplitude and shape whose value depends only on the time since the last spike ti−1 , and Nt is an unobserved (hidden) noise process with scale parameter σ. Without loss of generality, the “leak” and “threshold” potential are set at 0 and 1, respectively, so the cell spikes whenever V = 1, and V decays back to 0 with time constant 1/g in the absence of input. Note that the nonlinear behavior of the model is completely determined by only a few parameters, namely {g, σ, Vr }, and h (where the function h is allowed to take values in some low-dimensional vector space). The dynamical properties of this type of “spike response model” have been extensively studied [7]; for example, it is known that this class of models can effectively capture much of the behavior of apparently more biophysically realistic models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley). Figures 1 and 2 show several simple comparisons of the L-NLIF and LNP models. In 1, note the ﬁne structure of spike timing in the responses of the L-NLIF model, which is qualitatively similar to in vivo experimental observations [2, 16, 9]). The LNP model fails to capture this ﬁne temporal reproducibility. At the same time, the L-NLIF model is much more ﬂexible and representationally powerful, as demonstrated in Fig. 2: by varying V r or h, for example, we can match a wide variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. adaptation, bursting, bistability) known to exist in biological neurons. The Estimation Problem Our problem now is to estimate the model parameters {k, σ, g, Vr , h} from a sufﬁciently rich, dynamic input sequence x(t) together with spike times {ti }. A natural choice is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is easily proven to be consistent and statistically efﬁcient here. To compute the MLE, we need to compute the likelihood and develop an algorithm for maximizing it. The tractability of the likelihood function for this model arises directly from the linearity of the subthreshold dynamics of voltage V (t) during an interspike interval. In the noiseless case [15], the voltage trace during an interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ] is given by the solution to equation (1) with σ = 0:   V0 (t) = Vr e−gt + t ti−1 i−1 k · x(s) + j=0 h(s − tj ) e−g(t−s) ds, (2) A stimulus h current responses 0 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 2. 0 t stimulus x 0 B c responses c=1 h current 0 c=2 2. 0 c=5 1 )ces( t t 0 0 stimulus C 0 h current responses Figure 2: Illustration of diverse behaviors of L-NLIF model.

Voltage traces of each cell’s response (right, with spikes superimposed) exhibit rate facilitation for depolarizing h (middle), and rate adaptation for hyperpolarizing h (bottom). B: Bursting. The response of a model cell with a biphasic h current (left) is shown as a function of the three different levels of DC current. For small current levels (top), the cell responds rhythmically. For larger currents (middle and bottom), the cell responds with regular bursts of spikes. C: Bistability. The stimulus (top) is a positive followed by a negative current pulse. Although a cell with no h current (middle) responds transiently to the positive pulse, a cell with biphasic h (bottom) exhibits a bistable response: the positive pulse puts it into a stable ﬁring regime which persists until the arrival of a negative pulse. 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 5 0. t 0 which is simply a linear convolution of the input current with a negative exponential. It is easy to see that adding Gaussian noise to the voltage during each time step induces a Gaussian density over V (t), since linear dynamics preserve Gaussianity [8]. This density is uniquely characterized by its ﬁrst two moments; the mean is given by (2), and its covariance T is σ 2 Eg Eg , where Eg is the convolution operator corresponding to e−gt . Note that this density is highly correlated for nearby points in time, since noise is integrated by the linear dynamics. Intuitively, smaller leak conductance g leads to stronger correlation in V (t) at nearby time points. We denote this Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), where index i indicates the ith spike and the corresponding stimulus chunk xi (i.e. the stimuli that inﬂuence V (t) during the ith interspike interval). Now, on any interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ], the only information we have is that V (t) is less than threshold for all times before ti , and exceeds threshold during the time bin containing ti . This translates to a set of linear constraints on V (t), expressed in terms of the set Ci = ti−1 ≤t < 1 ∩ V (ti ) ≥ 1 . Therefore, the likelihood that the neuron ﬁrst spikes at time ti , given a spike at time ti−1 , is the probability of the event V (t) ∈ Ci , which is given by Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), Ci the integral of the Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h) over the set Ci . sulumits Figure 3: Behavior of the L-NLIF model during a single interspike interval, for a single (repeated) input current (top). Top middle: Ten simulated voltage traces V (t), evaluated up to the ﬁrst threshold crossing, conditional on a spike at time zero (Vr = 0). Note the strong correlation between neighboring time points, and the sparsening of the plot as traces are eliminated by spiking. Bottom Middle: Time evolution of P (V ).

This “renewal” property, in turn, implies that the density over V (t) for an entire experiment factorizes into a product of conditionally independent terms, where each of these terms is one of the Gaussian integrals derived above for a single interspike interval. The likelihood for the entire spike train is therefore the product of these terms over all observed spikes. Putting all the pieces together, then, the full likelihood is L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), i Ci where the product, again, is over all observed spike times {ti } and corresponding stimulus chunks {xi }. Now that we have an expression for the likelihood, we need to be able to maximize it. Our main result now states, basically, that we can use simple ascent algorithms to compute the MLE without getting stuck in local maxima. Theorem 1. The likelihood L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) has no non-global extrema in the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), for any data {xi , ti }. The proof [14] is based on the log-concavity of L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) under a certain parametrization of (k, σ, g, Vr , h). The classical approach for establishing the nonexistence of non-global maxima of a given function uses concavity, which corresponds roughly to the function having everywhere non-positive second derivatives. However, the basic idea can be extended with the use of any invertible function: if f has no non-global extrema, neither will g(f ), for any strictly increasing real function g. The logarithm is a natural choice for g in any probabilistic context in which independence plays a role, since sums are easier to work with than products. Moreover, concavity of a function f is strictly stronger than logconcavity, so logconcavity can be a powerful tool even in situations for which concavity is useless (the Gaussian density is logconcave but not concave, for example). Our proof relies on a particular theorem [3] establishing the logconcavity of integrals of logconcave functions, and proceeds by making a correspondence between this type of integral and the integrals that appear in the deﬁnition of the L-NLIF likelihood above. We should also note that the proof extends without difﬁculty to some other noise processes which generate logconcave densities (where white noise has the standard Gaussian density); for example, the proof is nearly identical if Nt is allowed to be colored or nonGaussian noise, with possibly nonzero drift. Computational methods and numerical results Theorem 1 tells us that we can ascend the likelihood surface without fear of getting stuck in local maxima. Now how do we actually compute the likelihood? This is a nontrivial problem: we need to be able to quickly compute (or at least approximate, in a rational way) integrals of multivariate Gaussian densities G over simple but high-dimensional orthants Ci . We discuss two ways to compute these integrals; each has its own advantages. The ﬁrst technique can be termed “density evolution” [10, 13]. The method is based on the following well-known fact from the theory of stochastic differential equations [8]: given the data (xi , ti−1 ), the probability density of the voltage process V (t) up to the next spike ti satisﬁes the following partial differential (Fokker-Planck) equation: ∂P (V, t) σ2 ∂ 2 P ∂[(V − Veq (t))P ] = , +g 2 ∂t 2 ∂V ∂V under the boundary conditions (3) P (V, ti−1 ) = δ(V − Vr ), P (Vth , t) = 0; where Veq (t) is the instantaneous equilibrium potential:   i−1 1 Veq (t) = h(t − tj ) . k · x(t) + g j=0 Moreover, the conditional ﬁring rate f (t) satisﬁes t ti−1 f (s)ds = 1 − P (V, t)dV. Thus standard techniques for solving the drift-diffusion evolution equation (3) lead to a fast method for computing f (t) (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Finally, the likelihood Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) is simply f (ti ). While elegant and efﬁcient, this density evolution technique turns out to be slightly more powerful than what we need for the MLE: recall that we do not need to compute the conditional rate function f at all times t, but rather just at the set of spike times {ti }, and thus we can turn to more specialized techniques for faster performance. We employ a rapid technique for computing the likelihood using an algorithm due to Genz [6], designed to compute exactly the kinds of multidimensional Gaussian probability integrals considered here. This algorithm works well when the orthants Ci are deﬁned by fewer than ≈ 10 linear constraints on V (t). The number of actual constraints on V (t) during an interspike interval (ti+1 − ti ) grows linearly in the length of the interval: thus, to use this algorithm in typical data situations, we adopt a strategy proposed in our work on the deterministic form of the model [15], in which we discard all but a small subset of the constraints. The key point is that, due to strong correlations in the noise and the fact that the constraints only ﬁgure signiﬁcantly when the V (t) is driven close to threshold, a small number of constraints often sufﬁce to approximate the true likelihood to a high degree of precision. h mitse h eurt K mitse ATS K eurt 0 0 06 )ekips retfa cesm( t 03 0 0 )ekips erofeb cesm( t 001- 002- Figure 4: Demonstration of the estimator’s performance on simulated data. Dashed lines show the true kernel k and aftercurrent h; k is a 12-sample function chosen to resemble the biphasic temporal impulse response of a macaque retinal ganglion cell, while h is function speciﬁed in a ﬁve-dimensional vector space, whose shape induces a slight degree of burstiness in the model’s spike responses. The L-NLIF model was stimulated with parameters g = 0.05 (corresponding to a membrane time constant of 20 time-samples), σ noise = 0.5, and Vr = 0. The stimulus was 30,000 time samples of white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5. With only 600 spikes of output, the estimator is able to retrieve an estimate of k (gray curve) which closely matches the true kernel. Note that the spike-triggered average (black curve), which is an unbiased estimator for the kernel of an LNP neuron [5], differs signiﬁcantly from this true kernel (see also [15]). The accuracy of this approach improves with the number of constraints considered, but performance is fastest with fewer constraints. Therefore, because ascending the likelihood function requires evaluating the likelihood at many different points, we can make this ascent process much quicker by applying a version of the coarse-to-ﬁne idea. Let L k denote the approximation to the likelihood given by allowing only k constraints in the above algorithm. Then we know, by a proof identical to that of Theorem 1, that Lk has no local maxima; in addition, by the above logic, Lk → L as k grows. It takes little additional effort to prove that argmax Lk → argmax L; thus, we can efﬁciently ascend the true likelihood surface by ascending the “coarse” approximants Lk , then gradually “reﬁning” our approximation by letting k increase. An application of this algorithm to simulated data is shown in Fig. 4. Further applications to both simulated and real data will be presented elsewhere. Discussion We have shown here that the L-NLIF model, which couples a linear ﬁltering stage to a biophysically plausible and ﬂexible model of neuronal spiking, can be efﬁciently estimated from extracellular physiological data using maximum likelihood. Moreover, this model lends itself directly to analysis via tools from the modern theory of point processes. For example, once we have obtained our estimate of the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), how do we verify that the resulting model provides an adequate description of the data? This important “model validation” question has been the focus of some recent elegant research, under the rubric of “time rescaling” techniques [4]. While we lack the room here to review these methods in detail, we can note that they depend essentially on knowledge of the conditional ﬁring rate function f (t). Recall that we showed how to efﬁciently compute this function in the last section and examined some of its qualitative properties in the L-NLIF context in Figs. 2 and 3. We are currently in the process of applying the model to physiological data recorded both in vivo and in vitro, in order to assess whether it accurately accounts for the stimulus preferences and spiking statistics of real neurons. One long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the different roles of stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent activity on the spiking patterns of both single cells and multineuronal ensembles.

<p>Author: Ryan C. Kelly, Tai Sing Lee</p><p>Abstract: Decoding is a strategy that allows us to assess the amount of information neurons can provide about certain aspects of the visual scene. In this study, we develop a method based on Bayesian sequential updating and the particle ﬁltering algorithm to decode the activity of V1 neurons in awake monkeys. A distinction in our method is the use of Volterra kernels to ﬁlter the particles, which live in a high dimensional space. This parametric Bayesian decoding scheme is compared to the optimal linear decoder and is shown to work consistently better than the linear optimal decoder. Interestingly, our results suggest that for decoding in real time, spike trains of as few as 10 independent but similar neurons would be sufﬁcient for decoding a critical scene variable in a particular class of visual stimuli. The reconstructed variable can predict the neural activity about as well as the actual signal with respect to the Volterra kernels. 1</p><p>4 0.62780786 <a title="125-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Generalised_Propagation_for_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_with_Partial_or_Missing_Data.html">80 nips-2003-Generalised Propagation for Fast Fourier Transforms with Partial or Missing Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms and other related Fourier methods have been practically implementable due to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this paper it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coeﬃcients. Furthermore eﬃcient generalised belief propagation methods between clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coeﬃcients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal. 1</p><p>5 0.62509012 <a title="125-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Learning_Curves_for_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_in_Linear_Feedforward_Networks.html">104 nips-2003-Learning Curves for Stochastic Gradient Descent in Linear Feedforward Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Justin Werfel, Xiaohui Xie, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: Gradient-following learning methods can encounter problems of implementation in many applications, and stochastic variants are frequently used to overcome these difﬁculties. We derive quantitative learning curves for three online training methods used with a linear perceptron: direct gradient descent, node perturbation, and weight perturbation. The maximum learning rate for the stochastic methods scales inversely with the ﬁrst power of the dimensionality of the noise injected into the system; with sufﬁciently small learning rate, all three methods give identical learning curves. These results suggest guidelines for when these stochastic methods will be limited in their utility, and considerations for architectures in which they will be effective. 1</p><p>6 0.62341982 <a title="125-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Model_Uncertainty_in_Classical_Conditioning.html">130 nips-2003-Model Uncertainty in Classical Conditioning</a></p>

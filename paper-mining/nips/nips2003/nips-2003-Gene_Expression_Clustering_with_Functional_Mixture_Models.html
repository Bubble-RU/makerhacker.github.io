<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical signiﬁcance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity. 1 Introduction and related work Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density estimation, and many other important tasks. However, most clustering algorithms require the user to specify the number of clusters (called k), and it is not always clear what is the best value for k. Figure 1 shows examples where k has been improperly chosen. Choosing k is often an ad hoc decision based on prior knowledge, assumptions, and practical experience. Choosing k is made more difﬁcult when the data has many dimensions, even when clusters are well-separated. Center-based clustering algorithms (in particular k-means and Gaussian expectationmaximization) usually assume that each cluster adheres to a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian. With these methods, only one center should be used to model each subset of data that follows a unimodal distribution. If multiple centers are used to describe data drawn from one mode, the centers are a needlessly complex description of the data, and in fact the multiple centers capture the truth about the subset less well than one center. In this paper we present a simple algorithm called G-means that discovers an appropriate k using a statistical test for deciding whether to split a k-means center into two centers. We describe examples and present experimental results that show that the new algorithm 0.9 4 0.8 3 0.7 2 0.6 1 0.5 0 0.4 −1 0.3 −2 −3 0.2 0.1 −0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: Two clusterings where k was improperly chosen. Dark crosses are k-means centers. On the left, there are too few centers; ﬁve should be used. On the right, too many centers are used; one center is sufﬁcient for representing the data. In general, one center should be used to represent one Gaussian cluster. is successful. This technique is useful and applicable for many clustering algorithms other than k-means, but here we consider only the k-means algorithm for simplicity. Several algorithms have been proposed previously to determine k automatically. Like our method, most previous methods are wrappers around k-means or some other clustering algorithm for ﬁxed k. Wrapper methods use splitting and/or merging rules for centers to increase or decrease k as the algorithm proceeds. Pelleg and Moore [14] proposed a regularization framework for learning k, which they call X-means. The algorithm searches over many values of k and scores each clustering model using the so-called Bayesian Information Criterion [10]: BIC(C|X) = L(X|C) − p log n 2 where L(X|C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C, p = k(d + 1) is the number of parameters in the model C with dimensionality d and k cluster centers, and n is the number of points in the dataset. X-means chooses the model with the best BIC score on the data. Aside from the BIC, other scoring functions are also available. Bischof et al. [1] use a minimum description length (MDL) framework, where the description length is a measure of how well the data are ﬁt by the model. Their algorithm starts with a large value for k and removes centers (reduces k) whenever that choice reduces the description length. Between steps of reducing k, they use the k-means algorithm to optimize the model ﬁt to the data. With hierarchical clustering algorithms, other methods may be employed to determine the best number of clusters. One is to build a merging tree (“dendrogram”) of the data based on a cluster distance metric, and search for areas of the tree that are stable with respect to inter- and intra-cluster distances [9, Section 5.1]. This method of estimating k is best applied with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and human intuition. 2 The Gaussian-means (G-means) algorithm The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to reﬁne the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each center. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center. However, if the same data do not appear Algorithm 1 G-means(X, α) 1: Let C be the initial set of centers (usually C ← {¯}). x 2: C ← kmeans(C, X). 3: Let {xi |class(xi ) = j} be the set of datapoints assigned to center cj . 4: Use a statistical test to detect if each {xi |class(xi ) = j} follow a Gaussian distribution (at conﬁdence level α). 5: If the data look Gaussian, keep cj . Otherwise replace cj with two centers. 6: Repeat from step 2 until no more centers are added. to be Gaussian, then we want to use multiple centers to model the data properly. The algorithm will run k-means multiple times (up to k times when ﬁnding k centers), so the time complexity is at most O(k) times that of k-means. The k-means algorithm implicitly assumes that the datapoints in each cluster are spherically distributed around the center. Less restrictively, the Gaussian expectation-maximization algorithm assumes that the datapoints in each cluster have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that may or may not be ﬁxed, or shared. The Gaussian distribution test that we present below are valid for either covariance matrix assumption. The test also accounts for the number of datapoints n tested by incorporating n in the calculation of the critical value of the test (see Equation 2). This prevents the G-means algorithm from making bad decisions about clusters with few datapoints. 2.1 Testing clusters for Gaussian ﬁt To specify the G-means algorithm fully we need a test to detect whether the data assigned to a center are sampled from a Gaussian. The alternative hypotheses are • H0 : The data around the center are sampled from a Gaussian. • H1 : The data around the center are not sampled from a Gaussian. If we accept the null hypothesis H0 , then we believe that the one center is sufﬁcient to model its data, and we should not split the cluster into two sub-clusters. If we reject H0 and accept H1 , then we want to split the cluster. The test we use is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic. This one-dimensional test has been shown empirically to be the most powerful normality test that is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). Given a list of values xi that have been converted to mean 0 and variance 1, let x(i) be the ith ordered value. Let zi = F (x(i) ), where F is the N (0, 1) cumulative distribution function. Then the statistic is A2 (Z) = − 1 n n (2i − 1) [log(zi ) + log(1 − zn+1−i )] − n (1) i=1 Stephens [17] showed that for the case where µ and σ are estimated from the data (as in clustering), we must correct the statistic according to A2 (Z) ∗ = A2 (Z)(1 + 4/n − 25/(n2 )) (2) Given a subset of data X in d dimensions that belongs to center c, the hypothesis test proceeds as follows: 1. Choose a signiﬁcance level α for the test. 2. Initialize two centers, called “children” of c. See the text for good ways to do this. 3. Run k-means on these two centers in X. This can be run to completion, or to some early stopping point if desired. Let c1 , c2 be the child centers chosen by k-means. 4. Let v = c1 − c2 be a d-dimensional vector that connects the two centers. This is the direction that k-means believes to be important for clustering. Then project X onto v: xi = xi , v /||v||2 . X is a 1-dimensional representation of the data projected onto v. Transform X so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. 5. Let zi = F (x(i) ). If A2 (Z) is in the range of non-critical values at conﬁdence ∗ level α, then accept H0 , keep the original center, and discard {c1 , c2 }. Otherwise, reject H0 and keep {c1 , c2 } in place of the original center. A primary contribution of this work is simplifying the test for Gaussian ﬁt by projecting the data to one dimension where the test is simple to apply. The authors of [5] also use this approach for online dimensionality reduction during clustering. The one-dimensional representation of the data allows us to consider only the data along the direction that kmeans has found to be important for separating the data. This is related to the problem of projection pursuit [7], where here k-means searches for a direction in which the data appears non-Gaussian. We must choose the signiﬁcance level of the test, α, which is the desired probability of making a Type I error (i.e. incorrectly rejecting H0 ). It is appropriate to use a Bonferroni adjustment to reduce the chance of making Type I errors over multiple tests. For example, if we want a 0.01 chance of making a Type I error in 100 tests, we should apply a Bonferroni adjustment to make each test use α = 0.01/100 = 0.0001. To ﬁnd k ﬁnal centers the G-means algorithm makes k statistical tests, so the Bonferroni correction does not need to be extreme. In our tests, we always use α = 0.0001. We consider two ways to initialize the two child centers. Both approaches initialize with c ± m, where c is a center and m is chosen. The ﬁrst method chooses m as a random d-dimensional vector such that ||m|| is small compared to the distortion of the data. A second method ﬁnds the main principal component s of the data (having eigenvalue λ), and chooses m = s 2λ/π. This deterministic method places the two centers in their expected locations under H0 . The principal component calculations require O(nd2 + d3 ) time and O(d2 ) space, but since we only want the main principal component, we can use fast methods like the power method, which takes time that is at most linear in the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues [4]. In this paper we use principal-component-based splitting. 2.2 An example Figure 2 shows a run of the G-means algorithm on a synthetic dataset with two true clusters and 1000 points, using α = 0.0001. The critical value for the Anderson-Darling test is 1.8692 for this conﬁdence level. Starting with one center, after one iteration of G-means, we have 2 centers and the A2 statistic is 38.103. This is much larger than the critical value, ∗ so we reject H0 and accept this split. On the next iteration, we split each new center and repeat the statistical test. The A2 values for the two splits are 0.386 and 0.496, both of ∗ which are well below the critical value. Therefore we accept H0 for both tests, and discard these splits. Thus G-means gives a ﬁnal answer of k = 2. 2.3 Statistical power Figure 3 shows the power of the Anderson-Darling test, as compared to the BIC. Lower is better for both plots. We run 1000 tests for each data point plotted for both plots.

Starting with one center (left plot), G-means splits into two centers (middle). The test for normality is signiﬁcant, so G-means rejects H0 and keeps the split. After splitting each center again (right), the test values are not signiﬁcant, so G-means accepts H0 for both tests and does not accept these splits. The middle plot is the G-means answer. See the text for further details. 1 1 G-means X-means 0.8 P(Type II error) P(Type I error) 0.8 G-means X-means 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 Figure 3: A comparison of the power of the Anderson-Darling test versus the BIC. For the AD test we ﬁx the signiﬁcance level (α = 0.0001), while the BIC’s signiﬁcance level depends on n. The left plot shows the probability of incorrectly splitting (Type I error) one true 2-d cluster that is 5% elliptical. The right plot shows the probability of incorrectly not splitting two true clusters separated by 5σ (Type II error). Both plots are functions of n. Both plots show that the BIC overﬁts (splits clusters) when n is small. plot, for each test we generate n datapoints from a single true Gaussian distribution, and then plot the frequency with which BIC and G-means will choose k = 2 rather than k = 1 (i.e. commit a Type I error). BIC tends to overﬁt by choosing too many centers when the data is not strictly spherical, while G-means does not. This is consistent with the tests of real-world data in the next section. While G-means commits more Type II errors when n is small, this prevents it from overﬁtting the data. The BIC can be considered a likelihood ratio test, but with a signiﬁcance level that cannot be ﬁxed. The signiﬁcance level instead varies depending on n and ∆k (the change in the number of model parameters between two models). As n or ∆k decrease, the signiﬁcance level increases (the BIC becomes weaker as a statistical test) [10]. Figure 3 shows this effect for varying n. In [11] the authors show that penalty-based methods require problemspeciﬁc tuning and don’t generalize as well as other methods, such as cross validation. 3 Experiments Table 1 shows the results from running G-means and X-means on many large synthetic. On synthetic datasets with spherically distributed clusters, G-means and X-means do equally Table 1: Results for many synthetic datasets. We report distortion relative to the optimum distortion for the correct clustering (closer to one is better), and time is reported relative to k-means run with the correct k. For BIC, larger values are better, but it is clear that ﬁnding the correct clustering does not always coincide with ﬁnding a larger BIC. Items with a star are where X-means always chose the largest number of centers we allowed. dataset synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 d 2 k found 9.1± 9.9 18.1± 3.2 20.1± 0.6 70.5±11.6 80.0± 0.2 171.7±23.7 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.1 *80.0± 0.0 80.2± 0.5 229.2±36.8 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.0 *80.0± 0.0 80.0± 0.0 171.5±10.9 method G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means 2 2 8 8 8 32 32 32 BIC(×104 ) -0.19±2.70 0.70±0.93 0.21±0.18 14.83±3.50 1.84±0.12 40.16±6.59 -0.74±0.16 -2.28±0.20 -0.18±0.17 14.36±0.21 1.45±0.20 52.28±9.26 -3.36±0.21 -27.92±0.22 -2.73±0.22 -11.13±0.23 -1.10±0.16 11.78±2.74 distortion(× optimal) 0.89± 0.23 0.37± 0.12 0.99± 0.01 9.45±28.02 1.00± 0.01 48.49±70.04 1.00± 0.00 0.47± 0.03 0.99± 0.00 0.47± 0.01 0.99± 0.00 0.57± 0.06 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.00 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.01 1.00± 0.00 0.84± 0.01 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 time(× k-means) 13.2 2.8 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.8 4.6 11.0 2.6 4.0 2.9 6.5 4.4 29.9 2.3 21.2 2.8 53.3 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Figure 4: 2-d synthetic dataset with 5 true clusters. On the left, G-means correctly chooses 5 centers and deals well with non-spherical data. On the right, the BIC causes X-means to overﬁt the data, choosing 20 unevenly distributed clusters. well at ﬁnding the correct k and maximizing the BIC statistic, so we don’t show these results here. Most real-world data is not spherical, however. The synthetic datasets used here each have 5000 datapoints in d = 2/8/32 dimensions. The true ks are 5, 20, and 80. For each synthetic dataset type, we generate 30 datasets with the true center means chosen uniformly randomly from the unit hypercube, and choosing σ so that no two clusters are closer than 3σ apart. Each cluster is also given a transformation to make it non-spherical, by multiplying the data by a randomly chosen scaling and rotation matrix. We run G-means starting with one center. We allow X-means to search between 2 and 4k centers (where here k is the true number of clusters). The G-means algorithm clearly does better at ﬁnding the correct k on non-spherical data. Its results are closer to the true distortions and the correct ks. The BIC statistic that X-means uses has been formulated to maximize the likelihood for spherically-distributed data. Thus it overestimates the number of true clusters in non-spherical data. This is especially evident when the number of points per cluster is small, as in datasets with 80 true clusters. 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Digit 0 1 Digit 0 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Cluster 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cluster Figure 5: NIST and Pendigits datasets: correspondence between each digit (row) and each cluster (column) found by G-means. G-means did not have the labels, yet it found meaningful clusters corresponding with the labels. Because of this overestimation, X-means often hits our limit of 4k centers. Figure 4 shows an example of overﬁtting on a dataset with 5 true clusters. X-means chooses k = 20 while G-means ﬁnds all 5 true cluster centers. Also of note is that X-means does not distribute centers evenly among clusters; some clusters receive one center, but others receive many. G-means runs faster than X-means for 8 and 32 dimensions, which we expect, since the kd-tree structures which make X-means fast in low dimensions take time exponential in d, making them slow for more than 8 to 12 dimensions. All our code is written in Matlab; X-means is written in C. 3.1 Discovering true clusters in labeled data We tested these algorithms on two real-world datasets for handwritten digit recognition: the NIST dataset [12] and the Pendigits dataset [2]. The goal is to cluster the data without knowledge of the labels and measure how well the clustering captures the true labels. Both datasets have 10 true classes (digits 0-9). NIST has 60000 training examples and 784 dimensions (28×28 pixels). We use 6000 randomly chosen examples and we reduce the dimension to 50 by random projection (following [3]). The Pendigits dataset has 7984 examples and 16 dimensions; we did not change the data in any way. We cluster each dataset with G-means and X-means, and measure performance by comparing the cluster labels Lc with the true labels Lt . We deﬁne the partition quality (PQ) as kt kc kt 2 2 pq = i=1 j=1 p(i, j) i=1 p(i) where kt is the true number of classes, and kc is the number of clusters found by the algorithm. This metric is maximized when Lc induces the same partition of the data as Lt ; in other words, when all points in each cluster have the same true label, and the estimated k is the true k. The p(i, j) term is the frequency-based probability that a datapoint will be labeled i by Lt and j by Lc . This quality is normalized by the sum of true probabilities, squared. This statistic is related to the Rand statistic for comparing partitions [8]. For the NIST dataset, G-means ﬁnds 31 clusters in 30 seconds with a PQ score of 0.177. X-means ﬁnds 715 clusters in 4149 seconds, and 369 of these clusters contain only one point, indicating an overestimation problem with the BIC. X-means receives a PQ score of 0.024. For the Pendigits dataset, G-means ﬁnds 69 clusters in 30 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.196; X-means ﬁnds 235 clusters in 287 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.057. Figure 5 shows Hinton diagrams of the G-means clusterings of both datasets, showing that G-means succeeds at identifying the true clusters concisely, without aid of the labels. The confusions between different digits in the NIST dataset (seen in the off-diagonal elements) are common for other researchers using more sophisticated techniques, see [3]. 4 Discussion and conclusions We have introduced the new G-means algorithm for learning k based on a statistical test for determining whether datapoints are a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary dimension and covariance matrix. The splitting uses dimension reduction and a powerful test for Gaussian ﬁtness. G-means uses this statistical test as a wrapper around k-means to discover the number of clusters automatically. The only parameter supplied to the algorithm is the signiﬁcance level of the statistical test, which can easily be set in a standard way. The G-means algorithm takes linear time and space (plus the cost of the splitting heuristic and test) in the number of datapoints and dimension, since k-means is itself linear in time and space. Empirically, the G-means algorithm works well at ﬁnding the correct number of clusters and the locations of genuine cluster centers, and we have shown it works well in moderately high dimensions. Clustering in high dimensions has been an open problem for many years. Recent research has shown that it may be preferable to use dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering, and then use a low-dimensional clustering algorithm such as k-means, rather than clustering in the high dimension directly. In [3] the author shows that using a simple, inexpensive linear projection preserves many of the properties of data (such as cluster distances), while making it easier to ﬁnd the clusters. Thus there is a need for good-quality, fast clustering algorithms for low-dimensional data. Our work is a step in this direction. Additionally, recent image segmentation algorithms such as normalized cut [16, 13] are based on eigenvector computations on distance matrices. These “spectral” clustering algorithms still use k-means as a post-processing step to ﬁnd the actual segmentation and they require k to be speciﬁed. Thus we expect G-means will be useful in combination with spectral clustering. References [1] Horst Bischof, Aleˇ Leonardis, and Alexander Selb. MDL principle for robust vector quantisation.

<p>Author: Volker Roth, Tilman Lange</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach to combining clustering and feature selection is presented. It implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. On the technical side, we present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of this method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is able to infer both meaningful partitions and meaningful subsets of features. 1</p><p>4 0.17685285 <a title="79-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Clustering_with_the_Connectivity_Kernel.html">46 nips-2003-Clustering with the Connectivity Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Fischer, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Clustering aims at extracting hidden structure in dataset. While the problem of ﬁnding compact clusters has been widely studied in the literature, extracting arbitrarily formed elongated structures is considered a much harder problem. In this paper we present a novel clustering algorithm which tackles the problem by a two step procedure: ﬁrst the data are transformed in such a way that elongated structures become compact ones. In a second step, these new objects are clustered by optimizing a compactness-based criterion. The advantages of the method over related approaches are threefold: (i) robustness properties of compactness-based criteria naturally transfer to the problem of extracting elongated structures, leading to a model which is highly robust against outlier objects; (ii) the transformed distances induce a Mercer kernel which allows us to formulate a polynomial approximation scheme to the generally N Phard clustering problem; (iii) the new method does not contain free kernel parameters in contrast to methods like spectral clustering or mean-shift clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.17420313 <a title="79-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Geometric_Clustering_Using_the_Information_Bottleneck_Method.html">82 nips-2003-Geometric Clustering Using the Information Bottleneck Method</a></p>
<p>Author: Susanne Still, William Bialek, Léon Bottou</p><p>Abstract: We argue that K–means and deterministic annealing algorithms for geometric clustering can be derived from the more general Information Bottleneck approach. If we cluster the identities of data points to preserve information about their location, the set of optimal solutions is massively degenerate. But if we treat the equations that deﬁne the optimal solution as an iterative algorithm, then a set of “smooth” initial conditions selects solutions with the desired geometrical properties. In addition to conceptual uniﬁcation, we argue that this approach can be more efﬁcient and robust than classic algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.16242902 <a title="79-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Identifying_Structure_across_Pre-partitioned_Data.html">87 nips-2003-Identifying Structure across Pre-partitioned Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Darya Chudova, Christopher Hart, Eric Mjolsness, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: We propose a functional mixture model for simultaneous clustering and alignment of sets of curves measured on a discrete time grid. The model is speciﬁcally tailored to gene expression time course data. Each functional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed proﬁles, (b) align the proﬁles in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA in the course of an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy proﬁles by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared to regular Gaussian mixtures. 1</p><p>2 0.63743371 <a title="79-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-ICA-based_Clustering_of_Genes_from_Microarray_Expression_Data.html">86 nips-2003-ICA-based Clustering of Genes from Microarray Expression Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Su-in Lee, Serafim Batzoglou</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised methodology using independent component analysis (ICA) to cluster genes from DNA microarray data. Based on an ICA mixture model of genomic expression patterns, linear and nonlinear ICA finds components that are specific to certain biological processes. Genes that exhibit significant up-regulation or down-regulation within each component are grouped into clusters. We test the statistical significance of enrichment of gene annotations within each cluster. ICA-based clustering outperformed other leading methods in constructing functionally coherent clusters on various datasets. This result supports our model of genomic expression data as composite effect of independent biological processes. Comparison of clustering performance among various ICA algorithms including a kernel-based nonlinear ICA algorithm shows that nonlinear ICA performed the best for small datasets and natural-gradient maximization-likelihood worked well for all the datasets. 1 In trod u ction Microarray technology has enabled genome-wide expression profiling, promising to provide insight into underlying biological mechanism involved in gene regulation. To aid such discoveries, mathematical tools that are versatile enough to capture the underlying biology and simple enough to be applied efficiently on large datasets are needed. Analysis tools based on novel data mining techniques have been proposed [1]-[6]. When applying mathematical models and tools to microarray analysis, clustering genes that have the similar biological properties is an important step for three reasons: reduction of data complexity, prediction of gene function, and evaluation of the analysis approach by measuring the statistical significance of biological coherence of gene clusters. Independent component analysis (ICA) linearly decomposes each of N vectors into M common component vectors (N≥M) so that each component is statistically as independent from the others as possible. One of the main applications of ICA is blind source separation (BSS) that aims to separate source signals from their mixtures. There have been a few attempts to apply ICA to the microarray expression data to extract meaningful signals each corresponding to independent biological process [5]-[6]. In this paper, we provide the first evidence that ICA is a superior mathematical model and clustering tool for microarray analysis, compared to the most widely used methods namely PCA and k-means clustering. We also introduce the application of nonlinear ICA to microarray analysis, and show that it outperforms linear ICA on some datasets. We apply ICA to microarray data to decompose the input data into statistically independent components. Then, genes are clustered in an unsupervised fashion into non-mutually exclusive clusters. Each independent component is assigned a putative biological meaning based on functional annotations of genes that are predominant within the component. We systematically evaluate the clustering performance of several ICA algorithms on four expression datasets and show that ICA-based clustering is superior to other leading methods that have been applied to analyze the same datasets. We also proposed a kernel based nonlinear ICA algorithm for dealing with more realistic mixture model. Among the different linear ICA algorithms including six linear and one nonlinear ICA algorithm, the natural-gradient maximum-likelihood estimation method (NMLE) [7]-[8] performs well in all the datasets. Kernel-based nonlinear ICA method worked better for three small datasets. 2 M a t h e m at i c a l m o de l o f g e n om e - wi d e e x p r e s s i on Several distinct biological processes take place simultaneously inside a cell; each biological process has its own expression program to up-regulate or down-regulate the level of expression of specific sets of genes. We model a genome-wide expression pattern in a given condition (measured by a microarray assay) as a mixture of signals generated by statistically independent biological processes with different activation levels. We design two kinds of models for genomic expression pattern: a linear and nonlinear mixture model. Suppose that a cell is governed by M independent biological processes S = (s1, …, sM)T, each of which is a vector of K gene expression levels, and that we measure the levels of expression of all genes in N conditions, resulting in a microarray expression matrix X = (x1,…,xN)T. The expression level at each different condition j can be expressed as linear combinations of the M biological processes: xj=aj1s1+…+ajMsM. We can express this idea concisely in matrix notation as follows. X = AS ,  x1   a11 L a1M   s1   M = M M  M        x N  a N 1 L a NM   s M       (1) More generally, we can express X = (x1,…,xN)T as a post-nonlinear mixture of the underlying independent processes as follows, where f(.) is a nonlinear mapping from N to N dimensional space. X = f ( AS ),   a11 L a1M   s1    x1    M  = f  M M  M         a  xN     N 1 L a NM   s M      (2) 3 I n d e p e n d e n t c o m po n e n t a n a l y s i s In the models described above, since we assume that the underlying biological processes are independent, we suggest that vectors S=(s1,…,sM) are statistically independent and so ICA can recover S from the observed microarray data X. For linear ICA, we apply natural-gradient maximum estimation (NMLE) method which was proposed in [7] and was made more efficient by using natural gradient method in [8]. We also apply nonlinear ICA using reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on [9], as follows: 1. We map the N dimensional input data xi to Ф(xi) in the feature space by using the kernel trick. The feature space is defined by the relationship Ф(xi)TФ(xj)=k(xi,, xj). That is, inner product of mapped data is determined to by a kernel function k(.,.) in the input space; we used a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel (k(x,y)=exp(-|x-y|2)) and a polynomial kernel of degree 2 (k(x,y)=(xTy+1)2). To perform mapping, we found orthonormal bases of the feature space by randomly sampling L input data v={v1,…,vL} 1000 times and choosing one set minimizing the condition number of Φv=(Φ(v1),…,Φ(vL)). Then, a set of orthonormal bases of the feature space is determined by the selected L images of input data in v as Ξ = Φv(Φv TΦv )-1/2. We map all input data x1,…,xK, each corresponding to a gene, to Ψ(x1),…,Ψ(xK) in the feature space with basis Ξ, as follows:  k (v1 , v1 ) K k (v1 , v L )   M M     k (v L , v1 ) L k (v L , v L )  Ψ(xi)=(ΦvTΦv )-1/2Φv TΦv (xi)  = −1 / 2  k (v1 , xi )   ∈ ℜ L (1≤ i≤K) (3)  M    k ( v L , xi )    2. We linearly decompose the mapped data Ψ=[Ψ(x1),.,Ψ(xK)] ∈RL×K into statistically independent components using NMLE. 4 Proposed approach The microarray dataset we are given is in matrix form where each element xij corresponds to the level of expression of the jth gene in the ith experimental condition. Missing values are imputed by KNNImpute [10], an algorithm based on k nearest neighbors that is widely used in microarray analysis. Given the expression matrix X of N experiment by K genes, we perform the following steps. 1. Apply ICA to decompose X into independent components y1, …,yM as in Equations (1) and (2). Prior to applying ICA, remove any rows that make the expression matrix X singular. After ICA, each component denoted by yi is a vector comprising K loads gene expression levels, i.e., yi = (yi1, ...,yiK). We chose to let the number of components M to be maximized, which is equal the number of microarray experiments N because the maximum for N in our datasets was 250, which is smaller than the number of biological processes we hypothesize to act within a cell. 2. For each component, cluster genes according to their relative loads yij/mean(yi). Based on our ICA model, each component is a putative genomic expression program of an independent biological process. Thus, our hypothesis is that genes showing relatively high or low expression level within the component are the most important for the process. We create two clusters for each component: one cluster containing genes with expression level higher than a threshold, and one cluster containing genes with expression level lower than a threshold. Cluster i,1 = {gene j | y ij > mean( y i ) + c × std( y i )} Cluster i,2 = {gene j | y ij < mean( y i ) – c × std( y i )} (4) Here, mean(yi) is the average, std(yi) is the standard deviation of yi; and c is an adjustable coefficient. The value of the coefficient c was varied from 1.0 to 2.0 and the result for c=1.25 was presented in this paper. The results for other values of c are similar, and are presented on the website www.stanford.edu/~silee/ICA/. 3. For each cluster, measure the enrichment of each cluster with genes of known functional annotations. Using the Gene Ontology (GO) [11] and KEGG [12] gene annotation databases, we calculate the p-value for each cluster with every gene annotation, which is the probability that the cluster contains the observed number of genes with the annotation by chance assuming the hypergeometric distribution (details in [4]). For each gene annotation, the minimum p-value that is smaller than 10-7 obtained from any cluster was collected. If no p-value smaller than 10-7 is found, we consider the gene annotation not to be detected by the approach. As a result, we can assign biological meaning to each cluster and the corresponding independent component and we can evaluate the clustering performance by comparing the collected minimum p-value for each gene annotation with that from other clustering approach. 5 P e r f o r m a n c e e v a l uat i o n We tested the ICA-based clustering to four expression datasets (D1—D4) described in Table 1.

For D2 and D3, we compared with k-means clustering and the topomap method, applied in the same datasets in [4] and [3], respectively. We applied nonlinear ICA to D1, D2 and D4. Dataset D3 is very large and makes the nonlinear algorithm unstable. D1 was preprocessed to contain log-ratios xij=log2(Rij/Gij) between red and green intensities. In [1], principal components, referred to as eigenarrays, were hypothesized to be genomic expression programs of distinct biological processes. We compared the biological coherence of independent components with that of principal components found by [1]. Comparison was done in two ways: (1) For each component, we grouped genes within top x% of significant up-regulation and down-regulation (as measured by the load of the gene in the component) into two clusters with x adjusted from 5% to 45%. For each value of x, statistical significance was measured for clusters from independent components and compared with that from principal components based on the minimum p-value for each gene annotation, as described in Section 4. We made a scatter plot to compare the negative log of the collected best p-values for each gene annotation when x is fixed to be 15%, shown in Figure 1 (a) (2) Same as before, except we did not fix the value of x; instead, we collected the minimum p-value from each method for each GO and KEGG gene annotation category and compared the collected p-values (Figure 1 (b)). For both cases, in the majority of the gene annotation categories ICA produced significantly lower p-values than PCA did, especially for gene annotation for which both ICA and PCA showed high significance. Figure 1. Comparison of linear ICA (NMLE) to PCA on dataset D1 (a) when x is fixed to be 15%; (b) when x is not fixed. (c) Three independent components of dataset D4. Each gene is mapped to a point based on the value assigned to the gene in three independent components, which are enriched with liver- (red), Muscle- (orange) and vulva-specific (green) genes, respectively. The expression levels of genes in D4 were normalized across the 59 experiments, and the logarithms of the resulting values were taken. Experiments 57, 58, and 59 were removed because they made the expression matrix nearly singular. In [2], a clustering approach based on PCA and subsequent visual inspection was applied to an earlier version of this dataset, containing 50 of the 59 samples. After we performed ICA, the most significant independent components were enriched for liver-specific, muscle-specific and vulva-specific genes with p-value of 10-133, 10-124 and 100-117, respectively. In the ICA liver cluster, 198 genes were liver specific (out of a total of 244), as compared with the 23 liver-specific genes identified in [2] using PCA. The ICA muscle cluster of 235 genes contains 199 muscle specific genes compared to 19 muscle-specific genes identified in [2]. We generated a 3-dimensional scatter plot of the load expression levels of all genes annotated in [15] on these significant ICA components in Figure 1 (c). We can see that the liver-specific, muscle-specific and vulva-specific genes are strongly biased to lie on the x-, y-, and z- axis, respectively. We applied nonlinear ICA on this dataset and the first four most significant clusters from nonlinear ICA with Gaussian RBF kernel were muscle-specific, liver-specific, vulva-specific and brain-specific with p-value of 10-158, 10-127, 10-112 and 10-70, respectively, showing considerable improvement over the linear ICA clusters. For D2, variance-normalization was applied to the 3000 most variant genes as in [4]. The 17th experiment, which made the expression matrix close to singular, was removed. We measured the statistical significance of clusters as described in Section 4 and compared the smallest p-value of each gene annotation from our approach to that from k-means clustering applied to the same dataset [4]. We made a scatter plot for comparing the negative log of the smallest p-value (y-axis) from ICA clusters with that from k-means clustering (x-axis). The coefficient c is varied from 1.0 to 2.0 and the superiority of ICA-based clustering to k-means clustering does not change. In many practical settings, estimation of the best c is not needed; we can adjust c to get a desired size of the cluster unless our focus is to blindly find the size of clusters. Figure 2 (a) (b) (c) shows for c=1.25 a comparison of the performance of linear ICA (NMLE), nonlinear ICA with Gaussian RBF kernel (NICA gauss), and k-means clustering (k-means). For D3, first we removed experiments that contained more than 7000 missing values, because ICA does not perform properly when the dataset contains many missing values. The 250 remaining experiments were used, containing expression levels for 17817 genes preprocessed to be log-ratios xij=log2(Rij/Gij) between red and green intensities. We compared the biological coherence of clusters by our approach with that of topomap-based approach applied to the same dataset in [3]. The result when c=1.25 is plotted in the Figure 2 (d). We observe that the two methods perform very similarly, with most categories having roughly the same p-value in ICA and in the topomap clusters. The topomap clustering approach performs slightly better in a larger fraction of the categories. Still, we consider this performance a confirmation that ICA is a widely applicable method that requires minimal training: in this case the missing values and high diversity of the data make clustering especially challenging, while the topomap approach was specifically designed and manually trained for this dataset as described in [3]. Finally, we compared different ICA algorithms in terms of clustering performance. We tested six linear ICA methods: Natural Gradient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NMLE) [7][8], Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices [16], Fast Fixed Point ICA with three different measures of non-Gaussianity [17], and Extended Information Maximization (Infomax) [18]. We also tested two kernels for nonlinear ICA: Gaussian RBF kernel, and polynomial kernel (NICA ploy). For each dataset, we compared the biological coherence of clusters generated by each method. Among the six linear ICA algorithms, NMLE was the best in all datasets. Among both linear and nonlinear methods, the Gaussian kernel nonlinear ICA method was the best in Datasets D1, D2 and D4, the polynomial kernel nonlinear ICA method was best in Dataset D4, and NMLE was best in the large datasets (D3 and D4). In Figure 3, we compare the NMLE method with three other ICA methods for the dataset D2. Overall, the NMLE algorithm consistently performed well in all datasets. The nonlinear ICA algorithms performed best in the small datasets, but were unstable in the two largest datasets. More comparison results are demonstrated in the website www.stanford.edu/~silee/ICA/.

We proposed applying ICA to decompose microarray data into independent gene expression patterns of underlying biological processes, and to group genes into clusters that are mutually non-exclusive with statistically significant functional coherence. Our clustering method outperformed several leading methods on a variety of datasets, with the added advantage that it requires setting only one parameter, namely the fraction c of standard deviations beyond which a gene is considered to be associated with a component’s cluster. We observed that performance was not very sensitive to that parameter, suggesting that ICA is robust enough to be used for clustering with little human intervention. The empirical performance of ICA in our tests supports the hypothesis that statistical independence is a good criterion for separating mixed biological signals in microarray data. The Extended Infomax ICA algorithm proposed in [18] can automatically determine whether the distribution of each source signal is super-Gaussian or sub-Gaussian. Interestingly, the application of Extended Infomax ICA to all the expression datasets uncovered no source signal with sub-Gaussian distribution. A likely explanation is that global gene expression profiles are mixtures of super-Gaussian sources rather than of sub-Gaussian sources. This finding is consistent with the following intuition: underlying biological processes are super-Gaussian, because they affect sharply the relevant genes, typically a small fraction of all genes, and leave the majority of genes relatively unaffected.

<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical signiﬁcance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity. 1 Introduction and related work Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density estimation, and many other important tasks. However, most clustering algorithms require the user to specify the number of clusters (called k), and it is not always clear what is the best value for k. Figure 1 shows examples where k has been improperly chosen. Choosing k is often an ad hoc decision based on prior knowledge, assumptions, and practical experience. Choosing k is made more difﬁcult when the data has many dimensions, even when clusters are well-separated. Center-based clustering algorithms (in particular k-means and Gaussian expectationmaximization) usually assume that each cluster adheres to a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian. With these methods, only one center should be used to model each subset of data that follows a unimodal distribution. If multiple centers are used to describe data drawn from one mode, the centers are a needlessly complex description of the data, and in fact the multiple centers capture the truth about the subset less well than one center. In this paper we present a simple algorithm called G-means that discovers an appropriate k using a statistical test for deciding whether to split a k-means center into two centers. We describe examples and present experimental results that show that the new algorithm 0.9 4 0.8 3 0.7 2 0.6 1 0.5 0 0.4 −1 0.3 −2 −3 0.2 0.1 −0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: Two clusterings where k was improperly chosen.

In general, one center should be used to represent one Gaussian cluster. is successful. This technique is useful and applicable for many clustering algorithms other than k-means, but here we consider only the k-means algorithm for simplicity. Several algorithms have been proposed previously to determine k automatically. Like our method, most previous methods are wrappers around k-means or some other clustering algorithm for ﬁxed k. Wrapper methods use splitting and/or merging rules for centers to increase or decrease k as the algorithm proceeds. Pelleg and Moore [14] proposed a regularization framework for learning k, which they call X-means. The algorithm searches over many values of k and scores each clustering model using the so-called Bayesian Information Criterion [10]: BIC(C|X) = L(X|C) − p log n 2 where L(X|C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C, p = k(d + 1) is the number of parameters in the model C with dimensionality d and k cluster centers, and n is the number of points in the dataset. X-means chooses the model with the best BIC score on the data. Aside from the BIC, other scoring functions are also available. Bischof et al. [1] use a minimum description length (MDL) framework, where the description length is a measure of how well the data are ﬁt by the model. Their algorithm starts with a large value for k and removes centers (reduces k) whenever that choice reduces the description length. Between steps of reducing k, they use the k-means algorithm to optimize the model ﬁt to the data. With hierarchical clustering algorithms, other methods may be employed to determine the best number of clusters. One is to build a merging tree (“dendrogram”) of the data based on a cluster distance metric, and search for areas of the tree that are stable with respect to inter- and intra-cluster distances [9, Section 5.1]. This method of estimating k is best applied with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and human intuition. 2 The Gaussian-means (G-means) algorithm The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to reﬁne the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each center. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center. However, if the same data do not appear Algorithm 1 G-means(X, α) 1: Let C be the initial set of centers (usually C ← {¯}). x 2: C ← kmeans(C, X). 3: Let {xi |class(xi ) = j} be the set of datapoints assigned to center cj . 4: Use a statistical test to detect if each {xi |class(xi ) = j} follow a Gaussian distribution (at conﬁdence level α). 5: If the data look Gaussian, keep cj . Otherwise replace cj with two centers. 6: Repeat from step 2 until no more centers are added. to be Gaussian, then we want to use multiple centers to model the data properly. The algorithm will run k-means multiple times (up to k times when ﬁnding k centers), so the time complexity is at most O(k) times that of k-means. The k-means algorithm implicitly assumes that the datapoints in each cluster are spherically distributed around the center. Less restrictively, the Gaussian expectation-maximization algorithm assumes that the datapoints in each cluster have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that may or may not be ﬁxed, or shared. The Gaussian distribution test that we present below are valid for either covariance matrix assumption. The test also accounts for the number of datapoints n tested by incorporating n in the calculation of the critical value of the test (see Equation 2). This prevents the G-means algorithm from making bad decisions about clusters with few datapoints. 2.1 Testing clusters for Gaussian ﬁt To specify the G-means algorithm fully we need a test to detect whether the data assigned to a center are sampled from a Gaussian. The alternative hypotheses are • H0 : The data around the center are sampled from a Gaussian. • H1 : The data around the center are not sampled from a Gaussian. If we accept the null hypothesis H0 , then we believe that the one center is sufﬁcient to model its data, and we should not split the cluster into two sub-clusters. If we reject H0 and accept H1 , then we want to split the cluster. The test we use is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic. This one-dimensional test has been shown empirically to be the most powerful normality test that is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). Given a list of values xi that have been converted to mean 0 and variance 1, let x(i) be the ith ordered value. Let zi = F (x(i) ), where F is the N (0, 1) cumulative distribution function. Then the statistic is A2 (Z) = − 1 n n (2i − 1) [log(zi ) + log(1 − zn+1−i )] − n (1) i=1 Stephens [17] showed that for the case where µ and σ are estimated from the data (as in clustering), we must correct the statistic according to A2 (Z) ∗ = A2 (Z)(1 + 4/n − 25/(n2 )) (2) Given a subset of data X in d dimensions that belongs to center c, the hypothesis test proceeds as follows: 1. Choose a signiﬁcance level α for the test. 2. Initialize two centers, called “children” of c. See the text for good ways to do this. 3. Run k-means on these two centers in X. This can be run to completion, or to some early stopping point if desired. Let c1 , c2 be the child centers chosen by k-means. 4. Let v = c1 − c2 be a d-dimensional vector that connects the two centers. This is the direction that k-means believes to be important for clustering. Then project X onto v: xi = xi , v /||v||2 . X is a 1-dimensional representation of the data projected onto v. Transform X so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. 5. Let zi = F (x(i) ). If A2 (Z) is in the range of non-critical values at conﬁdence ∗ level α, then accept H0 , keep the original center, and discard {c1 , c2 }. Otherwise, reject H0 and keep {c1 , c2 } in place of the original center. A primary contribution of this work is simplifying the test for Gaussian ﬁt by projecting the data to one dimension where the test is simple to apply. The authors of [5] also use this approach for online dimensionality reduction during clustering. The one-dimensional representation of the data allows us to consider only the data along the direction that kmeans has found to be important for separating the data. This is related to the problem of projection pursuit [7], where here k-means searches for a direction in which the data appears non-Gaussian. We must choose the signiﬁcance level of the test, α, which is the desired probability of making a Type I error (i.e. incorrectly rejecting H0 ). It is appropriate to use a Bonferroni adjustment to reduce the chance of making Type I errors over multiple tests. For example, if we want a 0.01 chance of making a Type I error in 100 tests, we should apply a Bonferroni adjustment to make each test use α = 0.01/100 = 0.0001. To ﬁnd k ﬁnal centers the G-means algorithm makes k statistical tests, so the Bonferroni correction does not need to be extreme. In our tests, we always use α = 0.0001. We consider two ways to initialize the two child centers. Both approaches initialize with c ± m, where c is a center and m is chosen. The ﬁrst method chooses m as a random d-dimensional vector such that ||m|| is small compared to the distortion of the data. A second method ﬁnds the main principal component s of the data (having eigenvalue λ), and chooses m = s 2λ/π. This deterministic method places the two centers in their expected locations under H0 . The principal component calculations require O(nd2 + d3 ) time and O(d2 ) space, but since we only want the main principal component, we can use fast methods like the power method, which takes time that is at most linear in the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues [4]. In this paper we use principal-component-based splitting. 2.2 An example Figure 2 shows a run of the G-means algorithm on a synthetic dataset with two true clusters and 1000 points, using α = 0.0001. The critical value for the Anderson-Darling test is 1.8692 for this conﬁdence level. Starting with one center, after one iteration of G-means, we have 2 centers and the A2 statistic is 38.103. This is much larger than the critical value, ∗ so we reject H0 and accept this split. On the next iteration, we split each new center and repeat the statistical test. The A2 values for the two splits are 0.386 and 0.496, both of ∗ which are well below the critical value. Therefore we accept H0 for both tests, and discard these splits. Thus G-means gives a ﬁnal answer of k = 2. 2.3 Statistical power Figure 3 shows the power of the Anderson-Darling test, as compared to the BIC. Lower is better for both plots. We run 1000 tests for each data point plotted for both plots.

Starting with one center (left plot), G-means splits into two centers (middle). The test for normality is signiﬁcant, so G-means rejects H0 and keeps the split. After splitting each center again (right), the test values are not signiﬁcant, so G-means accepts H0 for both tests and does not accept these splits. The middle plot is the G-means answer. See the text for further details. 1 1 G-means X-means 0.8 P(Type II error) P(Type I error) 0.8 G-means X-means 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 Figure 3: A comparison of the power of the Anderson-Darling test versus the BIC. For the AD test we ﬁx the signiﬁcance level (α = 0.0001), while the BIC’s signiﬁcance level depends on n. The left plot shows the probability of incorrectly splitting (Type I error) one true 2-d cluster that is 5% elliptical. The right plot shows the probability of incorrectly not splitting two true clusters separated by 5σ (Type II error). Both plots are functions of n. Both plots show that the BIC overﬁts (splits clusters) when n is small. plot, for each test we generate n datapoints from a single true Gaussian distribution, and then plot the frequency with which BIC and G-means will choose k = 2 rather than k = 1 (i.e. commit a Type I error). BIC tends to overﬁt by choosing too many centers when the data is not strictly spherical, while G-means does not. This is consistent with the tests of real-world data in the next section. While G-means commits more Type II errors when n is small, this prevents it from overﬁtting the data. The BIC can be considered a likelihood ratio test, but with a signiﬁcance level that cannot be ﬁxed. The signiﬁcance level instead varies depending on n and ∆k (the change in the number of model parameters between two models). As n or ∆k decrease, the signiﬁcance level increases (the BIC becomes weaker as a statistical test) [10]. Figure 3 shows this effect for varying n. In [11] the authors show that penalty-based methods require problemspeciﬁc tuning and don’t generalize as well as other methods, such as cross validation. 3 Experiments Table 1 shows the results from running G-means and X-means on many large synthetic. On synthetic datasets with spherically distributed clusters, G-means and X-means do equally Table 1: Results for many synthetic datasets. We report distortion relative to the optimum distortion for the correct clustering (closer to one is better), and time is reported relative to k-means run with the correct k. For BIC, larger values are better, but it is clear that ﬁnding the correct clustering does not always coincide with ﬁnding a larger BIC. Items with a star are where X-means always chose the largest number of centers we allowed. dataset synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 d 2 k found 9.1± 9.9 18.1± 3.2 20.1± 0.6 70.5±11.6 80.0± 0.2 171.7±23.7 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.1 *80.0± 0.0 80.2± 0.5 229.2±36.8 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.0 *80.0± 0.0 80.0± 0.0 171.5±10.9 method G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means 2 2 8 8 8 32 32 32 BIC(×104 ) -0.19±2.70 0.70±0.93 0.21±0.18 14.83±3.50 1.84±0.12 40.16±6.59 -0.74±0.16 -2.28±0.20 -0.18±0.17 14.36±0.21 1.45±0.20 52.28±9.26 -3.36±0.21 -27.92±0.22 -2.73±0.22 -11.13±0.23 -1.10±0.16 11.78±2.74 distortion(× optimal) 0.89± 0.23 0.37± 0.12 0.99± 0.01 9.45±28.02 1.00± 0.01 48.49±70.04 1.00± 0.00 0.47± 0.03 0.99± 0.00 0.47± 0.01 0.99± 0.00 0.57± 0.06 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.00 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.01 1.00± 0.00 0.84± 0.01 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 time(× k-means) 13.2 2.8 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.8 4.6 11.0 2.6 4.0 2.9 6.5 4.4 29.9 2.3 21.2 2.8 53.3 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Figure 4: 2-d synthetic dataset with 5 true clusters. On the left, G-means correctly chooses 5 centers and deals well with non-spherical data. On the right, the BIC causes X-means to overﬁt the data, choosing 20 unevenly distributed clusters. well at ﬁnding the correct k and maximizing the BIC statistic, so we don’t show these results here. Most real-world data is not spherical, however. The synthetic datasets used here each have 5000 datapoints in d = 2/8/32 dimensions. The true ks are 5, 20, and 80. For each synthetic dataset type, we generate 30 datasets with the true center means chosen uniformly randomly from the unit hypercube, and choosing σ so that no two clusters are closer than 3σ apart. Each cluster is also given a transformation to make it non-spherical, by multiplying the data by a randomly chosen scaling and rotation matrix. We run G-means starting with one center. We allow X-means to search between 2 and 4k centers (where here k is the true number of clusters). The G-means algorithm clearly does better at ﬁnding the correct k on non-spherical data. Its results are closer to the true distortions and the correct ks. The BIC statistic that X-means uses has been formulated to maximize the likelihood for spherically-distributed data. Thus it overestimates the number of true clusters in non-spherical data. This is especially evident when the number of points per cluster is small, as in datasets with 80 true clusters. 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Digit 0 1 Digit 0 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Cluster 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cluster Figure 5: NIST and Pendigits datasets: correspondence between each digit (row) and each cluster (column) found by G-means. G-means did not have the labels, yet it found meaningful clusters corresponding with the labels. Because of this overestimation, X-means often hits our limit of 4k centers. Figure 4 shows an example of overﬁtting on a dataset with 5 true clusters. X-means chooses k = 20 while G-means ﬁnds all 5 true cluster centers. Also of note is that X-means does not distribute centers evenly among clusters; some clusters receive one center, but others receive many. G-means runs faster than X-means for 8 and 32 dimensions, which we expect, since the kd-tree structures which make X-means fast in low dimensions take time exponential in d, making them slow for more than 8 to 12 dimensions. All our code is written in Matlab; X-means is written in C. 3.1 Discovering true clusters in labeled data We tested these algorithms on two real-world datasets for handwritten digit recognition: the NIST dataset [12] and the Pendigits dataset [2]. The goal is to cluster the data without knowledge of the labels and measure how well the clustering captures the true labels. Both datasets have 10 true classes (digits 0-9). NIST has 60000 training examples and 784 dimensions (28×28 pixels). We use 6000 randomly chosen examples and we reduce the dimension to 50 by random projection (following [3]). The Pendigits dataset has 7984 examples and 16 dimensions; we did not change the data in any way. We cluster each dataset with G-means and X-means, and measure performance by comparing the cluster labels Lc with the true labels Lt . We deﬁne the partition quality (PQ) as kt kc kt 2 2 pq = i=1 j=1 p(i, j) i=1 p(i) where kt is the true number of classes, and kc is the number of clusters found by the algorithm. This metric is maximized when Lc induces the same partition of the data as Lt ; in other words, when all points in each cluster have the same true label, and the estimated k is the true k. The p(i, j) term is the frequency-based probability that a datapoint will be labeled i by Lt and j by Lc . This quality is normalized by the sum of true probabilities, squared. This statistic is related to the Rand statistic for comparing partitions [8]. For the NIST dataset, G-means ﬁnds 31 clusters in 30 seconds with a PQ score of 0.177. X-means ﬁnds 715 clusters in 4149 seconds, and 369 of these clusters contain only one point, indicating an overestimation problem with the BIC. X-means receives a PQ score of 0.024. For the Pendigits dataset, G-means ﬁnds 69 clusters in 30 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.196; X-means ﬁnds 235 clusters in 287 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.057. Figure 5 shows Hinton diagrams of the G-means clusterings of both datasets, showing that G-means succeeds at identifying the true clusters concisely, without aid of the labels. The confusions between different digits in the NIST dataset (seen in the off-diagonal elements) are common for other researchers using more sophisticated techniques, see [3]. 4 Discussion and conclusions We have introduced the new G-means algorithm for learning k based on a statistical test for determining whether datapoints are a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary dimension and covariance matrix. The splitting uses dimension reduction and a powerful test for Gaussian ﬁtness. G-means uses this statistical test as a wrapper around k-means to discover the number of clusters automatically. The only parameter supplied to the algorithm is the signiﬁcance level of the statistical test, which can easily be set in a standard way. The G-means algorithm takes linear time and space (plus the cost of the splitting heuristic and test) in the number of datapoints and dimension, since k-means is itself linear in time and space. Empirically, the G-means algorithm works well at ﬁnding the correct number of clusters and the locations of genuine cluster centers, and we have shown it works well in moderately high dimensions. Clustering in high dimensions has been an open problem for many years. Recent research has shown that it may be preferable to use dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering, and then use a low-dimensional clustering algorithm such as k-means, rather than clustering in the high dimension directly. In [3] the author shows that using a simple, inexpensive linear projection preserves many of the properties of data (such as cluster distances), while making it easier to ﬁnd the clusters. Thus there is a need for good-quality, fast clustering algorithms for low-dimensional data. Our work is a step in this direction. Additionally, recent image segmentation algorithms such as normalized cut [16, 13] are based on eigenvector computations on distance matrices. These “spectral” clustering algorithms still use k-means as a post-processing step to ﬁnd the actual segmentation and they require k to be speciﬁed. Thus we expect G-means will be useful in combination with spectral clustering. References [1] Horst Bischof, Aleˇ Leonardis, and Alexander Selb. MDL principle for robust vector quantisation.

<p>Author: Volker Roth, Tilman Lange</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach to combining clustering and feature selection is presented. It implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. On the technical side, we present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of this method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is able to infer both meaningful partitions and meaningful subsets of features. 1</p><p>5 0.5513503 <a title="79-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Simplicial_Mixtures_of_Markov_Chains%3A_Distributed_Modelling_of_Dynamic_User_Profiles.html">177 nips-2003-Simplicial Mixtures of Markov Chains: Distributed Modelling of Dynamic User Profiles</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Girolami, Ata Kabán</p><p>Abstract: To provide a compact generative representation of the sequential activity of a number of individuals within a group there is a tradeoff between the deﬁnition of individual speciﬁc and global models. This paper proposes a linear-time distributed model for ﬁnite state symbolic sequences representing traces of individual user activity by making the assumption that heterogeneous user behavior may be ‘explained’ by a relatively small number of common structurally simple behavioral patterns which may interleave randomly in a user-speciﬁc proportion. The results of an empirical study on three different sources of user traces indicates that this modelling approach provides an efﬁcient representation scheme, reﬂected by improved prediction performance as well as providing lowcomplexity and intuitively interpretable representations.</p><p>6 0.54913312 <a title="79-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Geometric_Clustering_Using_the_Information_Bottleneck_Method.html">82 nips-2003-Geometric Clustering Using the Information Bottleneck Method</a></p>

<p>Author: Darya Chudova, Christopher Hart, Eric Mjolsness, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: We propose a functional mixture model for simultaneous clustering and alignment of sets of curves measured on a discrete time grid. The model is speciﬁcally tailored to gene expression time course data. Each functional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed proﬁles, (b) align the proﬁles in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA in the course of an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy proﬁles by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared to regular Gaussian mixtures. 1</p><p>2 0.76425225 <a title="79-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Training_a_Quantum_Neural_Network.html">187 nips-2003-Training a Quantum Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Bob Ricks, Dan Ventura</p><p>Abstract: Most proposals for quantum neural networks have skipped over the problem of how to train the networks. The mechanics of quantum computing are different enough from classical computing that the issue of training should be treated in detail. We propose a simple quantum neural network and a training method for it. It can be shown that this algorithm works in quantum systems. Results on several real-world data sets show that this algorithm can train the proposed quantum neural networks, and that it has some advantages over classical learning algorithms. 1</p><p>3 0.76203614 <a title="79-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Pairwise_Clustering_and_Graphical_Models.html">152 nips-2003-Pairwise Clustering and Graphical Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Noam Shental, Assaf Zomet, Tomer Hertz, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Signiﬁcant progress in clustering has been achieved by algorithms that are based on pairwise afﬁnities between the datapoints. In particular, spectral clustering methods have the advantage of being able to divide arbitrarily shaped clusters and are based on efﬁcient eigenvector calculations. However, spectral methods lack a straightforward probabilistic interpretation which makes it difﬁcult to automatically set parameters using training data. In this paper we use the previously proposed typical cut framework for pairwise clustering. We show an equivalence between calculating the typical cut and inference in an undirected graphical model. We show that for clustering problems with hundreds of datapoints exact inference may still be possible. For more complicated datasets, we show that loopy belief propagation (BP) and generalized belief propagation (GBP) can give excellent results on challenging clustering problems. We also use graphical models to derive a learning algorithm for afﬁnity matrices based on labeled data. 1</p><p>4 0.51243889 <a title="79-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Finding_the_M_Most_Probable_Configurations_using_Loopy_Belief_Propagation.html">74 nips-2003-Finding the M Most Probable Configurations using Loopy Belief Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation (BP) has been successfully used in a number of diﬃcult graphical models to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration of the hidden variables. In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to ﬁnd not just the best conﬁguration but rather the top M . While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world problems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of ﬁnding the M best conﬁgurations when exact inference is impossible. We start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculating the best conﬁgurations that uses only max-marginals. For approximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show empirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best conﬁgurations in graphs with hundreds of variables. 1</p><p>5 0.51116759 <a title="79-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-ICA-based_Clustering_of_Genes_from_Microarray_Expression_Data.html">86 nips-2003-ICA-based Clustering of Genes from Microarray Expression Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Su-in Lee, Serafim Batzoglou</p><p>Abstract: We propose an unsupervised methodology using independent component analysis (ICA) to cluster genes from DNA microarray data. Based on an ICA mixture model of genomic expression patterns, linear and nonlinear ICA finds components that are specific to certain biological processes. Genes that exhibit significant up-regulation or down-regulation within each component are grouped into clusters. We test the statistical significance of enrichment of gene annotations within each cluster. ICA-based clustering outperformed other leading methods in constructing functionally coherent clusters on various datasets. This result supports our model of genomic expression data as composite effect of independent biological processes. Comparison of clustering performance among various ICA algorithms including a kernel-based nonlinear ICA algorithm shows that nonlinear ICA performed the best for small datasets and natural-gradient maximization-likelihood worked well for all the datasets. 1 In trod u ction Microarray technology has enabled genome-wide expression profiling, promising to provide insight into underlying biological mechanism involved in gene regulation. To aid such discoveries, mathematical tools that are versatile enough to capture the underlying biology and simple enough to be applied efficiently on large datasets are needed. Analysis tools based on novel data mining techniques have been proposed [1]-[6]. When applying mathematical models and tools to microarray analysis, clustering genes that have the similar biological properties is an important step for three reasons: reduction of data complexity, prediction of gene function, and evaluation of the analysis approach by measuring the statistical significance of biological coherence of gene clusters. Independent component analysis (ICA) linearly decomposes each of N vectors into M common component vectors (N≥M) so that each component is statistically as independent from the others as possible. One of the main applications of ICA is blind source separation (BSS) that aims to separate source signals from their mixtures. There have been a few attempts to apply ICA to the microarray expression data to extract meaningful signals each corresponding to independent biological process [5]-[6]. In this paper, we provide the first evidence that ICA is a superior mathematical model and clustering tool for microarray analysis, compared to the most widely used methods namely PCA and k-means clustering. We also introduce the application of nonlinear ICA to microarray analysis, and show that it outperforms linear ICA on some datasets. We apply ICA to microarray data to decompose the input data into statistically independent components. Then, genes are clustered in an unsupervised fashion into non-mutually exclusive clusters. Each independent component is assigned a putative biological meaning based on functional annotations of genes that are predominant within the component. We systematically evaluate the clustering performance of several ICA algorithms on four expression datasets and show that ICA-based clustering is superior to other leading methods that have been applied to analyze the same datasets. We also proposed a kernel based nonlinear ICA algorithm for dealing with more realistic mixture model. Among the different linear ICA algorithms including six linear and one nonlinear ICA algorithm, the natural-gradient maximum-likelihood estimation method (NMLE) [7]-[8] performs well in all the datasets. Kernel-based nonlinear ICA method worked better for three small datasets. 2 M a t h e m at i c a l m o de l o f g e n om e - wi d e e x p r e s s i on Several distinct biological processes take place simultaneously inside a cell; each biological process has its own expression program to up-regulate or down-regulate the level of expression of specific sets of genes. We model a genome-wide expression pattern in a given condition (measured by a microarray assay) as a mixture of signals generated by statistically independent biological processes with different activation levels. We design two kinds of models for genomic expression pattern: a linear and nonlinear mixture model. Suppose that a cell is governed by M independent biological processes S = (s1, …, sM)T, each of which is a vector of K gene expression levels, and that we measure the levels of expression of all genes in N conditions, resulting in a microarray expression matrix X = (x1,…,xN)T. The expression level at each different condition j can be expressed as linear combinations of the M biological processes: xj=aj1s1+…+ajMsM. We can express this idea concisely in matrix notation as follows. X = AS ,  x1   a11 L a1M   s1   M = M M  M        x N  a N 1 L a NM   s M       (1) More generally, we can express X = (x1,…,xN)T as a post-nonlinear mixture of the underlying independent processes as follows, where f(.) is a nonlinear mapping from N to N dimensional space. X = f ( AS ),   a11 L a1M   s1    x1    M  = f  M M  M         a  xN     N 1 L a NM   s M      (2) 3 I n d e p e n d e n t c o m po n e n t a n a l y s i s In the models described above, since we assume that the underlying biological processes are independent, we suggest that vectors S=(s1,…,sM) are statistically independent and so ICA can recover S from the observed microarray data X. For linear ICA, we apply natural-gradient maximum estimation (NMLE) method which was proposed in [7] and was made more efficient by using natural gradient method in [8]. We also apply nonlinear ICA using reproducible kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS) based on [9], as follows: 1. We map the N dimensional input data xi to Ф(xi) in the feature space by using the kernel trick. The feature space is defined by the relationship Ф(xi)TФ(xj)=k(xi,, xj). That is, inner product of mapped data is determined to by a kernel function k(.,.) in the input space; we used a Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel (k(x,y)=exp(-|x-y|2)) and a polynomial kernel of degree 2 (k(x,y)=(xTy+1)2). To perform mapping, we found orthonormal bases of the feature space by randomly sampling L input data v={v1,…,vL} 1000 times and choosing one set minimizing the condition number of Φv=(Φ(v1),…,Φ(vL)). Then, a set of orthonormal bases of the feature space is determined by the selected L images of input data in v as Ξ = Φv(Φv TΦv )-1/2. We map all input data x1,…,xK, each corresponding to a gene, to Ψ(x1),…,Ψ(xK) in the feature space with basis Ξ, as follows:  k (v1 , v1 ) K k (v1 , v L )   M M     k (v L , v1 ) L k (v L , v L )  Ψ(xi)=(ΦvTΦv )-1/2Φv TΦv (xi)  = −1 / 2  k (v1 , xi )   ∈ ℜ L (1≤ i≤K) (3)  M    k ( v L , xi )    2. We linearly decompose the mapped data Ψ=[Ψ(x1),.,Ψ(xK)] ∈RL×K into statistically independent components using NMLE. 4 Proposed approach The microarray dataset we are given is in matrix form where each element xij corresponds to the level of expression of the jth gene in the ith experimental condition. Missing values are imputed by KNNImpute [10], an algorithm based on k nearest neighbors that is widely used in microarray analysis. Given the expression matrix X of N experiment by K genes, we perform the following steps. 1. Apply ICA to decompose X into independent components y1, …,yM as in Equations (1) and (2). Prior to applying ICA, remove any rows that make the expression matrix X singular. After ICA, each component denoted by yi is a vector comprising K loads gene expression levels, i.e., yi = (yi1, ...,yiK). We chose to let the number of components M to be maximized, which is equal the number of microarray experiments N because the maximum for N in our datasets was 250, which is smaller than the number of biological processes we hypothesize to act within a cell. 2. For each component, cluster genes according to their relative loads yij/mean(yi). Based on our ICA model, each component is a putative genomic expression program of an independent biological process. Thus, our hypothesis is that genes showing relatively high or low expression level within the component are the most important for the process. We create two clusters for each component: one cluster containing genes with expression level higher than a threshold, and one cluster containing genes with expression level lower than a threshold. Cluster i,1 = {gene j | y ij > mean( y i ) + c × std( y i )} Cluster i,2 = {gene j | y ij < mean( y i ) – c × std( y i )} (4) Here, mean(yi) is the average, std(yi) is the standard deviation of yi; and c is an adjustable coefficient. The value of the coefficient c was varied from 1.0 to 2.0 and the result for c=1.25 was presented in this paper. The results for other values of c are similar, and are presented on the website www.stanford.edu/~silee/ICA/. 3. For each cluster, measure the enrichment of each cluster with genes of known functional annotations. Using the Gene Ontology (GO) [11] and KEGG [12] gene annotation databases, we calculate the p-value for each cluster with every gene annotation, which is the probability that the cluster contains the observed number of genes with the annotation by chance assuming the hypergeometric distribution (details in [4]). For each gene annotation, the minimum p-value that is smaller than 10-7 obtained from any cluster was collected. If no p-value smaller than 10-7 is found, we consider the gene annotation not to be detected by the approach. As a result, we can assign biological meaning to each cluster and the corresponding independent component and we can evaluate the clustering performance by comparing the collected minimum p-value for each gene annotation with that from other clustering approach. 5 P e r f o r m a n c e e v a l uat i o n We tested the ICA-based clustering to four expression datasets (D1—D4) described in Table 1. Table 1: The four datasets used in our analysis ARRAY TYPE DESCRIPTION # OF GENES (K) # OF EXPS (N) D1 Spotted 4579 22 D2 Oligonucl eotide Spotted Oligonucl eotide Budding yeast during cell cycle and CLB2/CLN3 overactive strain [13] Budding yeast during cell cycle [14] 6616 17 C. elegans in various conditions [3] Normal human tissue including 19 kinds of tissues [15] 17817 7070 553 59 D3 D4 For D1 and D4, we compared the biological coherence of ICA components with that of PCA applied in the same datasets in [1] and [2], respectively. For D2 and D3, we compared with k-means clustering and the topomap method, applied in the same datasets in [4] and [3], respectively. We applied nonlinear ICA to D1, D2 and D4. Dataset D3 is very large and makes the nonlinear algorithm unstable. D1 was preprocessed to contain log-ratios xij=log2(Rij/Gij) between red and green intensities. In [1], principal components, referred to as eigenarrays, were hypothesized to be genomic expression programs of distinct biological processes. We compared the biological coherence of independent components with that of principal components found by [1]. Comparison was done in two ways: (1) For each component, we grouped genes within top x% of significant up-regulation and down-regulation (as measured by the load of the gene in the component) into two clusters with x adjusted from 5% to 45%. For each value of x, statistical significance was measured for clusters from independent components and compared with that from principal components based on the minimum p-value for each gene annotation, as described in Section 4. We made a scatter plot to compare the negative log of the collected best p-values for each gene annotation when x is fixed to be 15%, shown in Figure 1 (a) (2) Same as before, except we did not fix the value of x; instead, we collected the minimum p-value from each method for each GO and KEGG gene annotation category and compared the collected p-values (Figure 1 (b)). For both cases, in the majority of the gene annotation categories ICA produced significantly lower p-values than PCA did, especially for gene annotation for which both ICA and PCA showed high significance. Figure 1. Comparison of linear ICA (NMLE) to PCA on dataset D1 (a) when x is fixed to be 15%; (b) when x is not fixed. (c) Three independent components of dataset D4. Each gene is mapped to a point based on the value assigned to the gene in three independent components, which are enriched with liver- (red), Muscle- (orange) and vulva-specific (green) genes, respectively. The expression levels of genes in D4 were normalized across the 59 experiments, and the logarithms of the resulting values were taken. Experiments 57, 58, and 59 were removed because they made the expression matrix nearly singular. In [2], a clustering approach based on PCA and subsequent visual inspection was applied to an earlier version of this dataset, containing 50 of the 59 samples. After we performed ICA, the most significant independent components were enriched for liver-specific, muscle-specific and vulva-specific genes with p-value of 10-133, 10-124 and 100-117, respectively. In the ICA liver cluster, 198 genes were liver specific (out of a total of 244), as compared with the 23 liver-specific genes identified in [2] using PCA. The ICA muscle cluster of 235 genes contains 199 muscle specific genes compared to 19 muscle-specific genes identified in [2]. We generated a 3-dimensional scatter plot of the load expression levels of all genes annotated in [15] on these significant ICA components in Figure 1 (c). We can see that the liver-specific, muscle-specific and vulva-specific genes are strongly biased to lie on the x-, y-, and z- axis, respectively. We applied nonlinear ICA on this dataset and the first four most significant clusters from nonlinear ICA with Gaussian RBF kernel were muscle-specific, liver-specific, vulva-specific and brain-specific with p-value of 10-158, 10-127, 10-112 and 10-70, respectively, showing considerable improvement over the linear ICA clusters. For D2, variance-normalization was applied to the 3000 most variant genes as in [4]. The 17th experiment, which made the expression matrix close to singular, was removed. We measured the statistical significance of clusters as described in Section 4 and compared the smallest p-value of each gene annotation from our approach to that from k-means clustering applied to the same dataset [4]. We made a scatter plot for comparing the negative log of the smallest p-value (y-axis) from ICA clusters with that from k-means clustering (x-axis). The coefficient c is varied from 1.0 to 2.0 and the superiority of ICA-based clustering to k-means clustering does not change. In many practical settings, estimation of the best c is not needed; we can adjust c to get a desired size of the cluster unless our focus is to blindly find the size of clusters. Figure 2 (a) (b) (c) shows for c=1.25 a comparison of the performance of linear ICA (NMLE), nonlinear ICA with Gaussian RBF kernel (NICA gauss), and k-means clustering (k-means). For D3, first we removed experiments that contained more than 7000 missing values, because ICA does not perform properly when the dataset contains many missing values. The 250 remaining experiments were used, containing expression levels for 17817 genes preprocessed to be log-ratios xij=log2(Rij/Gij) between red and green intensities. We compared the biological coherence of clusters by our approach with that of topomap-based approach applied to the same dataset in [3]. The result when c=1.25 is plotted in the Figure 2 (d). We observe that the two methods perform very similarly, with most categories having roughly the same p-value in ICA and in the topomap clusters. The topomap clustering approach performs slightly better in a larger fraction of the categories. Still, we consider this performance a confirmation that ICA is a widely applicable method that requires minimal training: in this case the missing values and high diversity of the data make clustering especially challenging, while the topomap approach was specifically designed and manually trained for this dataset as described in [3]. Finally, we compared different ICA algorithms in terms of clustering performance. We tested six linear ICA methods: Natural Gradient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (NMLE) [7][8], Joint Approximate Diagonalization of Eigenmatrices [16], Fast Fixed Point ICA with three different measures of non-Gaussianity [17], and Extended Information Maximization (Infomax) [18]. We also tested two kernels for nonlinear ICA: Gaussian RBF kernel, and polynomial kernel (NICA ploy). For each dataset, we compared the biological coherence of clusters generated by each method. Among the six linear ICA algorithms, NMLE was the best in all datasets. Among both linear and nonlinear methods, the Gaussian kernel nonlinear ICA method was the best in Datasets D1, D2 and D4, the polynomial kernel nonlinear ICA method was best in Dataset D4, and NMLE was best in the large datasets (D3 and D4). In Figure 3, we compare the NMLE method with three other ICA methods for the dataset D2. Overall, the NMLE algorithm consistently performed well in all datasets. The nonlinear ICA algorithms performed best in the small datasets, but were unstable in the two largest datasets. More comparison results are demonstrated in the website www.stanford.edu/~silee/ICA/.

We proposed applying ICA to decompose microarray data into independent gene expression patterns of underlying biological processes, and to group genes into clusters that are mutually non-exclusive with statistically significant functional coherence. Our clustering method outperformed several leading methods on a variety of datasets, with the added advantage that it requires setting only one parameter, namely the fraction c of standard deviations beyond which a gene is considered to be associated with a component’s cluster. We observed that performance was not very sensitive to that parameter, suggesting that ICA is robust enough to be used for clustering with little human intervention. The empirical performance of ICA in our tests supports the hypothesis that statistical independence is a good criterion for separating mixed biological signals in microarray data. The Extended Infomax ICA algorithm proposed in [18] can automatically determine whether the distribution of each source signal is super-Gaussian or sub-Gaussian. Interestingly, the application of Extended Infomax ICA to all the expression datasets uncovered no source signal with sub-Gaussian distribution. A likely explanation is that global gene expression profiles are mixtures of super-Gaussian sources rather than of sub-Gaussian sources. This finding is consistent with the following intuition: underlying biological processes are super-Gaussian, because they affect sharply the relevant genes, typically a small fraction of all genes, and leave the majority of genes relatively unaffected.

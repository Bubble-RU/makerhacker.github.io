<p>Author: William M. Campbell, Joseph P. Campbell, Douglas A. Reynolds, Douglas A. Jones, Timothy R. Leek</p><p>Abstract: A recent area of signiﬁcant progress in speaker recognition is the use of high level features—idiolect, phonetic relations, prosody, discourse structure, etc. A speaker not only has a distinctive acoustic sound but uses language in a characteristic manner. Large corpora of speech data available in recent years allow experimentation with long term statistics of phone patterns, word patterns, etc. of an individual. We propose the use of support vector machines and term frequency analysis of phone sequences to model a given speaker. To this end, we explore techniques for text categorization applied to the problem. We derive a new kernel based upon a linearization of likelihood ratio scoring. We introduce a new phone-based SVM speaker recognition approach that halves the error rate of conventional phone-based approaches.</p><p>3 0.15021589 <a title="9-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-A_Sampled_Texture_Prior_for_Image_Super-Resolution.html">17 nips-2003-A Sampled Texture Prior for Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Lyndsey C. Pickup, Stephen J. Roberts, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Super-resolution aims to produce a high-resolution image from a set of one or more low-resolution images by recovering or inventing plausible high-frequency image content. Typical approaches try to reconstruct a high-resolution image using the sub-pixel displacements of several lowresolution images, usually regularized by a generic smoothness prior over the high-resolution image space. Other methods use training data to learn low-to-high-resolution matches, and have been highly successful even in the single-input-image case. Here we present a domain-speciﬁc image prior in the form of a p.d.f. based upon sampled images, and show that for certain types of super-resolution problems, this sample-based prior gives a signiﬁcant improvement over other common multiple-image super-resolution techniques. 1</p><p>4 0.14944445 <a title="9-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-1-norm_Support_Vector_Machines.html">1 nips-2003-1-norm Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Ji Zhu, Saharon Rosset, Robert Tibshirani, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: The standard 2-norm SVM is known for its good performance in twoclass classi£cation. In this paper, we consider the 1-norm SVM. We argue that the 1-norm SVM may have some advantage over the standard 2-norm SVM, especially when there are redundant noise features. We also propose an ef£cient algorithm that computes the whole solution path of the 1-norm SVM, hence facilitates adaptive selection of the tuning parameter for the 1-norm SVM. 1</p><p>5 0.14218105 <a title="9-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Prediction_on_Spike_Data_Using_Kernel_Algorithms.html">160 nips-2003-Prediction on Spike Data Using Kernel Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: James T. Kwok, Brian Mak, Simon Ho</p><p>Abstract: Eigenvoice speaker adaptation has been shown to be effective when only a small amount of adaptation data is available. At the heart of the method is principal component analysis (PCA) employed to ﬁnd the most important eigenvoices. In this paper, we postulate that nonlinear PCA, in particular kernel PCA, may be even more effective. One major challenge is to map the feature-space eigenvoices back to the observation space so that the state observation likelihoods can be computed during the estimation of eigenvoice weights and subsequent decoding. Our solution is to compute kernel PCA using composite kernels, and we will call our new method kernel eigenvoice speaker adaptation. On the TIDIGITS corpus, we found that compared with a speaker-independent model, our kernel eigenvoice adaptation method can reduce the word error rate by 28–33% while the standard eigenvoice approach can only match the performance of the speaker-independent model. 1</p><p>4 0.48998818 <a title="9-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Application_of_SVMs_for_Colour_Classification_and_Collision_Detection_with_AIBO_Robots.html">28 nips-2003-Application of SVMs for Colour Classification and Collision Detection with AIBO Robots</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael J. Quinlan, Stephan K. Chalup, Richard H.

We show how the method of one-class classiﬁcation with support vector machines (SVMs) can be applied to solve these tasks satisfactorily using the limited hardware capacity of the prescribed Sony AIBO quadruped robots. The experimental evaluation shows an improvement over our previous methods of ellipse ﬁtting for colour classiﬁcation and the statistical approach used for collision detection.</p><p>5 0.47593278 <a title="9-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Speech_Signals_from_Phaseless_Spectrograms.html">162 nips-2003-Probabilistic Inference of Speech Signals from Phaseless Spectrograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Kannan Achan, Sam T. Roweis, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques for complex speech processing such as denoising and deconvolution, time/frequency warping, multiple speaker separation, and multiple microphone analysis operate on sequences of short-time power spectra (spectrograms), a representation which is often well-suited to these tasks. However, a signiﬁcant problem with algorithms that manipulate spectrograms is that the output spectrogram does not include a phase component, which is needed to create a time-domain signal that has good perceptual quality. Here we describe a generative model of time-domain speech signals and their spectrograms, and show how an efﬁcient optimizer can be used to ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori speech signal, given the spectrogram. In contrast to techniques that alternate between estimating the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal, our technique directly infers the speech signal, thus jointly optimizing the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal. We compare our technique with a standard method using signal-to-noise ratios, but we also provide audio ﬁles on the web for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in perceptual quality that our technique offers. 1</p><p>6 0.47187799 <a title="9-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-1-norm_Support_Vector_Machines.html">1 nips-2003-1-norm Support Vector Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Thomas R. Strohmann, Andrei Belitski, Gregory Z. Grudic, Dennis DeCoste</p><p>Abstract: The Minimax Probability Machine Classiﬁcation (MPMC) framework [Lanckriet et al., 2002] builds classiﬁers by minimizing the maximum probability of misclassiﬁcation, and gives direct estimates of the probabilistic accuracy bound Ω. The only assumptions that MPMC makes is that good estimates of means and covariance matrices of the classes exist. However, as with Support Vector Machines, MPMC is computationally expensive and requires extensive cross validation experiments to choose kernels and kernel parameters that give good performance. In this paper we address the computational cost of MPMC by proposing an algorithm that constructs nonlinear sparse MPMC (SMPMC) models by incrementally adding basis functions (i.e. kernels) one at a time – greedily selecting the next one that maximizes the accuracy bound Ω. SMPMC automatically chooses both kernel parameters and feature weights without using computationally expensive cross validation. Therefore the SMPMC algorithm simultaneously addresses the problem of kernel selection and feature selection (i.e. feature weighting), based solely on maximizing the accuracy bound Ω. Experimental results indicate that we can obtain reliable bounds Ω, as well as test set accuracies that are comparable to state of the art classiﬁcation algorithms.</p><p>3 0.77414566 <a title="9-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Analytical_Solution_of_Spike-timing_Dependent_Plasticity_Based_on_Synaptic_Biophysics.html">27 nips-2003-Analytical Solution of Spike-timing Dependent Plasticity Based on Synaptic Biophysics</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Porr, Ausra Saudargiene, Florentin Wörgötter</p><p>Abstract: Spike timing plasticity (STDP) is a special form of synaptic plasticity where the relative timing of post- and presynaptic activity determines the change of the synaptic weight. On the postsynaptic side, active backpropagating spikes in dendrites seem to play a crucial role in the induction of spike timing dependent plasticity. We argue that postsynaptically the temporal change of the membrane potential determines the weight change. Coming from the presynaptic side induction of STDP is closely related to the activation of NMDA channels. Therefore, we will calculate analytically the change of the synaptic weight by correlating the derivative of the membrane potential with the activity of the NMDA channel. Thus, for this calculation we utilise biophysical variables of the physiological cell. The ﬁnal result shows a weight change curve which conforms with measurements from biology. The positive part of the weight change curve is determined by the NMDA activation. The negative part of the weight change curve is determined by the membrane potential change. Therefore, the weight change curve should change its shape depending on the distance from the soma of the postsynaptic cell. We ﬁnd temporally asymmetric weight change close to the soma and temporally symmetric weight change in the distal dendrite. 1</p><p>4 0.67895967 <a title="9-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time. We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>5 0.67360836 <a title="9-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Inferring_State_Sequences_for_Non-linear_Systems_with_Embedded_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">91 nips-2003-Inferring State Sequences for Non-linear Systems with Embedded Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Radford M. Neal, Matthew J. Beal, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Markov chain method for sampling from the distribution of the hidden state sequence in a non-linear dynamical system, given a sequence of observations. This method updates all states in the sequence simultaneously using an embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An update begins with the creation of “pools” of candidate states at each time. We then deﬁne an embedded HMM whose states are indexes within these pools. Using a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm, we can efﬁciently choose a state sequence with the appropriate probabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass through states in these pools. We illustrate the method in a simple one-dimensional example, and in an example showing how an embedded HMM can be used to in effect discretize the state space without any discretization error. We also compare the embedded HMM to a particle smoother on a more substantial problem of inferring human motion from 2D traces of markers. 1</p><p>6 0.66380376 <a title="9-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Eigenvoice_Speaker_Adaptation_via_Composite_Kernel_Principal_Component_Analysis.html">60 nips-2003-Eigenvoice Speaker Adaptation via Composite Kernel Principal Component Analysis</a></p>

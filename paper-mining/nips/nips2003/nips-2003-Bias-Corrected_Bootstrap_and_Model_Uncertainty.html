<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical signiﬁcance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity. 1 Introduction and related work Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density estimation, and many other important tasks. However, most clustering algorithms require the user to specify the number of clusters (called k), and it is not always clear what is the best value for k. Figure 1 shows examples where k has been improperly chosen. Choosing k is often an ad hoc decision based on prior knowledge, assumptions, and practical experience. Choosing k is made more difﬁcult when the data has many dimensions, even when clusters are well-separated. Center-based clustering algorithms (in particular k-means and Gaussian expectationmaximization) usually assume that each cluster adheres to a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian. With these methods, only one center should be used to model each subset of data that follows a unimodal distribution. If multiple centers are used to describe data drawn from one mode, the centers are a needlessly complex description of the data, and in fact the multiple centers capture the truth about the subset less well than one center. In this paper we present a simple algorithm called G-means that discovers an appropriate k using a statistical test for deciding whether to split a k-means center into two centers. We describe examples and present experimental results that show that the new algorithm 0.9 4 0.8 3 0.7 2 0.6 1 0.5 0 0.4 −1 0.3 −2 −3 0.2 0.1 −0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: Two clusterings where k was improperly chosen. Dark crosses are k-means centers. On the left, there are too few centers; ﬁve should be used. On the right, too many centers are used; one center is sufﬁcient for representing the data. In general, one center should be used to represent one Gaussian cluster. is successful. This technique is useful and applicable for many clustering algorithms other than k-means, but here we consider only the k-means algorithm for simplicity. Several algorithms have been proposed previously to determine k automatically. Like our method, most previous methods are wrappers around k-means or some other clustering algorithm for ﬁxed k. Wrapper methods use splitting and/or merging rules for centers to increase or decrease k as the algorithm proceeds. Pelleg and Moore [14] proposed a regularization framework for learning k, which they call X-means. The algorithm searches over many values of k and scores each clustering model using the so-called Bayesian Information Criterion [10]: BIC(C|X) = L(X|C) − p log n 2 where L(X|C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C, p = k(d + 1) is the number of parameters in the model C with dimensionality d and k cluster centers, and n is the number of points in the dataset. X-means chooses the model with the best BIC score on the data. Aside from the BIC, other scoring functions are also available. Bischof et al. [1] use a minimum description length (MDL) framework, where the description length is a measure of how well the data are ﬁt by the model. Their algorithm starts with a large value for k and removes centers (reduces k) whenever that choice reduces the description length. Between steps of reducing k, they use the k-means algorithm to optimize the model ﬁt to the data. With hierarchical clustering algorithms, other methods may be employed to determine the best number of clusters. One is to build a merging tree (“dendrogram”) of the data based on a cluster distance metric, and search for areas of the tree that are stable with respect to inter- and intra-cluster distances [9, Section 5.1]. This method of estimating k is best applied with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and human intuition. 2 The Gaussian-means (G-means) algorithm The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to reﬁne the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each center. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center. However, if the same data do not appear Algorithm 1 G-means(X, α) 1: Let C be the initial set of centers (usually C ← {¯}). x 2: C ← kmeans(C, X). 3: Let {xi |class(xi ) = j} be the set of datapoints assigned to center cj . 4: Use a statistical test to detect if each {xi |class(xi ) = j} follow a Gaussian distribution (at conﬁdence level α). 5: If the data look Gaussian, keep cj . Otherwise replace cj with two centers. 6: Repeat from step 2 until no more centers are added. to be Gaussian, then we want to use multiple centers to model the data properly. The algorithm will run k-means multiple times (up to k times when ﬁnding k centers), so the time complexity is at most O(k) times that of k-means. The k-means algorithm implicitly assumes that the datapoints in each cluster are spherically distributed around the center. Less restrictively, the Gaussian expectation-maximization algorithm assumes that the datapoints in each cluster have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that may or may not be ﬁxed, or shared. The Gaussian distribution test that we present below are valid for either covariance matrix assumption. The test also accounts for the number of datapoints n tested by incorporating n in the calculation of the critical value of the test (see Equation 2). This prevents the G-means algorithm from making bad decisions about clusters with few datapoints. 2.1 Testing clusters for Gaussian ﬁt To specify the G-means algorithm fully we need a test to detect whether the data assigned to a center are sampled from a Gaussian. The alternative hypotheses are • H0 : The data around the center are sampled from a Gaussian. • H1 : The data around the center are not sampled from a Gaussian. If we accept the null hypothesis H0 , then we believe that the one center is sufﬁcient to model its data, and we should not split the cluster into two sub-clusters. If we reject H0 and accept H1 , then we want to split the cluster. The test we use is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic. This one-dimensional test has been shown empirically to be the most powerful normality test that is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). Given a list of values xi that have been converted to mean 0 and variance 1, let x(i) be the ith ordered value. Let zi = F (x(i) ), where F is the N (0, 1) cumulative distribution function. Then the statistic is A2 (Z) = − 1 n n (2i − 1) [log(zi ) + log(1 − zn+1−i )] − n (1) i=1 Stephens [17] showed that for the case where µ and σ are estimated from the data (as in clustering), we must correct the statistic according to A2 (Z) ∗ = A2 (Z)(1 + 4/n − 25/(n2 )) (2) Given a subset of data X in d dimensions that belongs to center c, the hypothesis test proceeds as follows: 1. Choose a signiﬁcance level α for the test. 2. Initialize two centers, called “children” of c. See the text for good ways to do this. 3. Run k-means on these two centers in X. This can be run to completion, or to some early stopping point if desired. Let c1 , c2 be the child centers chosen by k-means. 4. Let v = c1 − c2 be a d-dimensional vector that connects the two centers. This is the direction that k-means believes to be important for clustering. Then project X onto v: xi = xi , v /||v||2 . X is a 1-dimensional representation of the data projected onto v. Transform X so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. 5. Let zi = F (x(i) ). If A2 (Z) is in the range of non-critical values at conﬁdence ∗ level α, then accept H0 , keep the original center, and discard {c1 , c2 }. Otherwise, reject H0 and keep {c1 , c2 } in place of the original center. A primary contribution of this work is simplifying the test for Gaussian ﬁt by projecting the data to one dimension where the test is simple to apply. The authors of [5] also use this approach for online dimensionality reduction during clustering. The one-dimensional representation of the data allows us to consider only the data along the direction that kmeans has found to be important for separating the data. This is related to the problem of projection pursuit [7], where here k-means searches for a direction in which the data appears non-Gaussian. We must choose the signiﬁcance level of the test, α, which is the desired probability of making a Type I error (i.e. incorrectly rejecting H0 ). It is appropriate to use a Bonferroni adjustment to reduce the chance of making Type I errors over multiple tests. For example, if we want a 0.01 chance of making a Type I error in 100 tests, we should apply a Bonferroni adjustment to make each test use α = 0.01/100 = 0.0001. To ﬁnd k ﬁnal centers the G-means algorithm makes k statistical tests, so the Bonferroni correction does not need to be extreme. In our tests, we always use α = 0.0001. We consider two ways to initialize the two child centers. Both approaches initialize with c ± m, where c is a center and m is chosen. The ﬁrst method chooses m as a random d-dimensional vector such that ||m|| is small compared to the distortion of the data. A second method ﬁnds the main principal component s of the data (having eigenvalue λ), and chooses m = s 2λ/π. This deterministic method places the two centers in their expected locations under H0 . The principal component calculations require O(nd2 + d3 ) time and O(d2 ) space, but since we only want the main principal component, we can use fast methods like the power method, which takes time that is at most linear in the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues [4]. In this paper we use principal-component-based splitting. 2.2 An example Figure 2 shows a run of the G-means algorithm on a synthetic dataset with two true clusters and 1000 points, using α = 0.0001. The critical value for the Anderson-Darling test is 1.8692 for this conﬁdence level. Starting with one center, after one iteration of G-means, we have 2 centers and the A2 statistic is 38.103. This is much larger than the critical value, ∗ so we reject H0 and accept this split. On the next iteration, we split each new center and repeat the statistical test. The A2 values for the two splits are 0.386 and 0.496, both of ∗ which are well below the critical value. Therefore we accept H0 for both tests, and discard these splits. Thus G-means gives a ﬁnal answer of k = 2. 2.3 Statistical power Figure 3 shows the power of the Anderson-Darling test, as compared to the BIC. Lower is better for both plots. We run 1000 tests for each data point plotted for both plots.

Starting with one center (left plot), G-means splits into two centers (middle). The test for normality is signiﬁcant, so G-means rejects H0 and keeps the split. After splitting each center again (right), the test values are not signiﬁcant, so G-means accepts H0 for both tests and does not accept these splits. The middle plot is the G-means answer. See the text for further details. 1 1 G-means X-means 0.8 P(Type II error) P(Type I error) 0.8 G-means X-means 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 Figure 3: A comparison of the power of the Anderson-Darling test versus the BIC. For the AD test we ﬁx the signiﬁcance level (α = 0.0001), while the BIC’s signiﬁcance level depends on n. The left plot shows the probability of incorrectly splitting (Type I error) one true 2-d cluster that is 5% elliptical. The right plot shows the probability of incorrectly not splitting two true clusters separated by 5σ (Type II error). Both plots are functions of n. Both plots show that the BIC overﬁts (splits clusters) when n is small. plot, for each test we generate n datapoints from a single true Gaussian distribution, and then plot the frequency with which BIC and G-means will choose k = 2 rather than k = 1 (i.e. commit a Type I error). BIC tends to overﬁt by choosing too many centers when the data is not strictly spherical, while G-means does not. This is consistent with the tests of real-world data in the next section. While G-means commits more Type II errors when n is small, this prevents it from overﬁtting the data. The BIC can be considered a likelihood ratio test, but with a signiﬁcance level that cannot be ﬁxed. The signiﬁcance level instead varies depending on n and ∆k (the change in the number of model parameters between two models). As n or ∆k decrease, the signiﬁcance level increases (the BIC becomes weaker as a statistical test) [10]. Figure 3 shows this effect for varying n. In [11] the authors show that penalty-based methods require problemspeciﬁc tuning and don’t generalize as well as other methods, such as cross validation. 3 Experiments Table 1 shows the results from running G-means and X-means on many large synthetic. On synthetic datasets with spherically distributed clusters, G-means and X-means do equally Table 1: Results for many synthetic datasets. We report distortion relative to the optimum distortion for the correct clustering (closer to one is better), and time is reported relative to k-means run with the correct k. For BIC, larger values are better, but it is clear that ﬁnding the correct clustering does not always coincide with ﬁnding a larger BIC. Items with a star are where X-means always chose the largest number of centers we allowed. dataset synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 d 2 k found 9.1± 9.9 18.1± 3.2 20.1± 0.6 70.5±11.6 80.0± 0.2 171.7±23.7 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.1 *80.0± 0.0 80.2± 0.5 229.2±36.8 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.0 *80.0± 0.0 80.0± 0.0 171.5±10.9 method G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means 2 2 8 8 8 32 32 32 BIC(×104 ) -0.19±2.70 0.70±0.93 0.21±0.18 14.83±3.50 1.84±0.12 40.16±6.59 -0.74±0.16 -2.28±0.20 -0.18±0.17 14.36±0.21 1.45±0.20 52.28±9.26 -3.36±0.21 -27.92±0.22 -2.73±0.22 -11.13±0.23 -1.10±0.16 11.78±2.74 distortion(× optimal) 0.89± 0.23 0.37± 0.12 0.99± 0.01 9.45±28.02 1.00± 0.01 48.49±70.04 1.00± 0.00 0.47± 0.03 0.99± 0.00 0.47± 0.01 0.99± 0.00 0.57± 0.06 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.00 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.01 1.00± 0.00 0.84± 0.01 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 time(× k-means) 13.2 2.8 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.8 4.6 11.0 2.6 4.0 2.9 6.5 4.4 29.9 2.3 21.2 2.8 53.3 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Figure 4: 2-d synthetic dataset with 5 true clusters. On the left, G-means correctly chooses 5 centers and deals well with non-spherical data. On the right, the BIC causes X-means to overﬁt the data, choosing 20 unevenly distributed clusters. well at ﬁnding the correct k and maximizing the BIC statistic, so we don’t show these results here. Most real-world data is not spherical, however. The synthetic datasets used here each have 5000 datapoints in d = 2/8/32 dimensions. The true ks are 5, 20, and 80. For each synthetic dataset type, we generate 30 datasets with the true center means chosen uniformly randomly from the unit hypercube, and choosing σ so that no two clusters are closer than 3σ apart. Each cluster is also given a transformation to make it non-spherical, by multiplying the data by a randomly chosen scaling and rotation matrix. We run G-means starting with one center. We allow X-means to search between 2 and 4k centers (where here k is the true number of clusters). The G-means algorithm clearly does better at ﬁnding the correct k on non-spherical data. Its results are closer to the true distortions and the correct ks. The BIC statistic that X-means uses has been formulated to maximize the likelihood for spherically-distributed data. Thus it overestimates the number of true clusters in non-spherical data. This is especially evident when the number of points per cluster is small, as in datasets with 80 true clusters. 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Digit 0 1 Digit 0 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Cluster 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cluster Figure 5: NIST and Pendigits datasets: correspondence between each digit (row) and each cluster (column) found by G-means. G-means did not have the labels, yet it found meaningful clusters corresponding with the labels. Because of this overestimation, X-means often hits our limit of 4k centers. Figure 4 shows an example of overﬁtting on a dataset with 5 true clusters. X-means chooses k = 20 while G-means ﬁnds all 5 true cluster centers. Also of note is that X-means does not distribute centers evenly among clusters; some clusters receive one center, but others receive many. G-means runs faster than X-means for 8 and 32 dimensions, which we expect, since the kd-tree structures which make X-means fast in low dimensions take time exponential in d, making them slow for more than 8 to 12 dimensions. All our code is written in Matlab; X-means is written in C. 3.1 Discovering true clusters in labeled data We tested these algorithms on two real-world datasets for handwritten digit recognition: the NIST dataset [12] and the Pendigits dataset [2]. The goal is to cluster the data without knowledge of the labels and measure how well the clustering captures the true labels. Both datasets have 10 true classes (digits 0-9). NIST has 60000 training examples and 784 dimensions (28×28 pixels). We use 6000 randomly chosen examples and we reduce the dimension to 50 by random projection (following [3]). The Pendigits dataset has 7984 examples and 16 dimensions; we did not change the data in any way. We cluster each dataset with G-means and X-means, and measure performance by comparing the cluster labels Lc with the true labels Lt . We deﬁne the partition quality (PQ) as kt kc kt 2 2 pq = i=1 j=1 p(i, j) i=1 p(i) where kt is the true number of classes, and kc is the number of clusters found by the algorithm. This metric is maximized when Lc induces the same partition of the data as Lt ; in other words, when all points in each cluster have the same true label, and the estimated k is the true k. The p(i, j) term is the frequency-based probability that a datapoint will be labeled i by Lt and j by Lc . This quality is normalized by the sum of true probabilities, squared. This statistic is related to the Rand statistic for comparing partitions [8]. For the NIST dataset, G-means ﬁnds 31 clusters in 30 seconds with a PQ score of 0.177. X-means ﬁnds 715 clusters in 4149 seconds, and 369 of these clusters contain only one point, indicating an overestimation problem with the BIC. X-means receives a PQ score of 0.024. For the Pendigits dataset, G-means ﬁnds 69 clusters in 30 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.196; X-means ﬁnds 235 clusters in 287 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.057. Figure 5 shows Hinton diagrams of the G-means clusterings of both datasets, showing that G-means succeeds at identifying the true clusters concisely, without aid of the labels. The confusions between different digits in the NIST dataset (seen in the off-diagonal elements) are common for other researchers using more sophisticated techniques, see [3]. 4 Discussion and conclusions We have introduced the new G-means algorithm for learning k based on a statistical test for determining whether datapoints are a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary dimension and covariance matrix. The splitting uses dimension reduction and a powerful test for Gaussian ﬁtness. G-means uses this statistical test as a wrapper around k-means to discover the number of clusters automatically. The only parameter supplied to the algorithm is the signiﬁcance level of the statistical test, which can easily be set in a standard way. The G-means algorithm takes linear time and space (plus the cost of the splitting heuristic and test) in the number of datapoints and dimension, since k-means is itself linear in time and space. Empirically, the G-means algorithm works well at ﬁnding the correct number of clusters and the locations of genuine cluster centers, and we have shown it works well in moderately high dimensions. Clustering in high dimensions has been an open problem for many years. Recent research has shown that it may be preferable to use dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering, and then use a low-dimensional clustering algorithm such as k-means, rather than clustering in the high dimension directly. In [3] the author shows that using a simple, inexpensive linear projection preserves many of the properties of data (such as cluster distances), while making it easier to ﬁnd the clusters. Thus there is a need for good-quality, fast clustering algorithms for low-dimensional data. Our work is a step in this direction. Additionally, recent image segmentation algorithms such as normalized cut [16, 13] are based on eigenvector computations on distance matrices. These “spectral” clustering algorithms still use k-means as a post-processing step to ﬁnd the actual segmentation and they require k to be speciﬁed. Thus we expect G-means will be useful in combination with spectral clustering. References [1] Horst Bischof, Aleˇ Leonardis, and Alexander Selb. MDL principle for robust vector quantisation.

<p>Author: Harald Steck, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: The bootstrap has become a popular method for exploring model (structure) uncertainty. Our experiments with artiﬁcial and realworld data demonstrate that the graphs learned from bootstrap samples can be severely biased towards too complex graphical models. Accounting for this bias is hence essential, e.g., when exploring model uncertainty. We ﬁnd that this bias is intimately tied to (well-known) spurious dependences induced by the bootstrap. The leading-order bias-correction equals one half of Akaike’s penalty for model complexity. We demonstrate the eﬀect of this simple bias-correction in our experiments. We also relate this bias to the bias of the plug-in estimator for entropy, as well as to the diﬀerence between the expected test and training errors of a graphical model, which asymptotically equals Akaike’s penalty (rather than one half). 1</p><p>2 0.79924446 <a title="40-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Analytical_Bootstrap_Averages_for_Support_Vector_Classifiers.html">31 nips-2003-Approximate Analytical Bootstrap Averages for Support Vector Classifiers</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: Rao–Blackwellization is an approximation technique for probabilistic inference that ﬂexibly combines exact inference with sampling. It is useful in models where conditioning on some of the variables leaves a simpler inference problem that can be solved tractably. This paper presents Sample Propagation, an efﬁcient implementation of Rao–Blackwellized approximate inference for a large class of models. Sample Propagation tightly integrates sampling with message passing in a junction tree, and is named for its simple, appealing structure: it walks the clusters of a junction tree, sampling some of the current cluster’s variables and then passing a message to one of its neighbors. We discuss the application of Sample Propagation to conditional Gaussian inference problems such as switching linear dynamical systems. 1</p><p>same-paper 2 0.66894084 <a title="40-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Bias-Corrected_Bootstrap_and_Model_Uncertainty.html">40 nips-2003-Bias-Corrected Bootstrap and Model Uncertainty</a></p>

<p>Author: Michael I. Jordan, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We present a new method for calculating approximate marginals for probability distributions deﬁned by graphs with cycles, based on a Gaussian entropy bound combined with a semideﬁnite outer bound on the marginal polytope. This combination leads to a log-determinant maximization problem that can be solved by efﬁcient interior point methods [8]. As with the Bethe approximation and its generalizations [12], the optimizing arguments of this problem can be taken as approximations to the exact marginals. In contrast to Bethe/Kikuchi approaches, our variational problem is strictly convex and so has a unique global optimum. An additional desirable feature is that the value of the optimal solution is guaranteed to provide an upper bound on the log partition function. In experimental trials, the performance of the log-determinant relaxation is comparable to or better than the sum-product algorithm, and by a substantial margin for certain problem classes. Finally, the zero-temperature limit of our log-determinant relaxation recovers a class of well-known semideﬁnite relaxations for integer programming [e.g., 3]. 1</p><p>4 0.56637806 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Non-linear_CCA_and_PCA_by_Alignment_of_Local_Models.html">138 nips-2003-Non-linear CCA and PCA by Alignment of Local Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Jakob J. Verbeek, Sam T. Roweis, Nikos A. Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method which works by coordinating or aligning mixtures of linear models. In the same way that CCA extends the idea of PCA, our work extends recent methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction to the case where multiple embeddings of the same underlying low dimensional coordinates are observed, each lying on a different high dimensional manifold. We also show that a special case of our method, when applied to only a single manifold, reduces to the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. As with previous alignment schemes, once the mixture models have been estimated, all of the parameters of our model can be estimated in closed form without local optima in the learning. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the approach as a non-linear extension of CCA. 1</p><p>5 0.48415947 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Generalised_Propagation_for_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_with_Partial_or_Missing_Data.html">80 nips-2003-Generalised Propagation for Fast Fourier Transforms with Partial or Missing Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms and other related Fourier methods have been practically implementable due to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this paper it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coeﬃcients. Furthermore eﬃcient generalised belief propagation methods between clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coeﬃcients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal. 1</p><p>6 0.48381913 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon, Robert Givan</p><p>Abstract: We explore approximate policy iteration, replacing the usual costfunction learning step with a learning step in policy space. We give policy-language biases that enable solution of very large relational Markov decision processes (MDPs) that no previous technique can solve. In particular, we induce high-quality domain-speciﬁc planners for classical planning domains (both deterministic and stochastic variants) by solving such domains as extremely large MDPs. 1</p><p>3 0.13542528 <a title="116-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time. We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>4 0.13485621 <a title="116-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Robustness_in_Markov_Decision_Problems_with_Uncertain_Transition_Matrices.html">167 nips-2003-Robustness in Markov Decision Problems with Uncertain Transition Matrices</a></p>
<p>Author: Arnab Nilim, Laurent El Ghaoui</p><p>Abstract: Optimal solutions to Markov Decision Problems (MDPs) are very sensitive with respect to the state transition probabilities. In many practical problems, the estimation of those probabilities is far from accurate. Hence, estimation errors are limiting factors in applying MDPs to realworld problems. We propose an algorithm for solving ﬁnite-state and ﬁnite-action MDPs, where the solution is guaranteed to be robust with respect to estimation errors on the state transition probabilities. Our algorithm involves a statistically accurate yet numerically efﬁcient representation of uncertainty, via Kullback-Leibler divergence bounds. The worst-case complexity of the robust algorithm is the same as the original Bellman recursion. Hence, robustness can be added at practically no extra computing cost.</p><p>5 0.12532367 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Policy_Search_by_Dynamic_Programming.html">158 nips-2003-Policy Search by Dynamic Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Natalia H. Gardiol, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: A mobile robot acting in the world is faced with a large amount of sensory data and uncertainty in its action outcomes. Indeed, almost all interesting sequential decision-making domains involve large state spaces and large, stochastic action sets. We investigate a way to act intelligently as quickly as possible in domains where ﬁnding a complete policy would take a hopelessly long time. This approach, Relational Envelopebased Planning (REBP) tackles large, noisy problems along two axes. First, describing a domain as a relational MDP (instead of as an atomic or propositionally-factored MDP) allows problem structure and dynamics to be captured compactly with a small set of probabilistic, relational rules. Second, an envelope-based approach to planning lets an agent begin acting quickly within a restricted part of the full state space and to judiciously expand its envelope as resources permit. 1</p><p>6 0.70701414 <a title="116-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Autonomous_Helicopter_Flight_via_Reinforcement_Learning.html">38 nips-2003-Autonomous Helicopter Flight via Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: William M. Campbell, Joseph P. Campbell, Douglas A. Reynolds, Douglas A. Jones, Timothy R. Leek</p><p>Abstract: A recent area of signiﬁcant progress in speaker recognition is the use of high level features—idiolect, phonetic relations, prosody, discourse structure, etc. A speaker not only has a distinctive acoustic sound but uses language in a characteristic manner. Large corpora of speech data available in recent years allow experimentation with long term statistics of phone patterns, word patterns, etc. of an individual. We propose the use of support vector machines and term frequency analysis of phone sequences to model a given speaker. To this end, we explore techniques for text categorization applied to the problem. We derive a new kernel based upon a linearization of likelihood ratio scoring. We introduce a new phone-based SVM speaker recognition approach that halves the error rate of conventional phone-based approaches.</p><p>2 0.85849893 <a title="116-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Kernels_for_Structured_Natural_Language_Data.html">99 nips-2003-Kernels for Structured Natural Language Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Jun Suzuki, Yutaka Sasaki, Eisaku Maeda</p><p>Abstract: This paper devises a novel kernel function for structured natural language data. In the ﬁeld of Natural Language Processing, feature extraction consists of the following two steps: (1) syntactically and semantically analyzing raw data, i.e., character strings, then representing the results as discrete structures, such as parse trees and dependency graphs with part-of-speech tags; (2) creating (possibly high-dimensional) numerical feature vectors from the discrete structures. The new kernels, called Hierarchical Directed Acyclic Graph (HDAG) kernels, directly accept DAGs whose nodes can contain DAGs. HDAG data structures are needed to fully reﬂect the syntactic and semantic structures that natural language data inherently have. In this paper, we deﬁne the kernel function and show how it permits efﬁcient calculation. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed kernels are superior to existing kernel functions, e.g., sequence kernels, tree kernels, and bag-of-words kernels. 1</p><p>3 0.7292338 <a title="116-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Response_for_Approximate_Inference.html">117 nips-2003-Linear Response for Approximate Inference</a></p>

The ﬁrst algorithm is a propagation algorithm which is shown to converge if belief propagation converges to a stable ﬁxed point. The second algorithm is based on matrix inversion.

<p>Author: Justin Werfel, Xiaohui Xie, H. S. Seung</p><p>Abstract: Gradient-following learning methods can encounter problems of implementation in many applications, and stochastic variants are frequently used to overcome these difﬁculties. We derive quantitative learning curves for three online training methods used with a linear perceptron: direct gradient descent, node perturbation, and weight perturbation. The maximum learning rate for the stochastic methods scales inversely with the ﬁrst power of the dimensionality of the noise injected into the system; with sufﬁciently small learning rate, all three methods give identical learning curves. These results suggest guidelines for when these stochastic methods will be limited in their utility, and considerations for architectures in which they will be effective. 1</p><p>6 0.49376225 <a title="116-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Unsupervised_Context_Sensitive_Language_Acquisition_from_a_Large_Corpus.html">191 nips-2003-Unsupervised Context Sensitive Language Acquisition from a Large Corpus</a></p>

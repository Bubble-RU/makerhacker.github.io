<p>Author: David Ferguson, Aaron Morris, Dirk Hähnel, Christopher Baker, Zachary Omohundro, Carlos Reverte, Scott Thayer, Charles Whittaker, William Whittaker, Wolfram Burgard, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: We present the software architecture of a robotic system for mapping abandoned mines. The software is capable of acquiring consistent 2D maps of large mines with many cycles, represented as Markov random £elds. 3D C-space maps are acquired from local 3D range scans, which are used to identify navigable paths using A* search. Our system has been deployed in three abandoned mines, two of which inaccessible to people, where it has acquired maps of unprecedented detail and accuracy. 1</p><p>3 0.19280902 <a title="36-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Planning_in_POMDPs_with_Macro-Actions.html">33 nips-2003-Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Macro-Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Theocharous, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that useful POMDP solutions do not require consideration of the entire belief space. We extend this idea with the notion of temporal abstraction. We present and explore a new reinforcement learning algorithm over grid-points in belief space, which uses macro-actions and Monte Carlo updates of the Q-values. We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>4 0.19191781 <a title="36-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-ARA%2A%3A_Anytime_A%2A_with_Provable_Bounds_on_Sub-Optimality.html">2 nips-2003-ARA*: Anytime A* with Provable Bounds on Sub-Optimality</a></p>
<p>Author: Maxim Likhachev, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: In real world planning problems, time for deliberation is often limited. Anytime planners are well suited for these problems: they ﬁnd a feasible solution quickly and then continually work on improving it until time runs out. In this paper we propose an anytime heuristic search, ARA*, which tunes its performance bound based on available search time. It starts by ﬁnding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound, then tightens the bound progressively as time allows. Given enough time it ﬁnds a provably optimal solution. While improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts and, as a result, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than other anytime search methods. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the practical utility of ARA* with experiments on a simulated robot kinematic arm and a dynamic path planning problem for an outdoor rover. 1</p><p>5 0.15891604 <a title="36-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Envelope-based_Planning_in_Relational_MDPs.html">62 nips-2003-Envelope-based Planning in Relational MDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Natalia H. Gardiol, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: A mobile robot acting in the world is faced with a large amount of sensory data and uncertainty in its action outcomes. Indeed, almost all interesting sequential decision-making domains involve large state spaces and large, stochastic action sets. We investigate a way to act intelligently as quickly as possible in domains where ﬁnding a complete policy would take a hopelessly long time. This approach, Relational Envelopebased Planning (REBP) tackles large, noisy problems along two axes. First, describing a domain as a relational MDP (instead of as an atomic or propositionally-factored MDP) allows problem structure and dynamics to be captured compactly with a small set of probabilistic, relational rules. Second, an envelope-based approach to planning lets an agent begin acting quickly within a restricted part of the full state space and to judiciously expand its envelope as resources permit. 1</p><p>6 0.14989485 <a title="36-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Entrainment_of_Silicon_Central_Pattern_Generators_for_Legged_Locomotory_Control.html">61 nips-2003-Entrainment of Silicon Central Pattern Generators for Legged Locomotory Control</a></p>

<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E.

We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>3 0.40279776 <a title="36-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Policy_Iteration_with_a_Policy_Language_Bias.html">34 nips-2003-Approximate Policy Iteration with a Policy Language Bias</a></p>

We give policy-language biases that enable solution of very large relational Markov decision processes (MDPs) that no previous technique can solve. In particular, we induce high-quality domain-speciﬁc planners for classical planning domains (both deterministic and stochastic variants) by solving such domains as extremely large MDPs. 1</p><p>4 0.4013381 <a title="36-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Program_Approximations_for_Factored_Continuous-State_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">116 nips-2003-Linear Program Approximations for Factored Continuous-State Markov Decision Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Milos Hauskrecht, Branislav Kveton</p><p>Abstract: Approximate linear programming (ALP) has emerged recently as one of the most promising methods for solving complex factored MDPs with ﬁnite state spaces. In this work we show that ALP solutions are not limited only to MDPs with ﬁnite state spaces, but that they can also be applied successfully to factored continuous-state MDPs (CMDPs). We show how one can build an ALP-based approximation for such a model and contrast it to existing solution methods. We argue that this approach offers a robust alternative for solving high dimensional continuous-state space problems. The point is supported by experiments on three CMDP problems with 24-25 continuous state factors. 1</p><p>5 0.39786386 <a title="36-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Sequential_Bayesian_Kernel_Regression.html">176 nips-2003-Sequential Bayesian Kernel Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Jaco Vermaak, Simon J. Godsill, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for sequential Bayesian kernel regression. As is the case for the popular Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [10, 11], the method automatically identiﬁes the number and locations of the kernels. Our algorithm overcomes some of the computational difﬁculties related to batch methods for kernel regression. It is non-iterative, and requires only a single pass over the data. It is thus applicable to truly sequential data sets and batch data sets alike. The algorithm is based on a generalisation of Importance Sampling, which allows the design of intuitively simple and efﬁcient proposal distributions for the model parameters. Comparative results on two standard data sets show our algorithm to compare favourably with existing batch estimation strategies.</p><p>6 0.39663932 <a title="36-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Towards_Social_Robots%3A_Automatic_Evaluation_of_Human-Robot_Interaction_by_Facial_Expression_Classification.html">186 nips-2003-Towards Social Robots: Automatic Evaluation of Human-Robot Interaction by Facial Expression Classification</a></p>

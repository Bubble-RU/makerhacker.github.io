<p>Author: Joelle Pineau, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: Recent developments in grid-based and point-based approximation algorithms for POMDPs have greatly improved the tractability of POMDP planning. These approaches operate on sets of belief points by individually learning a value function for each point. In reality, belief points exist in a highly-structured metric simplex, but current POMDP algorithms do not exploit this property. This paper presents a new metric-tree algorithm which can be used in the context of POMDP planning to sort belief points spatially, and then perform fast value function updates over groups of points. We present results showing that this approach can reduce computation in point-based POMDP algorithms for a wide range of problems. 1</p><p>3 0.13201556 <a title="136-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Ranking_on_Data_Manifolds.html">164 nips-2003-Ranking on Data Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Jason Weston, Arthur Gretton, Olivier Bousquet, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The Google search engine has enjoyed huge success with its web page ranking algorithm, which exploits global, rather than local, hyperlink structure of the web using random walks. Here we propose a simple universal ranking algorithm for data lying in the Euclidean space, such as text or image data. The core idea of our method is to rank the data with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure collectively revealed by a great amount of data. Encouraging experimental results from synthetic, image, and text data illustrate the validity of our method. 1</p><p>4 0.11130354 <a title="136-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Concentration_of_Expectation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Layered_Networks.html">142 nips-2003-On the Concentration of Expectation and Approximate Inference in Layered Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper reports on a family of computationally practical classiﬁers that converge to the Bayes error at near-minimax optimal rates for a variety of distributions. The classiﬁers are based on dyadic classiﬁcation trees (DCTs), which involve adaptively pruned partitions of the feature space. A key aspect of DCTs is their spatial adaptivity, which enables local (rather than global) ﬁtting of the decision boundary. Our risk analysis involves a spatial decomposition of the usual concentration inequalities, leading to a spatially adaptive, data-dependent pruning criterion. For any distribution on (X, Y ) whose Bayes decision boundary behaves locally like a Lipschitz smooth function, we show that the DCT error converges to the Bayes error at a rate within a logarithmic factor of the minimax optimal rate. We also study DCTs equipped with polynomial classiﬁcation rules at each leaf, and show that as the smoothness of the boundary increases their errors converge to the Bayes error at a rate approaching n−1/2 , the parametric rate. We are not aware of any other practical classiﬁers that provide similar rate of convergence guarantees. Fast algorithms for tree pruning are discussed. 1</p><p>3 0.60616285 <a title="136-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Training_a_Quantum_Neural_Network.html">187 nips-2003-Training a Quantum Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Bob Ricks, Dan Ventura</p><p>Abstract: Most proposals for quantum neural networks have skipped over the problem of how to train the networks. The mechanics of quantum computing are different enough from classical computing that the issue of training should be treated in detail. We propose a simple quantum neural network and a training method for it. It can be shown that this algorithm works in quantum systems. Results on several real-world data sets show that this algorithm can train the proposed quantum neural networks, and that it has some advantages over classical learning algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.57062697 <a title="136-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-An_Iterative_Improvement_Procedure_for_Hierarchical_Clustering.html">24 nips-2003-An Iterative Improvement Procedure for Hierarchical Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Xavier Carreras, Lluís Màrquez</p><p>Abstract: This work presents an architecture based on perceptrons to recognize phrase structures, and an online learning algorithm to train the perceptrons together and dependently. The recognition strategy applies learning in two layers: a ﬁltering layer, which reduces the search space by identifying plausible phrase candidates, and a ranking layer, which recursively builds the optimal phrase structure. We provide a recognition-based feedback rule which reﬂects to each local function its committed errors from a global point of view, and allows to train them together online as perceptrons. Experimentation on a syntactic parsing problem, the recognition of clause hierarchies, improves state-of-the-art results and evinces the advantages of our global training method over optimizing each function locally and independently. 1</p><p>3 0.76855338 <a title="136-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Max-Margin_Markov_Networks.html">124 nips-2003-Max-Margin Markov Networks</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Taskar, Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: In typical classiﬁcation tasks, we seek a function which assigns a label to a single object. Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of conﬁdence of the classiﬁer, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3 ) networks incorporate both kernels, which efﬁciently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classiﬁcation demonstrate very signiﬁcant gains over previous approaches. 1</p><p>4 0.70845252 <a title="136-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Models_for_Visualisation_of_High_Dimensional_Data.html">77 nips-2003-Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models for Visualisation of High Dimensional Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new underlying probabilistic model for principal component analysis (PCA). Our formulation interprets PCA as a particular Gaussian process prior on a mapping from a latent space to the observed data-space. We show that if the prior’s covariance function constrains the mappings to be linear the model is equivalent to PCA, we then extend the model by considering less restrictive covariance functions which allow non-linear mappings. This more general Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) is then evaluated as an approach to the visualisation of high dimensional data for three different data-sets. Additionally our non-linear algorithm can be further kernelised leading to ‘twin kernel PCA’ in which a mapping between feature spaces occurs.</p><p>5 0.59755021 <a title="136-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Trees.html">172 nips-2003-Semi-Supervised Learning with Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Charles Kemp, Thomas L. Griffiths, Sean Stromsten, Joshua B. Tenenbaum</p><p>Abstract: We describe a nonparametric Bayesian approach to generalizing from few labeled examples, guided by a larger set of unlabeled objects and the assumption of a latent tree-structure to the domain. The tree (or a distribution over trees) may be inferred using the unlabeled data. A prior over concepts generated by a mutation process on the inferred tree(s) allows efﬁcient computation of the optimal Bayesian classiﬁcation function from the labeled examples. We test our approach on eight real-world datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.52608764 <a title="136-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Link_Prediction_in_Relational_Data.html">118 nips-2003-Link Prediction in Relational Data</a></p>

<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich, Andriy Kharechko, John S. Shawe-taylor</p><p>Abstract: We present a modiﬁed version of the perceptron learning algorithm (PLA) which solves semideﬁnite programs (SDPs) in polynomial time. The algorithm is based on the following three observations: (i) Semideﬁnite programs are linear programs with inﬁnitely many (linear) constraints; (ii) every linear program can be solved by a sequence of constraint satisfaction problems with linear constraints; (iii) in general, the perceptron learning algorithm solves a constraint satisfaction problem with linear constraints in ﬁnitely many updates. Combining the PLA with a probabilistic rescaling algorithm (which, on average, increases the size of the feasable region) results in a probabilistic algorithm for solving SDPs that runs in polynomial time. We present preliminary results which demonstrate that the algorithm works, but is not competitive with state-of-the-art interior point methods. 1</p><p>3 0.13976926 <a title="174-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Expectation_Maximization.html">32 nips-2003-Approximate Expectation Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Tom Heskes, Onno Zoeter, Wim Wiegerinck</p><p>Abstract: We discuss the integration of the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for maximum likelihood learning of Bayesian networks with belief propagation algorithms for approximate inference. Specifically we propose to combine the outer-loop step of convergent belief propagation algorithms with the M-step of the EM algorithm. This then yields an approximate EM algorithm that is essentially still double loop, with the important advantage of an inner loop that is guaranteed to converge. Simulations illustrate the merits of such an approach. 1</p><p>4 0.13730796 <a title="174-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Invariant_Pattern_Recognition_by_Semi-Definite_Programming_Machines.html">96 nips-2003-Invariant Pattern Recognition by Semi-Definite Programming Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge about local invariances with respect to given pattern transformations can greatly improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation. Previous approaches are either based on regularisation or on the generation of virtual (transformed) examples. We develop a new framework for learning linear classiﬁers under known transformations based on semideﬁnite programming. We present a new learning algorithm— the Semideﬁnite Programming Machine (SDPM)—which is able to ﬁnd a maximum margin hyperplane when the training examples are polynomial trajectories instead of single points. The solution is found to be sparse in dual variables and allows to identify those points on the trajectory with minimal real-valued output as virtual support vectors. Extensions to segments of trajectories, to more than one transformation parameter, and to learning with kernels are discussed. In experiments we use a Taylor expansion to locally approximate rotational invariance in pixel images from USPS and ﬁnd improvements over known methods. 1</p><p>5 0.13142458 <a title="174-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Qi, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: Approximation structure plays an important role in inference on loopy graphs. As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propagation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a “message” to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.094823264 <a title="174-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Convex_Methods_for_Transduction.html">48 nips-2003-Convex Methods for Transduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation (BP) has been successfully used in a number of diﬃcult graphical models to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration of the hidden variables. In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to ﬁnd not just the best conﬁguration but rather the top M . While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world problems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of ﬁnding the M best conﬁgurations when exact inference is impossible. We start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculating the best conﬁgurations that uses only max-marginals. For approximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show empirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best conﬁgurations in graphs with hundreds of variables. 1</p><p>6 0.45306373 <a title="174-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Program_Approximations_for_Factored_Continuous-State_Markov_Decision_Processes.html">116 nips-2003-Linear Program Approximations for Factored Continuous-State Markov Decision Processes</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: Rao–Blackwellization is an approximation technique for probabilistic inference that ﬂexibly combines exact inference with sampling. It is useful in models where conditioning on some of the variables leaves a simpler inference problem that can be solved tractably. This paper presents Sample Propagation, an efﬁcient implementation of Rao–Blackwellized approximate inference for a large class of models. Sample Propagation tightly integrates sampling with message passing in a junction tree, and is named for its simple, appealing structure: it walks the clusters of a junction tree, sampling some of the current cluster’s variables and then passing a message to one of its neighbors. We discuss the application of Sample Propagation to conditional Gaussian inference problems such as switching linear dynamical systems. 1</p><p>2 0.76117742 <a title="174-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Bias-Corrected_Bootstrap_and_Model_Uncertainty.html">40 nips-2003-Bias-Corrected Bootstrap and Model Uncertainty</a></p>
<p>Author: Harald Steck, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: The bootstrap has become a popular method for exploring model (structure) uncertainty. Our experiments with artiﬁcial and realworld data demonstrate that the graphs learned from bootstrap samples can be severely biased towards too complex graphical models. Accounting for this bias is hence essential, e.g., when exploring model uncertainty. We ﬁnd that this bias is intimately tied to (well-known) spurious dependences induced by the bootstrap. The leading-order bias-correction equals one half of Akaike’s penalty for model complexity. We demonstrate the eﬀect of this simple bias-correction in our experiments. We also relate this bias to the bias of the plug-in estimator for entropy, as well as to the diﬀerence between the expected test and training errors of a graphical model, which asymptotically equals Akaike’s penalty (rather than one half). 1</p><p>same-paper 3 0.74998081 <a title="174-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Semidefinite_Relaxations_for_Approximate_Inference_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">174 nips-2003-Semidefinite Relaxations for Approximate Inference on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

Vlassis</p><p>Abstract: We propose a non-linear Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) method which works by coordinating or aligning mixtures of linear models. In the same way that CCA extends the idea of PCA, our work extends recent methods for non-linear dimensionality reduction to the case where multiple embeddings of the same underlying low dimensional coordinates are observed, each lying on a different high dimensional manifold. We also show that a special case of our method, when applied to only a single manifold, reduces to the Laplacian Eigenmaps algorithm. As with previous alignment schemes, once the mixture models have been estimated, all of the parameters of our model can be estimated in closed form without local optima in the learning. Experimental results illustrate the viability of the approach as a non-linear extension of CCA. 1</p><p>5 0.58231252 <a title="174-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Generalised_Propagation_for_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_with_Partial_or_Missing_Data.html">80 nips-2003-Generalised Propagation for Fast Fourier Transforms with Partial or Missing Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms and other related Fourier methods have been practically implementable due to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this paper it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coeﬃcients. Furthermore eﬃcient generalised belief propagation methods between clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coeﬃcients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal. 1</p><p>6 0.57641184 <a title="174-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>

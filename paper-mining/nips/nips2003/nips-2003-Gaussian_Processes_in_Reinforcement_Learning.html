<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, Sham M. Kakade, Jeff G. Schneider, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a ﬁnite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem. 1</p><p>3 0.39372393 <a title="78-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Policy_Iteration_with_a_Policy_Language_Bias.html">34 nips-2003-Approximate Policy Iteration with a Policy Language Bias</a></p>
<p>Author: Alan Fern, Sungwook Yoon, Robert Givan</p><p>Abstract: We explore approximate policy iteration, replacing the usual costfunction learning step with a learning step in policy space. We give policy-language biases that enable solution of very large relational Markov decision processes (MDPs) that no previous technique can solve. In particular, we induce high-quality domain-speciﬁc planners for classical planning domains (both deterministic and stochastic variants) by solving such domains as extremely large MDPs. 1</p><p>4 0.36971173 <a title="78-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Warped_Gaussian_Processes.html">194 nips-2003-Warped Gaussian Processes</a></p>
<p>Author: Edward Snelson, Zoubin Ghahramani, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We generalise the Gaussian process (GP) framework for regression by learning a nonlinear transformation of the GP outputs. This allows for non-Gaussian processes and non-Gaussian noise. The learning algorithm chooses a nonlinear transformation such that transformed data is well-modelled by a GP. This can be seen as including a preprocessing transformation as an integral part of the probabilistic modelling problem, rather than as an ad-hoc step. We demonstrate on several real regression problems that learning the transformation can lead to signiﬁcantly better performance than using a regular GP, or a GP with a ﬁxed transformation. 1</p><p>5 0.34809279 <a title="78-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Nonstationary_Covariance_Functions_for_Gaussian_Process_Regression.html">141 nips-2003-Nonstationary Covariance Functions for Gaussian Process Regression</a></p>
<p>Author: Christopher J. Paciorek, Mark J. Schervish</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a class of nonstationary covariance functions for Gaussian process (GP) regression. Nonstationary covariance functions allow the model to adapt to functions whose smoothness varies with the inputs. The class includes a nonstationary version of the Matérn stationary covariance, in which the differentiability of the regression function is controlled by a parameter, freeing one from ﬁxing the differentiability in advance. In experiments, the nonstationary GP regression model performs well when the input space is two or three dimensions, outperforming a neural network model and Bayesian free-knot spline models, and competitive with a Bayesian neural network, but is outperformed in one dimension by a state-of-the-art Bayesian free-knot spline model. The model readily generalizes to non-Gaussian data. Use of computational methods for speeding GP ﬁtting may allow for implementation of the method on larger datasets. 1</p><p>6 0.26839802 <a title="78-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-All_learning_is_Local%3A_Multi-agent_Learning_in_Global_Reward_Games.html">20 nips-2003-All learning is Local: Multi-agent Learning in Global Reward Games</a></p>

<p>Author: Radford M. Neal, Matthew J. Beal, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Markov chain method for sampling from the distribution of the hidden state sequence in a non-linear dynamical system, given a sequence of observations. This method updates all states in the sequence simultaneously using an embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An update begins with the creation of “pools” of candidate states at each time. We then deﬁne an embedded HMM whose states are indexes within these pools. Using a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm, we can efﬁciently choose a state sequence with the appropriate probabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass through states in these pools. We illustrate the method in a simple one-dimensional example, and in an example showing how an embedded HMM can be used to in effect discretize the state space without any discretization error. We also compare the embedded HMM to a particle smoother on a more substantial problem of inferring human motion from 2D traces of markers. 1</p><p>4 0.6358763 <a title="78-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-A_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence_Based_Kernel_for_SVM_Classification_in_Multimedia_Applications.html">9 nips-2003-A Kullback-Leibler Divergence Based Kernel for SVM Classification in Multimedia Applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro J. Moreno, Purdy P. Ho, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years signiﬁcant efforts have been made to develop kernels that can be applied to sequence data such as DNA, text, speech, video and images. The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classiﬁers such as SVM’s. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically ﬁnding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identiﬁcation/veriﬁcation and image classiﬁcation tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker veriﬁcation and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM’s and the generative classiﬁers in speaker identiﬁcation and image classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.62480229 <a title="78-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Planning_in_POMDPs_with_Macro-Actions.html">33 nips-2003-Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Macro-Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Theocharous, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that useful POMDP solutions do not require consideration of the entire belief space. We extend this idea with the notion of temporal abstraction. We present and explore a new reinforcement learning algorithm over grid-points in belief space, which uses macro-actions and Monte Carlo updates of the Q-values. We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>6 0.62165457 <a title="78-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Extending_Q-Learning_to_General_Adaptive_Multi-Agent_Systems.html">65 nips-2003-Extending Q-Learning to General Adaptive Multi-Agent Systems</a></p>

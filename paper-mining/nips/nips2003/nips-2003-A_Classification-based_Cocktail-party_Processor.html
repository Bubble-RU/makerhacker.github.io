Brown</p><p>Abstract: At a cocktail party, a listener can selectively attend to a single voice and filter out other acoustical interferences. How to simulate this perceptual ability remains a great challenge. This paper describes a novel supervised learning approach to speech segregation, in which a target speech signal is separated from interfering sounds using spatial location cues: interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural intensity differences (IID). Motivated by the auditory masking effect, we employ the notion of an ideal time-frequency binary mask, which selects the target if it is stronger than the interference in a local time-frequency unit. Within a narrow frequency band, modifications to the relative strength of the target source with respect to the interference trigger systematic changes for estimated ITD and IID. For a given spatial configuration, this interaction produces characteristic clustering in the binaural feature space. Consequently, we perform pattern classification in order to estimate ideal binary masks. A systematic evaluation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio as well as automatic speech recognition performance shows that the resulting system produces masks very close to ideal binary ones. A quantitative comparison shows that our model yields significant improvement in performance over an existing approach. Furthermore, under certain conditions the model produces large speech intelligibility improvements with normal listeners. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n The perceptual ability to detect, discriminate and recognize one utterance in a background of acoustic interference has been studied extensively under both monaural and binaural conditions [1, 2, 3]. The human auditory system is able to segregate a speech signal from an acoustic mixture using various cues, including fundamental frequency (F0), onset time and location, in a process that is known as auditory scene analysis (ASA) [1]. F0 is widely used in computational ASA systems that operate upon monaural input – however, systems that employ only this cue are limited to voiced speech [4, 5, 6]. Increased speech intelligibility in binaural listening compared to the monaural case has prompted research in designing cocktail-party processors based on spatial cues [7, 8, 9]. Such a system can be applied to, among other things, enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments and improving binaural hearing aid design. In this study, we propose a sound segregation model using binaural cues extracted from the responses of a KEMAR dummy head that realistically simulates the filtering process of the head, torso and external ear. A typical approach for signal reconstruction uses a time-frequency (T-F) mask: T-F units are weighted selectively in order to enhance the target signal. Here, we employ an ideal binary mask [6], which selects the T-F units where the signal energy is greater than the noise energy. The ideal mask notion is motivated by the human auditory masking phenomenon, in which a stronger signal masks a weaker one in the same critical band. In addition, from a theoretical ASA perspective, an ideal binary mask gives a performance ceiling for all binary masks. Moreover, such masks have been recently shown to provide a highly effective front-end for robust speech recognition [10]. We show for mixtures of multiple sound sources that there exists a strong correlation between the relative strength of target and interference and estimated ITD/IID, resulting in a characteristic clustering across frequency bands. Consequently, we employ a nonparametric classification method to determine decision regions in the joint ITDIID feature space that correspond to an optimal estimate for an ideal mask. Related models for estimating target masks through clustering have been proposed previously [11, 12]. Notably, the experimental results by Jourjine et al. [12] suggest that speech signals in a multiple-speaker condition obey to a large extent disjoint orthogonality in time and frequency. That is, at most one source has a nonzero energy at a specific time and frequency. Such models, however, assume input directly from microphone recordings and head-related filtering is not considered. Simulation of human binaural hearing introduces different constraints as well as clues to the problem. First, both ITD and IID should be utilized since IID is more reliable at higher frequencies than ITD. Second, frequency-dependent combinations of ITD and IID arise naturally for a fixed spatial configuration. Consequently, channel-dependent training should be performed for each frequency band. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains the architecture of the model and describes our method for azimuth localization. Section 3 is devoted to ideal binary mask estimation, which constitutes the core of the model. Section 4 presents the performance of the system and a quantitative comparison with the Bodden [7] model. Section 5 concludes our paper. 2 M od el a rch i t ect u re a n d a zi mu t h locali zat i o n Our model consists of the following stages: 1) a model of the auditory periphery; 2) frequency-dependent ITD/IID extraction and azimuth localization; 3) estimation of an ideal binary mask. The input to our model is a mixture of two or more signals presented at different, but fixed, locations. Signals are sampled at 44.1 kHz. We follow a standard procedure for simulating free-field acoustic signals from monaural signals (no reverberations are modeled). Binaural signals are obtained by filtering the monaural signals with measured head-related transfer functions (HRTF) from a KEMAR dummy head [13]. HRTFs introduce a natural combination of ITD and IID into the signals that is extracted in the subsequent stages of the model. To simulate the auditory periphery we use a bank of 128 gammatone filters in the range of 80 Hz to 5 kHz as described in [4]. In addition, the gains of the gammatone filters are adjusted in order to simulate the middle ear transfer function. In the final step of the peripheral model, the output of each gammatone filter is half-wave rectified in order to simulate firing rates of the auditory nerve. Saturation effects are modeled by taking the square root of the signal. Current models of azimuth localization almost invariably start with Jeffress’s crosscorrelation mechanism. For all frequency channels, we use the normalized crosscorrelation computed at lags equally distributed in the plausible range from –1 ms to 1 ms using an integration window of 20 ms. Frequency-dependent nonlinear transformations are used to map the time-delay axis onto the azimuth axis resulting in a cross-correlogram structure. In addition, a ‘skeleton’ cross-correlogram is formed by replacing the peaks in the cross-correlogram with Gaussians of narrower widths that are inversely proportional to the channel center frequency. This results in a sharpening effect, similar in principle to lateral inhibition. Assuming fixed sources, multiple locations are determined as peaks after summating the skeleton cross-correlogram across frequency and time. The number of sources and their locations computed here, as well as the target source location, feed to the next stage. 3 B i n a ry ma s k est i mat i on The objective of this stage of the model is to develop an efficient mechanism for estimating an ideal binary mask based on observed patterns of extracted ITD and IID features. Our theoretical analysis for two-source interactions in the case of pure tones shows relatively smooth changes for ITD and IID with the relative strength R between the two sources in narrow frequency bands [14]. More specifically, when the frequencies vary uniformly in a narrow band the derived mean values of ITD/IID estimates vary monotonically with respect to R. To capture this relationship in the context of real signals, statistics are collected for individual spatial configurations during training. We employ a training corpus consisting of 10 speech utterances from the TIMIT database (see [14] for details). In the two-source case, we divide the corpus in two equal sets: target and interference. In the three-source case, we select 4 signals for the target set and 2 interfering sets of 3 signals each. For all frequency channels, local estimates of ITD, IID and R are based on 20-ms time frames with 10 ms overlap between consecutive time frames. In order to eliminate the multi-peak ambiguity in the cross-correlation function for mid- and high-frequency channels, we use the following strategy. We compute ITDi as the peak location of the cross-correlation in the range 2π / ω i centered at the target ITD, where ω i indicates the center frequency of the ith channel. On the other hand, IID and R are computed as follows: ∑ t s i2 (t )     Ri = ∑ ∑ t li2 (t ) , t s i2 (t ) + ∑ ∑ t ri2 (t ) t ni2 (t )     IIDi = 20 log10 where l i and ri refer to the left and right peripheral output of the ith channel, respectively, s i refers to the output for the target signal, and ni that for the acoustic interference. In computing IIDi , we use 20 instead of 10 in order to compensate for the square root operation in the peripheral model. Fig. 1 shows empirical results obtained for a two-source configuration on the training corpus. The data exhibits a systematic shift for both ITD and IID with respect to the relative strength R. Moreover, the theoretical mean values obtained in the case of pure tones [14] match the empirical ones very well. This observation extends to multiple-source scenarios. As an example, Fig. 2 displays histograms that show the relationship between R and both ITD (Fig. 2A) and IID (Fig. 2B) for a three-source situation. Note that the interfering sources introduce systematic deviations for the binaural cues. Consider a worst case: the target is silent and two interferences have equal energy in a given T-F unit. This results in binaural cues indicating an auditory event at half of the distance between the two interference locations; for Fig. 2, it is 0° - the target location. However, the data in Fig. 2 has a low probability for this case and shows instead a clustering phenomenon, suggesting that in most cases only one source dominates a T-F unit.

Statistics are obtained for a channel with center frequency 1.5 kHz. A: Histogram of ITD and R samples. B: Histogram of IID and R samples. C: Clustering in the ITD-IID space. By displaying the information in the joint ITD-IID space (Fig. 2C), we observe location-based clustering of the binaural cues, which is clearly marked by strong peaks that correspond to distinct active sources. There exists a tradeoff between ITD and IID across frequencies, where ITD is most salient at low frequencies and IID at high frequencies [2]. But a fixed cutoff frequency that separates the effective use of ITD and IID does not exist for different spatial configurations. This motivates our choice of a joint ITD-IID feature space that optimizes the system performance across different configurations. Differential training seems necessary for different channels given that there exist variations of ITD and, especially, IID values for different center frequencies. Since the goal is to estimate an ideal binary mask, we focus on detecting decision regions in the 2-dimensional ITD-IID space for individual frequency channels. Consequently, supervised learning techniques can be applied. For the ith channel, we test the following two hypotheses. The first one is H 1 : target is dominant or Ri > 0.5 , and the second one is H 2 : interference is dominant or Ri < 0.5 . Based on the estimates of the bivariate densities p( x | H 1 ) and p( x | H 2 ) the classification is done by the maximum a posteriori decision rule: p( H 1 ) p( x | H 1 ) > p( H 2 ) p( x | H 2 ) . There exist a plethora of techniques for probability density estimation ranging from parametric techniques (e.g. mixture of Gaussians) to nonparametric ones (e.g. kernel density estimators). In order to completely characterize the distribution of the data we use the kernel density estimation method independently for each frequency channel. One approach for finding smoothing parameters is the least-squares crossvalidation method, which is utilized in our estimation. One cue not employed in our model is the interaural time difference between signal envelopes (IED). Auditory models generally employ IED in the high-frequency range where the auditory system becomes gradually insensitive to ITD. We have compared the performance of the three binaural cues: ITD, IID and IED and have found no benefit for using IED in our system after incorporating ITD and IID [14]. 4 Pe rfo rmanc e an d c omp arison The performance of a segregation system can be assessed in different ways, depending on intended applications. To extensively evaluate our model, we use the following three criteria: 1) a signal-to-noise (SNR) measure using the original target as signal; 2) ASR rates using our model as a front-end; and 3) human speech intelligibility tests. To conduct the SNR evaluation a segregated signal is reconstructed from a binary mask using a resynthesis method described in [5]. To quantitatively assess system performance, we measure the SNR using the original target speech as signal: ∑ t 2 s o (t ) ∑ SNR = 10 log 10 (s o (t ) − s e (t ))2 t where s o (t ) represents the resynthesized original speech and s e (t ) the reconstructed speech from an estimated mask. One can measure the initial SNR by replacing the denominator with s N (t ) , the resynthesized original interference. Fig. 3 shows the systematic results for two-source scenarios using the Cooke corpus [4], which is commonly used in sound separation studies. The corpus has 100 mixtures obtained from 10 speech utterances mixed with 10 types of intrusion. We compare the SNR gain obtained by our model against that obtained using the ideal binary mask across different noise types. Excellent results are obtained when the target is close to the median plane for an azimuth separation as small as 5°. Performance degrades when the target source is moved to the side of the head, from an average gain of 13.7 dB for the target in the median plane (Fig. 3A) to 1.7 dB when target is at 80° (Fig. 3B). When spatial separation increases the performance improves even for side targets, to an average gain of 14.5 dB in Fig. 3C. This performance profile is in qualitative agreement with experimental data [2]. Fig. 4 illustrates the performance in a three-source scenario with target in the median plane and two interfering sources at –30° and 30°. Here 5 speech signals from the Cooke corpus form the target set and the other 5 form one interference set. The second interference set contains the 10 intrusions. The performance degrades compared to the two-source situation, from an average SNR of about 12 dB to 4.1 dB. However, the average SNR gain obtained is approximately 11.3 dB. This ability of our model to segregate mixtures of more than two sources differs from blind source separation with independent component analysis. In order to draw a quantitative comparison, we have implemented Bodden’s cocktail-party processor using the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank [7]. The localization stage of this model uses an extended cross-correlation mechanism based on contralateral inhibition and it adapts to HRTFs. The separation stage of the model is based on estimation of the weights for a Wiener filter as the ratio between a desired excitation and an actual one. Although the Bodden model is more flexible by incorporating aspects of the precedence effect into the localization stage, the estimation of Wiener filter weights is less robust than our binary estimation of ideal masks. Shown in Fig. 5, our model shows a considerable improvement over the Bodden system, producing a 3.5 dB average improvement.

Black bars correspond to the SNR of the initial mixture. For the ASR evaluation, we use the missing-data technique as described in [10]. In this approach, a continuous density hidden Markov model recognizer is modified such that only acoustic features indicated as reliable in a binary mask are used during decoding. Hence, it works seamlessly with the output from our speech segregation system. We have implemented the missing data algorithm with the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank. Feature vectors are obtained using the Hilbert envelope at the output of the gammatone filter. More specifically, each feature vector is extracted by smoothing the envelope using an 8-ms first-order filter, sampling at a frame-rate of 10 ms and finally log-compressing. We use the bounded marginalization method for classification [10]. The task domain is recognition of connected digits, and both training and testing are performed on acoustic features from the left ear signal using the male speaker dataset in the TIDigits database.

The performance of our model is systematically compared against the ideal masks for four SNR levels: 5 dB, 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB. Similarly, Fig. 6B shows the results for the three-source case with an added female speaker at -30°. The ideal mask exhibits only slight and gradual degradation in recognition performance with decreasing SNR and increasing number of sources. Observe that large improvements over baseline performance are obtained across all conditions. This shows the strong potential of applying our model to robust speech recognition. 80 60 40 20 5 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB 80 60 40 20 5 dB −10 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB Figure 6.

We use the Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentence database that contains short semantically predictable sentences [15]. The score is evaluated as the percentage of keywords correctly identified, ignoring minor errors such as tense and plurality. To eliminate potential location-based priming effects we randomly swap the locations for target and interference for different trials. In the unprocessed condition, binaural signals are produced by convolving original signals with the corresponding HRTFs and the signals are presented to a listener dichotically. In the processed condition, our algorithm is used to reconstruct the target signal at the better ear and results are presented diotically. 80 80 Keyword score (%) B100 Keyword score (%) A 100 60 40 20 0 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB 60 40 20 0 Figure 7.

Three SNR levels are tested: 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB, where the SNR is computed at the better ear. Here the target is a male speaker and the interference is babble noise. Our algorithm improves the intelligibility score for the tested conditions and the improvement becomes larger as the SNR decreases (61% at –10 dB). Our informal observations suggest, as expected, that the intelligibility score improves for unprocessed mixtures when two sources are more widely separated than 5°. Fig. 7B shows the results for a three-source configuration, where our model yields a 40% improvement. Here the interfering sources are one female speaker and another male speaker, resulting in an initial SNR of –10 dB at the better ear. 5 C onclu si on We have observed systematic deviations of the ITD and IID cues with respect to the relative strength between target and acoustic interference, and configuration-specific clustering in the joint ITD-IID feature space. Consequently, supervised learning of binaural patterns is employed for individual frequency channels and different spatial configurations to estimate an ideal binary mask that cancels acoustic energy in T-F units where interference is stronger. Evaluation using both SNR and ASR measures shows that the system estimates ideal binary masks very well. A comparison shows a significant improvement in performance over the Bodden model. Moreover, our model produces substantial speech intelligibility improvements for two and three source conditions.

Consequently, we perform pattern classification in order to estimate ideal binary masks. A systematic evaluation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio as well as automatic speech recognition performance shows that the resulting system produces masks very close to ideal binary ones.

Binaural signals are obtained by filtering the monaural signals with measured head-related transfer functions (HRTF) from a KEMAR dummy head [13]. HRTFs introduce a natural combination of ITD and IID into the signals that is extracted in the subsequent stages of the model. To simulate the auditory periphery we use a bank of 128 gammatone filters in the range of 80 Hz to 5 kHz as described in [4]. In addition, the gains of the gammatone filters are adjusted in order to simulate the middle ear transfer function. In the final step of the peripheral model, the output of each gammatone filter is half-wave rectified in order to simulate firing rates of the auditory nerve. Saturation effects are modeled by taking the square root of the signal. Current models of azimuth localization almost invariably start with Jeffress’s crosscorrelation mechanism. For all frequency channels, we use the normalized crosscorrelation computed at lags equally distributed in the plausible range from –1 ms to 1 ms using an integration window of 20 ms. Frequency-dependent nonlinear transformations are used to map the time-delay axis onto the azimuth axis resulting in a cross-correlogram structure. In addition, a ‘skeleton’ cross-correlogram is formed by replacing the peaks in the cross-correlogram with Gaussians of narrower widths that are inversely proportional to the channel center frequency. This results in a sharpening effect, similar in principle to lateral inhibition. Assuming fixed sources, multiple locations are determined as peaks after summating the skeleton cross-correlogram across frequency and time. The number of sources and their locations computed here, as well as the target source location, feed to the next stage. 3 B i n a ry ma s k est i mat i on The objective of this stage of the model is to develop an efficient mechanism for estimating an ideal binary mask based on observed patterns of extracted ITD and IID features. Our theoretical analysis for two-source interactions in the case of pure tones shows relatively smooth changes for ITD and IID with the relative strength R between the two sources in narrow frequency bands [14]. More specifically, when the frequencies vary uniformly in a narrow band the derived mean values of ITD/IID estimates vary monotonically with respect to R. To capture this relationship in the context of real signals, statistics are collected for individual spatial configurations during training. We employ a training corpus consisting of 10 speech utterances from the TIMIT database (see [14] for details). In the two-source case, we divide the corpus in two equal sets: target and interference. In the three-source case, we select 4 signals for the target set and 2 interfering sets of 3 signals each. For all frequency channels, local estimates of ITD, IID and R are based on 20-ms time frames with 10 ms overlap between consecutive time frames. In order to eliminate the multi-peak ambiguity in the cross-correlation function for mid- and high-frequency channels, we use the following strategy. We compute ITDi as the peak location of the cross-correlation in the range 2π / ω i centered at the target ITD, where ω i indicates the center frequency of the ith channel. On the other hand, IID and R are computed as follows: ∑ t s i2 (t )     Ri = ∑ ∑ t li2 (t ) , t s i2 (t ) + ∑ ∑ t ri2 (t ) t ni2 (t )     IIDi = 20 log10 where l i and ri refer to the left and right peripheral output of the ith channel, respectively, s i refers to the output for the target signal, and ni that for the acoustic interference. In computing IIDi , we use 20 instead of 10 in order to compensate for the square root operation in the peripheral model. Fig. 1 shows empirical results obtained for a two-source configuration on the training corpus. The data exhibits a systematic shift for both ITD and IID with respect to the relative strength R. Moreover, the theoretical mean values obtained in the case of pure tones [14] match the empirical ones very well. This observation extends to multiple-source scenarios. As an example, Fig. 2 displays histograms that show the relationship between R and both ITD (Fig. 2A) and IID (Fig. 2B) for a three-source situation. Note that the interfering sources introduce systematic deviations for the binaural cues. Consider a worst case: the target is silent and two interferences have equal energy in a given T-F unit. This results in binaural cues indicating an auditory event at half of the distance between the two interference locations; for Fig. 2, it is 0° - the target location. However, the data in Fig. 2 has a low probability for this case and shows instead a clustering phenomenon, suggesting that in most cases only one source dominates a T-F unit.

Statistics are obtained for a channel with center frequency 1.5 kHz. A: Histogram of ITD and R samples. B: Histogram of IID and R samples. C: Clustering in the ITD-IID space. By displaying the information in the joint ITD-IID space (Fig. 2C), we observe location-based clustering of the binaural cues, which is clearly marked by strong peaks that correspond to distinct active sources. There exists a tradeoff between ITD and IID across frequencies, where ITD is most salient at low frequencies and IID at high frequencies [2]. But a fixed cutoff frequency that separates the effective use of ITD and IID does not exist for different spatial configurations. This motivates our choice of a joint ITD-IID feature space that optimizes the system performance across different configurations. Differential training seems necessary for different channels given that there exist variations of ITD and, especially, IID values for different center frequencies. Since the goal is to estimate an ideal binary mask, we focus on detecting decision regions in the 2-dimensional ITD-IID space for individual frequency channels. Consequently, supervised learning techniques can be applied. For the ith channel, we test the following two hypotheses. The first one is H 1 : target is dominant or Ri > 0.5 , and the second one is H 2 : interference is dominant or Ri < 0.5 . Based on the estimates of the bivariate densities p( x | H 1 ) and p( x | H 2 ) the classification is done by the maximum a posteriori decision rule: p( H 1 ) p( x | H 1 ) > p( H 2 ) p( x | H 2 ) . There exist a plethora of techniques for probability density estimation ranging from parametric techniques (e.g. mixture of Gaussians) to nonparametric ones (e.g. kernel density estimators). In order to completely characterize the distribution of the data we use the kernel density estimation method independently for each frequency channel. One approach for finding smoothing parameters is the least-squares crossvalidation method, which is utilized in our estimation. One cue not employed in our model is the interaural time difference between signal envelopes (IED). Auditory models generally employ IED in the high-frequency range where the auditory system becomes gradually insensitive to ITD. We have compared the performance of the three binaural cues: ITD, IID and IED and have found no benefit for using IED in our system after incorporating ITD and IID [14]. 4 Pe rfo rmanc e an d c omp arison The performance of a segregation system can be assessed in different ways, depending on intended applications. To extensively evaluate our model, we use the following three criteria: 1) a signal-to-noise (SNR) measure using the original target as signal; 2) ASR rates using our model as a front-end; and 3) human speech intelligibility tests. To conduct the SNR evaluation a segregated signal is reconstructed from a binary mask using a resynthesis method described in [5]. To quantitatively assess system performance, we measure the SNR using the original target speech as signal: ∑ t 2 s o (t ) ∑ SNR = 10 log 10 (s o (t ) − s e (t ))2 t where s o (t ) represents the resynthesized original speech and s e (t ) the reconstructed speech from an estimated mask. One can measure the initial SNR by replacing the denominator with s N (t ) , the resynthesized original interference. Fig. 3 shows the systematic results for two-source scenarios using the Cooke corpus [4], which is commonly used in sound separation studies. The corpus has 100 mixtures obtained from 10 speech utterances mixed with 10 types of intrusion. We compare the SNR gain obtained by our model against that obtained using the ideal binary mask across different noise types. Excellent results are obtained when the target is close to the median plane for an azimuth separation as small as 5°. Performance degrades when the target source is moved to the side of the head, from an average gain of 13.7 dB for the target in the median plane (Fig. 3A) to 1.7 dB when target is at 80° (Fig. 3B). When spatial separation increases the performance improves even for side targets, to an average gain of 14.5 dB in Fig. 3C. This performance profile is in qualitative agreement with experimental data [2]. Fig. 4 illustrates the performance in a three-source scenario with target in the median plane and two interfering sources at –30° and 30°. Here 5 speech signals from the Cooke corpus form the target set and the other 5 form one interference set. The second interference set contains the 10 intrusions. The performance degrades compared to the two-source situation, from an average SNR of about 12 dB to 4.1 dB. However, the average SNR gain obtained is approximately 11.3 dB. This ability of our model to segregate mixtures of more than two sources differs from blind source separation with independent component analysis. In order to draw a quantitative comparison, we have implemented Bodden’s cocktail-party processor using the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank [7]. The localization stage of this model uses an extended cross-correlation mechanism based on contralateral inhibition and it adapts to HRTFs. The separation stage of the model is based on estimation of the weights for a Wiener filter as the ratio between a desired excitation and an actual one. Although the Bodden model is more flexible by incorporating aspects of the precedence effect into the localization stage, the estimation of Wiener filter weights is less robust than our binary estimation of ideal masks. Shown in Fig. 5, our model shows a considerable improvement over the Bodden system, producing a 3.5 dB average improvement.

SNR comparison between the Bodden model (white bars) and our model (gray bars) for a two-source configuration: target at 0° and interference at 30°. Black bars correspond to the SNR of the initial mixture. For the ASR evaluation, we use the missing-data technique as described in [10]. In this approach, a continuous density hidden Markov model recognizer is modified such that only acoustic features indicated as reliable in a binary mask are used during decoding. Hence, it works seamlessly with the output from our speech segregation system. We have implemented the missing data algorithm with the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank. Feature vectors are obtained using the Hilbert envelope at the output of the gammatone filter. More specifically, each feature vector is extracted by smoothing the envelope using an 8-ms first-order filter, sampling at a frame-rate of 10 ms and finally log-compressing. We use the bounded marginalization method for classification [10]. The task domain is recognition of connected digits, and both training and testing are performed on acoustic features from the left ear signal using the male speaker dataset in the TIDigits database. A 100 B 100 Correctness (%) Correctness (%) Fig. 6A shows the correctness scores for a two-source condition, where the male target speaker is located at 0° and the interference is another male speaker at 30°. The performance of our model is systematically compared against the ideal masks for four SNR levels: 5 dB, 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB. Similarly, Fig. 6B shows the results for the three-source case with an added female speaker at -30°. The ideal mask exhibits only slight and gradual degradation in recognition performance with decreasing SNR and increasing number of sources. Observe that large improvements over baseline performance are obtained across all conditions. This shows the strong potential of applying our model to robust speech recognition. 80 60 40 20 5 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB 80 60 40 20 5 dB −10 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB Figure 6.

Correctness score for a three-source case. Finally we evaluate our model on speech intelligibility with listeners with normal hearing. We use the Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentence database that contains short semantically predictable sentences [15]. The score is evaluated as the percentage of keywords correctly identified, ignoring minor errors such as tense and plurality. To eliminate potential location-based priming effects we randomly swap the locations for target and interference for different trials. In the unprocessed condition, binaural signals are produced by convolving original signals with the corresponding HRTFs and the signals are presented to a listener dichotically. In the processed condition, our algorithm is used to reconstruct the target signal at the better ear and results are presented diotically. 80 80 Keyword score (%) B100 Keyword score (%) A 100 60 40 20 0 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB 60 40 20 0 Figure 7.

Three SNR levels are tested: 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB, where the SNR is computed at the better ear. Here the target is a male speaker and the interference is babble noise. Our algorithm improves the intelligibility score for the tested conditions and the improvement becomes larger as the SNR decreases (61% at –10 dB). Our informal observations suggest, as expected, that the intelligibility score improves for unprocessed mixtures when two sources are more widely separated than 5°. Fig. 7B shows the results for a three-source configuration, where our model yields a 40% improvement. Here the interfering sources are one female speaker and another male speaker, resulting in an initial SNR of –10 dB at the better ear. 5 C onclu si on We have observed systematic deviations of the ITD and IID cues with respect to the relative strength between target and acoustic interference, and configuration-specific clustering in the joint ITD-IID feature space. Consequently, supervised learning of binaural patterns is employed for individual frequency channels and different spatial configurations to estimate an ideal binary mask that cancels acoustic energy in T-F units where interference is stronger. Evaluation using both SNR and ASR measures shows that the system estimates ideal binary masks very well. A comparison shows a significant improvement in performance over the Bodden model. Moreover, our model produces substantial speech intelligibility improvements for two and three source conditions.

<p>Author: Jeff Bondy, Ian Bruce, Suzanna Becker, Simon Haykin</p><p>Abstract: A major issue in evaluating speech enhancement and hearing compensation algorithms is to come up with a suitable metric that predicts intelligibility as judged by a human listener. Previous methods such as the widely used Speech Transmission Index (STI) fail to account for masking effects that arise from the highly nonlinear cochlear transfer function. We therefore propose a Neural Articulation Index (NAI) that estimates speech intelligibility from the instantaneous neural spike rate over time, produced when a signal is processed by an auditory neural model. By using a well developed model of the auditory periphery and detection theory we show that human perceptual discrimination closely matches the modeled distortion in the instantaneous spike rates of the auditory nerve. In highly rippled frequency transfer conditions the NAI’s prediction error is 8% versus the STI’s prediction error of 10.8%. 1 In trod u ction A wide range of intelligibility measures in current use rest on the assumption that intelligibility of a speech signal is based upon the sum of contributions of intelligibility within individual frequency bands, as first proposed by French and Steinberg [1]. This basic method applies a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a set of bands, then averages across these bands to come up with a prediction of intelligibility. French and Steinberg’s original Articulation Index (AI) is based on 20 equally contributing bands, and produces an intelligibility score between zero and one: 1 20 AI = (1) ∑ TI i , 20 i =1 th where TIi (Transmission Index i) is the normalized intelligibility in the i band. The TI per band is a function of the signal to noise ratio or: (2) SNRi + 12 30 for SNRs between –12 dB and 18 dB. A SNR of greater than 18 dB means that the band has perfect intelligibility and TI equals 1, while an SNR under –12 dB means that a band is not contributing at all, and the TI of that band equals 0. The overall intelligibility is then a function of the AI, but this function changes depending on the semantic context of the signal. TI i = Kryter validated many of the underlying AI principles [2]. Kryter also presented the mechanics for calculating the AI for different number of bands - 5,6,15 or the original 20 - as well as important correction factors [3]. Some of the most important correction factors account for the effects of modulated noise, peak clipping, and reverberation. Even with the application of various correction factors, the AI does not predict intelligibility in the presence of some time-domain distortions. Consequently, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) has been utilized to measure the loss of intelligibility due to echoes and reverberation [4]. Steeneken and Houtgast later extended this approach to include nonlinear distortions, giving a new name to the predictor: the Speech Transmission Index (STI) [5]. These metrics proved more valid for a larger range of environments and interferences. The STI test signal is a long-term average speech spectrum, gaussian random signal, amplitude modulated by a 0.63 Hz to 12.5 Hz tone. Acoustic components within different frequency bands are switched on and off over the testing sequence to come up with an intelligibility score between zero and one. Interband intermodulation sources can be discerned, as long as the product does not fall into the testing band. Therefore, the STI allows for standard AI-frequency band weighted SNR effects, MTF-time domain effects, and some limited measurements of nonlinearities. The STI shows a high correlation with empirical tests, and has been codified as an ANSI standard [6]. For general acoustics it is very good. However, the STI does not accurately model intraband masker non-linearities, phase distortions or the underlying auditory mechanisms (outside of independent frequency bands) We therefore sought to extend the AI/STI concepts to predict intelligibility, on the assumption that the closest physical variable we have to the perceptual variable of intelligibility is the auditory nerve response. Using a spiking model of the auditory periphery [7] we form the Neuronal Articulation Index (NAI) by describing distortions in the spike trains of different frequency bands. The spiking over time of an auditory nerve fiber for an undistorted speech signal (control case) is compared to the neural spiking over time for the same signal after undergoing some distortion (test case). The difference in the estimated instantaneous discharge rate for the two cases is used to calculate a neural equivalent to the TI, the Neural Distortion (ND), for each frequency band. Then the NAI is calculated with a weighted average of NDs at different Best Frequencies (BFs). In general detection theory terms, the control neuronal response sets some locus in a high dimensional space, then the distorted neuronal response will project near that locus if it is perceptually equivalent, or very far away if it is not. Thus, the distance between the control neuronal response and the distorted neuronal response is a function of intelligibility. Due to the limitations of the STI mentioned above it is predicted that a measure of the neural coding error will be a better predictor than SNR for human intelligibility word-scores. Our method also has the potential to shed light on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. 2 2.1 Meth o d Model The auditory periphery model used throughout (and hereafter referred to as the Auditory Model) is from [7]. The system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Block diagram of the computational model of the auditory periphery from the middle ear to the Auditory Nerve. Reprinted from Fig. 1 of [7] with permission from the Acoustical Society of America © (2003). The auditory periphery model comprises several sections, each providing a phenomenological description of a different part of the cat auditory periphery function. The first section models middle ear filtering. The second section, labeled the “control path,” captures the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) modulatory function, and includes a wideband, nonlinear, time varying, band-pass filter followed by an OHC nonlinearity (NL) and low-pass (LP) filter. This section controls the time-varying, nonlinear behavior of the narrowband signal-path basilar membrane (BM) filter. The control-path filter has a wider bandwidth than the signal-path filter to account for wideband nonlinear phenomena such as two-tone rate suppression. The third section of the model, labeled the “signal path”, describes the filter properties and traveling wave delay of the BM (time-varying, narrowband filter); the nonlinear transduction and low-pass filtering of the Inner Hair Cell (IHC NL and LP); spontaneous and driven activity and adaptation in synaptic transmission (synapse model); and spike generation and refractoriness in the auditory nerve (AN). In this model, CIHC and COHC are scaling constants that control IHC and OHC status, respectively. The parameters of the synapse section of the model are set to produce adaptation and discharge-rate versus level behavior appropriate for a high-spontaneous- rate/low-threshold auditory nerve fiber. In order to avoid having to generate many spike trains to obtain a reliable estimate of the instantaneous discharge rate over time, we instead use the synaptic release rate as an approximation of the discharge rate, ignoring the effects of neural refractoriness. 2.2 Neural articulation index These results emulate most of the simulations described in Chapter 2 of Steeneken’s thesis [8], as it describes the full development of an STI metric from inception to end. For those interested, the following simulations try to map most of the second chapter, but instead of basing the distortion metric on a SNR calculation, we use the neural distortion. There are two sets of experiments. The first, in section 3.1, deals with applying a frequency weighting structure to combine the band distortion values, while section 3.2 introduces redundancy factors also. The bands, chosen to match [8], are octave bands centered at [125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000] Hz. Only seven bands are used here. The Neural AI (NAI) for this is: NAI = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (3) th where •i is the i bands contribution and NTIi is the Neural Transmission Index in th the i band. Here all the •s sum to one, so each • factor can be thought of as the percentage contribution of a band to intelligibility. Since NTI is between [0,1], it can also be thought of as the percentage of acoustic features that are intelligible in a particular band. The ND per band is the projection of the distorted (Test) instantaneous spike rate against the clean (Control) instantaneous spike rate. ND = 1 − Test ⋅ Control T , Control ⋅ Control T (4) where Control and Test are vectors of the instantaneous spike rate over time, sampled at 22050 Hz. This type of error metric can only deal with steady state channel distortions, such as the ones used in [8]. ND was then linearly fit to resemble the TI equation 1-2, after normalizing each of the seven bands to have zero means and unit standard deviations across each of the seven bands. The NTI in the th i band was calculated as NDi − µ i (5) NTIi = m +b. σi NTIi is then thresholded to be no less then 0 and no greater then 1, following the TI thresholding. In equation (5) the factors, m = 2.5, b = -1, were the best linear fit to produce NTIi’s in bands with SNR greater then 15 dB of 1, bands with 7.5 dB SNR produce NTIi’s of 0.75, and bands with 0 dB SNR produced NTI i’s of 0.5. This closely followed the procedure outlined in section 2.3.3 of [8]. As the TI is a best linear fit of SNR to intelligibility, the NTI is a best linear fit of neural distortion to intelligibility. The input stimuli were taken from a Dutch corpus [9], and consisted of 10 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant (CVC) words, each spoken by four males and four females and sampled at 44100 Hz. The Steeneken study had many more, but the exact corpus could not be found. 80 total words is enough to produce meaningful frequency weighting factors. There were 26 frequency channel distortion conditions used for male speakers, 17 for female and three SNRs (+15 dB, +7.5 dB and 0 dB). The channel conditions were split into four groups given in Tables 1 through 4 for males, since females have negligible signal in the 125 Hz band, they used a subset, marked with an asterisk in Table 1 through Table 4.

A 1353 tap FIR filter was designed for each envelope condition. The female envelopes are a subset of these because they have no appreciable speech energy in the 125 Hz octave band. Using the 40 male utterances and 40 female utterances under distortion and calculating the NAI following equation (3) produces only a value between [0,1]. To produce a word-score intelligibility prediction between zero and 100 percent the NAI value was fit to a third order polynomial that produced the lowest standard deviation of error from empirical data. While Fletcher and Galt [10] state that the relation between AI and intelligibility is exponential, [8] fits with a third order polynomial, and we have chosen to compare to [8]. The empirical word-score intelligibility was from [8]. 3 3.1 R esu lts Determining frequency weighting structure For the first tests, the optimal frequency weights (the values of •i from equation 3) were designed through minimizing the difference between the predicted intelligibility and the empirical intelligibility. At each iteration one of the values was dithered up or down, and then the sum of the • i was normalized to one. This is very similar to [5] whose final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 12.8%, and 8.8% for females. The NAI’s final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 8.9%, and 7.1% for females. Figure 2 Relation between NAI and empirical word-score intelligibility for male (left) and female (right) speech with bandpass limiting and noise. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 8.9% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 12.8%, for females the fit has a s.d. = 7.1% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 8.8% The frequency weighting factors are similar for the NAI and the STI. The STI weighting factors from [8], which produced the optimal prediction of empirical data (male s.d. = 6.8%, female s.d. = 6.0%) and the NAI are plotted in Figure 3. Figure 3 Frequency weighting factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAI and published by Steeneken [8]. As one can see, the low frequency information is tremendously suppressed in the NAI, while the high frequencies are emphasized. This may be an effect of the stimuli corpus. The corpus has a high percentage of stops and fricatives in the initial and final consonant positions. Since these have a comparatively large amount of high frequency signal they may explain this discrepancy at the cost of the low frequency weights. [8] does state that these frequency weights are dependant upon the conditions used for evaluation. 3.2 Determining frequency weighting with redundancy factors In experiment two, rather then using equation (3) that assumes each frequency band contributes independently, we introduce redundancy factors. There is correlation between the different frequency bands of speech [11], which tends to make the STI over-predict intelligibility. The redundancy factors attempt to remove correlate signals between bands. Equation (3) then becomes: NAIr = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 − β 1 NTI1 ⋅ NTI2 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 − β 1 NTI2 ⋅ NTI3 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (6) where the r subscript denotes a redundant NAI and • is the correlation factor. Only adjacent bands are used here to reduce complexity. We replicated Section 3.1 except using equation 6. The same testing, and adaptation strategy from Section 3.1 was used to find the optimal •s and •s. Figure 4 Relation between NAIr and empirical word-score intelligibility for male speech (right) and female speech (left) with bandpass limiting and noise with Redundancy Factors. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 6.9% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.7%, for females the best fitting polynomial has a s.d. = 5.4% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.0%. The frequency weighting and redundancy factors given as optimal in Steeneken, versus calculated through optimizing the NAIr are given in Figure 5. Figure 5 Frequency and redundancy factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAIr and published in [8]. The frequency weights for the NAIr and STIr are more similar than in Section 3.1. The redundancy factors are very different though. The NAI redundancy factors show no real frequency dependence unlike the convex STI redundancy factors. This may be due to differences in optimization that were not clear in [8]. Table 5: Standard Deviation of Prediction Error NAI STI [5] STI [8] MALE EQ. 3 8.9 % 12.8 % 6.8 % FEMALE EQ. 3 7.1 % 8.8 % 6.0 % MALE EQ. 6 6.9 % 4.7 % FEMALE EQ. 6 5.4 % 4.0 % The mean difference in error between the STI r, as given in [8], and the NAIr is 1.7%. This difference may be from the limited CVC word choice. It is well within the range of normal speaker variation, about 2%, so we believe that the NAI and NAIr are comparable to the STI and STI r in predicting speech intelligibility. 4 Conclusions These results are very encouraging. The NAI provides a modest improvement over STI in predicting intelligibility. We do not propose this as a replacement for the STI for general acoustics since the NAI is much more computationally complex then the STI. The NAI’s end applications are in predicting hearing impairment intelligibility and using statistical decision theory to describe the auditory systems feature extractors - tasks which the STI cannot do, but are available to the NAI. While the AI and STI can take into account threshold shifts in a hearing impaired individual, neither can account for sensorineural, suprathreshold degradations [12]. The accuracy of this model, based on cat anatomy and physiology, in predicting human speech intelligibility provides strong validation of attempts to design hearing aid amplification schemes based on physiological data and models [13]. By quantifying the hearing impairment in an intelligibility metric by way of a damaged auditory model one can provide a more accurate assessment of the distortion, probe how the distortion is changing the neuronal response and provide feedback for preprocessing via a hearing aid before the impairment. The NAI may also give insight into how the ear codes stimuli for the very robust, human auditory system. References [1] French, N.R. & Steinberg, J.C.

<p>Author: Kannan Achan, Sam T. Roweis, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques for complex speech processing such as denoising and deconvolution, time/frequency warping, multiple speaker separation, and multiple microphone analysis operate on sequences of short-time power spectra (spectrograms), a representation which is often well-suited to these tasks. However, a signiﬁcant problem with algorithms that manipulate spectrograms is that the output spectrogram does not include a phase component, which is needed to create a time-domain signal that has good perceptual quality. Here we describe a generative model of time-domain speech signals and their spectrograms, and show how an efﬁcient optimizer can be used to ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori speech signal, given the spectrogram. In contrast to techniques that alternate between estimating the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal, our technique directly infers the speech signal, thus jointly optimizing the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal. We compare our technique with a standard method using signal-to-noise ratios, but we also provide audio ﬁles on the web for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in perceptual quality that our technique offers. 1</p><p>5 0.12148317 <a title="5-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Nonlinear_Processing_in_LGN_Neurons.html">140 nips-2003-Nonlinear Processing in LGN Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Bonin, Valerio Mante, Matteo Carandini</p><p>Abstract: According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate on visual stimuli in a linear fashion. There is ample evidence, however, that LGN responses are not entirely linear. To account for nonlinearities we propose a model that synthesizes more than 30 years of research in the field. Model neurons have a linear receptive field, and a nonlinear, divisive suppressive field. The suppressive field computes local root-meansquare contrast. To test this model we recorded responses from LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. We estimate model parameters from a basic set of measurements and show that the model can accurately predict responses to novel stimuli. The model might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. It specifies how visual processing in LGN involves both linear filtering and divisive gain control. 1 In t rod u ct i on According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate linearly (Cai et al., 1997; Dan et al., 1996). Their response L(t) is the convolution of the map of stimulus contrast S(x,t) with a receptive field F(x,t): L (t ) = [ S∗ F ] ( 0, t ) The receptive field F(x,t) is typically taken to be a difference of Gaussians in space (Rodieck, 1965) and a difference of Gamma functions in time (Cai et al., 1997). This linear model accurately predicts the selectivity of responses for spatiotemporal frequency as measured with gratings (Cai et al., 1997; Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). It also predicts the main features of responses to complex dynamic video sequences (Dan et al., 1996). 150 spikes/s Data Model Figure 1. Response of an LGN neuron to a dynamic video sequence along with the prediction made by the linear model. Stimuli were sequences from Walt Disney’s “Tarzan”. From Mante et al. (2002). The linear model, however, suffers from limitations. For example, consider the response of an LGN neuron to a complex dynamic video sequences (Figure 1). The response is characterized by long periods of relative silence interspersed with brief events of high firing rate (Figure 1, thick traces). The linear model (Figure 1, thin traces) successfully predicts the timing of these firing events but fails to account for their magnitude (Mante et al., 2002). The limitations of the linear model are not surprising since there is ample evidence that LGN responses are nonlinear. For instance, responses to drifting gratings saturate as contrast is increased (Sclar et al., 1990) and are reduced, or masked, by superposition of a second grating (Bonin et al., 2002). Moreover, responses are selective for stimulus size (Cleland et al., 1983; Hubel and Wiesel, 1961; Jones and Sillito, 1991) in a nonlinear manner (Solomon et al., 2002). We propose that these and other nonlinearities can be explained by a nonlinear model incorporating a nonlinear suppressive field. The qualitative notion of a suppressive field was proposed three decades ago by Levick and collaborators (1972). We propose that the suppressive field computes local root-mean-square contrast, and operates divisively on the receptive field output. Basic elements of this model appeared in studies of contrast gain control in retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978) and in primary visual cortex (Cavanaugh et al., 2002; Heeger, 1992; Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). Some of these notions have been applied to LGN (Solomon et al., 2002), to fit responses to a limited set of stimuli with tailored parameter sets. Here we show that a single model with fixed parameters predicts responses to a broad range of stimuli. 2 Mod el In the model (Figure 2), the linear response of the receptive field L(t) is divided by the output of the suppressive field. The latter is a measure of local root-mean-square contrast c local. The result of the division is a generator potential V (t ) = Vmax L (t ) c50 + clocal , where c 50 is a constant.

The suppressive field operates on a filtered version of the stimulus, S*=S*H, where H is a linear filter and * denotes convolution. The squared output of the suppressive field is the local mean square (the local variance) of the filtered stimulus: clocal = S ( x, t ) G ( x ) dx dt , 2 * 2 ∫∫ where G(x) is a 2-dimensional Gaussian. Firing rate is a rectified version of generator potential, with threshold V thresh:   R(t ) = V (t ) − Vthresh + .   To test the nonlinear model, we recorded responses from neurons in the LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. Methods for these recordings were described elsewhere (Freeman et al., 2002). 3 Resu l t s We proceed in two steps: first we estimate model parameters by fitting the model to a large set of canonical data; second we fix model parameters and evaluate the model by predicting responses to a novel set of stimuli.

Solid curves indicate fit of nonlinear model. 3.1 C h a r a c te r i z i n g t he r e c e p ti v e fi e l d We obtain the parameters of the receptive field F(x,t) from responses to large drifting gratings (Figure 3). These stimuli elicit approximately constant output in the suppressive field, so they allow us to characterize the receptive field. Responses to different spatial frequencies constrain F(x,t) in space (Figure 3A). Responses to different temporal frequencies constrain F(x,t) in time (Figure 3B). 3.2 C h a r a c te r i z i n g t he s u p p r e s s i v e f i e l d To characterize the divisive stage, we start by measuring how responses saturate at high contrast (Figure 4A). A linear model cannot account for this contrast saturation (Figure 4A, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4A, solid curve) captures saturation because increases in receptive field output are attenuated by increases in suppressive field output. At low contrast, no saturation is observed because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50. From these data we estimate the value of c50. To obtain the parameters of the suppressive field, we recorded responses to sums of two drifting gratings (Figure 4B-D): an optimal test grating at 50% contrast, which elicits a large baseline response, and a mask grating that modulates this response. Test and mask temporal frequencies are incommensurate so that they temporally label a test response (at the frequency of the test) and a mask response (at the frequency of the mask) (Bonds, 1989). We vary mask attributes and study how they affect the test responses. Increasing mask contrast progressively suppresses responses (Figure 4B). The linear model fails to account for this suppression (Figure 4B, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4B, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask contrast increases the suppressive field output while the receptive field output (at the temporal frequency of the test) remains constant. With masks of low contrast there is little suppression because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50 . Similar effects are seen if we increase mask diameter. Responses decrease until they reach a plateau (Figure 4C). A linear model predicts no decrease (Figure 4C, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4C, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask diameter increases the suppressive field output while it does not affect the receptive field output. A plateau is reached once masks extend beyond the suppressive field. From these data we estimate the size of the Gaussian envelope G(x) of the suppressive field. Finally, the strength of suppression depends on mask spatial frequency (Figure 4D). At high frequencies, no suppression is elicited. Reducing spatial frequency increases suppression. This dependence of suppression on spatial frequency is captured in the nonlinear model by the filter H(x,t). From these data we estimate the spatial characteristics of the filter. From similar experiments involving different temporal frequencies (not shown), we estimate the filter’s selectivity for temporal frequency. 3.3 P r e d i c ti n g r e s p o n s e s t o n o v e l s ti m u l i We have seen that with a fixed set of parameters the model provides a good fit to a large set of measurements (Figure 3 and Figure 4). We now test whether the model predicts responses to a set of novel stimuli: drifting gratings varying in contrast and diameter. Responses to high contrast stimuli exhibit size tuning (Figure 5A, squares): they grow with size for small diameters, reach a maximum value at intermediate diameter and are reduced for large diameters (Jones and Sillito, 1991). Size tuning , however, strongly depends on stimulus contrast (Solomon et al., 2002): no size tuning is observed at low contrast (Figure 5A, circles). The model predicts these effects (Figure 5A, curves). For large, high contrast stimuli the output of the suppressive field is dominated by c local, resulting in suppression of responses. At low contrast, c local is much smaller than c50, and the suppressive field does not affect responses. Similar considerations can be made by plotting these data as a function of contrast (Figure 5B). As predicted by the nonlinear model (Figure 5B, curves), the effect of increasing contrast depends on stimulus size: responses to large stimuli show strong saturation (Figure 5B, squares), whereas responses to small stimuli grow linearly (Figure 5B, circles). The model predicts these effects because only large, high contrast stimuli elicit large enough responses from the suppressive field to cause suppression. For small, low contrast stimuli, instead, the linear model is a good approximation.

Curves show model predictions based on parameters as estimated in previous figures, not fitted to these data. A: Responses as function of diameter for different contrasts. B: Responses as function of contrast for different diameters. 3.4 M o d e l pe r f or m a nc e To assess model performance across neurons we calculate the percentage of variance in the data that is explained by the model (see Freeman et al., 2002 for methods). The model provides good fits to the data used to characterize the suppressive field (Figure 4), explaining more than 90% of the variance in the data for 9/13 cells (Figure 6A). Model parameters are then held fixed, and the model is used to predict responses to gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). The model performs well, explaining in 10/13 neurons above 90% of the variance in these novel data (Figure 6B, shaded histogram). The agreement between the quality of the fits and the quality of the predictions suggests that model parameters are well constrained and rules out a role of overfitting in determining the quality of the fits. To further confirm the performance of the model, in an additional 54 cells we ran a subset of the whole protocol, involving only the experiment for characterizing the receptive field (Figure 3), and the experiment involving gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). For these cells we estimate the suppressive field by fitting the model directly to the latter measurements. The model explains above 90% of the variance in these data in 20/54 neurons and more than 70% in 39/54 neurons (Figure 6B, white histogram). Considering the large size of the data set (more than 100 stimuli, requiring several hours of recordings per neuron) and the small number of free parameters (only 6 for the purpose of this work), the overall, quality of the model predictions is remarkable.

White histogram shows quality of fits. 4 Co n cl u si o n s The nonlinear model provides a unified description of visual processing in LGN neurons. Based on a fixed set of parameters, it can predict both linear properties (Figure 3), as well as nonlinear properties such as contrast saturation (Figure 4A) and masking (Figure 4B-D). Moreover, once the parameters are fixed, it predicts responses to novel stimuli (Figure 5). The model explains why responses are tuned for stimulus size at high contrast but not at low contrast, and it correctly predicts that only responses to large stimuli saturate with contrast, while responses to small stimuli grow linearly. The model implements a form of contrast gain control. A possible purpose for this gain control is to increase the range of contrast that can be transmitted given the limited dynamic range of single neurons. Divisive gain control may also play a role in population coding: a similar model applied to responses of primary visual cortex was shown to maximize independence of the responses across neurons (Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). We are working towards improving the model in two ways. First, we are characterizing the dynamics of the suppressive field, e.g. to predict how it responds to transient stimuli. Second, we are testing the assumption that the suppressive field computes root-mean-square contrast, a measure that solely depends on the secondorder moments of the light distribution. Our ultimate goal is to predict responses to complex stimuli such as those shown in Figure 1 and quantify to what degree the nonlinear model improves on the predictions of the linear model. Determining the role of visual nonlinearities under more natural stimulation conditions is also critical to understanding their function. The nonlinear model synthesizes more than 30 years of research. It is robust, tractable and generalizes to arbitrary stimuli. As a result it might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. Because the nonlinearities we discussed are already present in the retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978), and tend to get stronger as one ascends the visual hierarchy (Sclar et al., 1990), it may also be used to study how responses take shape from one stage to another in the visual system.

<p>Author: Nicoleta Roman, Deliang Wang, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: At a cocktail party, a listener can selectively attend to a single voice and filter out other acoustical interferences. How to simulate this perceptual ability remains a great challenge. This paper describes a novel supervised learning approach to speech segregation, in which a target speech signal is separated from interfering sounds using spatial location cues: interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural intensity differences (IID). Motivated by the auditory masking effect, we employ the notion of an ideal time-frequency binary mask, which selects the target if it is stronger than the interference in a local time-frequency unit. Within a narrow frequency band, modifications to the relative strength of the target source with respect to the interference trigger systematic changes for estimated ITD and IID. For a given spatial configuration, this interaction produces characteristic clustering in the binaural feature space. Consequently, we perform pattern classification in order to estimate ideal binary masks. A systematic evaluation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio as well as automatic speech recognition performance shows that the resulting system produces masks very close to ideal binary ones. A quantitative comparison shows that our model yields significant improvement in performance over an existing approach. Furthermore, under certain conditions the model produces large speech intelligibility improvements with normal listeners. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n The perceptual ability to detect, discriminate and recognize one utterance in a background of acoustic interference has been studied extensively under both monaural and binaural conditions [1, 2, 3]. The human auditory system is able to segregate a speech signal from an acoustic mixture using various cues, including fundamental frequency (F0), onset time and location, in a process that is known as auditory scene analysis (ASA) [1]. F0 is widely used in computational ASA systems that operate upon monaural input – however, systems that employ only this cue are limited to voiced speech [4, 5, 6]. Increased speech intelligibility in binaural listening compared to the monaural case has prompted research in designing cocktail-party processors based on spatial cues [7, 8, 9]. Such a system can be applied to, among other things, enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments and improving binaural hearing aid design. In this study, we propose a sound segregation model using binaural cues extracted from the responses of a KEMAR dummy head that realistically simulates the filtering process of the head, torso and external ear. A typical approach for signal reconstruction uses a time-frequency (T-F) mask: T-F units are weighted selectively in order to enhance the target signal. Here, we employ an ideal binary mask [6], which selects the T-F units where the signal energy is greater than the noise energy. The ideal mask notion is motivated by the human auditory masking phenomenon, in which a stronger signal masks a weaker one in the same critical band. In addition, from a theoretical ASA perspective, an ideal binary mask gives a performance ceiling for all binary masks. Moreover, such masks have been recently shown to provide a highly effective front-end for robust speech recognition [10]. We show for mixtures of multiple sound sources that there exists a strong correlation between the relative strength of target and interference and estimated ITD/IID, resulting in a characteristic clustering across frequency bands. Consequently, we employ a nonparametric classification method to determine decision regions in the joint ITDIID feature space that correspond to an optimal estimate for an ideal mask. Related models for estimating target masks through clustering have been proposed previously [11, 12]. Notably, the experimental results by Jourjine et al. [12] suggest that speech signals in a multiple-speaker condition obey to a large extent disjoint orthogonality in time and frequency. That is, at most one source has a nonzero energy at a specific time and frequency. Such models, however, assume input directly from microphone recordings and head-related filtering is not considered. Simulation of human binaural hearing introduces different constraints as well as clues to the problem. First, both ITD and IID should be utilized since IID is more reliable at higher frequencies than ITD. Second, frequency-dependent combinations of ITD and IID arise naturally for a fixed spatial configuration. Consequently, channel-dependent training should be performed for each frequency band. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains the architecture of the model and describes our method for azimuth localization. Section 3 is devoted to ideal binary mask estimation, which constitutes the core of the model. Section 4 presents the performance of the system and a quantitative comparison with the Bodden [7] model. Section 5 concludes our paper. 2 M od el a rch i t ect u re a n d a zi mu t h locali zat i o n Our model consists of the following stages: 1) a model of the auditory periphery; 2) frequency-dependent ITD/IID extraction and azimuth localization; 3) estimation of an ideal binary mask. The input to our model is a mixture of two or more signals presented at different, but fixed, locations. Signals are sampled at 44.1 kHz. We follow a standard procedure for simulating free-field acoustic signals from monaural signals (no reverberations are modeled). Binaural signals are obtained by filtering the monaural signals with measured head-related transfer functions (HRTF) from a KEMAR dummy head [13]. HRTFs introduce a natural combination of ITD and IID into the signals that is extracted in the subsequent stages of the model. To simulate the auditory periphery we use a bank of 128 gammatone filters in the range of 80 Hz to 5 kHz as described in [4]. In addition, the gains of the gammatone filters are adjusted in order to simulate the middle ear transfer function. In the final step of the peripheral model, the output of each gammatone filter is half-wave rectified in order to simulate firing rates of the auditory nerve. Saturation effects are modeled by taking the square root of the signal. Current models of azimuth localization almost invariably start with Jeffress’s crosscorrelation mechanism. For all frequency channels, we use the normalized crosscorrelation computed at lags equally distributed in the plausible range from –1 ms to 1 ms using an integration window of 20 ms. Frequency-dependent nonlinear transformations are used to map the time-delay axis onto the azimuth axis resulting in a cross-correlogram structure. In addition, a ‘skeleton’ cross-correlogram is formed by replacing the peaks in the cross-correlogram with Gaussians of narrower widths that are inversely proportional to the channel center frequency. This results in a sharpening effect, similar in principle to lateral inhibition. Assuming fixed sources, multiple locations are determined as peaks after summating the skeleton cross-correlogram across frequency and time. The number of sources and their locations computed here, as well as the target source location, feed to the next stage. 3 B i n a ry ma s k est i mat i on The objective of this stage of the model is to develop an efficient mechanism for estimating an ideal binary mask based on observed patterns of extracted ITD and IID features. Our theoretical analysis for two-source interactions in the case of pure tones shows relatively smooth changes for ITD and IID with the relative strength R between the two sources in narrow frequency bands [14]. More specifically, when the frequencies vary uniformly in a narrow band the derived mean values of ITD/IID estimates vary monotonically with respect to R. To capture this relationship in the context of real signals, statistics are collected for individual spatial configurations during training. We employ a training corpus consisting of 10 speech utterances from the TIMIT database (see [14] for details). In the two-source case, we divide the corpus in two equal sets: target and interference. In the three-source case, we select 4 signals for the target set and 2 interfering sets of 3 signals each. For all frequency channels, local estimates of ITD, IID and R are based on 20-ms time frames with 10 ms overlap between consecutive time frames. In order to eliminate the multi-peak ambiguity in the cross-correlation function for mid- and high-frequency channels, we use the following strategy. We compute ITDi as the peak location of the cross-correlation in the range 2π / ω i centered at the target ITD, where ω i indicates the center frequency of the ith channel. On the other hand, IID and R are computed as follows: ∑ t s i2 (t )     Ri = ∑ ∑ t li2 (t ) , t s i2 (t ) + ∑ ∑ t ri2 (t ) t ni2 (t )     IIDi = 20 log10 where l i and ri refer to the left and right peripheral output of the ith channel, respectively, s i refers to the output for the target signal, and ni that for the acoustic interference. In computing IIDi , we use 20 instead of 10 in order to compensate for the square root operation in the peripheral model. Fig. 1 shows empirical results obtained for a two-source configuration on the training corpus. The data exhibits a systematic shift for both ITD and IID with respect to the relative strength R. Moreover, the theoretical mean values obtained in the case of pure tones [14] match the empirical ones very well. This observation extends to multiple-source scenarios. As an example, Fig. 2 displays histograms that show the relationship between R and both ITD (Fig. 2A) and IID (Fig. 2B) for a three-source situation. Note that the interfering sources introduce systematic deviations for the binaural cues. Consider a worst case: the target is silent and two interferences have equal energy in a given T-F unit. This results in binaural cues indicating an auditory event at half of the distance between the two interference locations; for Fig. 2, it is 0° - the target location. However, the data in Fig. 2 has a low probability for this case and shows instead a clustering phenomenon, suggesting that in most cases only one source dominates a T-F unit.

Statistics are obtained for a channel with center frequency 1.5 kHz. A: Histogram of ITD and R samples. B: Histogram of IID and R samples. C: Clustering in the ITD-IID space. By displaying the information in the joint ITD-IID space (Fig. 2C), we observe location-based clustering of the binaural cues, which is clearly marked by strong peaks that correspond to distinct active sources. There exists a tradeoff between ITD and IID across frequencies, where ITD is most salient at low frequencies and IID at high frequencies [2]. But a fixed cutoff frequency that separates the effective use of ITD and IID does not exist for different spatial configurations. This motivates our choice of a joint ITD-IID feature space that optimizes the system performance across different configurations. Differential training seems necessary for different channels given that there exist variations of ITD and, especially, IID values for different center frequencies. Since the goal is to estimate an ideal binary mask, we focus on detecting decision regions in the 2-dimensional ITD-IID space for individual frequency channels. Consequently, supervised learning techniques can be applied. For the ith channel, we test the following two hypotheses. The first one is H 1 : target is dominant or Ri > 0.5 , and the second one is H 2 : interference is dominant or Ri < 0.5 . Based on the estimates of the bivariate densities p( x | H 1 ) and p( x | H 2 ) the classification is done by the maximum a posteriori decision rule: p( H 1 ) p( x | H 1 ) > p( H 2 ) p( x | H 2 ) . There exist a plethora of techniques for probability density estimation ranging from parametric techniques (e.g. mixture of Gaussians) to nonparametric ones (e.g. kernel density estimators). In order to completely characterize the distribution of the data we use the kernel density estimation method independently for each frequency channel. One approach for finding smoothing parameters is the least-squares crossvalidation method, which is utilized in our estimation. One cue not employed in our model is the interaural time difference between signal envelopes (IED). Auditory models generally employ IED in the high-frequency range where the auditory system becomes gradually insensitive to ITD. We have compared the performance of the three binaural cues: ITD, IID and IED and have found no benefit for using IED in our system after incorporating ITD and IID [14]. 4 Pe rfo rmanc e an d c omp arison The performance of a segregation system can be assessed in different ways, depending on intended applications. To extensively evaluate our model, we use the following three criteria: 1) a signal-to-noise (SNR) measure using the original target as signal; 2) ASR rates using our model as a front-end; and 3) human speech intelligibility tests. To conduct the SNR evaluation a segregated signal is reconstructed from a binary mask using a resynthesis method described in [5]. To quantitatively assess system performance, we measure the SNR using the original target speech as signal: ∑ t 2 s o (t ) ∑ SNR = 10 log 10 (s o (t ) − s e (t ))2 t where s o (t ) represents the resynthesized original speech and s e (t ) the reconstructed speech from an estimated mask. One can measure the initial SNR by replacing the denominator with s N (t ) , the resynthesized original interference. Fig. 3 shows the systematic results for two-source scenarios using the Cooke corpus [4], which is commonly used in sound separation studies. The corpus has 100 mixtures obtained from 10 speech utterances mixed with 10 types of intrusion. We compare the SNR gain obtained by our model against that obtained using the ideal binary mask across different noise types. Excellent results are obtained when the target is close to the median plane for an azimuth separation as small as 5°. Performance degrades when the target source is moved to the side of the head, from an average gain of 13.7 dB for the target in the median plane (Fig. 3A) to 1.7 dB when target is at 80° (Fig. 3B). When spatial separation increases the performance improves even for side targets, to an average gain of 14.5 dB in Fig. 3C. This performance profile is in qualitative agreement with experimental data [2]. Fig. 4 illustrates the performance in a three-source scenario with target in the median plane and two interfering sources at –30° and 30°. Here 5 speech signals from the Cooke corpus form the target set and the other 5 form one interference set. The second interference set contains the 10 intrusions. The performance degrades compared to the two-source situation, from an average SNR of about 12 dB to 4.1 dB. However, the average SNR gain obtained is approximately 11.3 dB. This ability of our model to segregate mixtures of more than two sources differs from blind source separation with independent component analysis. In order to draw a quantitative comparison, we have implemented Bodden’s cocktail-party processor using the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank [7]. The localization stage of this model uses an extended cross-correlation mechanism based on contralateral inhibition and it adapts to HRTFs. The separation stage of the model is based on estimation of the weights for a Wiener filter as the ratio between a desired excitation and an actual one. Although the Bodden model is more flexible by incorporating aspects of the precedence effect into the localization stage, the estimation of Wiener filter weights is less robust than our binary estimation of ideal masks. Shown in Fig. 5, our model shows a considerable improvement over the Bodden system, producing a 3.5 dB average improvement.

SNR comparison between the Bodden model (white bars) and our model (gray bars) for a two-source configuration: target at 0° and interference at 30°. Black bars correspond to the SNR of the initial mixture. For the ASR evaluation, we use the missing-data technique as described in [10]. In this approach, a continuous density hidden Markov model recognizer is modified such that only acoustic features indicated as reliable in a binary mask are used during decoding. Hence, it works seamlessly with the output from our speech segregation system. We have implemented the missing data algorithm with the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank. Feature vectors are obtained using the Hilbert envelope at the output of the gammatone filter. More specifically, each feature vector is extracted by smoothing the envelope using an 8-ms first-order filter, sampling at a frame-rate of 10 ms and finally log-compressing. We use the bounded marginalization method for classification [10]. The task domain is recognition of connected digits, and both training and testing are performed on acoustic features from the left ear signal using the male speaker dataset in the TIDigits database.

The performance of our model is systematically compared against the ideal masks for four SNR levels: 5 dB, 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB. Similarly, Fig. 6B shows the results for the three-source case with an added female speaker at -30°. The ideal mask exhibits only slight and gradual degradation in recognition performance with decreasing SNR and increasing number of sources. Observe that large improvements over baseline performance are obtained across all conditions. This shows the strong potential of applying our model to robust speech recognition. 80 60 40 20 5 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB 80 60 40 20 5 dB −10 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB Figure 6.

We use the Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentence database that contains short semantically predictable sentences [15]. The score is evaluated as the percentage of keywords correctly identified, ignoring minor errors such as tense and plurality. To eliminate potential location-based priming effects we randomly swap the locations for target and interference for different trials. In the unprocessed condition, binaural signals are produced by convolving original signals with the corresponding HRTFs and the signals are presented to a listener dichotically. In the processed condition, our algorithm is used to reconstruct the target signal at the better ear and results are presented diotically. 80 80 Keyword score (%) B100 Keyword score (%) A 100 60 40 20 0 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB 60 40 20 0 Figure 7.

Three SNR levels are tested: 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB, where the SNR is computed at the better ear. Here the target is a male speaker and the interference is babble noise. Our algorithm improves the intelligibility score for the tested conditions and the improvement becomes larger as the SNR decreases (61% at –10 dB). Our informal observations suggest, as expected, that the intelligibility score improves for unprocessed mixtures when two sources are more widely separated than 5°. Fig. 7B shows the results for a three-source configuration, where our model yields a 40% improvement. Here the interfering sources are one female speaker and another male speaker, resulting in an initial SNR of –10 dB at the better ear. 5 C onclu si on We have observed systematic deviations of the ITD and IID cues with respect to the relative strength between target and acoustic interference, and configuration-specific clustering in the joint ITD-IID feature space. Consequently, supervised learning of binaural patterns is employed for individual frequency channels and different spatial configurations to estimate an ideal binary mask that cancels acoustic energy in T-F units where interference is stronger. Evaluation using both SNR and ASR measures shows that the system estimates ideal binary masks very well. A comparison shows a significant improvement in performance over the Bodden model. Moreover, our model produces substantial speech intelligibility improvements for two and three source conditions.

<p>Author: Jeff Bondy, Ian Bruce, Suzanna Becker, Simon Haykin</p><p>Abstract: A major issue in evaluating speech enhancement and hearing compensation algorithms is to come up with a suitable metric that predicts intelligibility as judged by a human listener. Previous methods such as the widely used Speech Transmission Index (STI) fail to account for masking effects that arise from the highly nonlinear cochlear transfer function. We therefore propose a Neural Articulation Index (NAI) that estimates speech intelligibility from the instantaneous neural spike rate over time, produced when a signal is processed by an auditory neural model. By using a well developed model of the auditory periphery and detection theory we show that human perceptual discrimination closely matches the modeled distortion in the instantaneous spike rates of the auditory nerve. In highly rippled frequency transfer conditions the NAI’s prediction error is 8% versus the STI’s prediction error of 10.8%. 1 In trod u ction A wide range of intelligibility measures in current use rest on the assumption that intelligibility of a speech signal is based upon the sum of contributions of intelligibility within individual frequency bands, as first proposed by French and Steinberg [1]. This basic method applies a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a set of bands, then averages across these bands to come up with a prediction of intelligibility. French and Steinberg’s original Articulation Index (AI) is based on 20 equally contributing bands, and produces an intelligibility score between zero and one: 1 20 AI = (1) ∑ TI i , 20 i =1 th where TIi (Transmission Index i) is the normalized intelligibility in the i band. The TI per band is a function of the signal to noise ratio or: (2) SNRi + 12 30 for SNRs between –12 dB and 18 dB. A SNR of greater than 18 dB means that the band has perfect intelligibility and TI equals 1, while an SNR under –12 dB means that a band is not contributing at all, and the TI of that band equals 0. The overall intelligibility is then a function of the AI, but this function changes depending on the semantic context of the signal. TI i = Kryter validated many of the underlying AI principles [2]. Kryter also presented the mechanics for calculating the AI for different number of bands - 5,6,15 or the original 20 - as well as important correction factors [3]. Some of the most important correction factors account for the effects of modulated noise, peak clipping, and reverberation. Even with the application of various correction factors, the AI does not predict intelligibility in the presence of some time-domain distortions. Consequently, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) has been utilized to measure the loss of intelligibility due to echoes and reverberation [4]. Steeneken and Houtgast later extended this approach to include nonlinear distortions, giving a new name to the predictor: the Speech Transmission Index (STI) [5]. These metrics proved more valid for a larger range of environments and interferences. The STI test signal is a long-term average speech spectrum, gaussian random signal, amplitude modulated by a 0.63 Hz to 12.5 Hz tone. Acoustic components within different frequency bands are switched on and off over the testing sequence to come up with an intelligibility score between zero and one. Interband intermodulation sources can be discerned, as long as the product does not fall into the testing band. Therefore, the STI allows for standard AI-frequency band weighted SNR effects, MTF-time domain effects, and some limited measurements of nonlinearities. The STI shows a high correlation with empirical tests, and has been codified as an ANSI standard [6]. For general acoustics it is very good. However, the STI does not accurately model intraband masker non-linearities, phase distortions or the underlying auditory mechanisms (outside of independent frequency bands) We therefore sought to extend the AI/STI concepts to predict intelligibility, on the assumption that the closest physical variable we have to the perceptual variable of intelligibility is the auditory nerve response. Using a spiking model of the auditory periphery [7] we form the Neuronal Articulation Index (NAI) by describing distortions in the spike trains of different frequency bands. The spiking over time of an auditory nerve fiber for an undistorted speech signal (control case) is compared to the neural spiking over time for the same signal after undergoing some distortion (test case). The difference in the estimated instantaneous discharge rate for the two cases is used to calculate a neural equivalent to the TI, the Neural Distortion (ND), for each frequency band. Then the NAI is calculated with a weighted average of NDs at different Best Frequencies (BFs). In general detection theory terms, the control neuronal response sets some locus in a high dimensional space, then the distorted neuronal response will project near that locus if it is perceptually equivalent, or very far away if it is not. Thus, the distance between the control neuronal response and the distorted neuronal response is a function of intelligibility. Due to the limitations of the STI mentioned above it is predicted that a measure of the neural coding error will be a better predictor than SNR for human intelligibility word-scores. Our method also has the potential to shed light on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. 2 2.1 Meth o d Model The auditory periphery model used throughout (and hereafter referred to as the Auditory Model) is from [7]. The system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Block diagram of the computational model of the auditory periphery from the middle ear to the Auditory Nerve. Reprinted from Fig. 1 of [7] with permission from the Acoustical Society of America © (2003). The auditory periphery model comprises several sections, each providing a phenomenological description of a different part of the cat auditory periphery function. The first section models middle ear filtering. The second section, labeled the “control path,” captures the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) modulatory function, and includes a wideband, nonlinear, time varying, band-pass filter followed by an OHC nonlinearity (NL) and low-pass (LP) filter. This section controls the time-varying, nonlinear behavior of the narrowband signal-path basilar membrane (BM) filter. The control-path filter has a wider bandwidth than the signal-path filter to account for wideband nonlinear phenomena such as two-tone rate suppression. The third section of the model, labeled the “signal path”, describes the filter properties and traveling wave delay of the BM (time-varying, narrowband filter); the nonlinear transduction and low-pass filtering of the Inner Hair Cell (IHC NL and LP); spontaneous and driven activity and adaptation in synaptic transmission (synapse model); and spike generation and refractoriness in the auditory nerve (AN). In this model, CIHC and COHC are scaling constants that control IHC and OHC status, respectively. The parameters of the synapse section of the model are set to produce adaptation and discharge-rate versus level behavior appropriate for a high-spontaneous- rate/low-threshold auditory nerve fiber. In order to avoid having to generate many spike trains to obtain a reliable estimate of the instantaneous discharge rate over time, we instead use the synaptic release rate as an approximation of the discharge rate, ignoring the effects of neural refractoriness. 2.2 Neural articulation index These results emulate most of the simulations described in Chapter 2 of Steeneken’s thesis [8], as it describes the full development of an STI metric from inception to end. For those interested, the following simulations try to map most of the second chapter, but instead of basing the distortion metric on a SNR calculation, we use the neural distortion. There are two sets of experiments. The first, in section 3.1, deals with applying a frequency weighting structure to combine the band distortion values, while section 3.2 introduces redundancy factors also. The bands, chosen to match [8], are octave bands centered at [125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000] Hz. Only seven bands are used here. The Neural AI (NAI) for this is: NAI = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (3) th where •i is the i bands contribution and NTIi is the Neural Transmission Index in th the i band. Here all the •s sum to one, so each • factor can be thought of as the percentage contribution of a band to intelligibility. Since NTI is between [0,1], it can also be thought of as the percentage of acoustic features that are intelligible in a particular band. The ND per band is the projection of the distorted (Test) instantaneous spike rate against the clean (Control) instantaneous spike rate. ND = 1 − Test ⋅ Control T , Control ⋅ Control T (4) where Control and Test are vectors of the instantaneous spike rate over time, sampled at 22050 Hz. This type of error metric can only deal with steady state channel distortions, such as the ones used in [8]. ND was then linearly fit to resemble the TI equation 1-2, after normalizing each of the seven bands to have zero means and unit standard deviations across each of the seven bands. The NTI in the th i band was calculated as NDi − µ i (5) NTIi = m +b. σi NTIi is then thresholded to be no less then 0 and no greater then 1, following the TI thresholding. In equation (5) the factors, m = 2.5, b = -1, were the best linear fit to produce NTIi’s in bands with SNR greater then 15 dB of 1, bands with 7.5 dB SNR produce NTIi’s of 0.75, and bands with 0 dB SNR produced NTI i’s of 0.5. This closely followed the procedure outlined in section 2.3.3 of [8]. As the TI is a best linear fit of SNR to intelligibility, the NTI is a best linear fit of neural distortion to intelligibility. The input stimuli were taken from a Dutch corpus [9], and consisted of 10 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant (CVC) words, each spoken by four males and four females and sampled at 44100 Hz. The Steeneken study had many more, but the exact corpus could not be found. 80 total words is enough to produce meaningful frequency weighting factors. There were 26 frequency channel distortion conditions used for male speakers, 17 for female and three SNRs (+15 dB, +7.5 dB and 0 dB). The channel conditions were split into four groups given in Tables 1 through 4 for males, since females have negligible signal in the 125 Hz band, they used a subset, marked with an asterisk in Table 1 through Table 4.

A 1353 tap FIR filter was designed for each envelope condition. The female envelopes are a subset of these because they have no appreciable speech energy in the 125 Hz octave band. Using the 40 male utterances and 40 female utterances under distortion and calculating the NAI following equation (3) produces only a value between [0,1]. To produce a word-score intelligibility prediction between zero and 100 percent the NAI value was fit to a third order polynomial that produced the lowest standard deviation of error from empirical data. While Fletcher and Galt [10] state that the relation between AI and intelligibility is exponential, [8] fits with a third order polynomial, and we have chosen to compare to [8]. The empirical word-score intelligibility was from [8]. 3 3.1 R esu lts Determining frequency weighting structure For the first tests, the optimal frequency weights (the values of •i from equation 3) were designed through minimizing the difference between the predicted intelligibility and the empirical intelligibility. At each iteration one of the values was dithered up or down, and then the sum of the • i was normalized to one. This is very similar to [5] whose final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 12.8%, and 8.8% for females. The NAI’s final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 8.9%, and 7.1% for females. Figure 2 Relation between NAI and empirical word-score intelligibility for male (left) and female (right) speech with bandpass limiting and noise. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 8.9% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 12.8%, for females the fit has a s.d. = 7.1% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 8.8% The frequency weighting factors are similar for the NAI and the STI. The STI weighting factors from [8], which produced the optimal prediction of empirical data (male s.d. = 6.8%, female s.d. = 6.0%) and the NAI are plotted in Figure 3. Figure 3 Frequency weighting factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAI and published by Steeneken [8]. As one can see, the low frequency information is tremendously suppressed in the NAI, while the high frequencies are emphasized. This may be an effect of the stimuli corpus. The corpus has a high percentage of stops and fricatives in the initial and final consonant positions. Since these have a comparatively large amount of high frequency signal they may explain this discrepancy at the cost of the low frequency weights. [8] does state that these frequency weights are dependant upon the conditions used for evaluation. 3.2 Determining frequency weighting with redundancy factors In experiment two, rather then using equation (3) that assumes each frequency band contributes independently, we introduce redundancy factors. There is correlation between the different frequency bands of speech [11], which tends to make the STI over-predict intelligibility. The redundancy factors attempt to remove correlate signals between bands. Equation (3) then becomes: NAIr = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 − β 1 NTI1 ⋅ NTI2 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 − β 1 NTI2 ⋅ NTI3 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (6) where the r subscript denotes a redundant NAI and • is the correlation factor. Only adjacent bands are used here to reduce complexity. We replicated Section 3.1 except using equation 6. The same testing, and adaptation strategy from Section 3.1 was used to find the optimal •s and •s. Figure 4 Relation between NAIr and empirical word-score intelligibility for male speech (right) and female speech (left) with bandpass limiting and noise with Redundancy Factors. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 6.9% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.7%, for females the best fitting polynomial has a s.d. = 5.4% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.0%. The frequency weighting and redundancy factors given as optimal in Steeneken, versus calculated through optimizing the NAIr are given in Figure 5. Figure 5 Frequency and redundancy factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAIr and published in [8]. The frequency weights for the NAIr and STIr are more similar than in Section 3.1. The redundancy factors are very different though. The NAI redundancy factors show no real frequency dependence unlike the convex STI redundancy factors. This may be due to differences in optimization that were not clear in [8]. Table 5: Standard Deviation of Prediction Error NAI STI [5] STI [8] MALE EQ. 3 8.9 % 12.8 % 6.8 % FEMALE EQ. 3 7.1 % 8.8 % 6.0 % MALE EQ. 6 6.9 % 4.7 % FEMALE EQ. 6 5.4 % 4.0 % The mean difference in error between the STI r, as given in [8], and the NAIr is 1.7%. This difference may be from the limited CVC word choice. It is well within the range of normal speaker variation, about 2%, so we believe that the NAI and NAIr are comparable to the STI and STI r in predicting speech intelligibility. 4 Conclusions These results are very encouraging. The NAI provides a modest improvement over STI in predicting intelligibility. We do not propose this as a replacement for the STI for general acoustics since the NAI is much more computationally complex then the STI. The NAI’s end applications are in predicting hearing impairment intelligibility and using statistical decision theory to describe the auditory systems feature extractors - tasks which the STI cannot do, but are available to the NAI. While the AI and STI can take into account threshold shifts in a hearing impaired individual, neither can account for sensorineural, suprathreshold degradations [12]. The accuracy of this model, based on cat anatomy and physiology, in predicting human speech intelligibility provides strong validation of attempts to design hearing aid amplification schemes based on physiological data and models [13]. By quantifying the hearing impairment in an intelligibility metric by way of a damaged auditory model one can provide a more accurate assessment of the distortion, probe how the distortion is changing the neuronal response and provide feedback for preprocessing via a hearing aid before the impairment. The NAI may also give insight into how the ear codes stimuli for the very robust, human auditory system. References [1] French, N.R. & Steinberg, J.C.

<p>Author: Tomohiro Nakatani, Masato Miyoshi, Keisuke Kinoshita</p><p>Abstract: Speech dereverberation is desirable with a view to achieving, for example, robust speech recognition in the real world. However, it is still a challenging problem, especially when using a single microphone. Although blind equalization techniques have been exploited, they cannot deal with speech signals appropriately because their assumptions are not satisﬁed by speech signals. We propose a new dereverberation principle based on an inherent property of speech signals, namely quasi-periodicity. The present methods learn the dereverberation ﬁlter from a lot of speech data with no prior knowledge of the data, and can achieve high quality speech dereverberation especially when the reverberation time is long. 1</p><p>5 0.58315772 <a title="5-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Probabilistic_Inference_of_Speech_Signals_from_Phaseless_Spectrograms.html">162 nips-2003-Probabilistic Inference of Speech Signals from Phaseless Spectrograms</a></p>
<p>Author: Kannan Achan, Sam T. Roweis, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques for complex speech processing such as denoising and deconvolution, time/frequency warping, multiple speaker separation, and multiple microphone analysis operate on sequences of short-time power spectra (spectrograms), a representation which is often well-suited to these tasks. However, a signiﬁcant problem with algorithms that manipulate spectrograms is that the output spectrogram does not include a phase component, which is needed to create a time-domain signal that has good perceptual quality. Here we describe a generative model of time-domain speech signals and their spectrograms, and show how an efﬁcient optimizer can be used to ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori speech signal, given the spectrogram. In contrast to techniques that alternate between estimating the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal, our technique directly infers the speech signal, thus jointly optimizing the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal. We compare our technique with a standard method using signal-to-noise ratios, but we also provide audio ﬁles on the web for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in perceptual quality that our technique offers. 1</p><p>6 0.4387233 <a title="5-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Sensory_Modality_Segregation.html">175 nips-2003-Sensory Modality Segregation</a></p>

<p>Author: Nicoleta Roman, Deliang Wang, Guy J. Brown</p><p>Abstract: At a cocktail party, a listener can selectively attend to a single voice and filter out other acoustical interferences. How to simulate this perceptual ability remains a great challenge. This paper describes a novel supervised learning approach to speech segregation, in which a target speech signal is separated from interfering sounds using spatial location cues: interaural time differences (ITD) and interaural intensity differences (IID). Motivated by the auditory masking effect, we employ the notion of an ideal time-frequency binary mask, which selects the target if it is stronger than the interference in a local time-frequency unit. Within a narrow frequency band, modifications to the relative strength of the target source with respect to the interference trigger systematic changes for estimated ITD and IID. For a given spatial configuration, this interaction produces characteristic clustering in the binaural feature space. Consequently, we perform pattern classification in order to estimate ideal binary masks. A systematic evaluation in terms of signal-to-noise ratio as well as automatic speech recognition performance shows that the resulting system produces masks very close to ideal binary ones. A quantitative comparison shows that our model yields significant improvement in performance over an existing approach. Furthermore, under certain conditions the model produces large speech intelligibility improvements with normal listeners. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n The perceptual ability to detect, discriminate and recognize one utterance in a background of acoustic interference has been studied extensively under both monaural and binaural conditions [1, 2, 3]. The human auditory system is able to segregate a speech signal from an acoustic mixture using various cues, including fundamental frequency (F0), onset time and location, in a process that is known as auditory scene analysis (ASA) [1]. F0 is widely used in computational ASA systems that operate upon monaural input – however, systems that employ only this cue are limited to voiced speech [4, 5, 6]. Increased speech intelligibility in binaural listening compared to the monaural case has prompted research in designing cocktail-party processors based on spatial cues [7, 8, 9]. Such a system can be applied to, among other things, enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments and improving binaural hearing aid design. In this study, we propose a sound segregation model using binaural cues extracted from the responses of a KEMAR dummy head that realistically simulates the filtering process of the head, torso and external ear. A typical approach for signal reconstruction uses a time-frequency (T-F) mask: T-F units are weighted selectively in order to enhance the target signal. Here, we employ an ideal binary mask [6], which selects the T-F units where the signal energy is greater than the noise energy. The ideal mask notion is motivated by the human auditory masking phenomenon, in which a stronger signal masks a weaker one in the same critical band. In addition, from a theoretical ASA perspective, an ideal binary mask gives a performance ceiling for all binary masks. Moreover, such masks have been recently shown to provide a highly effective front-end for robust speech recognition [10]. We show for mixtures of multiple sound sources that there exists a strong correlation between the relative strength of target and interference and estimated ITD/IID, resulting in a characteristic clustering across frequency bands. Consequently, we employ a nonparametric classification method to determine decision regions in the joint ITDIID feature space that correspond to an optimal estimate for an ideal mask. Related models for estimating target masks through clustering have been proposed previously [11, 12]. Notably, the experimental results by Jourjine et al. [12] suggest that speech signals in a multiple-speaker condition obey to a large extent disjoint orthogonality in time and frequency. That is, at most one source has a nonzero energy at a specific time and frequency. Such models, however, assume input directly from microphone recordings and head-related filtering is not considered. Simulation of human binaural hearing introduces different constraints as well as clues to the problem. First, both ITD and IID should be utilized since IID is more reliable at higher frequencies than ITD. Second, frequency-dependent combinations of ITD and IID arise naturally for a fixed spatial configuration. Consequently, channel-dependent training should be performed for each frequency band. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The next section contains the architecture of the model and describes our method for azimuth localization. Section 3 is devoted to ideal binary mask estimation, which constitutes the core of the model. Section 4 presents the performance of the system and a quantitative comparison with the Bodden [7] model. Section 5 concludes our paper. 2 M od el a rch i t ect u re a n d a zi mu t h locali zat i o n Our model consists of the following stages: 1) a model of the auditory periphery; 2) frequency-dependent ITD/IID extraction and azimuth localization; 3) estimation of an ideal binary mask. The input to our model is a mixture of two or more signals presented at different, but fixed, locations. Signals are sampled at 44.1 kHz. We follow a standard procedure for simulating free-field acoustic signals from monaural signals (no reverberations are modeled). Binaural signals are obtained by filtering the monaural signals with measured head-related transfer functions (HRTF) from a KEMAR dummy head [13]. HRTFs introduce a natural combination of ITD and IID into the signals that is extracted in the subsequent stages of the model. To simulate the auditory periphery we use a bank of 128 gammatone filters in the range of 80 Hz to 5 kHz as described in [4]. In addition, the gains of the gammatone filters are adjusted in order to simulate the middle ear transfer function. In the final step of the peripheral model, the output of each gammatone filter is half-wave rectified in order to simulate firing rates of the auditory nerve. Saturation effects are modeled by taking the square root of the signal. Current models of azimuth localization almost invariably start with Jeffress’s crosscorrelation mechanism. For all frequency channels, we use the normalized crosscorrelation computed at lags equally distributed in the plausible range from –1 ms to 1 ms using an integration window of 20 ms. Frequency-dependent nonlinear transformations are used to map the time-delay axis onto the azimuth axis resulting in a cross-correlogram structure. In addition, a ‘skeleton’ cross-correlogram is formed by replacing the peaks in the cross-correlogram with Gaussians of narrower widths that are inversely proportional to the channel center frequency. This results in a sharpening effect, similar in principle to lateral inhibition. Assuming fixed sources, multiple locations are determined as peaks after summating the skeleton cross-correlogram across frequency and time. The number of sources and their locations computed here, as well as the target source location, feed to the next stage. 3 B i n a ry ma s k est i mat i on The objective of this stage of the model is to develop an efficient mechanism for estimating an ideal binary mask based on observed patterns of extracted ITD and IID features. Our theoretical analysis for two-source interactions in the case of pure tones shows relatively smooth changes for ITD and IID with the relative strength R between the two sources in narrow frequency bands [14]. More specifically, when the frequencies vary uniformly in a narrow band the derived mean values of ITD/IID estimates vary monotonically with respect to R. To capture this relationship in the context of real signals, statistics are collected for individual spatial configurations during training. We employ a training corpus consisting of 10 speech utterances from the TIMIT database (see [14] for details). In the two-source case, we divide the corpus in two equal sets: target and interference. In the three-source case, we select 4 signals for the target set and 2 interfering sets of 3 signals each. For all frequency channels, local estimates of ITD, IID and R are based on 20-ms time frames with 10 ms overlap between consecutive time frames. In order to eliminate the multi-peak ambiguity in the cross-correlation function for mid- and high-frequency channels, we use the following strategy. We compute ITDi as the peak location of the cross-correlation in the range 2π / ω i centered at the target ITD, where ω i indicates the center frequency of the ith channel. On the other hand, IID and R are computed as follows: ∑ t s i2 (t )     Ri = ∑ ∑ t li2 (t ) , t s i2 (t ) + ∑ ∑ t ri2 (t ) t ni2 (t )     IIDi = 20 log10 where l i and ri refer to the left and right peripheral output of the ith channel, respectively, s i refers to the output for the target signal, and ni that for the acoustic interference. In computing IIDi , we use 20 instead of 10 in order to compensate for the square root operation in the peripheral model. Fig. 1 shows empirical results obtained for a two-source configuration on the training corpus. The data exhibits a systematic shift for both ITD and IID with respect to the relative strength R. Moreover, the theoretical mean values obtained in the case of pure tones [14] match the empirical ones very well. This observation extends to multiple-source scenarios. As an example, Fig. 2 displays histograms that show the relationship between R and both ITD (Fig. 2A) and IID (Fig. 2B) for a three-source situation. Note that the interfering sources introduce systematic deviations for the binaural cues. Consider a worst case: the target is silent and two interferences have equal energy in a given T-F unit. This results in binaural cues indicating an auditory event at half of the distance between the two interference locations; for Fig. 2, it is 0° - the target location. However, the data in Fig. 2 has a low probability for this case and shows instead a clustering phenomenon, suggesting that in most cases only one source dominates a T-F unit.

Statistics are obtained for a channel with center frequency 1.5 kHz. A: Histogram of ITD and R samples. B: Histogram of IID and R samples. C: Clustering in the ITD-IID space. By displaying the information in the joint ITD-IID space (Fig. 2C), we observe location-based clustering of the binaural cues, which is clearly marked by strong peaks that correspond to distinct active sources. There exists a tradeoff between ITD and IID across frequencies, where ITD is most salient at low frequencies and IID at high frequencies [2]. But a fixed cutoff frequency that separates the effective use of ITD and IID does not exist for different spatial configurations. This motivates our choice of a joint ITD-IID feature space that optimizes the system performance across different configurations. Differential training seems necessary for different channels given that there exist variations of ITD and, especially, IID values for different center frequencies. Since the goal is to estimate an ideal binary mask, we focus on detecting decision regions in the 2-dimensional ITD-IID space for individual frequency channels. Consequently, supervised learning techniques can be applied. For the ith channel, we test the following two hypotheses. The first one is H 1 : target is dominant or Ri > 0.5 , and the second one is H 2 : interference is dominant or Ri < 0.5 . Based on the estimates of the bivariate densities p( x | H 1 ) and p( x | H 2 ) the classification is done by the maximum a posteriori decision rule: p( H 1 ) p( x | H 1 ) > p( H 2 ) p( x | H 2 ) . There exist a plethora of techniques for probability density estimation ranging from parametric techniques (e.g. mixture of Gaussians) to nonparametric ones (e.g. kernel density estimators). In order to completely characterize the distribution of the data we use the kernel density estimation method independently for each frequency channel. One approach for finding smoothing parameters is the least-squares crossvalidation method, which is utilized in our estimation. One cue not employed in our model is the interaural time difference between signal envelopes (IED). Auditory models generally employ IED in the high-frequency range where the auditory system becomes gradually insensitive to ITD. We have compared the performance of the three binaural cues: ITD, IID and IED and have found no benefit for using IED in our system after incorporating ITD and IID [14]. 4 Pe rfo rmanc e an d c omp arison The performance of a segregation system can be assessed in different ways, depending on intended applications. To extensively evaluate our model, we use the following three criteria: 1) a signal-to-noise (SNR) measure using the original target as signal; 2) ASR rates using our model as a front-end; and 3) human speech intelligibility tests. To conduct the SNR evaluation a segregated signal is reconstructed from a binary mask using a resynthesis method described in [5]. To quantitatively assess system performance, we measure the SNR using the original target speech as signal: ∑ t 2 s o (t ) ∑ SNR = 10 log 10 (s o (t ) − s e (t ))2 t where s o (t ) represents the resynthesized original speech and s e (t ) the reconstructed speech from an estimated mask. One can measure the initial SNR by replacing the denominator with s N (t ) , the resynthesized original interference. Fig. 3 shows the systematic results for two-source scenarios using the Cooke corpus [4], which is commonly used in sound separation studies. The corpus has 100 mixtures obtained from 10 speech utterances mixed with 10 types of intrusion. We compare the SNR gain obtained by our model against that obtained using the ideal binary mask across different noise types. Excellent results are obtained when the target is close to the median plane for an azimuth separation as small as 5°. Performance degrades when the target source is moved to the side of the head, from an average gain of 13.7 dB for the target in the median plane (Fig. 3A) to 1.7 dB when target is at 80° (Fig. 3B). When spatial separation increases the performance improves even for side targets, to an average gain of 14.5 dB in Fig. 3C. This performance profile is in qualitative agreement with experimental data [2]. Fig. 4 illustrates the performance in a three-source scenario with target in the median plane and two interfering sources at –30° and 30°. Here 5 speech signals from the Cooke corpus form the target set and the other 5 form one interference set. The second interference set contains the 10 intrusions. The performance degrades compared to the two-source situation, from an average SNR of about 12 dB to 4.1 dB. However, the average SNR gain obtained is approximately 11.3 dB. This ability of our model to segregate mixtures of more than two sources differs from blind source separation with independent component analysis. In order to draw a quantitative comparison, we have implemented Bodden’s cocktail-party processor using the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank [7]. The localization stage of this model uses an extended cross-correlation mechanism based on contralateral inhibition and it adapts to HRTFs. The separation stage of the model is based on estimation of the weights for a Wiener filter as the ratio between a desired excitation and an actual one. Although the Bodden model is more flexible by incorporating aspects of the precedence effect into the localization stage, the estimation of Wiener filter weights is less robust than our binary estimation of ideal masks. Shown in Fig. 5, our model shows a considerable improvement over the Bodden system, producing a 3.5 dB average improvement.

Black bars correspond to the SNR of the initial mixture. For the ASR evaluation, we use the missing-data technique as described in [10]. In this approach, a continuous density hidden Markov model recognizer is modified such that only acoustic features indicated as reliable in a binary mask are used during decoding. Hence, it works seamlessly with the output from our speech segregation system. We have implemented the missing data algorithm with the same 128-channel gammatone filterbank. Feature vectors are obtained using the Hilbert envelope at the output of the gammatone filter. More specifically, each feature vector is extracted by smoothing the envelope using an 8-ms first-order filter, sampling at a frame-rate of 10 ms and finally log-compressing. We use the bounded marginalization method for classification [10]. The task domain is recognition of connected digits, and both training and testing are performed on acoustic features from the left ear signal using the male speaker dataset in the TIDigits database.

The performance of our model is systematically compared against the ideal masks for four SNR levels: 5 dB, 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB. Similarly, Fig. 6B shows the results for the three-source case with an added female speaker at -30°. The ideal mask exhibits only slight and gradual degradation in recognition performance with decreasing SNR and increasing number of sources. Observe that large improvements over baseline performance are obtained across all conditions. This shows the strong potential of applying our model to robust speech recognition. 80 60 40 20 5 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB 80 60 40 20 5 dB −10 dB Baseline Ideal Mask Estimated Mask 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB Figure 6.

We use the Bamford-Kowal-Bench sentence database that contains short semantically predictable sentences [15]. The score is evaluated as the percentage of keywords correctly identified, ignoring minor errors such as tense and plurality. To eliminate potential location-based priming effects we randomly swap the locations for target and interference for different trials. In the unprocessed condition, binaural signals are produced by convolving original signals with the corresponding HRTFs and the signals are presented to a listener dichotically. In the processed condition, our algorithm is used to reconstruct the target signal at the better ear and results are presented diotically. 80 80 Keyword score (%) B100 Keyword score (%) A 100 60 40 20 0 0 dB −5 dB −10 dB 60 40 20 0 Figure 7.

Three SNR levels are tested: 0 dB, -5 dB and –10 dB, where the SNR is computed at the better ear. Here the target is a male speaker and the interference is babble noise. Our algorithm improves the intelligibility score for the tested conditions and the improvement becomes larger as the SNR decreases (61% at –10 dB). Our informal observations suggest, as expected, that the intelligibility score improves for unprocessed mixtures when two sources are more widely separated than 5°. Fig. 7B shows the results for a three-source configuration, where our model yields a 40% improvement. Here the interfering sources are one female speaker and another male speaker, resulting in an initial SNR of –10 dB at the better ear. 5 C onclu si on We have observed systematic deviations of the ITD and IID cues with respect to the relative strength between target and acoustic interference, and configuration-specific clustering in the joint ITD-IID feature space. Consequently, supervised learning of binaural patterns is employed for individual frequency channels and different spatial configurations to estimate an ideal binary mask that cancels acoustic energy in T-F units where interference is stronger. Evaluation using both SNR and ASR measures shows that the system estimates ideal binary masks very well. A comparison shows a significant improvement in performance over the Bodden model. Moreover, our model produces substantial speech intelligibility improvements for two and three source conditions.

<p>Author: Kannan Achan, Sam T. Roweis, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: Many techniques for complex speech processing such as denoising and deconvolution, time/frequency warping, multiple speaker separation, and multiple microphone analysis operate on sequences of short-time power spectra (spectrograms), a representation which is often well-suited to these tasks. However, a signiﬁcant problem with algorithms that manipulate spectrograms is that the output spectrogram does not include a phase component, which is needed to create a time-domain signal that has good perceptual quality. Here we describe a generative model of time-domain speech signals and their spectrograms, and show how an efﬁcient optimizer can be used to ﬁnd the maximum a posteriori speech signal, given the spectrogram. In contrast to techniques that alternate between estimating the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal, our technique directly infers the speech signal, thus jointly optimizing the phase and a spectrally-consistent signal. We compare our technique with a standard method using signal-to-noise ratios, but we also provide audio ﬁles on the web for the purpose of demonstrating the improvement in perceptual quality that our technique offers. 1</p><p>4 0.44383895 <a title="5-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-A_Probabilistic_Model_of_Auditory_Space_Representation_in_the_Barn_Owl.html">15 nips-2003-A Probabilistic Model of Auditory Space Representation in the Barn Owl</a></p>

<p>Author: Kazuyuki Samejima, Kenji Doya, Yasumasa Ueda, Minoru Kimura</p><p>Abstract: When we model a higher order functions, such as learning and memory, we face a difﬁculty of comparing neural activities with hidden variables that depend on the history of sensory and motor signals and the dynamics of the network. Here, we propose novel method for estimating hidden variables of a learning agent, such as connection weights from sequences of observable variables. Bayesian estimation is a method to estimate the posterior probability of hidden variables from observable data sequence using a dynamic model of hidden and observable variables. In this paper, we apply particle ﬁlter for estimating internal parameters and metaparameters of a reinforcement learning model. We veriﬁed the effectiveness of the method using both artiﬁcial data and real animal behavioral data. 1</p><p>6 0.4423773 <a title="5-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Algorithms_for_Large-State-Space_HMMs_with_Applications_to_Web_Usage_Analysis.html">70 nips-2003-Fast Algorithms for Large-State-Space HMMs with Applications to Web Usage Analysis</a></p>

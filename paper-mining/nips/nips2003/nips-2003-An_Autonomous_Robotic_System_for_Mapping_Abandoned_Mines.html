</p><p>4 1  Introduction  This paper describes the navigation software of a deployed robotic system for mapping subterranean spaces such as abandoned mines. [sent-16, score-0.503]
</p><p>5 Subsidence of abandoned mines poses a major problem for society, as do ground water contaminations, mine £res, and so on. [sent-17, score-0.979]
</p><p>6 Most abandoned mines are inaccessible to people, but some are accessible to robots. [sent-18, score-0.524]
</p><p>7 When exploring and mapping unknown mines, it alternates short phases of motion guided by 2D range scans, with phases in which the vehicle rests to acquire 3D range scans. [sent-21, score-0.406]
</p><p>8 An analysis of the 3D scans leads to a path that is then executed, using rapidly acquired 2D scans to determine the robot’s motion relative to the 3D map. [sent-22, score-0.616]
</p><p>9 Acquiring consistent large-scale maps without external geo-referencing through GPS is largely considered an open research issue. [sent-24, score-0.206]
</p><p>10 Our approach relies on ef£cient statistical techniques for generating such maps in real-time. [sent-25, score-0.174]
</p><p>11 At the lowest level, we employ a fast scan matching algorithm for registering successive scans, thereby recovering robot odometry. [sent-26, score-0.568]
</p><p>12 Groups of scans are then converted into local maps, using Markov random £eld representations (MRFs) to characterize the residual path uncertainty. [sent-27, score-0.315]
</p><p>13 However, the brittleness of the ML approach is overcome by a “lazy” data association mechanism that can undo and redo past associations so as to maximize the overall map consistency. [sent-29, score-0.355]
</p><p>14 To navigate, local 3D scans are mapped into 2 1 D terrain maps, by analyzing surface gradi2 ents and vertical clearance in the 3D scans. [sent-30, score-0.513]
</p><p>15 The result is subsequently transformed into cost  Figure 1: The Groundhog robot is a 1,500 pound custom-built vehicle equipped with onboard computing, laser range sensing, gas and sinkage sensors, and video recording equipment. [sent-31, score-0.588]
</p><p>16 Its purpose is to explore and map abandoned mines. [sent-32, score-0.417]
</p><p>17 functions expressed in the robot’s three-dimensional con£guration space, by convolving the 2 1 D terrain maps with kernels that describe the robot’s footprints in different orienta2 tions. [sent-33, score-0.432]
</p><p>18 Some of the results reported here were obtained via manual control in mines accessible to people. [sent-36, score-0.242]
</p><p>19 Others involved fully autonomous exploration, for which our robot operated fully self-guided for several hours beyond the reach of radio communication. [sent-37, score-0.38]
</p><p>20 1 Generating Locally Consistent Maps As in [6, 9], we apply an incremental scan matching technique for registering scans, acquired using a forward-pointed laser range £nder while the vehicle is in motion. [sent-39, score-0.806]
</p><p>21 This algorithm aligns scans by iteratively identifying nearby points in pairs of consecutive range scans, and then calculating the relative displacement and orientation of these scans by minimizing the quadratic distance of these pairs of points [2]. [sent-40, score-0.41]
</p><p>22 This approach leads to the recovery of two quantities: locally consistent maps and an estimate of the robot’s motion. [sent-41, score-0.233]
</p><p>23 It is well-understood [3, 6], however, that local scan matching is incapable of achieving globally consistent maps. [sent-42, score-0.384]
</p><p>24 This is because of the residual error in scan matching, which accumulates over time. [sent-43, score-0.249]
</p><p>25 The limitation is apparent in the map shown in Figure 2a, which is the result of applying local scan matching in a mine that is approximately 250 meters wide. [sent-44, score-1.089]
</p><p>26 Our approach addresses this problem by explicitly representing the uncertainty in the map and the path using a Markov random £eld (MRF) [11]. [sent-45, score-0.225]
</p><p>27 More speci£cally, the data acquired through every £ve meters of consecutive robot motion is mapped into a local map [3]. [sent-46, score-0.773]
</p><p>28 The absolute location of orientation of the k-th map will be denoted by ξk = ( xk yk θk )T ; here x and y are the Cartesian coordinates and θ is the orientation. [sent-48, score-0.159]
</p><p>29 Figure 3b shows the MRF for the data collected in the  (a)  (b)  Figure 2: Mine map with incremental ML scan matching (left) and using our lazy data association approach (right). [sent-56, score-0.681]
</p><p>30 2  Enforcing Global Consistency  The key advantage of the MRF representation is that it encompasses the residual uncertainty in local scan matching. [sent-61, score-0.291]
</p><p>31 This enables us to alter the shape of the map in accordance with global consistency constraints. [sent-62, score-0.159]
</p><p>32 These constraints are obtained by matching local maps acquired at different points in time (e. [sent-63, score-0.45]
</p><p>33 In particular, if the k-th map overlaps with some map j acquired at an earlier point in time, our approach localizes the robot relative to this map using once again local scan matching. [sent-66, score-1.137]
</p><p>34 As a result, it recovers a relative constraint φ(ξk , ξj ) between the coordinates of non-adjacent maps ξk and ξj . [sent-67, score-0.174]
</p><p>35 , the solution of the recursion (1) without the additional data association constraints). [sent-83, score-0.165]
</p><p>36 (b) The Markov random £eld: Each node is the center of a local map, acquired when traversing the Bruceton Research Mine near Pittsburgh, PA. [sent-85, score-0.277]
</p><p>37 ¯  ξj f (ξj , δk,j )  ¯ is the Jacobean of f (ξj , δk,j ) at ξj :   ¯ ¯ 1 0 −∆xk,j sin θk + ∆yk,j cos θk ¯ ¯ Fk,j x =  0 1 −∆xk,j cos θk − ∆yk,j sin θk  0 0 1  (5)  The resulting negative log-likelihood is given by − log p(Ξ) ≈ const. [sent-86, score-0.168]
</p><p>38 Empirically, we £nd that this inversion can be performed very ef£ciently using an inversion algorithm described in [15]; it only requires a few seconds for matrices composed of hundreds of local map positions (and it appears to be numerically more stable than the solution in [11, 6]). [sent-91, score-0.201]
</p><p>39 3 Lazy Data Association Search Unfortunately, the approach described thus far leads only to a consistent map when the additional constraints φ(ξk , ξj ) obtained after loop closure are correct. [sent-95, score-0.358]
</p><p>40 These constraints amount to a maximum likelihood solution for the challenging data association problem that arises when closing a loop. [sent-96, score-0.229]
</p><p>41 Figure 4a depicts such a situation, obtained when operating our vehicle in a large abandoned mine. [sent-98, score-0.492]
</p><p>42 As long as the correct such closure is in the set of surviving particle £lters, the correct map can be recovered. [sent-102, score-0.255]
</p><p>43 In the context of our present system, this approach suffers from two disadvantages: it is computationally expensive due to its proactive nature, and it provides no mechanism for recovery should the correct loop closure not be represented in the particle set. [sent-103, score-0.237]
</p><p>44 However, it also provides a mechanism to undo and redo past data association decisions. [sent-106, score-0.196]
</p><p>45 If this likelihood falls below a threshold, data association constraints are recursively undone and replaced by other constraints of decreasing likelihood (including the possibility of not generating a constraint at all). [sent-108, score-0.218]
</p><p>46 The search terminates if the likelihood of the most recent measurement  (a)  (b)  con¤ict  ¨ % ¨  map after adjustment  ' start  Figure 4: Example of our lazy data association technique: When closing a large loop, the robot £rst erroneously assumes the existence of a second, parallel hallway. [sent-109, score-0.742]
</p><p>47 However, this model leads to a gross inconsistency as the robot encounters a corridor at a right angle. [sent-110, score-0.361]
</p><p>48 At this point, our approach recursively searches for improved data association decisions, arriving at the map shown on the right. [sent-111, score-0.309]
</p><p>49 The left panel shows the ML association after traversing a large loop inside a mine: At £rst, it appears that the existence of two adjacent corridors is more likely than a single one, according to the estimated robot motion. [sent-115, score-0.56]
</p><p>50 However, as the robot approaches a turn, a noticeable inconsistency is detected. [sent-116, score-0.259]
</p><p>51 As a result, our data association mechanism recursively removes past data association constraints back to the most recent loop closure, and then “tries” the second most likely hypothesis. [sent-118, score-0.383]
</p><p>52 The backtracking requires a fraction of a second, and with high likelihood leads to a globally consistent map and, as a side-effect, to an improved estimate of the map coordinates Ξ. [sent-120, score-0.415]
</p><p>53 3  Autonomous Navigation  2D maps are suf£cient for localizing robots inside mines; however, they are insuf£cient to navigate a robot due to the rugged nature of abandoned mines. [sent-122, score-0.869]
</p><p>54 Our approach to navigation is based on 3D maps, acquired in periodic intervals while the vehicle suspends motion to scan its environment. [sent-123, score-0.681]
</p><p>55 A typical 3D scan is shown in Figure 5a; others are shown in Figure 7. [sent-124, score-0.218]
</p><p>56 1  1 2 2 D Terrain Maps  In a £rst processing step, the robot projects local 3D maps onto 2 1 D terrain maps, such as 2 the one shown in Figure 5b. [sent-126, score-0.733]
</p><p>57 The gray-level in this map illustrates the degree at which the map is traversable: the brighter a 2D location, the better suited it is for navigation. [sent-127, score-0.355]
</p><p>58 The terrain map is obtained by analyzing all measurements x, y, z in the 3D scan (where z is the vertical dimension). [sent-128, score-0.635]
</p><p>59 It then searches for the largest z value in this region whose distance to z does not exceed the vehicle height (plus a safety margin); this value will be called z . [sent-130, score-0.263]
</p><p>60 The difference z − z is the navigational coef£cient: ¯ ¯ it loosely corresponds to the ruggedness of the terrain under the height of the robot. [sent-131, score-0.258]
</p><p>61 For safety reasons, multiple regions {xmin ; xmax } × {ymin ; ymax } overlap when building the terrain map. [sent-133, score-0.397]
</p><p>62 The terrain map is subsequently convolved with a narrow radial kernel that serves as a repellent potential £eld, to keep the robot clear of obstacles. [sent-134, score-0.676]
</p><p>63 2 Con£guration Space Maps The terrain map is used to construct a collection of maps that describe the robot’s con£guration space, or C-space [10]. [sent-136, score-0.591]
</p><p>64 The C-space is the three-dimensional space of poses that  (a)  (b)  (c)  Figure 5: (a) A local 3D model of the mine corridor, obtained by a scanning laser range £nder. [sent-137, score-0.674]
</p><p>65 (b) 1 The corresponding 2 2 D terrain map extracted from this 3D snapshot: the brighter a location, the 1 easier it is to navigate. [sent-138, score-0.454]
</p><p>66 (c) Kernels for generating directional C-space maps from the 2 2 D terrain map. [sent-139, score-0.432]
</p><p>67 Planning in these C-space maps ensures that the terrain under the tires is maximally navigable. [sent-141, score-0.469]
</p><p>68 the vehicle can assume; it comprises the x-y location along with the vehicle’s orientation θ. [sent-142, score-0.234]
</p><p>69 The C-space maps are obtained by convolving the terrain map with oriented kernels that describe the robot’s footprint. [sent-143, score-0.591]
</p><p>70 The intuition of using such a kernel is as follows: Abandoned mines often possess railroad tracks, and while it is perfectly acceptable to navigate with a track between the wheels, traversing or riding these tracks causes unnecessary damage to the tires and will increase the energy consumption. [sent-145, score-0.331]
</p><p>71 The result of this transformation is a collection of C-space maps, each of which applies to a different vehicle orientation. [sent-146, score-0.234]
</p><p>72 The A* search is initiated with an array of goal points, which places the highest value at locations at maximum distance straight down a mine corridor. [sent-149, score-0.496]

</p><p>74 4  Results  The approach was tested in multiple experiments, some of which were remotely operated while in others the robot operated autonomously, outside the reach of radio communication. [sent-154, score-0.39]

<p>Author: Curt Bererton, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: The design of cooperative multi-robot systems is a highly active research area in robotics. Two lines of research in particular have generated interest: the solution of large, weakly coupled MDPs, and the design and implementation of market architectures. We propose a new algorithm which joins together these two lines of research. For a class of coupled MDPs, our algorithm automatically designs a market architecture which causes a decentralized multi-robot system to converge to a consistent policy. We can show that this policy is the same as the one which would be produced by a particular centralized planning algorithm. We demonstrate the new algorithm on three simulation examples: multi-robot towing, multi-robot path planning with a limited fuel resource, and coordinating behaviors in a game of paint ball. 1</p><p>3 0.085882455 <a title="21-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Discriminative_Fields_for_Modeling_Spatial_Dependencies_in_Natural_Images.html">54 nips-2003-Discriminative Fields for Modeling Spatial Dependencies in Natural Images</a></p>
<p>Author: Sanjiv Kumar, Martial Hebert</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present Discriminative Random Fields (DRF), a discriminative framework for the classiﬁcation of natural image regions by incorporating neighborhood spatial dependencies in the labels as well as the observed data. The proposed model exploits local discriminative models and allows to relax the assumption of conditional independence of the observed data given the labels, commonly used in the Markov Random Field (MRF) framework. The parameters of the DRF model are learned using penalized maximum pseudo-likelihood method. Furthermore, the form of the DRF model allows the MAP inference for binary classiﬁcation problems using the graph min-cut algorithms. The performance of the model was veriﬁed on the synthetic as well as the real-world images. The DRF model outperforms the MRF model in the experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.076950118 <a title="21-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Planning_in_POMDPs_with_Macro-Actions.html">33 nips-2003-Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Macro-Actions</a></p>

We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>5 0.070607573 <a title="21-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-ARA%2A%3A_Anytime_A%2A_with_Provable_Bounds_on_Sub-Optimality.html">2 nips-2003-ARA*: Anytime A* with Provable Bounds on Sub-Optimality</a></p>
<p>Author: Maxim Likhachev, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: In real world planning problems, time for deliberation is often limited. Anytime planners are well suited for these problems: they ﬁnd a feasible solution quickly and then continually work on improving it until time runs out. In this paper we propose an anytime heuristic search, ARA*, which tunes its performance bound based on available search time. It starts by ﬁnding a suboptimal solution quickly using a loose bound, then tightens the bound progressively as time allows. Given enough time it ﬁnds a provably optimal solution. While improving its bound, ARA* reuses previous search efforts and, as a result, is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient than other anytime search methods. In addition to our theoretical analysis, we demonstrate the practical utility of ARA* with experiments on a simulated robot kinematic arm and a dynamic path planning problem for an outdoor rover. 1</p><p>6 0.070352688 <a title="21-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Bounded_Invariance_and_the_Formation_of_Place_Fields.html">43 nips-2003-Bounded Invariance and the Formation of Place Fields</a></p>

<p>Author: Curt Bererton, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: The design of cooperative multi-robot systems is a highly active research area in robotics. Two lines of research in particular have generated interest: the solution of large, weakly coupled MDPs, and the design and implementation of market architectures. We propose a new algorithm which joins together these two lines of research. For a class of coupled MDPs, our algorithm automatically designs a market architecture which causes a decentralized multi-robot system to converge to a consistent policy. We can show that this policy is the same as the one which would be produced by a particular centralized planning algorithm. We demonstrate the new algorithm on three simulation examples: multi-robot towing, multi-robot path planning with a limited fuel resource, and coordinating behaviors in a game of paint ball. 1</p><p>4 0.50217873 <a title="21-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-A_Holistic_Approach_to_Compositional_Semantics%3A_a_connectionist_model_and_robot_experiments.html">8 nips-2003-A Holistic Approach to Compositional Semantics: a connectionist model and robot experiments</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuuya Sugita, Jun Tani</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel connectionist model for acquiring the semantics of a simple language through the behavioral experiences of a real robot. We focus on the “compositionality” of semantics, a fundamental characteristic of human language, which is the ability to understand the meaning of a sentence as a combination of the meanings of words. We also pay much attention to the “embodiment” of a robot, which means that the robot should acquire semantics which matches its body, or sensory-motor system. The essential claim is that an embodied compositional semantic representation can be self-organized from generalized correspondences between sentences and behavioral patterns. This claim is examined and conﬁrmed through simple experiments in which a robot generates corresponding behaviors from unlearned sentences by analogy with the correspondences between learned sentences and behaviors. 1</p><p>5 0.38734224 <a title="21-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Bounded_Invariance_and_the_Formation_of_Place_Fields.html">43 nips-2003-Bounded Invariance and the Formation of Place Fields</a></p>
<p>Author: Reto Wyss, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: One current explanation of the view independent representation of space by the place-cells of the hippocampus is that they arise out of the summation of view dependent Gaussians. This proposal assumes that visual representations show bounded invariance. Here we investigate whether a recently proposed visual encoding scheme called the temporal population code can provide such representations. Our analysis is based on the behavior of a simulated robot in a virtual environment containing speciﬁc visual cues. Our results show that the temporal population code provides a representational substrate that can naturally account for the formation of place ﬁelds. 1</p><p>6 0.38138658 <a title="21-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-A_Fast_Multi-Resolution_Method_for_Detection_of_Significant_Spatial_Disease_Clusters.html">6 nips-2003-A Fast Multi-Resolution Method for Detection of Significant Spatial Disease Clusters</a></p>

<p>Author: Roland Vollgraf, Michael Scholz, Ian A. Meinertzhagen, Klaus Obermayer</p><p>Abstract: Nonlinear ﬁltering can solve very complex problems, but typically involve very time consuming calculations. Here we show that for ﬁlters that are constructed as a RBF network with Gaussian basis functions, a decomposition into linear ﬁlters exists, which can be computed eﬃciently in the frequency domain, yielding dramatic improvement in speed. We present an application of this idea to image processing. In electron micrograph images of photoreceptor terminals of the fruit ﬂy, Drosophila, synaptic vesicles containing neurotransmitter should be detected and labeled automatically. We use hand labels, provided by human experts, to learn a RBF ﬁlter using Support Vector Regression with Gaussian kernels. We will show that the resulting nonlinear ﬁlter solves the task to a degree of accuracy, which is close to what can be achieved by human experts. This allows the very time consuming task of data evaluation to be done eﬃciently. 1</p><p>4 0.36453116 <a title="21-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Autonomous_Helicopter_Flight_via_Reinforcement_Learning.html">38 nips-2003-Autonomous Helicopter Flight via Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Liva Ralaivola, Florence D'alché-buc</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of predicting nonlinear time series. Kernel Dynamical Modeling (KDM), a new method based on kernels, is proposed as an extension to linear dynamical models. The kernel trick is used twice: ﬁrst, to learn the parameters of the model, and second, to compute preimages of the time series predicted in the feature space by means of Support Vector Regression. Our model shows strong connection with the classic Kalman Filter model, with the kernel feature space as hidden state space. Kernel Dynamical Modeling is tested against two benchmark time series and achieves high quality predictions. 1</p><p>6 0.34389108 <a title="21-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

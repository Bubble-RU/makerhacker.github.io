<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Michael Isard, Benjamin H. Sigelman, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: The detection and pose estimation of people in images and video is made challenging by the variability of human appearance, the complexity of natural scenes, and the high dimensionality of articulated body models. To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuousvalued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle ﬁlter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter. 1</p><p>3 0.10956562 <a title="154-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Geometric_Analysis_of_Constrained_Curves.html">81 nips-2003-Geometric Analysis of Constrained Curves</a></p>
<p>Author: Anuj Srivastava, Washington Mio, Xiuwen Liu, Eric Klassen</p><p>Abstract: We present a geometric approach to statistical shape analysis of closed curves in images. The basic idea is to specify a space of closed curves satisfying given constraints, and exploit the differential geometry of this space to solve optimization and inference problems. We demonstrate this approach by: (i) deﬁning and computing statistics of observed shapes, (ii) deﬁning and learning a parametric probability model on shape space, and (iii) designing a binary hypothesis test on this space. 1</p><p>4 0.090059072 <a title="154-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Eye_Movements_for_Reward_Maximization.html">68 nips-2003-Eye Movements for Reward Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Sprague, Dana Ballard</p><p>Abstract: Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest that there is a tight link between eye movements and goal directed motor actions. However, most existing models of human eye movements provide a bottom up account that relates visual attention to attributes of the visual scene. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new model of human eye movements that directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands of behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements serve to reduce uncertainty about environmental variables that are task relevant. A value is assigned to an eye movement by estimating the expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if the movement is not made. If there are several candidate eye movements, the one with the highest expected value is chosen. The model is illustrated using a humanoid graphic ﬁgure that navigates on a sidewalk in a virtual urban environment. Simulations show our protocol is superior to a simple round robin scheduling mechanism. 1</p><p>5 0.086620294 <a title="154-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Bounded_Finite_State_Controllers.html">42 nips-2003-Bounded Finite State Controllers</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Fanti, Marzia Polito, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Consider a number of moving points, where each point is attached to a joint of the human body and projected onto an image plane. Johannson showed that humans can eﬀortlessly detect and recognize the presence of other humans from such displays. This is true even when some of the body points are missing (e.g. because of occlusion) and unrelated clutter points are added to the display. We are interested in replicating this ability in a machine. To this end, we present a labelling and detection scheme in a probabilistic framework. Our method is based on representing the joint probability density of positions and velocities of body points with a graphical model, and using Loopy Belief Propagation to calculate a likely interpretation of the scene. Furthermore, we introduce a global variable representing the body’s centroid. Experiments on one motion-captured sequence suggest that our scheme improves on the accuracy of a previous approach based on triangulated graphical models, especially when very few parts are visible. The improvement is due both to the more general graph structure we use and, more signiﬁcantly, to the introduction of the centroid variable. 1</p><p>4 0.43980536 <a title="154-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Sensory_Modality_Segregation.html">175 nips-2003-Sensory Modality Segregation</a></p>
<p>Author: Virginia Sa</p><p>Abstract: Why are sensory modalities segregated the way they are? In this paper we show that sensory modalities are well designed for self-supervised cross-modal learning. Using the Minimizing-Disagreement algorithm on an unsupervised speech categorization task with visual (moving lips) and auditory (sound signal) inputs, we show that very informative auditory dimensions actually harm performance when moved to the visual side of the network. It is better to throw them away than to consider them part of the “visual input”. We explain this ﬁnding in terms of the statistical structure in sensory inputs. 1</p><p>5 0.42712286 <a title="154-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Subject-Independent_Magnetoencephalographic_Source_Localization_by_a_Multilayer_Perceptron.html">182 nips-2003-Subject-Independent Magnetoencephalographic Source Localization by a Multilayer Perceptron</a></p>
<p>Author: Sung C. Jun, Barak A. Pearlmutter</p><p>Abstract: We describe a system that localizes a single dipole to reasonable accuracy from noisy magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements in real time. At its core is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained to map sensor signals and head position to dipole location. Including head position overcomes the previous need to retrain the MLP for each subject and session. The training dataset was generated by mapping randomly chosen dipoles and head positions through an analytic model and adding noise from real MEG recordings. After training, a localization took 0.7 ms with an average error of 0.90 cm. A few iterations of a Levenberg-Marquardt routine using the MLP’s output as its initial guess took 15 ms and improved the accuracy to 0.53 cm, only slightly above the statistical limits on accuracy imposed by the noise. We applied these methods to localize single dipole sources from MEG components isolated by blind source separation and compared the estimated locations to those generated by standard manually-assisted commercial software. 1</p><p>6 0.38803434 <a title="154-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Eye_Movements_for_Reward_Maximization.html">68 nips-2003-Eye Movements for Reward Maximization</a></p>

In this paper, we describe a successful application of reinforcement learning to autonomous helicopter ﬂight. We ﬁrst ﬁt a stochastic, nonlinear model of the helicopter dynamics. We then use the model to learn to hover in place, and to ﬂy a number of maneuvers taken from an RC helicopter competition.</p><p>4 0.6090942 <a title="154-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Ranking_on_Data_Manifolds.html">164 nips-2003-Ranking on Data Manifolds</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Jason Weston, Arthur Gretton, Olivier Bousquet, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: The Google search engine has enjoyed huge success with its web page ranking algorithm, which exploits global, rather than local, hyperlink structure of the web using random walks. Here we propose a simple universal ranking algorithm for data lying in the Euclidean space, such as text or image data. The core idea of our method is to rank the data with respect to the intrinsic manifold structure collectively revealed by a great amount of data. Encouraging experimental results from synthetic, image, and text data illustrate the validity of our method. 1</p><p>5 0.38859296 <a title="154-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Planning_in_POMDPs_with_Macro-Actions.html">33 nips-2003-Approximate Planning in POMDPs with Macro-Actions</a></p>
<p>Author: Georgios Theocharous, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has demonstrated that useful POMDP solutions do not require consideration of the entire belief space. We extend this idea with the notion of temporal abstraction. We present and explore a new reinforcement learning algorithm over grid-points in belief space, which uses macro-actions and Monte Carlo updates of the Q-values. We apply the algorithm to a large scale robot navigation task and demonstrate that with temporal abstraction we can consider an even smaller part of the belief space, we can learn POMDP policies faster, and we can do information gathering more efﬁciently.</p><p>6 0.38496417 <a title="154-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Auction_Mechanism_Design_for_Multi-Robot_Coordination.html">36 nips-2003-Auction Mechanism Design for Multi-Robot Coordination</a></p>

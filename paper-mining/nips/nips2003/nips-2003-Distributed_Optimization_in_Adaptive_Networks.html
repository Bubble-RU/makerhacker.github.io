<p>Author: Yu-han Chang, Tracey Ho, Leslie P. Kaelbling</p><p>Abstract: In large multiagent games, partial observability, coordination, and credit assignment persistently plague attempts to design good learning algorithms. We provide a simple and efﬁcient algorithm that in part uses a linear system to model the world from a single agent’s limited perspective, and takes advantage of Kalman ﬁltering to allow an agent to construct a good training signal and learn an effective policy. 1</p><p>3 0.23634179 <a title="55-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Malte Kuss, Carl E. Rasmussen</p><p>Abstract: We exploit some useful properties of Gaussian process (GP) regression models for reinforcement learning in continuous state spaces and discrete time. We demonstrate how the GP model allows evaluation of the value function in closed form. The resulting policy iteration algorithm is demonstrated on a simple problem with a two dimensional state space. Further, we speculate that the intrinsic ability of GP models to characterise distributions of functions would allow the method to capture entire distributions over future values instead of merely their expectation, which has traditionally been the focus of much of reinforcement learning.</p><p>4 0.21460484 <a title="55-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Policy_Search_by_Dynamic_Programming.html">158 nips-2003-Policy Search by Dynamic Programming</a></p>

We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a ﬁnite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem. 1</p><p>5 0.19765083 <a title="55-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Approximate_Policy_Iteration_with_a_Policy_Language_Bias.html">34 nips-2003-Approximate Policy Iteration with a Policy Language Bias</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaco Vermaak, Simon J. Godsill, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for sequential Bayesian kernel regression. As is the case for the popular Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [10, 11], the method automatically identiﬁes the number and locations of the kernels. Our algorithm overcomes some of the computational difﬁculties related to batch methods for kernel regression. It is non-iterative, and requires only a single pass over the data. It is thus applicable to truly sequential data sets and batch data sets alike. The algorithm is based on a generalisation of Importance Sampling, which allows the design of intuitively simple and efﬁcient proposal distributions for the model parameters. Comparative results on two standard data sets show our algorithm to compare favourably with existing batch estimation strategies.</p><p>4 0.62517428 <a title="55-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Wormholes_Improve_Contrastive_Divergence.html">196 nips-2003-Wormholes Improve Contrastive Divergence</a></p>
<p>Author: Max Welling, Andriy Mnih, Geoffrey E. Hinton</p><p>Abstract: In models that deﬁne probabilities via energies, maximum likelihood learning typically involves using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to sample from the model’s distribution. If the Markov chain is started at the data distribution, learning often works well even if the chain is only run for a few time steps [3]. But if the data distribution contains modes separated by regions of very low density, brief MCMC will not ensure that different modes have the correct relative energies because it cannot move particles from one mode to another. We show how to improve brief MCMC by allowing long-range moves that are suggested by the data distribution. If the model is approximately correct, these long-range moves have a reasonable acceptance rate.</p><p>5 0.62395895 <a title="55-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Feature_Selection_from_Microarray_Expression_Data_via_Multiplicative_Large_Margin_Algorithms.html">72 nips-2003-Fast Feature Selection from Microarray Expression Data via Multiplicative Large Margin Algorithms</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: New feature selection algorithms for linear threshold functions are described which combine backward elimination with an adaptive regularization method. This makes them particularly suitable to the classiﬁcation of microarray expression data, where the goal is to obtain accurate rules depending on few genes only. Our algorithms are fast and easy to implement, since they center on an incremental (large margin) algorithm which allows us to avoid linear, quadratic or higher-order programming methods. We report on preliminary experiments with ﬁve known DNA microarray datasets. These experiments suggest that multiplicative large margin algorithms tend to outperform additive algorithms (such as SVM) on feature selection tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.62314147 <a title="55-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Learning_Curves_for_Stochastic_Gradient_Descent_in_Linear_Feedforward_Networks.html">104 nips-2003-Learning Curves for Stochastic Gradient Descent in Linear Feedforward Networks</a></p>

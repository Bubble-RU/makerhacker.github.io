<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms and other related Fourier methods have been practically implementable due to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this paper it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coeﬃcients. Furthermore eﬃcient generalised belief propagation methods between clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coeﬃcients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal. 1</p><p>3 0.17437796 <a title="32-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Qi, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: Approximation structure plays an important role in inference on loopy graphs. As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propagation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a “message” to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms. 1</p><p>4 0.13976926 <a title="32-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Semidefinite_Relaxations_for_Approximate_Inference_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">174 nips-2003-Semidefinite Relaxations for Approximate Inference on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>
<p>Author: Michael I. Jordan, Martin J. Wainwright</p><p>Abstract: We present a new method for calculating approximate marginals for probability distributions deﬁned by graphs with cycles, based on a Gaussian entropy bound combined with a semideﬁnite outer bound on the marginal polytope. This combination leads to a log-determinant maximization problem that can be solved by efﬁcient interior point methods [8]. As with the Bethe approximation and its generalizations [12], the optimizing arguments of this problem can be taken as approximations to the exact marginals. In contrast to Bethe/Kikuchi approaches, our variational problem is strictly convex and so has a unique global optimum. An additional desirable feature is that the value of the optimal solution is guaranteed to provide an upper bound on the log partition function. In experimental trials, the performance of the log-determinant relaxation is comparable to or better than the sum-product algorithm, and by a substantial margin for certain problem classes. Finally, the zero-temperature limit of our log-determinant relaxation recovers a class of well-known semideﬁnite relaxations for integer programming [e.g., 3]. 1</p><p>5 0.12517732 <a title="32-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Response_for_Approximate_Inference.html">117 nips-2003-Linear Response for Approximate Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Max Welling, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation on cyclic graphs is an efﬁcient algorithm for computing approximate marginal probability distributions over single nodes and neighboring nodes in the graph. In this paper we propose two new algorithms for approximating joint probabilities of arbitrary pairs of nodes and prove a number of desirable properties that these estimates fulﬁll. The ﬁrst algorithm is a propagation algorithm which is shown to converge if belief propagation converges to a stable ﬁxed point. The second algorithm is based on matrix inversion. Experiments compare a number of competing methods.</p><p>6 0.11983985 <a title="32-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Applying_Metric-Trees_to_Belief-Point_POMDPs.html">29 nips-2003-Applying Metric-Trees to Belief-Point POMDPs</a></p>

<p>Author: Chen Yanover, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: Loopy belief propagation (BP) has been successfully used in a number of diﬃcult graphical models to ﬁnd the most probable conﬁguration of the hidden variables. In applications ranging from protein folding to image analysis one would like to ﬁnd not just the best conﬁguration but rather the top M . While this problem has been solved using the junction tree formalism, in many real world problems the clique size in the junction tree is prohibitively large. In this work we address the problem of ﬁnding the M best conﬁgurations when exact inference is impossible. We start by developing a new exact inference algorithm for calculating the best conﬁgurations that uses only max-marginals. For approximate inference, we replace the max-marginals with the beliefs calculated using max-product BP and generalized BP. We show empirically that the algorithm can accurately and rapidly approximate the M best conﬁgurations in graphs with hundreds of variables. 1</p><p>3 0.74764198 <a title="32-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark A. Paskin</p><p>Abstract: Rao–Blackwellization is an approximation technique for probabilistic inference that ﬂexibly combines exact inference with sampling. It is useful in models where conditioning on some of the variables leaves a simpler inference problem that can be solved tractably. This paper presents Sample Propagation, an efﬁcient implementation of Rao–Blackwellized approximate inference for a large class of models. Sample Propagation tightly integrates sampling with message passing in a junction tree, and is named for its simple, appealing structure: it walks the clusters of a junction tree, sampling some of the current cluster’s variables and then passing a message to one of its neighbors. We discuss the application of Sample Propagation to conditional Gaussian inference problems such as switching linear dynamical systems. 1</p><p>6 0.58576125 <a title="32-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Semidefinite_Relaxations_for_Approximate_Inference_on_Graphs_with_Cycles.html">174 nips-2003-Semidefinite Relaxations for Approximate Inference on Graphs with Cycles</a></p>

<p>Author: Salvador Ruiz-correa, Linda G. Shapiro, Marina Meila, Gabriel Berson</p><p>Abstract: We present and empirically test a novel approach for categorizing 3-D free form object shapes represented by range data . In contrast to traditional surface-signature based systems that use alignment to match speciﬁc objects, we adapted the newly introduced symbolic-signature representation to classify deformable shapes [10]. Our approach constructs an abstract description of shape classes using an ensemble of classiﬁers that learn object class parts and their corresponding geometrical relationships from a set of numeric and symbolic descriptors. We used our classiﬁcation engine in a series of large scale discrimination experiments on two well-deﬁned classes that share many common distinctive features. The experimental results suggest that our method outperforms traditional numeric signature-based methodologies. 1 1</p><p>3 0.47217774 <a title="32-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Jaco Vermaak, Simon J. Godsill, Arnaud Doucet</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for sequential Bayesian kernel regression. As is the case for the popular Relevance Vector Machine (RVM) [10, 11], the method automatically identiﬁes the number and locations of the kernels. Our algorithm overcomes some of the computational difﬁculties related to batch methods for kernel regression. It is non-iterative, and requires only a single pass over the data. It is thus applicable to truly sequential data sets and batch data sets alike. The algorithm is based on a generalisation of Importance Sampling, which allows the design of intuitively simple and efﬁcient proposal distributions for the model parameters. Comparative results on two standard data sets show our algorithm to compare favourably with existing batch estimation strategies.</p><p>6 0.46364111 <a title="32-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Perspectives_on_Sparse_Bayesian_Learning.html">155 nips-2003-Perspectives on Sparse Bayesian Learning</a></p>

We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>Reference: <a title="nips-2003-128-reference" href="../nips2003_reference/nips-2003-Minimax_Embeddings_reference.html">text</a></p><br/>

<p>Author: Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: Spectral methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) impose a neighborhood graph on point data and compute eigenfunctions of a quadratic form generated from the graph. We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>2 0.26798016 <a title="128-tfidf-2" href="./nips-2003-Out-of-Sample_Extensions_for_LLE%2C_Isomap%2C_MDS%2C_Eigenmaps%2C_and_Spectral_Clustering.html">150 nips-2003-Out-of-Sample Extensions for LLE, Isomap, MDS, Eigenmaps, and Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Signiﬁcant plasticity in sensory cortical representations can be driven in mature animals either by behavioural tasks that pair sensory stimuli with reinforcement, or by electrophysiological experiments that pair sensory input with direct stimulation of neuromodulatory nuclei, but usually not by sensory stimuli presented alone. Biologically motivated theories of representational learning, however, have tended to focus on unsupervised mechanisms, which may play a signiﬁcant role on evolutionary or developmental timescales, but which neglect this essential role of reinforcement in adult plasticity. By contrast, theoretical reinforcement learning has generally dealt with the acquisition of optimal policies for action in an uncertain world, rather than with the concurrent shaping of sensory representations. This paper develops a framework for representational learning which builds on the relative success of unsupervised generativemodelling accounts of cortical encodings to incorporate the effects of reinforcement in a biologically plausible way. 1</p><p>4 0.16207591 <a title="128-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Optimal_Manifold_Representation_of_Data%3A_An_Information_Theoretic_Approach.html">149 nips-2003-Optimal Manifold Representation of Data: An Information Theoretic Approach</a></p>
<p>Author: Denis V. Chigirev, William Bialek</p><p>Abstract: We introduce an information theoretic method for nonparametric, nonlinear dimensionality reduction, based on the inﬁnite cluster limit of rate distortion theory. By constraining the information available to manifold coordinates, a natural probabilistic map emerges that assigns original data to corresponding points on a lower dimensional manifold. With only the information-distortion trade off as a parameter, our method determines the shape of the manifold, its dimensionality, the probabilistic map and the prior that provide optimal description of the data. 1 A simple example Some data sets may not be as complicated as they appear. Consider the set of points on a plane in Figure 1. As a two dimensional set, it requires a two dimensional density ρ(x, y) for its description. Since the data are sparse the density will be almost singular. We may use a smoothing kernel, but then the data set will be described by a complicated combination of troughs and peaks with no obvious pattern and hence no ability to generalize. We intuitively, however, see a strong one dimensional structure (a curve) underlying the data. In this paper we attempt to capture this intuition formally, through the use of the inﬁnite cluster limit of rate distortion theory. Any set of points can be embedded in a hypersurface of any intrinsic dimensionality if we allow that hypersurface to be highly “folded.” For example, in Figure 1, any curve that goes through all the points gives a one dimensional representation. We would like to avoid such solutions, since they do not help us discover structure in the data. Looking for a simpler description one may choose to penalize the curvature term [1]. The problem with this approach is that it is not easily generalized to multiple dimensions, and requires the dimensionality of the solution as an input. An alternative approach is to allow curves of all shapes and sizes, but to send the reduced coordinates through an information bottleneck. With a ﬁxed number of bits, position along a highly convoluted curve becomes uncertain. This will penalize curves that follow the data too closely (see Figure 1). There are several advantages to this approach. First, it removes the artiﬁciality introduced by Hastie [2] of adding to the cost function only orthogonal errors. If we believe that data points fall out of the manifold due to noise, there is no reason to treat the projection onto the manifold as exact. Second, it does not require the dimension- 9 8 Figure 1: Rate distortion curve for a data set of 25 points (red).

Note that the produced curve is well deﬁned, one dimensional and smooth. 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 ality of the solution manifold as an input. By adding extra dimensions, one quickly looses the precision with which manifold points are speciﬁed (due to the ﬁxed information bottleneck). Hence, the optimal dimension emerges naturally. This also means that the method works well in many dimensions with no adjustments. Third, the method handles sparse data well. This is important since in high dimensional spaces all data sets are sparse, i.e. they look like points in Figure 1, and the density estimation becomes impossible. Luckily, if the data are truly generated by a lower dimensional process, then density estimation in the data space is not important (from the viewpoint of prediction or any other). What is critical is the density of the data along the manifold (known in latent variable modeling as a prior), and our algorithm ﬁnds it naturally. 2 Latent variable models and dimensionality reduction Recently, the problem of reducing the dimensionality of a data set has received renewed attention [3,4]. The underlying idea, due to Hotelling [5], is that most of the variation in many high dimensional data sets can often be explained by a few latent variables. Alternatively, we say that rather than ﬁlling the whole space, the data lie on a lower dimensional manifold. The dimensionality of this manifold is the dimensionality of the latent space and the coordinate system on this manifold provides the latent variables. Traditional tools of principal component analysis (PCA) and factor analysis (FA) are still the most widely used methods in data analysis. They project the data onto a hyperplane, so the reduced coordinates are easy to interpret. However, these methods are unable to deal with nonlinear correlations in a data set. To accommodate nonlinearity in a data set, one has to relax the assumption that the data is modeled by a hyperplane, and allow a general low dimensional manifold of unknown shape and dimensionality. The same questions that we asked in the previous section apply here. What do we mean by requiring that “the manifold models the data well”? In the next section, we formalize this notion by deﬁning the manifold description of data as a doublet (the shape of the manifold and the projection map). Note that we do not require the probability distribution over the manifold (known for generative models [6,7] as a prior distribution over the latent variables and postulated a priori). It is completely determined by the doublet. Nonlinear correlations in data can also be accommodated implicitly, without constructing an actual low dimensional manifold. By mapping the data from the original space to an even higher dimensional feature space, we may hope that the correlations will become linearized and PCA will apply. Kernel methods [8] allow us to do this without actually constructing an explicit map to feature space. They introduce nonlinearity through an a priori nonlinear kernel. Alternatively, autoassociative neural networks [9] force the data through a bottleneck (with an internal layer of desired dimensionality) to produce a reduced description. One of the disadvantages of these methods is that the results are not easy to interpret. Recent attempts to describe a data set with a low dimensional representation generally follow into two categories: spectral methods and density modeling methods. Spectral methods (LLE [3], ISOMAP [4], Laplacian eigenmaps [10]) give reduced coordinates of an a priori dimensionality by introducing a quadratic cost function in reduced coordinates (hence eigenvectors are solutions) that mimics the relationships between points in the original data space (geodesic distance for ISOMAP, linear reconstruction for LLE). Density modeling methods (GTM [6], GMM [7]) are generative models that try to reproduce the data with fewer variables. They require a prior and a parametric generative model to be introduced a priori and then ﬁnd optimal parameters via maximum likelihood. The approach that we will take is inspired by the work of Kramer [9] and others who tried to formulate dimensionality reduction as a compression problem. They tried to solve the problem by building an explicit neural network encoder-decoder system which restricted the information implicitly by limiting the number of nodes in the bottleneck layer. Extending their intuition with the tools of information theory, we recast dimensionality reduction as a compression problem where the bottleneck is the information available to manifold coordinates. This allows us to deﬁne the optimal manifold description as that which produces the best reconstruction of the original data set, given that the coordinates can only be transmitted through a channel of ﬁxed capacity. 3 Dimensionality reduction as compression Suppose that we have a data set X in a high dimensional state space RD described by a density function ρ(x). We would like to ﬁnd a “simpliﬁed” description of this data set. One may do so by visualizing a lower dimensional manifold M that “almost” describes the data. If we have a manifold M and a stochastic map PM : x → PM (µ|x) to points µ on the manifold, we will say that they provide a manifold description of the data set X. Note that the stochastic map here is well justiﬁed: if a data point does not lie exactly on the manifold then we should expect some uncertainty in the estimation of the value of its latent variables. Also note that we do not need to specify the inverse (generative) map: M → RD ; it can be obtained by Bayes’ rule. The manifold description (M, PM ) is a less than faithful representation of the data. To formalize this notion we will introduce the distortion measure D(M, PM , ρ): ρ(x)PM (µ|x) x − µ 2 dD xDµ. D(M, PM , ρ) = x∈RD (1) µ∈M Here we have assumed the Euclidean distance function for simplicity. The stochastic map, PM (µ|x), together with the density, ρ(x), deﬁne a joint probability function P (M, X) that allows us to calculate the mutual information between the data and its manifold representation: I(X, M) = P (x, µ) log x∈X µ∈M P (x, µ) dD xDµ. ρ(x)PM (µ) (2) This quantity tells us how many bits (on average) are required to encode x into µ. If we view the manifold representation of X as a compression scheme, then I(X, M) tells us the necessary capacity of the channel needed to transmit the compressed data. Ideally, we would like to obtain a manifold description {M, PM (M|X)} of the data set X that provides both a low distortion D(M, PM , ρ) and a good compression (i.e. small I(X, M)). The more bits we are willing to provide for the description of the data, the more detailed a manifold that can be constructed. So there is a trade off between how faithful a manifold representation can be and how much information is required for its description. To formalize this notion we introduce the concept of an optimal manifold. DEFINITION. Given a data set X and a channel capacity I, a manifold description (M, PM (M|X)) that minimizes the distortion D(M, PM , X), and requires only information I for representing an element of X, will be called an optimal manifold M(I, X). Note that another way to deﬁne an optimal manifold is to require that the information I(M, X) is minimized while the average distortion is ﬁxed at value D. The shape and the dimensionality of optimal manifold depends on our information resolution (or the description length that we are willing to allow). This dependence captures our intuition that for real world, multi-scale data, a proper manifold representation must reﬂect the compression level we are trying to achieve. To ﬁnd the optimal manifold (M(I), PM(I) ) for a given data set X, we must solve a constrained optimization problem. Let us introduce a Lagrange multiplier λ that represents the trade off between information and distortion. Then optimal manifold M(I) minimizes the functional: F(M, PM ) = D + λI. (3) Let us parametrize the manifold M by t (presumably t ∈ Rd for some d ≤ D). The function γ(t) : t → M maps the points from the parameter space onto the manifold and therefore describes the manifold. Our equations become: D = dD x dd t ρ(x)P (t|x) x − γ(t) 2 , I = dD x dd t ρ(x)P (t|x) log P (t|x) , P (t) F(γ(t), P (t|x)) = D + λI. (4) (5) (6) Note that both information and distortion measures are properties of the manifold description doublet {M, PM (M|X)} and are invariant under reparametrization. We require the variations of the functional to vanish for optimal manifolds δF/δγ(t) = 0 and δF/δP (t|x) = 0, to obtain the following set of self consistent equations: P (t) = γ(t) = P (t|x) = Π(x) = dD x ρ(x)P (t|x), 1 dD x xρ(x)P (t|x), P (t) P (t) − 1 x−γ (t) 2 e λ , Π(x) 2 1 dd t P (t)e− λ x−γ (t) . (7) (8) (9) (10) In practice we do not have the full density ρ(x), but only a discrete number of samples. 1 So we have to approximate ρ(x) = N δ(x − xi ), where N is the number of samples, i is the sample label, and xi is the multidimensional vector describing the ith sample. Similarly, instead of using a continuous variable t we use a discrete set t ∈ {t1 , t2 , ..., tK } of K points to model the manifold. Note that in (7 − 10) the variable t appears only as an argument for other functions, so we can replace the integral over t by a sum over k = 1..K. Then P (t|x) becomes Pk (xi ),γ(t) is now γ k , and P (t) is Pk . The solution to the resulting set of equations in discrete variables (11 − 14) can be found by an iterative Blahut-Arimoto procedure [11] with an additional EM-like step. Here (n) denotes the iteration step, and α is a coordinate index in RD . The iteration scheme becomes: (n) Pk (n) γk,α = = N 1 N (n) Pk (xi ) = Π(n) (xi ) N 1 1 (n) N P k where α (11) i=1 = (n) xi,α Pk (xi ), (12) i=1 1, . . . , D, K (n) 1 (n) Pk e− λ xi −γ k 2 (13) k=1 (n) (n+1) Pk (xi ) = (n) 2 Pk 1 . e− λ xi −γ k (n) (x ) Π i (14) 0 0 One can initialize γk and Pk (xi ) by choosing K points at random from the data set and 0 letting γk = xi(k) and Pk = 1/K, then use equations (13) and (14) to initialize the 0 association map Pk (xi ). The iteration procedure (11 − 14) is terminated once n−1 n max |γk − γk | < , (15) k where determines the precision with which the manifold points are located. The above algorithm requires the information distortion cost λ = −δD/δI as a parameter. If we want to ﬁnd the manifold description (M, P (M|X)) for a particular value of information I, we can plot the curve I(λ) and, because it’s monotonic, we can easily ﬁnd the solution iteratively, arbitrarily close to a given value of I. 4 Evaluating the solution The result of our algorithm is a collection of K manifold points, γk ∈ M ⊂ RD , and a stochastic projection map, Pk (xi ), which maps the points from the data space onto the manifold. Presumably, the manifold M has a well deﬁned intrinsic dimensionality d. If we imagine a little ball of radius r centered at some point on the manifold of intrinsic dimensionality d, and then we begin to grow the ball, the number of points on the manifold that fall inside will scale as rd . On the other hand, this will not be necessarily true for the original data set, since it is more spread out and resembles locally the whole embedding space RD . The Grassberger-Procaccia algorithm [12] captures this intuition by calculating the correlation dimension. First, calculate the correlation integral: 2 C(r) = N (N − 1) N N H(r − |xi − xj |), (16) i=1 j>i where H(x) is a step function with H(x) = 1 for x > 0 and H(x) = 0 for x < 0. This measures the probability that any two points fall within the ball of radius r.

(b) Log log plot of C(r) vs r for both the manifold points (squares) and the original data set (circles). the correlation dimension at length scale r as the slope on the log log plot. dcorr (r) = d log C(r) . d log r (17) For points lying on a manifold the slope remains constant and the dimensionality is ﬁxed, while the correlation dimension of the original data set quickly approaches that of the embedding space as we decrease the length scale. Note that the slope at large length scales always tends to decrease due to ﬁnite span of the data and curvature effects and therefore does not provide a reliable estimator of intrinsic dimensionality. 5 5.1 Examples Semi-Circle We have randomly generated N = 3150 data points scattered by a normal distribution with σ = 1 around a semi-circle of radius R = 20 (Figure 2a). Then we ran the algorithm with K = 100 and λ = 8, and terminated the iterative algorithm once the precision = 0.1 had been reached. The resulting manifold is depicted in red. To test the quality of our solution, we calculated the correlation dimension as a function of spatial scale for both the manifold points and the original data set (Figure 2b). As one can see, the manifold solution is of ﬁxed dimensionality (the slope remains constant), while the original data set exhibits varying dimensionality. One should also note that the manifold points have dcorr (r) = 1 well into the territory where the original data set becomes two dimensional. This is what we should expect: at a given information level (in this case, I = 2.8 bits), the information about the second (local) degree of freedom is lost, and the resulting structure is one dimensional. A note about the parameters. Letting K → ∞ does not alter the solution. The information I and distortion D remain the same, and the additional points γk also fall on the semi-circle and are simple interpolations between the original manifold points. This allows us to claim that what we have found is a manifold, and not an agglomeration of clustering centers. Second, varying λ changes the information resolution I(λ): for small λ (high information rate) the local structure becomes important. At high information rate the solution undergoes 3.5 3 3 3 2.5 2.5 2 2.5 2 2 1.5 1.5 1.5 1 1 1 0.5 0.5 0 0.5 -0.5 0 0 -1 5 -0.5 -0.5 4 1 3 0.5 2 -1 -1 0 1 -0.5 0 -1 -1.5 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 -1.5 -1.5 -1 -0.5 0 0.5 1 1.5 Figure 3: S-shaped sheet in 3D.

(c) Optimal manifold points in 3D, projected onto an XY plane for easy visualization. a phase transition, and the resulting manifold becomes two dimensional to take into account the local structure. Alternatively, if we take λ → ∞, the cost of information rate becomes very high and the whole manifold collapses to a single point (becomes zero dimensional). 5.2 S-surface Here we took N = 2000 points covering an S-shaped sheet in three dimensions (Figure 3a), and then scattered the position of each point by adding Gaussian noise. The resulting manifold is difﬁcult to visualize in three dimensions, so we provided its projection onto an XY plane for an illustrative purpose (Figure 3b). After running our algorithm we have recovered the original structure of the manifold (Figure 3c). 6 Discussion The problem of ﬁnding low dimensional manifolds in high dimensional data requires regularization to avoid hgihly folded, Peano curve like solutions which are low dimensional in the mathematical sense but fail to capture our geometric intuition. Rather than constraining geometrical features of the manifold (e.g., the curvature) we have constrained the mutual information between positions on the manifold and positions in the original data space, and this is invariant to all invertible coordinate transformations in either space. This approach enforces “smoothness” of the manifold only implicitly, but nonetheless seems to work. Our information theoretic approach has considerable generality relative to methods based on speciﬁc smoothing criteria, but requires a separate algorithm, such as LLE, to give the manifold points curvilinear coordinates. For data points not in the original data set, equations (9-10) and (13-14) provide the mapping onto the manifold. Eqn. (7) gives the probability distribution over the latent variable, known in the density modeling literature as “the prior.” The running time of the algorithm is linear in N . This compares favorably with other methods and makes it particularly attractive for very large data sets. The number of manifold points K usually is chosen as large as possible, given the computational constraints, to have a dense sampling of the manifold. However, a value of K << N is often sufﬁcient, since D(λ, K) → D(λ) and I(λ, K) → I(λ) approach their limits rather quickly (the convergence improves for large λ and deteriorates for small λ). In the example of a semi-circle, the value of K = 30 was sufﬁcient at the compression level of I = 2.8 bits. In general, the threshold value for K scales exponentially with the latent dimensionality (rather than with the dimensionality of the embedding space). The choice of λ depends on the desired information resolution, since I depends on λ. Ideally, one should plot the function I(λ) and then choose the region of interest. I(λ) is a monotonically decreasing function, with the kinks corresponding to phase transitions where the optimal manifold abruptly changes its dimensionality. In practice, we may want to run the algorithm only for a few choices of λ, and we would like to start with values that are most likely to correspond to a low dimensional latent variable representation. In this case, as a rule of thumb, we choose λ smaller, but on the order of the largest linear dimension (i.e. λ/2 ∼ Lmax ). The dependence of the optimal manifold M(I) on information resolution reﬂects the multi-scale nature of the data and should not be taken as a shortcoming. References [1] Bregler, C. & Omohundro, S.

<p>Author: Xiaofei He, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in information processing involve some form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we introduce Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). These are linear projective maps that arise by solving a variational problem that optimally preserves the neighborhood structure of the data set. LPP should be seen as an alternative to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – a classical linear technique that projects the data along the directions of maximal variance. When the high dimensional data lies on a low dimensional manifold embedded in the ambient space, the Locality Preserving Projections are obtained by ﬁnding the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold. As a result, LPP shares many of the data representation properties of nonlinear techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or Locally Linear Embedding. Yet LPP is linear and more crucially is deﬁned everywhere in ambient space rather than just on the training data points. This is borne out by illustrative examples on some high dimensional data sets.</p><p>6 0.13855657 <a title="128-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Measure_Based_Regularization.html">126 nips-2003-Measure Based Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: Spectral methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) impose a neighborhood graph on point data and compute eigenfunctions of a quadratic form generated from the graph. We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>2 0.67767936 <a title="128-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Out-of-Sample_Extensions_for_LLE%2C_Isomap%2C_MDS%2C_Eigenmaps%2C_and_Spectral_Clustering.html">150 nips-2003-Out-of-Sample Extensions for LLE, Isomap, MDS, Eigenmaps, and Spectral Clustering</a></p>

Roux, Marie Ouimet</p><p>Abstract: Several unsupervised learning algorithms based on an eigendecomposition provide either an embedding or a clustering only for given training points, with no straightforward extension for out-of-sample examples short of recomputing eigenvectors. This paper provides a uniﬁed framework for extending Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (for dimensionality reduction) as well as for Spectral Clustering. This framework is based on seeing these algorithms as learning eigenfunctions of a data-dependent kernel. Numerical experiments show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms due to the choice of training data. 1</p><p>3 0.61873502 <a title="128-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Embedding_of_Sparse_Similarity_Graphs.html">71 nips-2003-Fast Embedding of Sparse Similarity Graphs</a></p>
<p>Author: John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: This paper applies fast sparse multidimensional scaling (MDS) to a large graph of music similarity, with 267K vertices that represent artists, albums, and tracks; and 3.22M edges that represent similarity between those entities. Once vertices are assigned locations in a Euclidean space, the locations can be used to browse music and to generate playlists. MDS on very large sparse graphs can be effectively performed by a family of algorithms called Rectangular Dijsktra (RD) MDS algorithms. These RD algorithms operate on a dense rectangular slice of the distance matrix, created by calling Dijsktra a constant number of times. Two RD algorithms are compared: Landmark MDS, which uses the Nyström approximation to perform MDS; and a new algorithm called Fast Sparse Embedding, which uses FastMap. These algorithms compare favorably to Laplacian Eigenmaps, both in terms of speed and embedding quality. 1</p><p>4 0.58806551 <a title="128-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Locality_Preserving_Projections.html">120 nips-2003-Locality Preserving Projections</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaofei He, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in information processing involve some form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we introduce Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). These are linear projective maps that arise by solving a variational problem that optimally preserves the neighborhood structure of the data set. LPP should be seen as an alternative to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – a classical linear technique that projects the data along the directions of maximal variance. When the high dimensional data lies on a low dimensional manifold embedded in the ambient space, the Locality Preserving Projections are obtained by ﬁnding the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold. As a result, LPP shares many of the data representation properties of nonlinear techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or Locally Linear Embedding. Yet LPP is linear and more crucially is deﬁned everywhere in ambient space rather than just on the training data points. This is borne out by illustrative examples on some high dimensional data sets.</p><p>5 0.5364148 <a title="128-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-A_Biologically_Plausible_Algorithm_for_Reinforcement-shaped_Representational_Learning.html">4 nips-2003-A Biologically Plausible Algorithm for Reinforcement-shaped Representational Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Signiﬁcant plasticity in sensory cortical representations can be driven in mature animals either by behavioural tasks that pair sensory stimuli with reinforcement, or by electrophysiological experiments that pair sensory input with direct stimulation of neuromodulatory nuclei, but usually not by sensory stimuli presented alone. Biologically motivated theories of representational learning, however, have tended to focus on unsupervised mechanisms, which may play a signiﬁcant role on evolutionary or developmental timescales, but which neglect this essential role of reinforcement in adult plasticity. By contrast, theoretical reinforcement learning has generally dealt with the acquisition of optimal policies for action in an uncertain world, rather than with the concurrent shaping of sensory representations. This paper develops a framework for representational learning which builds on the relative success of unsupervised generativemodelling accounts of cortical encodings to incorporate the effects of reinforcement in a biologically plausible way. 1</p><p>6 0.52011746 <a title="128-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Optimal_Manifold_Representation_of_Data%3A_An_Information_Theoretic_Approach.html">149 nips-2003-Optimal Manifold Representation of Data: An Information Theoretic Approach</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: Spectral methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) impose a neighborhood graph on point data and compute eigenfunctions of a quadratic form generated from the graph. We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>2 0.71130884 <a title="128-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Efficient_Multiscale_Sampling_from_Products_of_Gaussian_Mixtures.html">58 nips-2003-Efficient Multiscale Sampling from Products of Gaussian Mixtures</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexander T. Ihler, Erik B. Sudderth, William T. Freeman, Alan S. Willsky</p><p>Abstract: The problem of approximating the product of several Gaussian mixture distributions arises in a number of contexts, including the nonparametric belief propagation (NBP) inference algorithm and the training of product of experts models. This paper develops two multiscale algorithms for sampling from a product of Gaussian mixtures, and compares their performance to existing methods. The ﬁrst is a multiscale variant of previously proposed Monte Carlo techniques, with comparable theoretical guarantees but improved empirical convergence rates. The second makes use of approximate kernel density evaluation methods to construct a fast approximate sampler, which is guaranteed to sample points to within a tunable parameter of their true probability. We compare both multiscale samplers on a set of computational examples motivated by NBP, demonstrating signiﬁcant improvements over existing methods. 1</p><p>3 0.64998174 <a title="128-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Fast_Feature_Selection_from_Microarray_Expression_Data_via_Multiplicative_Large_Margin_Algorithms.html">72 nips-2003-Fast Feature Selection from Microarray Expression Data via Multiplicative Large Margin Algorithms</a></p>

This makes them particularly suitable to the classiﬁcation of microarray expression data, where the goal is to obtain accurate rules depending on few genes only. Our algorithms are fast and easy to implement, since they center on an incremental (large margin) algorithm which allows us to avoid linear, quadratic or higher-order programming methods.

These experiments suggest that multiplicative large margin algorithms tend to outperform additive algorithms (such as SVM) on feature selection tasks. 1</p><p>4 0.61778051 <a title="128-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Identifying_Structure_across_Pre-partitioned_Data.html">87 nips-2003-Identifying Structure across Pre-partitioned Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Zvika Marx, Ido Dagan, Eli Shamir</p><p>Abstract: We propose an information-theoretic clustering approach that incorporates a pre-known partition of the data, aiming to identify common clusters that cut across the given partition. In the standard clustering setting the formation of clusters is guided by a single source of feature information. The newly utilized pre-partition factor introduces an additional bias that counterbalances the impact of the features whenever they become correlated with this known partition. The resulting algorithmic framework was applied successfully to synthetic data, as well as to identifying text-based cross-religion correspondences. 1 In t ro d u c t i o n The standard task of feature-based data clustering deals with a single set of elements that are characterized by a unified set of features. The goal of the clustering task is to identify implicit constructs, or themes, within the clustered set, grouping together elements that are characterized similarly by the features. In recent years there has been growing interest in more complex clustering settings, in which additional information is incorporated [1], [2]. Several such extensions ([3]-[5]) are based on the information bottleneck (IB) framework [6], which facilitates coherent information-theoretic representation of different information types. In a recent line of research we have investigated the cross-dataset clustering task [7], [8]. In this setting, some inherent a-priori partition of the clustered data to distinct subsets is given. The clustering goal it to identify corresponding (analogous) structures that cut across the different subsets, while ignoring internal structures that characterize individual subsets. To accomplish this task, those features that commonly characterize elements across the different subsets guide the clustering process, while within-subset regularities are neutralized. In [7], we presented a distance-based hard clustering algorithm for the coupledclustering problem, in which the clustered data is pre-partitioned to two subsets. In [8], our setting, generalized to pre-partitions of any number of subsets, was addressed by a heuristic extension of the probabilistic IB algorithm, yielding improved empirical results. Specifically, the algorithm in [8] was based on a modification of the IB stable-point equation, which amplified the impact of features characterizing a formed cluster across all, or most, subsets. This paper describes an information-theoretic framework that motivates and extends the algorithm proposed in [8]. The given pre-partitioning is represented via a probability distribution variable, which may represent “soft” pre-partitioning of the data, versus the strictly disjoint subsets assumed in the earlier cross-dataset framework. Further, we present a new functional that captures the cross-partition motivation. From the new functional, we derive a stable-point equation underlying our algorithmic framework in conjunction with the corresponding IB equation. Our algorithm was tested empirically on synthetic data and on a real-world textbased task that aimed to identify corresponding themes across distinct religions. We have cross-clustered five sets of keywords that were extracted from topical corpora of texts about Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam and Judaism. In distinction from standard clustering results, our algorithm reveals themes that are common to all religions, such as sacred writings, festivals, narratives and myths and theological principles, and avoids topical clusters that correspond to individual religions (for example, ‘Christmas’ and ‘Easter’ are clustered together with ‘Ramadan’ rather than with ‘Church’). Finally, we have paid specific attention to the framework of clustering with side information [4]. While this approach was presented for a somewhat different mindset, it might be used directly to address clustering across pre-partitioned data. We compare the technical details of the two approaches and demonstrate empirically that clustering with side information does not seem appropriate for the kind of cross-partition tasks that we explored. 2 Th e In fo rmat i o n B ot t len eck M et h od Probabilistic (“soft”) data clustering outputs, for each element x of the set being clustered and each cluster c, an assignment probability p(c|x). The IB method [6] interprets probabilistic clustering as lossy data compression. The given data is represented by a random variable X ranging over the clustered elements. X is compressed through another random variable C, ranging over the clusters. Every element x is characterized by conditional probability distribution p(Y|x), where Y is a third random variable taking the members y of a given set of features as values. The IB method formalizes the clustering task as minimizing the IB functional: L(IB) = I(C; X) − β I(C; Y) . (1) As known from information theory (Ch. 13 of [9]), minimizing the mutual information I(C; X) optimizes distorted compression rate. A complementary bias to maximize I(C; Y) is interpreted in [6] as articulating the level of relevance of Y to the obtained clustering, inferred from the level by which C can predict Y. β is a free parameter counterbalancing the two biases. It is shown in [6] that p(c|x) values that minimize L(IB) satisfy the following equation: p(c|x) = 1 p (c )e −β DKL [ p ( Y |x )|| p (Y |c ) ] , z( β , x) (2) where DKL stands for the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, or relative entropy, between two distributions and z(β ,x) is a normalization function over C. Eq. (2) implies that, optimally, x is assigned to c in proportion to their KL distance in a feature distribution space, where the distribution p(Y|c) takes the role of a Start at time t = 0 and iterate the following update-steps, till convergence: IB1: initialize p t (c|x) randomly or arbitrarily −β DKL [ p (Y | x )|| pt −1 (Y |c ) ] pt (c|x) ∝ IB2: pt (c) = IB3: pt (y|c) = pt −1 (c ) e ∑ x (t = 0) (t > 0) p t (c | x ) p ( x ) 1 ∑ pt ( c | x) p ( y | x ) p ( x) p t (c ) x Figure 1: The Information Bottleneck iterative algorithm (with fixed β and |C|). representative, or centroid, of c. The feature variable Y is hence utilized as the (exclusive) means to guide clustering, beyond the random nature of compression. Figure 1 presents the IB iterative algorithm for a fixed value of β . The IB1 update step follows Eq. (2). The other two steps, which are derived from the IB functional as well, estimate the p(c) and p(y|c) values required for the next iteration. The algorithm converges to a local minimum of the IB functional. The IB setting, particularly the derivation of steps IB1 and IB3 of the algorithm, assumes that Y and C are independent given X, that is: I(C; Y|X) = ∑x p(x) I(C|x; Y|x) = 0. The balancing parameter β affects the number of distinct clusters being formed in a manner that resembles (inverse) temperature in physical systems. The higher β is (i.e., the stronger the bias to construct C that predicts Y well), more distinct clusters are required for encoding the data. For each |C| = 2, 3, …, there is a minimal β value, enabling the formation of |C| distinct clusters. Setting β to be smaller than this critical value corresponding to the current |C| would result in two or more clusters that are identical to one another. Based on this, the iterative algorithm is applied repeatedly within a gradual cooling-like (deterministic annealing) scheme: starting with random initialization of the p0 (c|x)'s, generate two clusters with the critical β value, found empirically, for |C| = 2. Then, use a perturbation on the obtained two-cluster configuration to initialize the p0(c|x)'s for a larger set of clusters and execute additional runs of the algorithm to identify the critical β value for the larger |C|. And so on: each output configuration is used as a basis for a more granular one. The final outcome is a “soft hierarchy” of probabilistic clusters. 3 Cro ss- p a rt i t i o n Clu st eri n g Cross-partition (CP) clustering introduces a factor – a pre-given partition of the clustered data – additional to what considered in a standard clustering setting. For representing this factor we introduce the pre-partitioning variable W, ranging over all parts w of the pre-given partition. Every data element x is associated with W through a given probability distribution p(W|x). Our goal is to cluster the data, so that the clusters C would not be correlated with W. We notice that Y, which is intended to direct the formation of clusters, might be a-priori correlated with W, so the formed clusters might end up being correlated with W as well. Our method aims at eliminating this aspect of Y. 3.1 I n f or ma t i o n D e f oc us i n g As noted, some of the information conveyed by Y characterizes structures correlated with W, while the other part of the information characterizes the target cross-W structures. We are interested in detecting the latter while filtering out the former. However, there is no direct a-priori separation between the two parts of the Ymediated information. Our strategy in tackling this difficulty is: we follow in general Y's directions, as the IB method does, while avoiding Y's impact whenever it entails undesired inter-dependencies of C and W. Our strategy implies conflicting biases with regard to the mutual information I(C,Y): it should be maximized in order to form meaningful clusters, but be minimized as well in the specific context where Y entails C–W dependencies. Accordingly, we propose a computational procedure directed by two distinct cost-terms in tandem. The first one is the IB functional (Eq. 1), introducing the bias to maximize I(C,Y). With this bias alone, Y might dictate (or “explain”, in retrospect) substantial C–W dependencies, implying a low I(C;W|Y) value. 1 Hence, the guideline of preventing Y from accounting for C–W dependencies is realized through an opposing bias of maximizing I(C;W|Y) = ∑y p(y) I(C|y; W|y). The second cost term – the Information Defocusing (ID) functional – consequently counterbalances minimization of I(C,Y) against the new bias: L(ID) = I(C; Y) − η I(C;W|Y) , (3) where η is a free parameter articulating the tradeoff between the biases. The ID functional captures our goal of reducing the impact of Y selectively: “defocusing” a specific aspect of the information Y conveys: the information correlated with W. In a like manner to the stable-point equation of the IB functional (Eq. 2), we derive the following stable-point equation for the ID functional: η p ( w) 1 p ( c )∏ w p ( y | c, w) η +1 , p(c|y) = z (η , y ) (4) where z(η,y) is a normalization function over C. The derivation relies on an additional assumption, I(C;W) = 0, imposing the intended independence between C and W (the detailed derivation will be described elsewhere). The intuitive interpretation of Eq. (4) is as follows: a feature y is to be associated with a cluster c in proportion to a weighted, though flattened, geometric mean of the “W-projected centroids” p(y|c,w), priored by p(c). 2 This scheme overweighs y's that contribute to c evenly across W. Thus, clusters satisfying Eq. (4) are situated around centroids biased towards evenly contributing features. The higher η is, heavier emphasis is put on suppressing disagreements between the w's. For η → ∞ a plain weighted geometric-mean scheme is obtained. The inclusion of a step derived from Eq. (4) in our algorithm (see below) facilitates convergence on a configuration with centroids dominated by features that are evenly distributed across W. 3.2 T h e Cr os s - p a r t i t i on C l us t e r i n g A l g or i t h m Our proposed cross partition (CP) clustering algorithm (Fig. 2) seeks a clustering configuration that optimizes simultaneously both the IB and ID functionals, 1 Notice that “Z explaining well the dependencies between A and B” is equivalent with “A and B sharing little information in common given Z”, i.e. low I(A;B|Z) . Complete conditional independence is exemplified in the IB framework, assuming I(C;Y|X) = 0. 2 Eq. (4) resembles our suggestion in [8] to compute a geometric average over the subsets; in the current paper this scheme is analytically derived from the ID functional. Start at time t = 0 and iterate the following update-steps, till convergence: CP1: Initialize p t (c|x) randomly or arbitrarily −β DKL [ p (Y | x )|| pt −1 (Y |c ) ] pt (c|x) ∝ CP2: pt (c) = CP3: p*t (y|c,w) = CP4: (t = 0) p t −1 (c ) e ∑ x (t > 0) p t (c | x ) p ( x ) 1 ∑ pt ( c | x ) p ( y | x ) p ( w | x ) p ( x ) p t ( c ) p ( w) x Initialize p*t (c) randomly or arbitrarily (t = 0) p*t (c) (t > 0) = ∑ y p *t −1 (c | y ) p ( y ) η CP5: p*t (c|y) ∝ p *t (c)∏w p *t ( y | c, w) η +1 CP6: pt (y|c) = p ( w) p *t (c | y ) p ( y ) p *t (c ) Figure 2: The cross-partition clustering iterative algorithm (with fixed β, η, and |C|). thus obtaining clusters that cut across the pre-given partition W. To this end, the algorithm interleaves an iterative computation of the stable-point equations, and the additional estimated parameters, for both functionals. Steps CP1, CP2 and CP6 correspond to the computations related to the IB functional, while steps CP3, CP4 and CP5, which compute a separate set of parameters (denoted by an asterisk), correspond to the ID functional. Figure 3 summarizes the roles of the two functionals in the dynamics of the CP algorithm. The two components of the iterative cycle are tied together in steps CP3 and CP6, in which parameters from one set are used as input to compute a parameter of other set. The derivation of step CP3 relies on an additional assumption, namely that C, Y and W are jointly independent given X. This assumption, which extends to W the underlying assumption of the IB setting that C and Y are independent given X, still entails the IB stable point equation. At convergence, the stable point equations for both the IB and ID functionals are satisfied, each by its own set of parameters (in steps CP1 and CP5). The deterministic annealing scheme, which gradually increases β over repeated runs (see Sec. 2), is applied for the CP algorithm as well with η held fixed. For a given target number of clusters |C|, the algorithm empirically converges with a wide range of η values 3. I(C;X) ↓ IB β↑ I(C;Y) ↓ ID η↑ I(C; W|Y) I(C; Y; W|X) = 0 ← assumptions → I(C;W) = 0 Figure 3: The interplay of the IB and the ID functionals in the CP algorithm. High η values tend to dictate centroids with features that are unevenly distributed across W, resulting in shrinkage of some of the clusters. Further analysis will be provided in future work. 3 4 Exp e ri men t a l Resu lt s Our synthetic setting consisted of 75 virtual elements, evenly pre-partitioned into three 25-element parts denoted X 1 , X2 and X3 (in our formalism, for each clustered element x, p(w|x) = 1 holds for either w = 1, 2, or 3). On top of this pre-partition, we partitioned the data twice, getting two (exhaustive) clustering configurations: 1. Target cross-W clustering: five clusters, each with representatives from all X w's; 2. Masking within-w clustering: six clusters, each consisting of roughly half the elements of either X 1, X 2 or X3 with no representatives from the other X w's. Each cluster, of both configurations, was characterized by a designated subset of features. Masking clusters were designed to be more salient than target clusters: they had more designated features (60 vs. 48 per cluster, i.e., 360 vs. 240 in total) and their elements shared higher feature-element (virtual) co-occurrence counts with those designated features (900 vs. 450 per element-feature pair). Noise (random positive integer < 200) was added to all counts associating elements with their designated features (for both within-w and cross-W clusters), as well as to roughly quarter of the zero counts associating elements with the rest of the features. The plain IB method consistently produced configurations strongly correlated with the masking clustering, while the CP algorithm revealed the target configuration. We got (see Table 1A) almost perfect results in configurations of nearly equal-sized cross-W clusters, and somewhat less perfect reconstruction in configurations of diverging sizes (6, 9, 15, 21 and 24). Performance level was measured relatively to optimal target-output cluster match by the proportion of elements correctly assigned, where assignment of an element x follows its highest p(c|x). The results indicated were averaged over 200 runs. They were obtained for the optimal η, which was found to be higher in the diverging-sizes task. In the text-based task, the clustered elements – keywords – were automatically extracted from five distinct corpora addressing five religions: introductory web pages, online magazines, encyclopedic entries etc., all downloaded from the Internet. The clustered keyword set X was consequently pre-partitioned to disjoint subsets {X w} w∈W, one for each religion4 (|X w| ≈ 200 for each w). We conducted experiments simultaneously involving religion pairs as well as all five religions. We took the features Y to be a set of words that commonly occur within all five corpora (|Y| ≈ 7000). x–y co-occurrences were recorded within ±5-word sliding window truncated by sentence boundaries. η was fixed to a value (1.0) enabling the formation of 20 clusters in all settings. The obtained clusters revealed interesting cross religion themes (see Sec. 1). For instance, the cluster (one of nine) capturing the theme of sacred festivals: the three highest p(c/x) members within each religion were Full-moon, Ceremony, Celebration (Buddhism); Easter, Sunday, Christmas Table 1: Average correct assignment proportion scores for the synthetic task (A) and Jaccard-coefficient scores for the religion keyword classification task (B).

(Chrsitianity); Puja, Ceremony, Festival (Hinduism); Id-al-Fitr, Friday, Ramadan, (Islam); and Sukkoth, Shavuot, Rosh-Hodesh (Judaism). The closest cluster produced by the plain IB method was poorer by far, including Islamic Ramadan, and Id and Jewish Passover, Rosh-Hashanah and Sabbath (which our method ranked high too), but no single related term from the other religions. Our external evaluation standards were cross-religion keyword classes constructed manually by experts of comparative religion studies. One such expert classification involved all five religions, and eight classifications addressed religions in pairs. Each of the eight religion-pair classifications was contributed by two independent experts using the same keywords, so we could also assess the agreement between experts. As an overlap measure we employed the Jaccard coefficient: the number of element pairs co-assigned together by both one of the evaluated clusters and one of the expert classes, divided by the number of pairs co-assigned by either our clusters or the expert (or both). We did not assume the number of expert classes is known in advance (as done in the synthetic experiments), so the results were averaged over all configurations of 2–16 cluster hierarchy, for each experiment. The results shown in Table 1B – clear improvement relatively to plain IB and the distance-based coupled clustering [7] – are, however, persistent when the number of clusters is taken to be equal to the number of classes, or if only the best score in hierarchy is considered. The level of cross-expert agreement indicates that our results are reasonably close to the scores expected in such subjective task. 5 C o mp a ri so n t o R e la t ed W o r k The information bottleneck framework served as the basis for several approaches that represent additional information in their clustering setting. The multivariate information bottleneck (MIB) adapts the IB framework for networks of multiple variables [3]. However, all variables in such networks are either compressed (like X), or predicted (like Y). The incorporation of an empirical variable to be masked or defocused in the sense of our W is not possible. Including such variables in the MIB framework might be explored in future work. Particularly relevant to our work is the IB-based method for extracting relevant constructs with side information [4]. This approach addresses settings in which two different types of features are distinguished explicitly: relevant versus irrelevant ones, denoted by Y+ and Y−. Both types of features are incorporated within a single functional to be minimized: L(IB-side-info) = I(C; X) − β ( I(C; Y +) − γ I(C; Y−) ), which directly drives clustering to de-correlate C and Y−. Formally, our setting can be mapped to the side information setting by regarding the pre-partition W simply as the additional set of irrelevant features, giving symmetric (and opposite) roles to W and Y. However, it seems that this view does not address properly the desired cross-partition setting. In our setting, it is assumed that clustering should be guided in general by Y, while W should only neutralize particular information within Y that would otherwise yield the undesired correlation between C and W (as described in Section 3.1). For that reason, the defocusing functional tie the three variables together by conditioning the de-correlation of C and W on Y, while its underlying assumption ensures the global de-correlation. Indeed, our method was found empirically superior on the cross-dataset task. The side-information IB method (the iterative algorithm with best scoring γ) achieves correct assignment proportion of 0.52 in both synthetic tasks, where our method scored 0.99 and 0.83 (see Table 1A) and, in the religion-pair keyword classification task, Jaccard coefficient improved by 20% relatively to plain IB (compared to our 100% improvement, see Table 1B). 6 C o n c lu si o n s This paper addressed the problem of clustering a pre-partitioned dataset, aiming to detect new internal structures that are not correlated with the pre-given partition but rather cut across its components. The proposed framework extends the cross-dataset clustering algorithm [8], providing better formal grounding and representing any pre-given (soft) partition of the dataset. Supported by empirical evidence, we suggest that our framework is better suited for the cross-partition task than applying the side-information framework [4], which was originally developed to address a somewhat different setting. We also demonstrate substantial empirical advantage over the distance-based coupled-clustering algorithm [7]. As an applied real-world goal, the algorithm successfully detects cross-religion commonalities. This goal exemplifies the more general notion of detecting analogies across different systems, which is a somewhat vague and non-consensual task and therefore especially challenging for a computational framework. Our approach can be viewed as an initial step towards principled identification of “hidden” commonalities between substantially different real world systems, while suppressing the vast majority of attributes that are irrelevant for the analogy. Further research may study the role of defocusing in supervised learning, where some pre-given partitions might mask the role of underlying discriminative features. Additionally, it would be interesting to explore relationships to other disciplines, e.g., network information theory ([9], Ch. 14) which provided motivation for the side-information approach. Finally, both frameworks (ours and side-information) suggest the importance of dealing wisely with information that should not dictate the clustering output directly.

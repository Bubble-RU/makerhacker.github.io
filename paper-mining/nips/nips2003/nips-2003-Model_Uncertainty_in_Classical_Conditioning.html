<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani</p><p>Abstract: Signiﬁcant plasticity in sensory cortical representations can be driven in mature animals either by behavioural tasks that pair sensory stimuli with reinforcement, or by electrophysiological experiments that pair sensory input with direct stimulation of neuromodulatory nuclei, but usually not by sensory stimuli presented alone. Biologically motivated theories of representational learning, however, have tended to focus on unsupervised mechanisms, which may play a signiﬁcant role on evolutionary or developmental timescales, but which neglect this essential role of reinforcement in adult plasticity. By contrast, theoretical reinforcement learning has generally dealt with the acquisition of optimal policies for action in an uncertain world, rather than with the concurrent shaping of sensory representations. This paper develops a framework for representational learning which builds on the relative success of unsupervised generativemodelling accounts of cortical encodings to incorporate the effects of reinforcement in a biologically plausible way. 1</p><p>3 0.12735362 <a title="130-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Dopamine_Modulation_in_a_Basal_Ganglio-Cortical_Network_of_Working_Memory.html">56 nips-2003-Dopamine Modulation in a Basal Ganglio-Cortical Network of Working Memory</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuval Aviel, David Horn, Moshe Abeles</p><p>Abstract: A balanced network leads to contradictory constraints on memory models, as exemplified in previous work on accommodation of synfire chains. Here we show that these constraints can be overcome by introducing a 'shadow' inhibitory pattern for each excitatory pattern of the model. This is interpreted as a doublebalance principle, whereby there exists both global balance between average excitatory and inhibitory currents and local balance between the currents carrying coherent activity at any given time frame. This principle can be applied to networks with Hebbian cell assemblies, leading to a high capacity of the associative memory. The number of possible patterns is limited by a combinatorial constraint that turns out to be P=0.06N within the specific model that we employ. This limit is reached by the Hebbian cell assembly network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such high memory capacities are demonstrated in the asynchronous state of models of spiking neurons. 1 In trod u ction Numerous studies analyze the different phases of unstructured networks of spiking neurons [1, 2]. These networks with random connectivity possess a phase of asynchronous activity, the asynchronous state (AS), which is the most interesting one from the biological perspective, since it is similar to physiological data. Unstructured networks, however, do not hold information in their connectivity matrix, and therefore do not store memories. Binary networks with ordered connectivity matrices, or structured networks, and their ability to store and retrieve memories, have been extensively studied in the past [3-8]. Applicability of these results to biologically plausible neuronal models is questionable. In particular, models of spiking neurons are known to have modes of synchronous global oscillations. Avoiding such modes, and staying in an AS, is a major constraint on networks of spiking neurons that is absent in most binary neural networks. As we will show below, it is this constraint that imposes a limit on capacity in our model. Existing associative memory models of spiking neurons have not strived for maximal pattern capacity [3, 4, 8]. Here, using an integrate-and-fire model, we embed structured synaptic connections in an otherwise unstructured network and study the capacity limit of the system. The system is therefore macroscopically unstructured, but microscopically structured. The unstructured network model is based on Brunel's [1] balanced network of integrate-and-fire neurons. In his model, the network possesses different phases, one of which is the AS. We replace his unstructured excitatory connectivity by a semistructured one, including a super-position of either synfire chains or Hebbian cell assemblies. The existence of a stable AS is a fundamental prerequisite of the system. There are two reasons for that: First, physiological measurements of cortical tissues reveal an irregular neuronal activity and an asynchronous population activity. These findings match the properties of the AS. Second, in term of information content, the entropy of the system is the highest when firing probability is uniformly distributed, as in an AS. In general, embedding one or two patterns will not destabilize the AS. Increasing the number of embedded patterns, however, will eventually destabilize the AS, leading to global oscillations. In previous work [9], we have demonstrated that the cause of AS instability is correlations between neurons that result from the presence of structure in the network. The patterns, be it Hebbian cell assemblies (HCA) or pools occurring in synfire chains (SFC), have an important characteristic: neurons that are members of the same pattern (or pool) share a large portion of their inputs. This common input correlates neuronal activities both when a pattern is activated and when both neurons are influenced by random activity. If too many patterns are embedded in the network, too many neurons become correlated due to common inputs, leading to globally synchronized deviations from mean activity. A qualitative understanding of this state of affairs is provided by a simple model of a threshold linear pair of neurons that receive n excitatory common, and correlated, inputs, and K-n excitatory, as well as K inhibitory, non-common uncorrelated inputs. Thinking of these neurons as belonging to a pattern or a pool within a network, we can obtain an interesting self-consistent result by assuming the correlation of the pair of neurons to be also the correlation in their common correlated input (as is likely to be the case in a network loaded with HCA or SFC). We find then [9] that there exists a critical pattern size, n c , below which correlations decay but above which correlations are amplified. Furthermore, the following scaling was found to exist (1) nc = rc K . Implications of this model for the whole network are that: (i) rc is independent of N, the size of the network, (ii) below nc the AS is stable, and (iii) above nc the AS is unstable. Using extensive computer simulations we were able [9] to validate all these predictions. In addition, keeping n  nmin, by the requirement that n excitatory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), on average, drive a neuron across its threshold. Since N>K and typically N>>K, together with Eq. (1) it follows that N >> (n min / rc ) . Hence rc and nmin set the lower bound of the network's size, 2 above which it is possible to embed a reasonable number of patterns in the network without losing the AS. In this paper we propose a solution that enables small n min and large r values, which in turn enables embedding a large number of patterns in much smaller networks. This is made possible by the doubly-balanced construction to be outlined below. 2 The double-balance principle Counteracting the excitatory correlations with inhibitory ones is the principle that will allow us to solve the problem. Since we deal with balanced networks, in which the mean excitatory input is balanced by an inhibitory one, we note that this principle imposes a second type of balancing condition, hence we refer to it as the double- balance principle. In the following, we apply this principle by introducing synaptic connections between any excitatory pattern and its randomly chosen inhibitory pattern. These inhibitory patterns, which we call shadow patterns, are activated after the excitatory patterns fire, but have no special in-pattern connectivity or structured projections onto other patterns. The premise is that correlations evolved in the excitatory patterns will elicit correlated inhibitory activity, thus balancing the network's average correlation level. The size of the shadow pattern has to be small enough, so that the global network activity will not be quenched, yet large enough, so that the excitatory correlation will be counteracted. A balanced network that is embedded with patterns and their shadow patterns will be referred to as a doubly balanced network (DBN), to be contrasted with the singly balanced network (SBN) where shadow patterns are absent. 3 3.1 Application of the double balance principle. The Network We model neuronal activity with the Integrate and Fire [10] model. All neurons have the same parameters: τ = 10ms , τ ref = 2.5ms , C=250pF. PSPs are modeled by a delta function with fixed delay. The number of synapses on a neuron is fixed and set to KE excitatory synapses from the local network, KE excitatory synapses from external sources and KI inhibitory synapses from the local network. See Aviel et al [9] for details. All synapses of each group will be given fixed values. It is allowed for one pre-synaptic neuron to make more than one connection to one postsynaptic neuron. The network possesses NE excitatory neurons and N I ≡ γN E inhibitory neurons. Connectivity is sparse, ε = 0.1 ). K E N E = K I N I = ε , (we use A Poisson process with rate vext=10Hz models the external source. If a neuron of population y innervates a neuron of population x its synaptic strength J xy is defined as J xE ≡ J 0 K E , J xI ≡ − gJ 0 with J0=10, and g=5. Note that J xI = − g γ KI J xE , hence g γ controls the balance between the two populations. Within an HCA pattern the neurons have high connection probability with one another. Here it is achieved by requiring L of the synapses of a neuron in the excitatory pattern to originate from within the pattern. Similarly, a neuron in the inhibitory shadow pattern dedicates L of its synapses to the associated excitatory pattern. In a SFC, each neuron in an excitatory pool is fed by L neurons from the previous pool. This forms a feed forward connectivity. In addition, when shadow pools are present, each neuron in a shadow pool is fed by L neurons from its associated excitatory pool. In both cases L = C L K E , with CL=2.5. The size of the excitatory patterns (i.e. the number of neurons participating in a pattern) or pools, nE, is also chosen to be proportional to K E (see Aviel et al. 2003 [9]), nE ≡ Cn K E , where Cn varies. This is a suitable choice, because of the behavior of the critical nc of Eq. (1), and is needed for the meaningful memory activity (of the HCA or SFC) to overcome synaptic noise. ~ The size of a shadow pattern is defined as nI ≡ d nE . This leads to the factor d, representing the relative strength of inhibitory and excitatory currents, due to a pattern or pool, affecting a neuron that is connected to both: d≡ (2) Thus it fixes nI = d − J xI nI J xE nE = gJ 0 K E d gd . = J0 K I γ ( )n . In the simulations reported below d varied between 1 γ g E and 3. Wiring the network is done in two stages, first all excitatory patterns are wired, and then random connections are added, complying with the fixed number of synapses. A volley of w spikes, normally distributed over time with width of 1ms, is used to ignite a memory pattern. In the case of SFC, the first pool is ignited, and under the right conditions the volley propagates along the chain without fading away and without destabilizing the AS. 3.2 Results First we show that the AS remains stable when embedding HCAs in a small DBN, whereas global oscillations take place if embedding is done without shadow pools. Figure 1 displays clearly the sustained activity of an HCA in the DBN. The same principle also enables embedding of SFCs in a small network. This is to be contrasted with the conclusions drawn in Aviel et al [9], where it was shown that otherwise very large networks are necessary to reach this goal. Figure 1: HCAs are embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. P=300 HCAs of size nE=194 excitatory neurons were embedded in a network of NE=15,000 excitatory neurons. The eleventh pattern is externally ignited at time t=100ms. A raster plot of 200ms is displayed. Without shadow patterns the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow patterns the network exhibits only minute oscillations, enabling the activity of the ignited pattern to be sustained. The size of the shadow patterns is set according to Eq. (2) with d=1. Neurons that participate in more than one HCA may appear more than once on the raster plot, whose y-axis is ordered according to HCAs, and represents every second neuron in each pattern. Figure 2: SFCs embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. The first pool is externally ignited at time t=100ms. d=0.5. The rest of the parameters are as in Figure 1. Here again, without shadow pools, the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow pools it has only minute oscillation, enabling a stable propagation of the synfire wave. 3.3 Maximum Capacity In this section we show that, within our DBN, it is the fixed number of synapses (rather than dynamical constraints) that dictates the maximal number of patterns or pools P that may be loaded onto the network. Let us start by noting that a neuron of population x (E or I) can participate in at most m ≡ K E L  patterns, hence N x m sets an upper bound on the number of neurons that participate in all patterns: P n x P ≤ m ⋅ N x . Next, defining α x ≡ , we find that Nx αx ≤ (3) m nx =  K E CL K E    nx To leading order in NE this turns into  K E CL K E   N = C C D −1 N − O αxNx =  n L x E E D C K (4) x n E ( ) ( NE ) (g γ ) if x=I, or 1 for x=E. where Dx ≡ d Thus we conclude that synaptic combinatorial considerations lead to a maximal number of patterns P. If DI<1, including the case DI=0 of the SBN, the excitatory neurons determine the limit to be P = (C n C L ) N E . If, as is the case in our DBN, −1 DI>1, then ( γα I < α E P = C n C L DI ) −1 and the inhibitory neurons set the maximum value to NE . For example, setting Cn=3.5, CL=2.4, g=3 and d=3, in Eq. (4), we get P=0.06NE. In Figure 3 we use these parameters. The capacity of a DBN is compared to that of an SBN for different network sizes. The maximal load is defined by the presence of global oscillation strong enough to prohibit sustained activity of patterns. The DBN reaches the combinatorial limit, whereas the SBN does not increase with N and obviously does not reach its combinatorial limit. 1400 1200 Pmax 1000 DBN SBN DBN Upper Limit SBN Upper Limit 800 600 400 200 0 0 5000 10000 NE 15000 Figure 3: A balanced network maximally loaded with HCAs.

<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We discuss an idea for collecting data in a relatively efﬁcient manner. Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual information between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quantiﬁes the effectiveness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadaptive experimental design. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative efﬁciency of the “staircase method” widely employed in psychophysics research, and to demonstrate the dependence of this efﬁciency on the form of the “psychometric function” underlying the output responses. 1</p><p>6 0.10994142 <a title="130-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Estimating_Internal_Variables_and_Paramters_of_a_Learning_Agent_by_a_Particle_Filter.html">64 nips-2003-Estimating Internal Variables and Paramters of a Learning Agent by a Particle Filter</a></p>

In both tasks discrimination thresholds varied significantly with the type of motion pattern presented, suggesting perceptual correlates to the preferred motion bias reported in MSTd. Through the model we demonstrate that while independently responding motion pattern units are capable of encoding information relevant to the visual motion tasks, equivalent psychophysical performance can only be achieved using interconnected neural populations that systematically inhibit non-responsive units. These results suggest the cyclic trends in psychophysical performance may be mediated, in part, by recurrent connections within motion pattern responsive areas whose structure is a function of the similarity in preferred motion patterns and receptive field locations between units. 1 In trod u ction A major challenge in computational neuroscience is to elucidate the architecture of the cortical circuits for sensory processing and their effective role in mediating behavior. In the visual motion system, biologically constrained models are playing an increasingly important role in this endeavor by providing an explanatory substrate linking perceptual performance and the visual properties of single cells. Single cell studies indicate the presence of complex interconnected structures in middle temporal and primary visual cortex whose most basic horizontal connections can impart considerable computational power to the underlying neural population [1, 2]. Combined psychophysical and computational studies support these findings Figure 1: a) Schematic of the graded motion pattern (GMP) task. Discrimination pairs of stimuli were created by perturbing the flow angle (φ) of each 'test' motion (with average dot speed, vav), by ±φp in the stimulus space spanned by radial and circular motions. b) Schematic of the shifted center-of-motion (COM) task. Discrimination pairs of stimuli were created by shifting the COM of the ‘test’ motion to the left and right of a central fixation point. For each motion pattern the COM was shifted within the illusory inner aperture and was never explicitly visible. and suggest that recurrent connections may play a significant role in encoding the visual motion properties associated with various psychophysical tasks [3, 4]. Using this methodology our goal is to elucidate the computational mechanisms associated with the processing of wide-field motion patterns encountered during self-motion. In the human visual motion system, psychophysical studies suggest the existence of specialized detectors for the motion pattern components (i.e., radial, circular and spiral motions) associated with self-motion [5, 6]. Neurophysiological studies reporting neurons sensitive to motion patterns in the dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) support the existence of such mechanisms [7-10], and in conjunction with psychophysical studies suggest a strong link between the patterns of neural activity and motion-based perceptual performance [11, 12]. Through the combination of human psychophysical performance and biologically constrained modeling we investigate the computational role of simple recurrent connections within a population of MSTd-like units. Based on the known visual motion properties within MSTd we ask what neural structures are computationally sufficient to encode psychophysical performance on a series of motion pattern tasks. 2 M o t i o n pa t t e r n d i sc r i m i n a t i o n Using motion pattern stimuli consistent with previous studies [5, 6], we have developed a set of novel psychophysical tasks designed to facilitate a more direct comparison between human perceptual performance and the visual motion properties of cells in MSTd that have been found to underlie the discrimination of motion patterns [11, 12]. The psychophysical tasks, referred to as the graded motion pattern (GMP) and shifted center-of-motion (COM) tasks, are outlined in Fig. 1. Using a temporal two-alternative-forced-choice task we measured discrimination thresholds to global changes in the patterns of complex motion (GMP task), [13], and shifts in the center-of-motion (COM task). Stimuli were presented with central fixation using a constant stimulus paradigm and consisted of dynamic random dot displays presented in a 24o annular region (central 4o removed). In each task, the stimulus duration was randomly perturbed across presentations (440±40 msec) to control for timing-based cues, and dots moved coherently through a radial speed Figure 2: a) GMP thresholds across 8 'test' motions at two mean dot speeds for two observers. Performance varied continuously with thresholds for radial motions (φ=0, 180o) significantly lower than those for circular motions (φ=90,270o), (p<0.001; t(37)=3.39). b) COM thresholds at three mean dot speeds for two observers. As with the GMP task, performance varied continuously with thresholds for radial motions significantly lower than those for circular motions, (p<0.001; t(37)=4.47). gradient in directions consistent with the global motion pattern presented. Discrimination thresholds were obtained across eight ‘test’ motions corresponding to expansion, contraction, CW and CCW rotation, and the four intermediate spiral motions. To minimize adaptation to specific motion patterns, opposing motions (e.g., expansion/ contraction) were interleaved across paired presentations. 2.1 Results Discrimination thresholds are reported here from a subset of the observer population consisting of three experienced psychophysical observers, one of which was naïve to the purpose of the psychophysical tasks. For each condition, performance is reported as the mean and standard error averaged across 8-12 thresholds. Across observers and dot speeds GMP thresholds followed a distinct trend in the stimulus space [13], with radial motions (expansion/contraction) significantly lower than circular motions (CW/CCW rotation), (p<0.001; t(37)=3.39), (Fig. 2a). While thresholds for the intermediate spiral motions were not significantly different from circular motions (p=0.223, t(60)=0.74), the trends across 'test' motions were well fit within the stimulus space (SB: r>0.82, SC: r>0.77) by sinusoids whose period and phase were 196 ± 10o and -72 ± 20o respectively (Fig. 1a). When the radial speed gradient was removed by randomizing the spatial distribution of dot speeds, threshold performance increased significantly across observers (p<0.05; t(17)=1.91), particularly for circular motions (p<0.005; t(25)=3.31), (data not shown). Such performance suggests a perceptual contribution associated with the presence of the speed gradient and is particularly interesting given the fact that the speed gradient did not contribute computationally relevant information to the task. However, the speed gradient did convey information regarding the integrative structure of the global motion field and as such suggests a preference of the underlying motion mechanisms for spatially structured speed information. Similar trends in performance were observed in the COM task across observers and dot speeds. Discrimination thresholds varied continuously as a function of the 'test' motion with thresholds for radial motions significantly lower than those for circular motions, (p<0.001; t(37)=4.47) and could be well fit by a sinusoidal trend line (e.g. SB at 3 deg/s: r>0.91, period = 178 ± 10 o and phase = -70 ± 25o), (Fig. 2b). 2.2 A local or global task? The consistency of the cyclic threshold profile in stimuli that restricted the temporal integration of individual dot motions [13], and simultaneously contained all directions of motion, generally argues against a primary role for local motion mechanisms in the psychophysical tasks. While the psychophysical literature has reported a wide variety of “local” motion direction anisotropies whose properties are reminiscent of the results observed here, e.g. [14], all would predict equivalent thresholds for radial and circular motions for a set of uniformly distributed and/or spatially restricted motion direction mechanisms. Together with the computational impact of the speed gradient and psychophysical studies supporting the existence of wide-field motion pattern mechanisms [5, 6], these results suggest that the threshold differences across the GMP and COM tasks may be associated with variations in the computational properties across a series of specialized motion pattern mechanisms. 3 A computational model The similarities between the motion pattern stimuli used to quantify human perception and the visual motion properties of cells in MSTd suggests that MSTd may play a computational role in the psychophysical tasks. To examine this hypothesis, we constructed a population of MSTd-like units whose visual motion properties were consistent with the reported neurophysiology (see [13] for details). Across the population, the distribution of receptive field centers was uniform across polar angle and followed a gamma distribution Γ(5,6) across eccenticity [7]. For each unit, visual motion responses followed a gaussian tuning profile as a function of the stimulus flow angle G( φ), (σi=60±30o; [10]), and the distance of the stimulus COM from the unit’s receptive field center Gsat(xi, yi, σs=19o), Eq. 1, such that its preferred motion response was position invariant to small shifts in the COM [10] and degraded continuously for large shifts [9]. Within the model, simulations were categorized according to the distribution of preferred motions represented across the population (one reported in MSTd and a uniform control). The first distribution simulated an expansion bias in which the density of preferred motions decreased symmetrically from expansions to contraction [10]. The second distribution simulated a uniform preference for all motions and was used as a control to quantify the effects of an expansion bias on psychophysical performance. Throughout the paper we refer to simulations containing these distributions as ‘Expansion-biased’ and ‘Uniform’ respectively. 3.1 Extracting perceptual estimates from the neural code For each stimulus presentation, the ith unit’s response was calculated as the average firing rate, Ri, from the product of its motion pattern and spatial tuning profiles, ( ) Ri = Rmax G min[φ − φi ] ,σ ti G sati (x− xi , y − y i ,σ s ) + P (λ = 12 ) (1) where Rmax is the maximum preferred stimulus response (spikes/s), min[ ] refers to the minimum angular distance between the stimulus flow angle φ and the unit’s preferred motion φi, Gsat is the unit’s spatial tuning profile saturated within the central 5±3o, σti and σs are the standard deviations of the unit’s motion pattern and Figure 3: Model vs. psychophysical performance for independently responding units. Model thresholds are reported as the average (±1 S.E.) across five simulated populations. a) GMP thresholds were highest for contracting motions and lowest for expanding motions across all Expansion-biased populations. b) Comparable trends in performance were observed for COM thresholds. Comparison with the Uniform control simulations in both tasks (2000 units shown here) indicates that thresholds closely followed the distribution of preferred motions simulated within the model. spatial tuning profiles respectively, (xi,yi) is the spatial location of the unit’s receptive field center, (x,y) is the spatial location of the stimulus COM, and P(λ=12) is the background activity simulated as an uncorrelated Poisson process. The psychophysical tasks were simulated using a modified center-of-gravity ^ approach to decode estimates of the stimulus properties, i.e. flow angle (φ ) and ˆ ˆ COM location in the visual field (x, y ) , from the neural population   ∑ xi Ri ∑ y i Ri v  , i , ∑ φ i Ri  ∑ Ri i   i i   i (xˆ, yˆ , φˆ) =  i∑ R  (2) v where φi is the unit vector in the stimulus space (Fig. 1a) corresponding to the unit’s preferred motion. For each set of paired stimuli, psychophysical judgments were made by comparing the estimated stimulus properties according to the discrimination criteria, specified in the psychophysical tasks. As with the psychophysical experiments, discrimination thresholds were computed using a leastsquares fit to percent correct performance across constant stimulus levels. 3.2 Simulation 1: Independent neural responses In the first series of simulations, GMP and COM thresholds were quantified across three populations (500, 1000, and 2000 units) of independently responding units for each simulated distribution (Expansion-biased and Uniform). Across simulations, both the range in thresholds and their trends across ‘test’ motions were compared with human psychophysical performance to quantify the effects of population size and an expansion biased preferred motion distribution on model performance. Over the psychophysical range of interest (φp ± 7o), GMP thresholds for contracting motions were at chance across all Expansion-biased populations, (Fig. 3a). While thresholds for expanding motions were generally consistent with those for human observers, those for circular motions remained significantly higher for all but the largest populations. Similar trends in performance were observed for the COM task, (Fig. 3b). Here the range of COM thresholds was well matched with human performance for simulations containing 1000 units, however, the trends across motion patterns remained inconsistent even for the largest populations. Figure 4: Proposed recurrent connection profile between motion pattern units. a) Across the motion pattern space connection strength followed an inverse gaussian profile such that the ith unit (with preferred motion φi) systematically inhibited units with anti-preferred motions centered at 180+φi. b) Across the visual field connection strength followed a difference-of-gaussians profile as a function of the relative distance between receptive field centers such that spatially local units are mutually excitatory (σRe=10o) and more distant units were mutually inhibitory (σRi=80o). For simulations containing a uniform distribution of preferred motions, the threshold range was consistent with human performance on both tasks, however, the trend across motion patterns was generally flat. What variability did occur was due primarily to the discrete sampling of preferred motions across the population. Comparison of the discrimination thresholds for the Expansion-biased and Uniform populations indicates that the trend across thresholds was closely matched to the underlying distributions of preferred motions. This result in due in part to the nearequal weighting of independently responding units and can be explained to a first approximation by the proportional increase in the signal-to-noise ratio across the population as a function of the density of units responsive to a given 'test' motion. 3.3 Simulation 2: An interconnected neural structure In a second series of simulations, we examined the computational effect of adding recurrent connections between units. If the distribution of preferred motions in MSTd is in fact biased towards expansions, as the neurophysiology suggests, it seems unlikely that independent estimates of the visual motion information would be sufficient to yield the threshold profiles observed in the psychophysical tasks. We hypothesize that a simple fixed architecture of excitatory and/or inhibitory connections is sufficient to account for the cyclic trends in discrimination thresholds. Specifically, we propose that a recurrent connection profile whose strength varies as a function of (a) the similarity between preferred motion patterns and (b) the distance between receptive field centers, is computationally sufficient to recover the trends in GMP/COM performance (Fig. 4), wij = S R e − ( xi − x j )2 + ( yi − y j )2 2 2σ R e − SR e 2 − −(min[ φi − φ j ])2 ( xi − x j )2 + ( yi − y j )2 2 2 σ Ri − Sφ e 2σ I2 (3) Figure 5: Model vs. psychophysical performance for populations containing recurrent connections (σI=80o). As the number of units increased for Expansionbiased populations, discrimination thresholds decreased to psychophysical levels and the sinusoidal trend in thresholds emerged for both the (a) GMP and (b) COM tasks. Sinusoidal trends were established for as few as 1000 units and were well fit (r>0.9) by sinusoids whose periods and phases were (193.8 ± 11.7o, -70.0 ± 22.6o) and (168.2 ± 13.7o, -118.8 ± 31.8o) for the GMP and COM tasks respectively. where wij is the strength of the recurrent connection between ith and jth units, (xi,yi) and (xj,yj) denote the spatial locations of their receptive field centers, σRe (=10o) and σRi (=80o) together define the spatial extent of a difference-of-gaussians interaction between receptive field centers, and SR and Sφ scale the connection strength. To examine the effects of the spread of motion pattern-specific inhibition and connection strength in the model, σI, Sφ, and SR were considered free parameters. Within the parameter space used to define recurrent connections (i.e., σI, Sφ and SR), Monte Carlo simulations of Expansion-biased model performance (1000 units) yielded regions of high correlation on both tasks (with respect to the psychophysical thresholds, r>0.7) that were consistent across independently simulated populations. Typically these regions were well defined over a broad range such that there was significant overlap between tasks (e.g., for the GMP task (SR=0.03), σI=[45,120o], Sφ=[0.03,0.3] and for the COM task (σI=80o), Sφ = [0.03,0.08], SR = [0.005, 0.04]). Fig. 5 shows averaged threshold performance for simulations of interconnected units drawn from the highly correlated regions of the (σI, Sφ, SR) parameter space. For populations not explicitly examined in the Monte Carlo simulations connection strengths (Sφ, SR) were scaled inversely with population size to maintain an equivalent level of recurrent activity. With the incorporation of recurrent connections, the sinusoidal trend in GMP and COM thresholds emerged for Expansion-biased populations as the number of units increased. In both tasks the cyclic threshold profiles were established for 1000 units and were well fit (r>0.9) by sinusoids whose periods and phases were consistent with human performance. Unlike the Expansion-biased populations, Uniform populations were not significantly affected by the presence of recurrent connections (Fig. 5). Both the range in thresholds and the flat trend across motion patterns were well matched to those in Section 3.2. Together these results suggest that the sinusoidal trends in GMP and COM performance may be mediated by the combined contribution of the recurrent interconnections and the bias in preferred motions across the population. 4 D i s c u s s i on Using a biologically constrained computational model in conjunction with human psychophysical performance on two motion pattern tasks we have shown that the visual motion information encoded across an interconnected population of cells responsive to motion patterns, such as those in MSTd, is computationally sufficient to extract perceptual estimates consistent with human performance. Specifically, we have shown that the cyclic trend in psychophysical performance observed across tasks, (a) cannot be reproduced using populations of independently responding units and (b) is dependent, in part, on the presence of an expanding motion bias in the distribution of preferred motions across the neural population. The model’s performance suggests the presence of specific recurrent structures within motion pattern responsive areas, such as MSTd, whose strength varies as a function of the similarity between preferred motion patterns and the distance between receptive field centers. While such structures have not been explicitly examined in MSTd and other higher visual motion areas there is anecdotal support for the presence of inhibitory connections [8]. Together, these results suggest that robust processing of the motion patterns associated with self-motion and optic flow may be mediated, in part, by recurrent structures in extrastriate visual motion areas whose distributions of preferred motions are biased strongly in favor of expanding motions.

<p>Author: Marc Toussaint</p><p>Abstract: We present a connectionist architecture that can learn a model of the relations between perceptions and actions and use this model for behavior planning. State representations are learned with a growing selforganizing layer which is directly coupled to a perception and a motor layer. Knowledge about possible state transitions is encoded in the lateral connectivity. Motor signals modulate this lateral connectivity and a dynamic ﬁeld on the layer organizes a planning process. All mechanisms are local and adaptation is based on Hebbian ideas. The model is continuous in the action, perception, and time domain.</p><p>5 0.52489436 <a title="130-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Mechanism_of_Neural_Interference_by_Transcranial_Magnetic_Stimulation%3A_Network_or_Single_Neuron%3F.html">127 nips-2003-Mechanism of Neural Interference by Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation: Network or Single Neuron?</a></p>

TMS can stimulate the brain non-invasively through a brief magnetic pulse delivered by a coil placed on the scalp, interfering with speciﬁc cortical functions with a high temporal resolution. Due to these advantages, TMS has been a popular experimental tool in various neuroscience ﬁelds. However, the neural mechanisms underlying TMSinduced interference are still unknown; a theoretical basis for TMS has not been developed. This paper provides computational evidence that inhibitory interactions in a neural population, not an isolated single neuron, play a critical role in yielding the neural interference induced by TMS.</p><p>6 0.52401286 <a title="130-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-A_Biologically_Plausible_Algorithm_for_Reinforcement-shaped_Representational_Learning.html">4 nips-2003-A Biologically Plausible Algorithm for Reinforcement-shaped Representational Learning</a></p>

Traditional accounts of conditioning ﬁt parameters within a ﬁxed generative model of reinforcer delivery; uncertainty over the model structure is not considered. We apply the theory to explain the puzzling relationship between second-order conditioning and conditioned inhibition, two similar conditioning regimes that nonetheless result in strongly divergent behavioral outcomes. According to the theory, second-order conditioning results when limited experience leads animals to prefer a simpler world model that produces spurious correlations; conditioned inhibition results when a more complex model is justiﬁed by additional experience. 1</p><p>2 0.76970959 <a title="130-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-PAC-Bayesian_Generic_Chaining.html">151 nips-2003-PAC-Bayesian Generic Chaining</a></p>
<p>Author: Jean-yves Audibert, Olivier Bousquet</p><p>Abstract: There exist many different generalization error bounds for classiﬁcation. Each of these bounds contains an improvement over the others for certain situations. Our goal is to combine these different improvements into a single bound. In particular we combine the PAC-Bayes approach introduced by McAllester [1], which is interesting for averaging classiﬁers, with the optimal union bound provided by the generic chaining technique developed by Fernique and Talagrand [2]. This combination is quite natural since the generic chaining is based on the notion of majorizing measures, which can be considered as priors on the set of classiﬁers, and such priors also arise in the PAC-bayesian setting. 1</p><p>3 0.69010943 <a title="130-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Learning_a_Rare_Event_Detection_Cascade_by_Direct_Feature_Selection.html">109 nips-2003-Learning a Rare Event Detection Cascade by Direct Feature Selection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jianxin Wu, James M. Rehg, Matthew D. Mullin</p><p>Abstract: Face detection is a canonical example of a rare event detection problem, in which target patterns occur with much lower frequency than nontargets. Out of millions of face-sized windows in an input image, for example, only a few will typically contain a face. Viola and Jones recently proposed a cascade architecture for face detection which successfully addresses the rare event nature of the task. A central part of their method is a feature selection algorithm based on AdaBoost. We present a novel cascade learning algorithm based on forward feature selection which is two orders of magnitude faster than the Viola-Jones approach and yields classiﬁers of equivalent quality. This faster method could be used for more demanding classiﬁcation tasks, such as on-line learning. 1</p><p>4 0.68665671 <a title="130-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Generalised_Propagation_for_Fast_Fourier_Transforms_with_Partial_or_Missing_Data.html">80 nips-2003-Generalised Propagation for Fast Fourier Transforms with Partial or Missing Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Amos J. Storkey</p><p>Abstract: Discrete Fourier transforms and other related Fourier methods have been practically implementable due to the fast Fourier transform (FFT). However there are many situations where doing fast Fourier transforms without complete data would be desirable. In this paper it is recognised that formulating the FFT algorithm as a belief network allows suitable priors to be set for the Fourier coeﬃcients. Furthermore eﬃcient generalised belief propagation methods between clusters of four nodes enable the Fourier coeﬃcients to be inferred and the missing data to be estimated in near to O(n log n) time, where n is the total of the given and missing data points. This method is compared with a number of common approaches such as setting missing data to zero or to interpolation. It is tested on generated data and for a Fourier analysis of a damaged audio signal. 1</p><p>5 0.68318355 <a title="130-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Tree-structured_Approximations_by_Expectation_Propagation.html">189 nips-2003-Tree-structured Approximations by Expectation Propagation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Qi, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: Approximation structure plays an important role in inference on loopy graphs. As a tractable structure, tree approximations have been utilized in the variational method of Ghahramani & Jordan (1997) and the sequential projection method of Frey et al. (2000). However, belief propagation represents each factor of the graph with a product of single-node messages. In this paper, belief propagation is extended to represent factors with tree approximations, by way of the expectation propagation framework. That is, each factor sends a “message” to all pairs of nodes in a tree structure. The result is more accurate inferences and more frequent convergence than ordinary belief propagation, at a lower cost than variational trees or double-loop algorithms. 1</p><p>6 0.68251783 <a title="130-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-A_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence_Based_Kernel_for_SVM_Classification_in_Multimedia_Applications.html">9 nips-2003-A Kullback-Leibler Divergence Based Kernel for SVM Classification in Multimedia Applications</a></p>

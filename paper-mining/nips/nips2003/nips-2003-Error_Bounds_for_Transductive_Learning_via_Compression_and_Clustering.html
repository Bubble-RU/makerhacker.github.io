Although transduction appears to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many provably useful algorithms and bounds for transduction. We present explicit error bounds for transduction and derive a general technique for devising bounds within this setting. The technique is applied to derive error bounds for compression schemes such as (transductive) SVMs and for transduction algorithms based on clustering. 1 Introduction and Related Work In contrast to inductive learning, in the transductive setting the learner is given both the training and test sets prior to learning. The goal of the learner is to infer (or “transduce”) the labels of the test points. The transduction setting was introduced by Vapnik [1, 2] who proposed basic bounds and an algorithm for this setting. Clearly, inferring the labels of points in the test set can be done using an inductive scheme. However, as pointed out in [2], it makes little sense to solve an easier problem by ‘reducing’ it to a much more difﬁcult one. In particular, the prior knowledge carried by the (unlabeled) test points can be incorporated into an algorithm, potentially leading to superior performance. Indeed, a number of papers have demonstrated empirically that transduction can offer substantial advantage over induction whenever the training set is small or moderate (see e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]). However, unlike the current state of affairs in induction, the question of what are provably effective learning principles for transduction is quite far from being resolved. In this paper we provide new error bounds and a general technique for transductive learning. Our technique is based on bounds that can be viewed as an extension of McAllester’s PAC-Bayesian framework [7, 8] to transductive learning. The main advantage of using this framework in transduction is that here priors can be selected after observing the unlabeled data (but before observing the labeled sample). This ﬂexibility allows for the choice of “compact priors” (with small support) and therefore, for tight bounds. Another simple observation is that the PAC-Bayesian framework can be operated with polynomially (in m, the training sample size) many different priors simultaneously. Altogether, this added ﬂexibility, of using data-dependent multiple priors allows for easy derivation of tight error bounds for “compression schemes” such as (transductive) SVMs and for clustering algorithms. We brieﬂy review some previous results. The idea of transduction, and a speciﬁc algorithm for SVM transductive learning, was introduced and studied by Vapnik (e.g. [2]), where an error bound is also proposed. However, this bound is implicit and rather unwieldy and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been applied in practical situations. A PAC-Bayes bound [7] for transduction with Perceptron Decision Trees is given in [9]. The bound is data-dependent depending on the number of decision nodes, the margins at each node and the sample size. However, the authors state that the transduction bound is not much tighter than the induction bound. Empirical tests show that this transduction algorithm performs slightly better than induction in terms of the test error, however, the advantage is usually statistically insigniﬁcant. Reﬁning the algorithm of [2] a transductive algorithm based on a SVMs is proposed in [3]. The paper also provides empirical tests indicating that transduction is advantageous in the text categorization domain. An error bound for transduction, based on the effective VC Dimension, is given in [10]. More recently Lanckriet et al. [11] derived a transductive bound for kernel methods based on spectral properties of the kernel matrix. Blum and Langford [12] recently also established an implicit bound for transduction, in the spirit of the results in [2]. 2 The Transduction Setup We consider the following setting proposed by Vapnik ([2] Chp. 8), which for simplicity is described in the context of binary classiﬁcation (the general case will be discussed in the full paper). Let H be a set of binary hypotheses consisting of functions from input space X to {±1} and let Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } be a set of points from X each of which is chosen i.i.d. according to some unknown distribution µ(x). We call Xm+u the full sample. Let Xm = {x1 , . . . , xm } and Ym = {y1 , . . . , ym }, where Xm is drawn uniformly from Xm+u and yi ∈ {±1}. The set Sm = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} is referred to as a training sample. In this paper we assume that yi = φ(xi ) for some unknown function φ. The remaining subset Xu = Xm+u \ Xm is referred to as the unlabeled sample. Based on Sm and Xu our goal is to choose h ∈ H which predicts the labels of points in Xu as accurately as possible. For each h ∈ H and a set Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| of samples deﬁne 1 Rh (Z) = |Z| |Z| (h(xi ), yi ), (1) i=1 where in our case (·, ·) is the zero-one loss function. Our goal in transduction is to learn an h such that Rh (Xu ) is as small as possible. This problem setup is summarized by the following transduction “protocol” introduced in [2] and referred to as Setting 1: (i) A full sample Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } consisting of arbitrary m + u points is given.1 (ii) We then choose uniformly at random the training sample Xm ⊆ Xm+u and receive its labeling Ym ; the resulting training set is Sm = (Xm , Ym ) and the remaining set Xu is the unlabeled sample, Xu = Xm+u \ Xm ; (iii) Using both Sm and Xu we select a classiﬁer h ∈ H whose quality is measured by Rh (Xu ). Vapnik [2] also considers another formulation of transduction, referred to as Setting 2: (i) We are given a training set Sm = (Xm , Ym ) selected i.i.d according to µ(x, y). (ii) An independent test set Su = (Xu , Yu ) of u samples is then selected in the same manner. 1 The original Setting 1, as proposed by Vapnik, discusses a full sample whose points are chosen independently at random according to some source distribution µ(x). (iii) We are required to choose our best h ∈ H based on Sm and Xu so as to minimize m+u Rm,u (h) = 1 (h(xi ), yi ) dµ(x1 , y1 ) · · · dµ(xm+u , ym+u ). u i=m+1 (2) Even though Setting 2 may appear more applicable in practical situations than Setting 1, the derivation of theoretical results can be easier within Setting 1. Nevertheless, as far as the expected losses are concerned, Vapnik [2] shows that an error bound in Setting 1 implies an equivalent bound in Setting 2. In view of this result we restrict ourselves in the sequel to Setting 1. We make use of the following quantities, which are all instances of (1). The quantity Rh (Xm+u ) is called the full sample risk of the hypothesis h, Rh (Xu ) is referred to as the transduction risk (of h), and Rh (Xm ) is the training error (of h). Thus, Rh (Xm ) is ˆ the standard training error denoted by Rh (Sm ). While our objective in transduction is to achieve small error over the unlabeled set (i.e. to minimize Rh (Xu )), it turns out that it is much easier to derive error bounds for the full sample risk. The following simple lemma translates an error bound on Rh (Xm+u ), the full sample risk, to an error bound on the transduction risk Rh (Xu ). Lemma 2.1 For any h ∈ H and any C ˆ Rh (Xm+u ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C ⇔ ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + m+u · C. u (3) Proof: For any h Rh (Xm+u ) = mRh (Xm ) + uRh (Xu ) . m+u (4) ˆ Substituting Rh (Sm ) for Rh (Xm ) in (4) and then substituting the result for the left-hand side of (3) we get Rh (Xm+u ) = ˆ mRh (Sm ) + uRh (Xu ) ˆ ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C. m+u The equivalence (3) is now obtained by isolating Rh (Xu ) on the left-hand side. 2 3 General Error Bounds for Transduction Consider a hypothesis class H and assume for simplicity that H is countable; in fact, in the case of transduction it sufﬁces to consider a ﬁnite hypothesis class. To see this note that all m + u points are known in advance. Thus, in the case of binary classiﬁcation (for example) it sufﬁces to consider at most 2m+u possible dichotomies. Recall that in the setting considered we select a sub-sample of m points from the set Xm+u of cardinality m+u. This corresponds to a selection of m points without replacement from a set of m+u points, leading to the m points being dependent. A naive utilization of large deviation bounds would therefore not be directly applicable in this setting. However, Hoeffding (see Theorem 4 in [13]) pointed out a simple procedure to transform the problem into one involving independent data. While this procedure leads to non-trivial bounds, it does not fully take advantage of the transductive setting and will not be used here. Consider for simplicity the case of binary classiﬁcation. In this case we make use of the following concentration inequality, based on [14]. Theorem 3.1 Let C = {c1 , . . . , cN }, ci ∈ {0, 1}, be a ﬁnite set of binary numbers, and N set c = (1/N ) i=1 ci . Let Z1 , . . . , Zm , be random variables obtaining their values ¯ by sampling C uniformly at random without replacement. Set Z = (1/m) β = m/N . Then, if 2 ε ≤ min{1 − c, c(1 − β)/β}, ¯¯ Pr {Z − EZ > ε} ≤ exp −mD(¯ + ε c) − (N − m) D c − c ¯ ¯ m i=1 Zi and βε c + 7 log(N + 1) ¯ 1−β where D(p q) = p log(p/q) = (1 − p) log(1 − p)/(1 − q), p, q, ∈ [0, 1] is the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using this result we obtain the following error bound for transductive classiﬁcation. Theorem 3.2 Let Xm+u = Xm ∪Xu be the full sample and let p = p(Xm+u ) be a (prior) distribution over the class of binary hypotheses H that may depend on the full sample. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm (from the full sample) the following bound holds for any h ∈ H, ˆ 2Rh (Sm )(m + u) u ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + + 2 log 1 p(h) log + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 1 p(h) . (5) Proof: (sketch) In our transduction setting the set Xm (and therefore Sm ) is obtained by sampling the full sample Xm+u uniformly at random without replacement. We ﬁrst claim that ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = Rh (Xm+u ), (6) where EΣm (·) is the expectation with respect to a random choice of Sm from Xm+u without replacement. This is shown as follows. ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = 1 m+u m ˆ Rh (Sm ) = Sm 1 m+u m Xm ⊆Xm+n 1 m (h(x), φ(x)). x∈Sm By symmetry, all points x ∈ Xm+u are counted on the right-hand side an equal number of times; this number is precisely m+u − m+u−1 = m+u−1 . The equality (6) is obtained m m m−1 m by considering the deﬁnition of Rh (Xm+u ) and noting that m+u−1 / m+u = m+u . m−1 m The remainder of the proof combines Theorem 3.1 and the techniques presented in [15]. The details will be provided in the full paper. 2 ˆ Notice that when Rh (Sm ) → 0 the square root in (5) vanishes and faster rates are obtained. An important feature of Theorem 3.2 is that it allows one to use the sample Xm+u in order to choose the prior distribution p(h). This advantage has already been alluded to in [2], but does not seem to have been widely used in practice. Additionally, observe that (5) holds with probability at least 1 − δ with respect to the random selection of sub-samples of size m from the ﬁxed set Xm+u . This should be contrasted with the standard inductive setting results where the probabilities are with respect to a random choice of m training points chosen i.i.d. from µ(x, y). The next bound we present is analogous to McAllester’s Theorem 1 in [8]. This theorem concerns Gibbs composite classiﬁers, which are distributions over the base classiﬁers in H. For any distribution q over H denote by Gq the Gibbs classiﬁer, which classiﬁes an 2 The second condition, ε ≤ c(1 − β)/β, simply guarantees that the number of ‘ones’ in the ¯ sub-sample does not exceed their number in the original sample. , instance (in Xu ) by randomly choosing, according to q, one hypothesis h ∈ H. For Gibbs classiﬁers we now extend deﬁnition (1) as follows. Let Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| be any set of samples and let Gq be a Gibbs classiﬁer over H. The risk of Gq over Z is RGq (Z) = Eh∼q (1/|Z|) |Z| i=1 (h(xi ), φ(xi )) . As before, when Z = Xm (the training set) we ˆ use the standard notation RGq (Sm ) = RGq (Xm ). Due to space limitations, the proof of the following theorem will appear in the full paper. Theorem 3.3 Let Xm+u be the full sample. Let p be a distribution over H that may depend on Xm+u and let q be a (posterior) distribution over H that may depend on both Sm and Xu . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. With probability at least 1 − δ over the choices of Sm for any distribution q ˆ RGq (Xu ) ≤ RGq (Sm ) + + ˆ 2RGq (Sm )(m + u) u D(q p) + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 7 2 D(q p) + ln m + m log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 . In the context of inductive learning, a major obstacle in generating meaningful and effective bounds using the PAC-Bayesian framework [8] is the construction of “compact priors”. Here we discuss two extensions to the PAC-Bayesian scheme, which together allow for easy choices of compact priors that can yield tight error bounds. The ﬁrst extension we offer is the use of multiple priors. Instead of a single prior p in the original PACBayesian framework we observe that one can use all PAC-Bayesian bounds with a number of priors p1 , . . . , pk and then replace the complexity term ln(1/p(h)) (in Theorem 3.2) by mini ln(1/pi (h)), at a cost of an additional ln k term (see below). Similarly, in Theorem 3.3 we can replace the KL-divergence term in the bound with mini D(q||pi ). The penalty for using k priors is logarithmic in k (speciﬁcally the ln(1/δ) term in the original bound becomes ln(k/δ)). As long as k is sub-exponential in m we still obtain effective generalization bounds. The second “extension” is simply the feature of our transduction bounds (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3), which allows for the priors to be dependent on the full sample Xm+u . The combination of these two simple ideas yields a powerful technique for deriving error bounds in realistic transductive settings. After stating the extended result we later use it for deriving tight bounds for known learning algorithms and for deriving new algorithms. Suppose that instead of a single prior p over H we want to utilize k priors, p1 , . . . , pk and in retrospect choose the best among the k corresponding PAC-Bayesian bounds. The following theorem shows that one can use polynomially many priors with a minor penalty. The proof, which is omitted due to space limitations, utilizes the union bound in a straightforward manner. Theorem 3.4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.2 hold, except that we now have k prior distributions p1 , . . . , pk deﬁned over H, each of which may depend on Xm+u . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over random choices of sub-samples of size m from the full-sample, for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with p(h) replaced by min1≤i≤k pi (h) and log 1 is replaced by log k . δ δ Remark: A similar result holds for the Gibbs algorithm of Theorem 3.3. Also, as noted by one of the reviewers, when the supports of the k priors intersect (i.e. there is at least one pair of priors pi and pj with overlapping support), then one can do better by utilizing the 1 “super prior” p = k i pi within the original Theorem 3.2. However, note that when the supports are disjoint, these two views (of multiple priors and a super prior) are equivalent. In the applications below we utilize non-intersecting priors. 4 Bounds for Compression Algorithms Here we propose a technique for bounding the error of “compression” algorithms based on appropriate construction of prior probabilities. Let A be a learning algorithm. Intuitively, A is a “compression scheme” if it can generate the same hypothesis using a subset of the data. More formally, a learning algorithm A (viewed as a function from samples to some hypothesis class) is a compression scheme with respect to a sample Z if there is a subsample Z , Z ⊂ Z, such that A(Z ) = A(Z). Observe that the SVM approach is a compression scheme, with Z being determined by the set of support vectors. Let A be a deterministic compression scheme and consider the full sample Xm+u . For each integer τ = 1, . . . , m, consider all subsets of Xm+u of size τ , and for each subset construct all possible dichotomies of that subset (note that we are not proposing this approach as an algorithm, but rather as a means to derive bounds; in practice one need not construct all these dichotomies). A deterministic algorithm A uniquely determines at most one hypothesis h ∈ H for each dichotomy.3 For each τ , let the set of hypotheses generated by this procedure be denoted by Hτ . For the rest of this discussion we assume the worst case where |Hτ | = m+u (i.e. if Hτ does not contains one hypothesis for each dichotomy τ the bounds improve). The prior pτ is then deﬁned to be a uniform distribution over Hτ . In this way we have m priors, p1 , . . . , pm which are constructed using only Xm+u (and are independent of Sm ). Any hypothesis selected by the learning algorithm A based on the labeled sample Sm and on the test set Xu belongs to ∪m Hτ . The motivation for this τ =1 construction is as follows. Each τ can be viewed as our “guess” for the maximal number of compression points that will be utilized by a resulting classiﬁer. For each such τ the prior pτ is constructed over all possible classiﬁers that use τ compression points. By systematically considering all possible dichotomies of τ points we can characterize a relatively small subset of H without observing labels of the training points. Thus, each prior pτ represents one such guess. Using Theorem 3.4 we are later allowed to choose in retrospect the bound corresponding to the best “guess”. The following corollary identiﬁes an upper bound on the divergence in terms of the observed size of the compression set of the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Corollary 4.1 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.4 hold. Let A be a deterministic learning algorithm leading to a hypothesis h ∈ H based on a compression set of size s. Then with probability at least 1 − δ for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by s log(2e(m + u)/s) and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(m2 /δ). Proof: Recall that Hs ⊆ H is the support set of ps and that ps (h) = 1/|Hs | for all h ∈ Hs , implying that ln(1/ps (h)) = |Hs |. Using the inequality m+u ≤ (e(m + u)/s)s s we have that |Hs | = 2s m+u ≤ (2e(m + u)/s)s . Substituting this result in Theorem 3.4 s while restricting the minimum over i to be over i ≥ s, leads to the desired result. 2 The bound of Corollary 4.1 can be easily computed once the classiﬁer is trained. If the size of the compression set happens to be small, we obtain a tight bound. SVM classiﬁcation is one of the best studied compression schemes. The compression set for a sample Sm is given by the subset of support vectors. Thus the bound in Corollary 4.1 immediately applies with s being the number of observed support vectors (after training). We note that this bound is similar to a recently derived compression bound for inductive learning (Theorem 5.18 in [16]). Also, observe that the algorithm itself (inductive SVM) did not use in this case the unlabeled sample (although the bound does use this sample). Nevertheless, using exactly the same technique we obtain error bounds for the transductive SVM algorithms in [2, 3].4 3 It might be that for some dichotomies the algorithm will fail. For example, an SVM in feature space without soft margin will fail to classify non linearly-separable dichotomies of Xm+u . 4 Note however that our bounds are optimized with a “minimum number of support vectors” approach rather than “maximum margin”. 5 Bounds for Clustering Algorithms Some learning problems do not allow for high compression rates using compression schemes such as SVMs (i.e. the number of support vectors can sometimes be very large). A considerably stronger type of compression can often be achieved by clustering algorithms. While there is lack of formal links between entirely unsupervised clustering and classiﬁcation, within a transduction setting we can provide a principled approach to using clustering algorithms for classiﬁcation. Let A be any (deterministic) clustering algorithm which, given the full sample Xm+u , can cluster this sample into any desired number of clusters. We use A to cluster Xm+u into 2, 3 . . . , c clusters where c ≤ m. Thus, the algorithm generates a collection of partitions of Xm+u into τ = 2, 3, . . . , c clusters, where each partition is denoted by Cτ . For each value of τ , let Hτ consist of those hypotheses which assign an identical label to all points in the same cluster of partition Cτ , and deﬁne the prior pτ (h) = 1/2τ for each h ∈ Hτ and zero otherwise (note that there are 2τ possible dichotomies). The learning algorithm selects a hypothesis as follows. Upon observing the labeled sample Sm = (Xm , Ym ), for each of the clusterings C2 , . . . , Cc constructed above, it assigns a label to each cluster based on the majority vote from the labels Ym of points falling within the cluster (in case of ties, or if no points from Xm belong to the cluster, choose a label arbitrarily). Doing this leads to c − 1 classiﬁers hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c. For each hτ there is a valid error bound as given by Theorem 3.4 and all these bounds are valid simultaneously. Thus we choose the best classiﬁer (equivalently, number of clusters) for which the best bound holds. We thus have the following corollary of Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 2.1. Corollary 5.1 Let A be any clustering algorithm and let hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c be classiﬁcations of test set Xu as determined by clustering of the full sample Xm+u (into τ clusters) and the training set Sm , as described above. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, for all τ , (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by τ and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(mc/δ). Error bounds obtained using Corollary 5.1 can be rather tight when the clustering algorithm is successful (i.e. when it captures the class structure in the data using a small number of clusters). Corollary 5.1 can be extended in a number of ways. One simple extension is the use of an ensemble of clustering algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we can concurrently apply k clustering algorithm (using each algorithm to cluster the data into τ = 2, . . . , c clusters). We thus obtain kc hypotheses (partitions of Xm+u ). By a simple application of the union bound we can replace ln cm by ln kcm in Corollary 5.1 and guarantee that kc bounds hold siδ δ multaneously for all kc hypotheses (with probability at least 1 − δ). We thus choose the hypothesis which minimizes the resulting bound. This extension is particularly attractive since typically without prior knowledge we do not know which clustering algorithm will be effective for the dataset at hand. 6 Concluding Remarks We presented new bounds for transductive learning algorithms. We also developed a new technique for deriving tight error bounds for compression schemes and for clustering algorithms in the transductive setting. We expect that these bounds and new techniques will be useful for deriving new error bounds for other known algorithms and for deriving new types of transductive learning algorithms. It would be interesting to see if tighter transduction bounds can be obtained by reducing the “slacks” in the inequalities we use in our analysis. Another promising direction is the construction of better (multiple) priors. For example, in our compression bound (Corollary 4.1), for each number of compression points we assigned the same prior to each possible point subset and each possible dichotomy. However, in practice a vast majority of all these subsets and dichotomies are unlikely to occur.

<p>Author: Philip Derbeko, Ran El-Yaniv, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with transductive learning. Although transduction appears to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many provably useful algorithms and bounds for transduction. We present explicit error bounds for transduction and derive a general technique for devising bounds within this setting. The technique is applied to derive error bounds for compression schemes such as (transductive) SVMs and for transduction algorithms based on clustering. 1 Introduction and Related Work In contrast to inductive learning, in the transductive setting the learner is given both the training and test sets prior to learning. The goal of the learner is to infer (or “transduce”) the labels of the test points. The transduction setting was introduced by Vapnik [1, 2] who proposed basic bounds and an algorithm for this setting. Clearly, inferring the labels of points in the test set can be done using an inductive scheme. However, as pointed out in [2], it makes little sense to solve an easier problem by ‘reducing’ it to a much more difﬁcult one. In particular, the prior knowledge carried by the (unlabeled) test points can be incorporated into an algorithm, potentially leading to superior performance. Indeed, a number of papers have demonstrated empirically that transduction can offer substantial advantage over induction whenever the training set is small or moderate (see e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]). However, unlike the current state of affairs in induction, the question of what are provably effective learning principles for transduction is quite far from being resolved. In this paper we provide new error bounds and a general technique for transductive learning. Our technique is based on bounds that can be viewed as an extension of McAllester’s PAC-Bayesian framework [7, 8] to transductive learning. The main advantage of using this framework in transduction is that here priors can be selected after observing the unlabeled data (but before observing the labeled sample). This ﬂexibility allows for the choice of “compact priors” (with small support) and therefore, for tight bounds. Another simple observation is that the PAC-Bayesian framework can be operated with polynomially (in m, the training sample size) many different priors simultaneously. Altogether, this added ﬂexibility, of using data-dependent multiple priors allows for easy derivation of tight error bounds for “compression schemes” such as (transductive) SVMs and for clustering algorithms. We brieﬂy review some previous results. The idea of transduction, and a speciﬁc algorithm for SVM transductive learning, was introduced and studied by Vapnik (e.g. [2]), where an error bound is also proposed. However, this bound is implicit and rather unwieldy and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been applied in practical situations. A PAC-Bayes bound [7] for transduction with Perceptron Decision Trees is given in [9]. The bound is data-dependent depending on the number of decision nodes, the margins at each node and the sample size. However, the authors state that the transduction bound is not much tighter than the induction bound. Empirical tests show that this transduction algorithm performs slightly better than induction in terms of the test error, however, the advantage is usually statistically insigniﬁcant. Reﬁning the algorithm of [2] a transductive algorithm based on a SVMs is proposed in [3]. The paper also provides empirical tests indicating that transduction is advantageous in the text categorization domain. An error bound for transduction, based on the effective VC Dimension, is given in [10]. More recently Lanckriet et al. [11] derived a transductive bound for kernel methods based on spectral properties of the kernel matrix. Blum and Langford [12] recently also established an implicit bound for transduction, in the spirit of the results in [2]. 2 The Transduction Setup We consider the following setting proposed by Vapnik ([2] Chp. 8), which for simplicity is described in the context of binary classiﬁcation (the general case will be discussed in the full paper). Let H be a set of binary hypotheses consisting of functions from input space X to {±1} and let Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } be a set of points from X each of which is chosen i.i.d. according to some unknown distribution µ(x). We call Xm+u the full sample. Let Xm = {x1 , . . . , xm } and Ym = {y1 , . . . , ym }, where Xm is drawn uniformly from Xm+u and yi ∈ {±1}. The set Sm = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} is referred to as a training sample. In this paper we assume that yi = φ(xi ) for some unknown function φ. The remaining subset Xu = Xm+u \ Xm is referred to as the unlabeled sample. Based on Sm and Xu our goal is to choose h ∈ H which predicts the labels of points in Xu as accurately as possible. For each h ∈ H and a set Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| of samples deﬁne 1 Rh (Z) = |Z| |Z| (h(xi ), yi ), (1) i=1 where in our case (·, ·) is the zero-one loss function. Our goal in transduction is to learn an h such that Rh (Xu ) is as small as possible. This problem setup is summarized by the following transduction “protocol” introduced in [2] and referred to as Setting 1: (i) A full sample Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } consisting of arbitrary m + u points is given.1 (ii) We then choose uniformly at random the training sample Xm ⊆ Xm+u and receive its labeling Ym ; the resulting training set is Sm = (Xm , Ym ) and the remaining set Xu is the unlabeled sample, Xu = Xm+u \ Xm ; (iii) Using both Sm and Xu we select a classiﬁer h ∈ H whose quality is measured by Rh (Xu ). Vapnik [2] also considers another formulation of transduction, referred to as Setting 2: (i) We are given a training set Sm = (Xm , Ym ) selected i.i.d according to µ(x, y). (ii) An independent test set Su = (Xu , Yu ) of u samples is then selected in the same manner. 1 The original Setting 1, as proposed by Vapnik, discusses a full sample whose points are chosen independently at random according to some source distribution µ(x). (iii) We are required to choose our best h ∈ H based on Sm and Xu so as to minimize m+u Rm,u (h) = 1 (h(xi ), yi ) dµ(x1 , y1 ) · · · dµ(xm+u , ym+u ). u i=m+1 (2) Even though Setting 2 may appear more applicable in practical situations than Setting 1, the derivation of theoretical results can be easier within Setting 1. Nevertheless, as far as the expected losses are concerned, Vapnik [2] shows that an error bound in Setting 1 implies an equivalent bound in Setting 2. In view of this result we restrict ourselves in the sequel to Setting 1. We make use of the following quantities, which are all instances of (1). The quantity Rh (Xm+u ) is called the full sample risk of the hypothesis h, Rh (Xu ) is referred to as the transduction risk (of h), and Rh (Xm ) is the training error (of h). Thus, Rh (Xm ) is ˆ the standard training error denoted by Rh (Sm ). While our objective in transduction is to achieve small error over the unlabeled set (i.e. to minimize Rh (Xu )), it turns out that it is much easier to derive error bounds for the full sample risk. The following simple lemma translates an error bound on Rh (Xm+u ), the full sample risk, to an error bound on the transduction risk Rh (Xu ). Lemma 2.1 For any h ∈ H and any C ˆ Rh (Xm+u ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C ⇔ ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + m+u · C. u (3) Proof: For any h Rh (Xm+u ) = mRh (Xm ) + uRh (Xu ) . m+u (4) ˆ Substituting Rh (Sm ) for Rh (Xm ) in (4) and then substituting the result for the left-hand side of (3) we get Rh (Xm+u ) = ˆ mRh (Sm ) + uRh (Xu ) ˆ ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C. m+u The equivalence (3) is now obtained by isolating Rh (Xu ) on the left-hand side. 2 3 General Error Bounds for Transduction Consider a hypothesis class H and assume for simplicity that H is countable; in fact, in the case of transduction it sufﬁces to consider a ﬁnite hypothesis class. To see this note that all m + u points are known in advance. Thus, in the case of binary classiﬁcation (for example) it sufﬁces to consider at most 2m+u possible dichotomies. Recall that in the setting considered we select a sub-sample of m points from the set Xm+u of cardinality m+u. This corresponds to a selection of m points without replacement from a set of m+u points, leading to the m points being dependent. A naive utilization of large deviation bounds would therefore not be directly applicable in this setting. However, Hoeffding (see Theorem 4 in [13]) pointed out a simple procedure to transform the problem into one involving independent data. While this procedure leads to non-trivial bounds, it does not fully take advantage of the transductive setting and will not be used here. Consider for simplicity the case of binary classiﬁcation. In this case we make use of the following concentration inequality, based on [14]. Theorem 3.1 Let C = {c1 , . . . , cN }, ci ∈ {0, 1}, be a ﬁnite set of binary numbers, and N set c = (1/N ) i=1 ci . Let Z1 , . . . , Zm , be random variables obtaining their values ¯ by sampling C uniformly at random without replacement. Set Z = (1/m) β = m/N . Then, if 2 ε ≤ min{1 − c, c(1 − β)/β}, ¯¯ Pr {Z − EZ > ε} ≤ exp −mD(¯ + ε c) − (N − m) D c − c ¯ ¯ m i=1 Zi and βε c + 7 log(N + 1) ¯ 1−β where D(p q) = p log(p/q) = (1 − p) log(1 − p)/(1 − q), p, q, ∈ [0, 1] is the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using this result we obtain the following error bound for transductive classiﬁcation. Theorem 3.2 Let Xm+u = Xm ∪Xu be the full sample and let p = p(Xm+u ) be a (prior) distribution over the class of binary hypotheses H that may depend on the full sample. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm (from the full sample) the following bound holds for any h ∈ H, ˆ 2Rh (Sm )(m + u) u ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + + 2 log 1 p(h) log + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 1 p(h) . (5) Proof: (sketch) In our transduction setting the set Xm (and therefore Sm ) is obtained by sampling the full sample Xm+u uniformly at random without replacement. We ﬁrst claim that ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = Rh (Xm+u ), (6) where EΣm (·) is the expectation with respect to a random choice of Sm from Xm+u without replacement. This is shown as follows. ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = 1 m+u m ˆ Rh (Sm ) = Sm 1 m+u m Xm ⊆Xm+n 1 m (h(x), φ(x)). x∈Sm By symmetry, all points x ∈ Xm+u are counted on the right-hand side an equal number of times; this number is precisely m+u − m+u−1 = m+u−1 . The equality (6) is obtained m m m−1 m by considering the deﬁnition of Rh (Xm+u ) and noting that m+u−1 / m+u = m+u . m−1 m The remainder of the proof combines Theorem 3.1 and the techniques presented in [15]. The details will be provided in the full paper. 2 ˆ Notice that when Rh (Sm ) → 0 the square root in (5) vanishes and faster rates are obtained. An important feature of Theorem 3.2 is that it allows one to use the sample Xm+u in order to choose the prior distribution p(h). This advantage has already been alluded to in [2], but does not seem to have been widely used in practice. Additionally, observe that (5) holds with probability at least 1 − δ with respect to the random selection of sub-samples of size m from the ﬁxed set Xm+u . This should be contrasted with the standard inductive setting results where the probabilities are with respect to a random choice of m training points chosen i.i.d. from µ(x, y). The next bound we present is analogous to McAllester’s Theorem 1 in [8]. This theorem concerns Gibbs composite classiﬁers, which are distributions over the base classiﬁers in H. For any distribution q over H denote by Gq the Gibbs classiﬁer, which classiﬁes an 2 The second condition, ε ≤ c(1 − β)/β, simply guarantees that the number of ‘ones’ in the ¯ sub-sample does not exceed their number in the original sample. , instance (in Xu ) by randomly choosing, according to q, one hypothesis h ∈ H. For Gibbs classiﬁers we now extend deﬁnition (1) as follows. Let Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| be any set of samples and let Gq be a Gibbs classiﬁer over H. The risk of Gq over Z is RGq (Z) = Eh∼q (1/|Z|) |Z| i=1 (h(xi ), φ(xi )) . As before, when Z = Xm (the training set) we ˆ use the standard notation RGq (Sm ) = RGq (Xm ). Due to space limitations, the proof of the following theorem will appear in the full paper. Theorem 3.3 Let Xm+u be the full sample. Let p be a distribution over H that may depend on Xm+u and let q be a (posterior) distribution over H that may depend on both Sm and Xu . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. With probability at least 1 − δ over the choices of Sm for any distribution q ˆ RGq (Xu ) ≤ RGq (Sm ) + + ˆ 2RGq (Sm )(m + u) u D(q p) + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 7 2 D(q p) + ln m + m log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 . In the context of inductive learning, a major obstacle in generating meaningful and effective bounds using the PAC-Bayesian framework [8] is the construction of “compact priors”. Here we discuss two extensions to the PAC-Bayesian scheme, which together allow for easy choices of compact priors that can yield tight error bounds. The ﬁrst extension we offer is the use of multiple priors. Instead of a single prior p in the original PACBayesian framework we observe that one can use all PAC-Bayesian bounds with a number of priors p1 , . . . , pk and then replace the complexity term ln(1/p(h)) (in Theorem 3.2) by mini ln(1/pi (h)), at a cost of an additional ln k term (see below). Similarly, in Theorem 3.3 we can replace the KL-divergence term in the bound with mini D(q||pi ). The penalty for using k priors is logarithmic in k (speciﬁcally the ln(1/δ) term in the original bound becomes ln(k/δ)). As long as k is sub-exponential in m we still obtain effective generalization bounds. The second “extension” is simply the feature of our transduction bounds (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3), which allows for the priors to be dependent on the full sample Xm+u . The combination of these two simple ideas yields a powerful technique for deriving error bounds in realistic transductive settings. After stating the extended result we later use it for deriving tight bounds for known learning algorithms and for deriving new algorithms. Suppose that instead of a single prior p over H we want to utilize k priors, p1 , . . . , pk and in retrospect choose the best among the k corresponding PAC-Bayesian bounds. The following theorem shows that one can use polynomially many priors with a minor penalty. The proof, which is omitted due to space limitations, utilizes the union bound in a straightforward manner. Theorem 3.4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.2 hold, except that we now have k prior distributions p1 , . . . , pk deﬁned over H, each of which may depend on Xm+u . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over random choices of sub-samples of size m from the full-sample, for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with p(h) replaced by min1≤i≤k pi (h) and log 1 is replaced by log k . δ δ Remark: A similar result holds for the Gibbs algorithm of Theorem 3.3. Also, as noted by one of the reviewers, when the supports of the k priors intersect (i.e. there is at least one pair of priors pi and pj with overlapping support), then one can do better by utilizing the 1 “super prior” p = k i pi within the original Theorem 3.2. However, note that when the supports are disjoint, these two views (of multiple priors and a super prior) are equivalent. In the applications below we utilize non-intersecting priors. 4 Bounds for Compression Algorithms Here we propose a technique for bounding the error of “compression” algorithms based on appropriate construction of prior probabilities. Let A be a learning algorithm. Intuitively, A is a “compression scheme” if it can generate the same hypothesis using a subset of the data. More formally, a learning algorithm A (viewed as a function from samples to some hypothesis class) is a compression scheme with respect to a sample Z if there is a subsample Z , Z ⊂ Z, such that A(Z ) = A(Z). Observe that the SVM approach is a compression scheme, with Z being determined by the set of support vectors. Let A be a deterministic compression scheme and consider the full sample Xm+u . For each integer τ = 1, . . . , m, consider all subsets of Xm+u of size τ , and for each subset construct all possible dichotomies of that subset (note that we are not proposing this approach as an algorithm, but rather as a means to derive bounds; in practice one need not construct all these dichotomies). A deterministic algorithm A uniquely determines at most one hypothesis h ∈ H for each dichotomy.3 For each τ , let the set of hypotheses generated by this procedure be denoted by Hτ . For the rest of this discussion we assume the worst case where |Hτ | = m+u (i.e. if Hτ does not contains one hypothesis for each dichotomy τ the bounds improve). The prior pτ is then deﬁned to be a uniform distribution over Hτ . In this way we have m priors, p1 , . . . , pm which are constructed using only Xm+u (and are independent of Sm ). Any hypothesis selected by the learning algorithm A based on the labeled sample Sm and on the test set Xu belongs to ∪m Hτ . The motivation for this τ =1 construction is as follows. Each τ can be viewed as our “guess” for the maximal number of compression points that will be utilized by a resulting classiﬁer. For each such τ the prior pτ is constructed over all possible classiﬁers that use τ compression points. By systematically considering all possible dichotomies of τ points we can characterize a relatively small subset of H without observing labels of the training points. Thus, each prior pτ represents one such guess. Using Theorem 3.4 we are later allowed to choose in retrospect the bound corresponding to the best “guess”. The following corollary identiﬁes an upper bound on the divergence in terms of the observed size of the compression set of the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Corollary 4.1 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.4 hold. Let A be a deterministic learning algorithm leading to a hypothesis h ∈ H based on a compression set of size s. Then with probability at least 1 − δ for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by s log(2e(m + u)/s) and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(m2 /δ). Proof: Recall that Hs ⊆ H is the support set of ps and that ps (h) = 1/|Hs | for all h ∈ Hs , implying that ln(1/ps (h)) = |Hs |. Using the inequality m+u ≤ (e(m + u)/s)s s we have that |Hs | = 2s m+u ≤ (2e(m + u)/s)s . Substituting this result in Theorem 3.4 s while restricting the minimum over i to be over i ≥ s, leads to the desired result. 2 The bound of Corollary 4.1 can be easily computed once the classiﬁer is trained. If the size of the compression set happens to be small, we obtain a tight bound. SVM classiﬁcation is one of the best studied compression schemes. The compression set for a sample Sm is given by the subset of support vectors. Thus the bound in Corollary 4.1 immediately applies with s being the number of observed support vectors (after training). We note that this bound is similar to a recently derived compression bound for inductive learning (Theorem 5.18 in [16]). Also, observe that the algorithm itself (inductive SVM) did not use in this case the unlabeled sample (although the bound does use this sample). Nevertheless, using exactly the same technique we obtain error bounds for the transductive SVM algorithms in [2, 3].4 3 It might be that for some dichotomies the algorithm will fail. For example, an SVM in feature space without soft margin will fail to classify non linearly-separable dichotomies of Xm+u . 4 Note however that our bounds are optimized with a “minimum number of support vectors” approach rather than “maximum margin”. 5 Bounds for Clustering Algorithms Some learning problems do not allow for high compression rates using compression schemes such as SVMs (i.e. the number of support vectors can sometimes be very large). A considerably stronger type of compression can often be achieved by clustering algorithms. While there is lack of formal links between entirely unsupervised clustering and classiﬁcation, within a transduction setting we can provide a principled approach to using clustering algorithms for classiﬁcation. Let A be any (deterministic) clustering algorithm which, given the full sample Xm+u , can cluster this sample into any desired number of clusters. We use A to cluster Xm+u into 2, 3 . . . , c clusters where c ≤ m. Thus, the algorithm generates a collection of partitions of Xm+u into τ = 2, 3, . . . , c clusters, where each partition is denoted by Cτ . For each value of τ , let Hτ consist of those hypotheses which assign an identical label to all points in the same cluster of partition Cτ , and deﬁne the prior pτ (h) = 1/2τ for each h ∈ Hτ and zero otherwise (note that there are 2τ possible dichotomies). The learning algorithm selects a hypothesis as follows. Upon observing the labeled sample Sm = (Xm , Ym ), for each of the clusterings C2 , . . . , Cc constructed above, it assigns a label to each cluster based on the majority vote from the labels Ym of points falling within the cluster (in case of ties, or if no points from Xm belong to the cluster, choose a label arbitrarily). Doing this leads to c − 1 classiﬁers hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c. For each hτ there is a valid error bound as given by Theorem 3.4 and all these bounds are valid simultaneously. Thus we choose the best classiﬁer (equivalently, number of clusters) for which the best bound holds. We thus have the following corollary of Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 2.1. Corollary 5.1 Let A be any clustering algorithm and let hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c be classiﬁcations of test set Xu as determined by clustering of the full sample Xm+u (into τ clusters) and the training set Sm , as described above. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, for all τ , (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by τ and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(mc/δ). Error bounds obtained using Corollary 5.1 can be rather tight when the clustering algorithm is successful (i.e. when it captures the class structure in the data using a small number of clusters). Corollary 5.1 can be extended in a number of ways. One simple extension is the use of an ensemble of clustering algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we can concurrently apply k clustering algorithm (using each algorithm to cluster the data into τ = 2, . . . , c clusters). We thus obtain kc hypotheses (partitions of Xm+u ). By a simple application of the union bound we can replace ln cm by ln kcm in Corollary 5.1 and guarantee that kc bounds hold siδ δ multaneously for all kc hypotheses (with probability at least 1 − δ). We thus choose the hypothesis which minimizes the resulting bound. This extension is particularly attractive since typically without prior knowledge we do not know which clustering algorithm will be effective for the dataset at hand. 6 Concluding Remarks We presented new bounds for transductive learning algorithms. We also developed a new technique for deriving tight error bounds for compression schemes and for clustering algorithms in the transductive setting. We expect that these bounds and new techniques will be useful for deriving new error bounds for other known algorithms and for deriving new types of transductive learning algorithms. It would be interesting to see if tighter transduction bounds can be obtained by reducing the “slacks” in the inequalities we use in our analysis. Another promising direction is the construction of better (multiple) priors. For example, in our compression bound (Corollary 4.1), for each number of compression points we assigned the same prior to each possible point subset and each possible dichotomy. However, in practice a vast majority of all these subsets and dichotomies are unlikely to occur.

<p>Author: Tijl D. Bie, Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: The 2-class transduction problem, as formulated by Vapnik [1], involves ﬁnding a separating hyperplane for a labelled data set that is also maximally distant from a given set of unlabelled test points. In this form, the problem has exponential computational complexity in the size of the working set. So far it has been attacked by means of integer programming techniques [2] that do not scale to reasonable problem sizes, or by local search procedures [3]. In this paper we present a relaxation of this task based on semideﬁnite programming (SDP), resulting in a convex optimization problem that has polynomial complexity in the size of the data set. The results are very encouraging for mid sized data sets, however the cost is still too high for large scale problems, due to the high dimensional search space. To this end, we restrict the feasible region by introducing an approximation based on solving an eigenproblem. With this approximation, the computational cost of the algorithm is such that problems with more than 1000 points can be treated. 1</p><p>3 0.11063342 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Learning_with_Local_and_Global_Consistency.html">113 nips-2003-Learning with Local and Global Consistency</a></p>

Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distribution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist “bad” prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution. 1</p><p>6 0.095083877 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Semi-supervised_Protein_Classification_Using_Cluster_Kernels.html">173 nips-2003-Semi-supervised Protein Classification Using Cluster Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Philip Derbeko, Ran El-Yaniv, Ron Meir</p><p>Abstract: This paper is concerned with transductive learning. Although transduction appears to be an easier task than induction, there have not been many provably useful algorithms and bounds for transduction. We present explicit error bounds for transduction and derive a general technique for devising bounds within this setting. The technique is applied to derive error bounds for compression schemes such as (transductive) SVMs and for transduction algorithms based on clustering. 1 Introduction and Related Work In contrast to inductive learning, in the transductive setting the learner is given both the training and test sets prior to learning. The goal of the learner is to infer (or “transduce”) the labels of the test points. The transduction setting was introduced by Vapnik [1, 2] who proposed basic bounds and an algorithm for this setting. Clearly, inferring the labels of points in the test set can be done using an inductive scheme. However, as pointed out in [2], it makes little sense to solve an easier problem by ‘reducing’ it to a much more difﬁcult one. In particular, the prior knowledge carried by the (unlabeled) test points can be incorporated into an algorithm, potentially leading to superior performance. Indeed, a number of papers have demonstrated empirically that transduction can offer substantial advantage over induction whenever the training set is small or moderate (see e.g. [3, 4, 5, 6]). However, unlike the current state of affairs in induction, the question of what are provably effective learning principles for transduction is quite far from being resolved. In this paper we provide new error bounds and a general technique for transductive learning. Our technique is based on bounds that can be viewed as an extension of McAllester’s PAC-Bayesian framework [7, 8] to transductive learning. The main advantage of using this framework in transduction is that here priors can be selected after observing the unlabeled data (but before observing the labeled sample). This ﬂexibility allows for the choice of “compact priors” (with small support) and therefore, for tight bounds. Another simple observation is that the PAC-Bayesian framework can be operated with polynomially (in m, the training sample size) many different priors simultaneously. Altogether, this added ﬂexibility, of using data-dependent multiple priors allows for easy derivation of tight error bounds for “compression schemes” such as (transductive) SVMs and for clustering algorithms. We brieﬂy review some previous results. The idea of transduction, and a speciﬁc algorithm for SVM transductive learning, was introduced and studied by Vapnik (e.g. [2]), where an error bound is also proposed. However, this bound is implicit and rather unwieldy and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been applied in practical situations. A PAC-Bayes bound [7] for transduction with Perceptron Decision Trees is given in [9]. The bound is data-dependent depending on the number of decision nodes, the margins at each node and the sample size. However, the authors state that the transduction bound is not much tighter than the induction bound. Empirical tests show that this transduction algorithm performs slightly better than induction in terms of the test error, however, the advantage is usually statistically insigniﬁcant. Reﬁning the algorithm of [2] a transductive algorithm based on a SVMs is proposed in [3]. The paper also provides empirical tests indicating that transduction is advantageous in the text categorization domain. An error bound for transduction, based on the effective VC Dimension, is given in [10]. More recently Lanckriet et al. [11] derived a transductive bound for kernel methods based on spectral properties of the kernel matrix. Blum and Langford [12] recently also established an implicit bound for transduction, in the spirit of the results in [2]. 2 The Transduction Setup We consider the following setting proposed by Vapnik ([2] Chp. 8), which for simplicity is described in the context of binary classiﬁcation (the general case will be discussed in the full paper). Let H be a set of binary hypotheses consisting of functions from input space X to {±1} and let Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } be a set of points from X each of which is chosen i.i.d. according to some unknown distribution µ(x). We call Xm+u the full sample. Let Xm = {x1 , . . . , xm } and Ym = {y1 , . . . , ym }, where Xm is drawn uniformly from Xm+u and yi ∈ {±1}. The set Sm = {(x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xm , ym )} is referred to as a training sample. In this paper we assume that yi = φ(xi ) for some unknown function φ. The remaining subset Xu = Xm+u \ Xm is referred to as the unlabeled sample. Based on Sm and Xu our goal is to choose h ∈ H which predicts the labels of points in Xu as accurately as possible. For each h ∈ H and a set Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| of samples deﬁne 1 Rh (Z) = |Z| |Z| (h(xi ), yi ), (1) i=1 where in our case (·, ·) is the zero-one loss function. Our goal in transduction is to learn an h such that Rh (Xu ) is as small as possible. This problem setup is summarized by the following transduction “protocol” introduced in [2] and referred to as Setting 1: (i) A full sample Xm+u = {x1 , . . . , xm+u } consisting of arbitrary m + u points is given.1 (ii) We then choose uniformly at random the training sample Xm ⊆ Xm+u and receive its labeling Ym ; the resulting training set is Sm = (Xm , Ym ) and the remaining set Xu is the unlabeled sample, Xu = Xm+u \ Xm ; (iii) Using both Sm and Xu we select a classiﬁer h ∈ H whose quality is measured by Rh (Xu ). Vapnik [2] also considers another formulation of transduction, referred to as Setting 2: (i) We are given a training set Sm = (Xm , Ym ) selected i.i.d according to µ(x, y). (ii) An independent test set Su = (Xu , Yu ) of u samples is then selected in the same manner. 1 The original Setting 1, as proposed by Vapnik, discusses a full sample whose points are chosen independently at random according to some source distribution µ(x). (iii) We are required to choose our best h ∈ H based on Sm and Xu so as to minimize m+u Rm,u (h) = 1 (h(xi ), yi ) dµ(x1 , y1 ) · · · dµ(xm+u , ym+u ). u i=m+1 (2) Even though Setting 2 may appear more applicable in practical situations than Setting 1, the derivation of theoretical results can be easier within Setting 1. Nevertheless, as far as the expected losses are concerned, Vapnik [2] shows that an error bound in Setting 1 implies an equivalent bound in Setting 2. In view of this result we restrict ourselves in the sequel to Setting 1. We make use of the following quantities, which are all instances of (1). The quantity Rh (Xm+u ) is called the full sample risk of the hypothesis h, Rh (Xu ) is referred to as the transduction risk (of h), and Rh (Xm ) is the training error (of h). Thus, Rh (Xm ) is ˆ the standard training error denoted by Rh (Sm ). While our objective in transduction is to achieve small error over the unlabeled set (i.e. to minimize Rh (Xu )), it turns out that it is much easier to derive error bounds for the full sample risk. The following simple lemma translates an error bound on Rh (Xm+u ), the full sample risk, to an error bound on the transduction risk Rh (Xu ). Lemma 2.1 For any h ∈ H and any C ˆ Rh (Xm+u ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C ⇔ ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + m+u · C. u (3) Proof: For any h Rh (Xm+u ) = mRh (Xm ) + uRh (Xu ) . m+u (4) ˆ Substituting Rh (Sm ) for Rh (Xm ) in (4) and then substituting the result for the left-hand side of (3) we get Rh (Xm+u ) = ˆ mRh (Sm ) + uRh (Xu ) ˆ ≤ Rh (Sm ) + C. m+u The equivalence (3) is now obtained by isolating Rh (Xu ) on the left-hand side. 2 3 General Error Bounds for Transduction Consider a hypothesis class H and assume for simplicity that H is countable; in fact, in the case of transduction it sufﬁces to consider a ﬁnite hypothesis class. To see this note that all m + u points are known in advance. Thus, in the case of binary classiﬁcation (for example) it sufﬁces to consider at most 2m+u possible dichotomies. Recall that in the setting considered we select a sub-sample of m points from the set Xm+u of cardinality m+u. This corresponds to a selection of m points without replacement from a set of m+u points, leading to the m points being dependent. A naive utilization of large deviation bounds would therefore not be directly applicable in this setting. However, Hoeffding (see Theorem 4 in [13]) pointed out a simple procedure to transform the problem into one involving independent data. While this procedure leads to non-trivial bounds, it does not fully take advantage of the transductive setting and will not be used here. Consider for simplicity the case of binary classiﬁcation. In this case we make use of the following concentration inequality, based on [14]. Theorem 3.1 Let C = {c1 , . . . , cN }, ci ∈ {0, 1}, be a ﬁnite set of binary numbers, and N set c = (1/N ) i=1 ci . Let Z1 , . . . , Zm , be random variables obtaining their values ¯ by sampling C uniformly at random without replacement. Set Z = (1/m) β = m/N . Then, if 2 ε ≤ min{1 − c, c(1 − β)/β}, ¯¯ Pr {Z − EZ > ε} ≤ exp −mD(¯ + ε c) − (N − m) D c − c ¯ ¯ m i=1 Zi and βε c + 7 log(N + 1) ¯ 1−β where D(p q) = p log(p/q) = (1 − p) log(1 − p)/(1 − q), p, q, ∈ [0, 1] is the binary Kullback-Leibler divergence. Using this result we obtain the following error bound for transductive classiﬁcation. Theorem 3.2 Let Xm+u = Xm ∪Xu be the full sample and let p = p(Xm+u ) be a (prior) distribution over the class of binary hypotheses H that may depend on the full sample. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over choices of Sm (from the full sample) the following bound holds for any h ∈ H, ˆ 2Rh (Sm )(m + u) u ˆ Rh (Xu ) ≤ Rh (Sm ) + + 2 log 1 p(h) log + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 1 p(h) . (5) Proof: (sketch) In our transduction setting the set Xm (and therefore Sm ) is obtained by sampling the full sample Xm+u uniformly at random without replacement. We ﬁrst claim that ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = Rh (Xm+u ), (6) where EΣm (·) is the expectation with respect to a random choice of Sm from Xm+u without replacement. This is shown as follows. ˆ EΣm Rh (Sm ) = 1 m+u m ˆ Rh (Sm ) = Sm 1 m+u m Xm ⊆Xm+n 1 m (h(x), φ(x)). x∈Sm By symmetry, all points x ∈ Xm+u are counted on the right-hand side an equal number of times; this number is precisely m+u − m+u−1 = m+u−1 . The equality (6) is obtained m m m−1 m by considering the deﬁnition of Rh (Xm+u ) and noting that m+u−1 / m+u = m+u . m−1 m The remainder of the proof combines Theorem 3.1 and the techniques presented in [15]. The details will be provided in the full paper. 2 ˆ Notice that when Rh (Sm ) → 0 the square root in (5) vanishes and faster rates are obtained. An important feature of Theorem 3.2 is that it allows one to use the sample Xm+u in order to choose the prior distribution p(h). This advantage has already been alluded to in [2], but does not seem to have been widely used in practice. Additionally, observe that (5) holds with probability at least 1 − δ with respect to the random selection of sub-samples of size m from the ﬁxed set Xm+u . This should be contrasted with the standard inductive setting results where the probabilities are with respect to a random choice of m training points chosen i.i.d. from µ(x, y). The next bound we present is analogous to McAllester’s Theorem 1 in [8]. This theorem concerns Gibbs composite classiﬁers, which are distributions over the base classiﬁers in H. For any distribution q over H denote by Gq the Gibbs classiﬁer, which classiﬁes an 2 The second condition, ε ≤ c(1 − β)/β, simply guarantees that the number of ‘ones’ in the ¯ sub-sample does not exceed their number in the original sample. , instance (in Xu ) by randomly choosing, according to q, one hypothesis h ∈ H. For Gibbs classiﬁers we now extend deﬁnition (1) as follows. Let Z = x1 , . . . , x|Z| be any set of samples and let Gq be a Gibbs classiﬁer over H. The risk of Gq over Z is RGq (Z) = Eh∼q (1/|Z|) |Z| i=1 (h(xi ), φ(xi )) . As before, when Z = Xm (the training set) we ˆ use the standard notation RGq (Sm ) = RGq (Xm ). Due to space limitations, the proof of the following theorem will appear in the full paper. Theorem 3.3 Let Xm+u be the full sample. Let p be a distribution over H that may depend on Xm+u and let q be a (posterior) distribution over H that may depend on both Sm and Xu . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. With probability at least 1 − δ over the choices of Sm for any distribution q ˆ RGq (Xu ) ≤ RGq (Sm ) + + ˆ 2RGq (Sm )(m + u) u D(q p) + ln m + 7 log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 7 2 D(q p) + ln m + m log(m + u + 1) δ m−1 . In the context of inductive learning, a major obstacle in generating meaningful and effective bounds using the PAC-Bayesian framework [8] is the construction of “compact priors”. Here we discuss two extensions to the PAC-Bayesian scheme, which together allow for easy choices of compact priors that can yield tight error bounds. The ﬁrst extension we offer is the use of multiple priors. Instead of a single prior p in the original PACBayesian framework we observe that one can use all PAC-Bayesian bounds with a number of priors p1 , . . . , pk and then replace the complexity term ln(1/p(h)) (in Theorem 3.2) by mini ln(1/pi (h)), at a cost of an additional ln k term (see below). Similarly, in Theorem 3.3 we can replace the KL-divergence term in the bound with mini D(q||pi ). The penalty for using k priors is logarithmic in k (speciﬁcally the ln(1/δ) term in the original bound becomes ln(k/δ)). As long as k is sub-exponential in m we still obtain effective generalization bounds. The second “extension” is simply the feature of our transduction bounds (Theorems 3.2 and 3.3), which allows for the priors to be dependent on the full sample Xm+u . The combination of these two simple ideas yields a powerful technique for deriving error bounds in realistic transductive settings. After stating the extended result we later use it for deriving tight bounds for known learning algorithms and for deriving new algorithms. Suppose that instead of a single prior p over H we want to utilize k priors, p1 , . . . , pk and in retrospect choose the best among the k corresponding PAC-Bayesian bounds. The following theorem shows that one can use polynomially many priors with a minor penalty. The proof, which is omitted due to space limitations, utilizes the union bound in a straightforward manner. Theorem 3.4 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.2 hold, except that we now have k prior distributions p1 , . . . , pk deﬁned over H, each of which may depend on Xm+u . Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then, with probability at least 1 − δ over random choices of sub-samples of size m from the full-sample, for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with p(h) replaced by min1≤i≤k pi (h) and log 1 is replaced by log k . δ δ Remark: A similar result holds for the Gibbs algorithm of Theorem 3.3. Also, as noted by one of the reviewers, when the supports of the k priors intersect (i.e. there is at least one pair of priors pi and pj with overlapping support), then one can do better by utilizing the 1 “super prior” p = k i pi within the original Theorem 3.2. However, note that when the supports are disjoint, these two views (of multiple priors and a super prior) are equivalent. In the applications below we utilize non-intersecting priors. 4 Bounds for Compression Algorithms Here we propose a technique for bounding the error of “compression” algorithms based on appropriate construction of prior probabilities. Let A be a learning algorithm. Intuitively, A is a “compression scheme” if it can generate the same hypothesis using a subset of the data. More formally, a learning algorithm A (viewed as a function from samples to some hypothesis class) is a compression scheme with respect to a sample Z if there is a subsample Z , Z ⊂ Z, such that A(Z ) = A(Z). Observe that the SVM approach is a compression scheme, with Z being determined by the set of support vectors. Let A be a deterministic compression scheme and consider the full sample Xm+u . For each integer τ = 1, . . . , m, consider all subsets of Xm+u of size τ , and for each subset construct all possible dichotomies of that subset (note that we are not proposing this approach as an algorithm, but rather as a means to derive bounds; in practice one need not construct all these dichotomies). A deterministic algorithm A uniquely determines at most one hypothesis h ∈ H for each dichotomy.3 For each τ , let the set of hypotheses generated by this procedure be denoted by Hτ . For the rest of this discussion we assume the worst case where |Hτ | = m+u (i.e. if Hτ does not contains one hypothesis for each dichotomy τ the bounds improve). The prior pτ is then deﬁned to be a uniform distribution over Hτ . In this way we have m priors, p1 , . . . , pm which are constructed using only Xm+u (and are independent of Sm ). Any hypothesis selected by the learning algorithm A based on the labeled sample Sm and on the test set Xu belongs to ∪m Hτ . The motivation for this τ =1 construction is as follows. Each τ can be viewed as our “guess” for the maximal number of compression points that will be utilized by a resulting classiﬁer. For each such τ the prior pτ is constructed over all possible classiﬁers that use τ compression points. By systematically considering all possible dichotomies of τ points we can characterize a relatively small subset of H without observing labels of the training points. Thus, each prior pτ represents one such guess. Using Theorem 3.4 we are later allowed to choose in retrospect the bound corresponding to the best “guess”. The following corollary identiﬁes an upper bound on the divergence in terms of the observed size of the compression set of the ﬁnal classiﬁer. Corollary 4.1 Let the conditions of Theorem 3.4 hold. Let A be a deterministic learning algorithm leading to a hypothesis h ∈ H based on a compression set of size s. Then with probability at least 1 − δ for all h ∈ H, (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by s log(2e(m + u)/s) and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(m2 /δ). Proof: Recall that Hs ⊆ H is the support set of ps and that ps (h) = 1/|Hs | for all h ∈ Hs , implying that ln(1/ps (h)) = |Hs |. Using the inequality m+u ≤ (e(m + u)/s)s s we have that |Hs | = 2s m+u ≤ (2e(m + u)/s)s . Substituting this result in Theorem 3.4 s while restricting the minimum over i to be over i ≥ s, leads to the desired result. 2 The bound of Corollary 4.1 can be easily computed once the classiﬁer is trained. If the size of the compression set happens to be small, we obtain a tight bound. SVM classiﬁcation is one of the best studied compression schemes. The compression set for a sample Sm is given by the subset of support vectors. Thus the bound in Corollary 4.1 immediately applies with s being the number of observed support vectors (after training). We note that this bound is similar to a recently derived compression bound for inductive learning (Theorem 5.18 in [16]). Also, observe that the algorithm itself (inductive SVM) did not use in this case the unlabeled sample (although the bound does use this sample). Nevertheless, using exactly the same technique we obtain error bounds for the transductive SVM algorithms in [2, 3].4 3 It might be that for some dichotomies the algorithm will fail. For example, an SVM in feature space without soft margin will fail to classify non linearly-separable dichotomies of Xm+u . 4 Note however that our bounds are optimized with a “minimum number of support vectors” approach rather than “maximum margin”. 5 Bounds for Clustering Algorithms Some learning problems do not allow for high compression rates using compression schemes such as SVMs (i.e. the number of support vectors can sometimes be very large). A considerably stronger type of compression can often be achieved by clustering algorithms. While there is lack of formal links between entirely unsupervised clustering and classiﬁcation, within a transduction setting we can provide a principled approach to using clustering algorithms for classiﬁcation. Let A be any (deterministic) clustering algorithm which, given the full sample Xm+u , can cluster this sample into any desired number of clusters. We use A to cluster Xm+u into 2, 3 . . . , c clusters where c ≤ m. Thus, the algorithm generates a collection of partitions of Xm+u into τ = 2, 3, . . . , c clusters, where each partition is denoted by Cτ . For each value of τ , let Hτ consist of those hypotheses which assign an identical label to all points in the same cluster of partition Cτ , and deﬁne the prior pτ (h) = 1/2τ for each h ∈ Hτ and zero otherwise (note that there are 2τ possible dichotomies). The learning algorithm selects a hypothesis as follows. Upon observing the labeled sample Sm = (Xm , Ym ), for each of the clusterings C2 , . . . , Cc constructed above, it assigns a label to each cluster based on the majority vote from the labels Ym of points falling within the cluster (in case of ties, or if no points from Xm belong to the cluster, choose a label arbitrarily). Doing this leads to c − 1 classiﬁers hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c. For each hτ there is a valid error bound as given by Theorem 3.4 and all these bounds are valid simultaneously. Thus we choose the best classiﬁer (equivalently, number of clusters) for which the best bound holds. We thus have the following corollary of Theorem 3.4 and Lemma 2.1. Corollary 5.1 Let A be any clustering algorithm and let hτ , τ = 2, . . . , c be classiﬁcations of test set Xu as determined by clustering of the full sample Xm+u (into τ clusters) and the training set Sm , as described above. Let δ ∈ (0, 1) be given. Then with probability at least 1 − δ, for all τ , (5) holds with log(1/p(h)) replaced by τ and ln(m/δ) replaced by ln(mc/δ). Error bounds obtained using Corollary 5.1 can be rather tight when the clustering algorithm is successful (i.e. when it captures the class structure in the data using a small number of clusters). Corollary 5.1 can be extended in a number of ways. One simple extension is the use of an ensemble of clustering algorithms. Speciﬁcally, we can concurrently apply k clustering algorithm (using each algorithm to cluster the data into τ = 2, . . . , c clusters). We thus obtain kc hypotheses (partitions of Xm+u ). By a simple application of the union bound we can replace ln cm by ln kcm in Corollary 5.1 and guarantee that kc bounds hold siδ δ multaneously for all kc hypotheses (with probability at least 1 − δ). We thus choose the hypothesis which minimizes the resulting bound. This extension is particularly attractive since typically without prior knowledge we do not know which clustering algorithm will be effective for the dataset at hand. 6 Concluding Remarks We presented new bounds for transductive learning algorithms. We also developed a new technique for deriving tight error bounds for compression schemes and for clustering algorithms in the transductive setting. We expect that these bounds and new techniques will be useful for deriving new error bounds for other known algorithms and for deriving new types of transductive learning algorithms. It would be interesting to see if tighter transduction bounds can be obtained by reducing the “slacks” in the inequalities we use in our analysis. Another promising direction is the construction of better (multiple) priors. For example, in our compression bound (Corollary 4.1), for each number of compression points we assigned the same prior to each possible point subset and each possible dichotomy. However, in practice a vast majority of all these subsets and dichotomies are unlikely to occur.

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we obtain convergence bounds for the concentration of Bayesian posterior distributions (around the true distribution) using a novel method that simpliﬁes and enhances previous results. Based on the analysis, we also introduce a generalized family of Bayesian posteriors, and show that the convergence behavior of these generalized posteriors is completely determined by the local prior structure around the true distribution. This important and surprising robustness property does not hold for the standard Bayesian posterior in that it may not concentrate when there exist “bad” prior structures even at places far away from the true distribution. 1</p><p>3 0.58749777 <a title="63-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Convex_Methods_for_Transduction.html">48 nips-2003-Convex Methods for Transduction</a></p>
<p>Author: Tijl D. Bie, Nello Cristianini</p><p>Abstract: The 2-class transduction problem, as formulated by Vapnik [1], involves ﬁnding a separating hyperplane for a labelled data set that is also maximally distant from a given set of unlabelled test points. In this form, the problem has exponential computational complexity in the size of the working set. So far it has been attacked by means of integer programming techniques [2] that do not scale to reasonable problem sizes, or by local search procedures [3]. In this paper we present a relaxation of this task based on semideﬁnite programming (SDP), resulting in a convex optimization problem that has polynomial complexity in the size of the data set. The results are very encouraging for mid sized data sets, however the cost is still too high for large scale problems, due to the high dimensional search space. To this end, we restrict the feasible region by introducing an approximation based on solving an eigenproblem. With this approximation, the computational cost of the algorithm is such that problems with more than 1000 points can be treated. 1</p><p>4 0.4462252 <a title="63-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Concentration_of_Expectation_and_Approximate_Inference_in_Layered_Networks.html">142 nips-2003-On the Concentration of Expectation and Approximate Inference in Layered Networks</a></p>

<p>Author: Claudio Gentile</p><p>Abstract: New feature selection algorithms for linear threshold functions are described which combine backward elimination with an adaptive regularization method. This makes them particularly suitable to the classiﬁcation of microarray expression data, where the goal is to obtain accurate rules depending on few genes only. Our algorithms are fast and easy to implement, since they center on an incremental (large margin) algorithm which allows us to avoid linear, quadratic or higher-order programming methods. We report on preliminary experiments with ﬁve known DNA microarray datasets. These experiments suggest that multiplicative large margin algorithms tend to outperform additive algorithms (such as SVM) on feature selection tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.43666199 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Learning_with_Local_and_Global_Consistency.html">113 nips-2003-Learning with Local and Global Consistency</a></p>

One important idea34 is that kernels result from filtering, ie an attempt by synapses to eliminate noise corrupting learning. This idea has hitherto been applied to trace learning rules; we apply it to experimentally-defined kernels, using it to reverse-engineer assumed signal statistics. We also extend it to consider the additional goal for filtering of weighting learning according to statistical surprise, as in the Z-score transform. This provides a fresh view of observed kernels and can lead to different, and more natural, signal statistics.</p><p>2 0.9947024 <a title="63-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Variational_Linear_Response.html">193 nips-2003-Variational Linear Response</a></p>

<p>Author: Quaid D. Morris, Brendan J. Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets. We test our model (a) (b) 40 0 untangling baseline random empirical potential posterior −2 30 log Pr true positives (%) 50 20 10 −4 −6 −8 0 0 5 10 −10 0 false positives (%) 10 20 30 degree (# of nodes) Figure 3: Protein-protein interaction network untangling results.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

<p>Author: Reto Wyss, Paul F. Verschure</p><p>Abstract: One current explanation of the view independent representation of space by the place-cells of the hippocampus is that they arise out of the summation of view dependent Gaussians. This proposal assumes that visual representations show bounded invariance. Here we investigate whether a recently proposed visual encoding scheme called the temporal population code can provide such representations. Our analysis is based on the behavior of a simulated robot in a virtual environment containing speciﬁc visual cues. Our results show that the temporal population code provides a representational substrate that can naturally account for the formation of place ﬁelds. 1</p><p>5 0.98921239 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Approximability_of_Probability_Distributions.html">30 nips-2003-Approximability of Probability Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Alina Beygelzimer, Irina Rish</p><p>Abstract: We consider the question of how well a given distribution can be approximated with probabilistic graphical models. We introduce a new parameter, effective treewidth, that captures the degree of approximability as a tradeoff between the accuracy and the complexity of approximation. We present a simple approach to analyzing achievable tradeoffs that exploits the threshold behavior of monotone graph properties, and provide experimental results that support the approach. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.98349321 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Error_Bounds_for_Transductive_Learning_via_Compression_and_Clustering.html">63 nips-2003-Error Bounds for Transductive Learning via Compression and Clustering</a></p>

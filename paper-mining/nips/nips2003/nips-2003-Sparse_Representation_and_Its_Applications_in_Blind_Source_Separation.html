<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: Existing source location and recovery algorithms used in magnetoencephalographic imaging generally assume that the source activity at different brain locations is independent or that the correlation structure is known. However, electrophysiological recordings of local ﬁeld potentials show strong correlations in aggregate activity over signiﬁcant distances. Indeed, it seems very likely that stimulus-evoked activity would follow strongly correlated time-courses in different brain areas. Here, we present, and validate through simulations, a new approach to source reconstruction in which the correlation between sources is modelled and estimated explicitly by variational Bayesian methods, facilitating accurate recovery of source locations and the time-courses of their activation. 1</p><p>3 0.18698943 <a title="179-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Impact_of_an_Energy_Normalization_Transform_on_the_Performance_of_the_LF-ASD_Brain_Computer_Interface.html">89 nips-2003-Impact of an Energy Normalization Transform on the Performance of the LF-ASD Brain Computer Interface</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Zhou, Steven G. Mason, Gary E. Birch</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an energy normalization transform as a method to reduce system errors in the LF-ASD brain-computer interface. The energy normalization transform has two major benefits to the system performance. First, it can increase class separation between the active and idle EEG data. Second, it can desensitize the system to the signal amplitude variability. For four subjects in the study, the benefits resulted in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD in the range from 7.7% to 18.9%, while for the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. 1 In trod u ction In an effort to provide alternative communication channels for people who suffer from severe loss of motor function, several researchers have worked over the past two decades to develop a direct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has good time resolution and is non-invasive, it is commonly used for data source of a BCI. A BCI system converts the input EEG into control signals, which are then used to control devices like computers, environmental control system and neuro-prostheses. Mason and Birch [1] proposed the Low-Frequency Asynchronous Switch Design (LF-ASD) as a BCI which detected imagined voluntary movement-related potentials (IVMRPs) in spontaneous EEG. The principle signal processing components of the LF-ASD are shown in Figure 1. sIN Feature Extractor sLPF LPF Feature Classifier sFE sFC Figure 1: The original LF-ASD design. The input to the low-pass filter (LPF), denoted as SIN in Figure 1, are six bipolar EEG signals recorded from F1-FC1, Fz-FCz, F2-FC2, FC1-C1, FCz-Cz and FC2-C2 sampled at 128 Hz. The cutoff frequency of the LPF implemented by Mason and Birch was 4 Hz. The Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD extracts custom features related to IVMRPs. The Feature Classifier implements a one-nearest-neighbor (1NN) classifier, which determines if the input signals are related to a user state of voluntary movement or passive (idle) observation. The LF-ASD was able to achieve True Positive (TP) values in the range of 44%-81%, with the corresponding False Positive (FP) values around 1% [1]. Although encouraging, the current error rates of the LF-ASD are insufficient for real-world applications. This paper proposes a method to improve the system performance. 2 Design and Rationale The improved design of the LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is provided in Figure 2. SIN ENT SN SNLPF LPF Feature Extractor SNFE SNFC Feature Classifier Figure 2: The improved LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform. The design of the Feature Extractor and Feature Classifier were the same as shown in Figure 1. The Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is implemented as S N (n ) = S s=( w s= − ( N ∑ w IN S IN −1) / 2 N −1) / 2 (n ) 2 (n − s) w N where W N (normalization window size) is the only parameter in the equation. The optimal parameter value was obtained by exhaustive search for the best class separation between active and idle EEG data. The method of obtaining the active and idle EEG data is provided in Section 3.1. The idea to use energy normalization to improve the LF-ASD design was based primarily on an observation that high frequency power decreases significantly around movement. For example, Jasper and Penfield [3] and Pfurtscheller et al, [4] reported EEG power decrease in the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta rhythm (18-26 Hz) when people are involved in motor related activity. Also Mason [5] found that the power in the frequency components greater than 4Hz decreased significantly during movement-related potential periods, while power in the frequency components less than 4Hz did not. Thus energy normalization, which would increase the low frequency power level, would strengthen the 0-4 Hz features used in the LF-ASD and hence reduce errors. In addition, as a side benefit, it can automatically adjust the mean scale of the input signal and desensitize the system to change in EEG power, which is known to vary over time [2]. Therefore, it was postulated that the addition of ENT into the improved design would have two major benefits. First, it can increase the EEG power around motor potentials, consequently increasing the class separation and feature strength. Second, it can desensitize the system to amplitude variance of the input signal. In addition, since the system components of the modified LF-ASD after the ENT were the same as in the original design, a major concern was whether or not the ENT distorted the features used by the LF-ASD. Since the features used by the LFASD are generated from the 0-4 Hz band, if the ENT does not distort the phase and magnitude spectrum in this specific band, it would not distort the features related to movement potential detection in the application. 3 3.1 Evaluation Test data Two types of EEG data were pre-recorded from five able-bodied individuals as shown in Figure 3. Active Data Type and Idle Data Type. Active Data was recorded during repeated right index finger flexions alternating with periods of no motor activity; Idle Data was recorded during extended periods of passive observation. Figure 3: Data Definition of M1, M2, Idle1 and Idle2. Observation windows centered at the time of the finger switch activations (as shown in Figure 4) were imposed in the active data to separate data related to movements from data during periods of idleness. For purpose of this study, data in the front part of the observation window was defined as M1 and data in the rear part of the window was defined as M2. Data falling out of the observation window was defined as Idle2. All the data in the Idle Data Type was defined as Idle1 for comparison with Idle2. Figure 4: Ensemble Average of EEG centered on finger activations. Figure 5: Density distribution of Idle1, Idle2, M1 and M2. It was noted, in terms of the density distribution of active and idle data, the separation between M2 and Idle2 was the largest and Idle1 and Idle2 were nearly identical (see Figure 5). For the study, M2 and Idle2 were chosen to represent the active and idle data classes and the separation between M2 and Idle2 data was defined by the difference of means (DOM) scaled by the amplitude range of Idle2. 3.2 Optimal parameter determination The optimal combination of normalization window size, W N, and observation window size, W O was selected to be that which achieved the maximal DOM value. This was determined by exhaustive search, and discussed in Section 4.1. 3.3 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output As mentioned previously, it was postulated that the ENT had two major impacts: increasing the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitizing the system to the signal amplitude variance. The hypothesis was evaluated by comparing characteristics of SNLPF and SLPF in Figure 1 and Figure 2. DOM was applied to measure the increased class separation. The signal with the larger DOM meant larger class separation. In addition, the signal with smaller standard deviation may result in a more stable feature set. 3.4 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The performances of the original and improved designs were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics of SNFC in Figure 2 to SFC in Figure 1. A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) [6] was generated for the original and improved designs. The ROC Curve characterizes the system performance over a range of TP vs. FP values. The larger area under ROC Curve indicates better system performance. In real applications, a BCI with high-level FP rates could cause frustration for subjects. Therefore, in this work only the LF-ASD performance when the FP values are less than 1% were studied. 4 4.1 Results Optimal normalization window size (WN) The method to choose optimal WN was an exhaustive search for maximal DOM between active and idle classes. This method was possibly dependent on the observation window size (W O). However, as shown in Figure 6a, the optimal WN was found to be independent of WO. Experimentally, the W O values were selected in the range of 50-60 samples, which corresponded to largest DOM between nonnormalized active and idle data. The optimal WN was obtained by exhaustive search for the largest DOM through normalized active and idle data. The DOM vs. WN profile for Subject 1 is shown in Figure 6b. a) b) Figure 6: Optimal parameter determination for Subject 1 in Channel 1 a) DOM vs. WO; b) DOM vs. WN. When using ENT, a small W N value may cause distortion to the feature set used by the LF-ASD. Thus, the optimal W N was not selected in this range (< 40 samples). When W N is greater than 200, the ENT has lost its capability to increase class separation and the DOM curve gradually goes towards the best separation without normalization. Thus, the optimal W N should correspond to the maximal DOM value when W N is in the range from 40 to 200. In Figure 6b, the optimal WN is around 51. 4.2 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output With ENT, the standard deviation of the low frequency EEG signal decreased from around 1.90 to 1.30 over the six channels and over the five subjects. This change resulted in more stable feature sets. Thus, the ENT desensitizes the system to input signal variance. a) b) Figure 7: Density distribution of the active vs. idle class without (a) and with (b) ENT, for Subject 1 in Channel 1. As shown in Figure 7, by increasing the EEG power around motor potentials, ENT can increase class separations between active and idle EEG data. The class separation in (frontal) Channels 1-3 across all subjects increased consistently with the proposed ENT. The same was true for (midline) Channels 4-6, for all subjects except Subject 5, whose DOM in channel 5-6 decreased by 2.3% and 3.4% respectively with normalization. That is consistent with the fact that his EEG power in Channels 4-6 does not decrease. On average, across all five subjects, DOM increases with normalization to about 28.8%, 26.4%, 39.4%, 20.5%, 17.8% and 22.5% over six channels respectively. In addition, the magnitude and phase spectrums of the EEG signal before and after ENT is provided in Figure 8. The ENT has no visible distortion to the signal in the low frequency band (0-4 Hz) used by the LF-ASD. Therefore, the ENT does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. (a) (b) Figure 8: Magnitude and phase spectrum of the EEG signal before and after ENT. 4.3 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The two major benefits of the ENT to the low frequency EEG data result in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD. Subject 1’s ROC Curves with and without ENT is shown in Figure 9, where the ROC-Curve with ENT of optimal parameter value is above the ROC Curve without ENT. This indicates that the improved LF-ASD performs better. Table I compares the system performance with and without ENT in terms of TP with corresponding FP at 1% across all the 5 subjects. Figure 9: The ROC Curves (in the section of interest) of Subject 1 with different WN values and the corresponding ROC Curve without ENT. Table I: Performance of the LF-ASD with and without LF-ASD in terms of the True Positive rate with corresponding False Positive at 1%. Subject 1 Subject 2 Subject 3 Subject 4 Subject 5 TP without ENT 66.1% 82.7% 79.7% 79.3% 90.5% TP with ENT 85.0% 90.4% 88.0% 87.8% 88.7% Performance Improvement 18.9% 7.7% 8.3% 8.5% -1.8% For 4 out of 5 subjects, corresponding with the FP at 1%, the improved system with ENT increased the TP value by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively. Thus, for these subjects, the range of TP with FP at 1% was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4% with ENT. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance remained around 90% with ENT. In addition, this evaluation is conservative. Since the codebook in the Feature Classifier and the parameters in the Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD were derived from nonnormalized EEG, they work in favor of the non-normalized EEG. Therefore, if the parameters and the codebook of the modified LF-ASD are generated from the normalized EEG in the future, the modified LF-ASD may show better performance than this evaluation. 5 Conclusion The evaluation with data from five able-bodied subjects indicates that the proposed system with Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) has better performance than the original. This study has verified the original hypotheses that the improved design with ENT might have two major benefits: increased the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitized the system performance to input amplitude variance. As a side benefit, the ENT can also make the design less sensitive to the mean input scale. In the broad band, the Energy Normalization Transform is a non-linear transform. However, it has no visible distortion to the signal in the 0-4 Hz band. Therefore, it does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. For 4 out of 5 subjects, with the corresponding False Positive rate at 1%, the proposed transform increased the system performance by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively in terms of True Positive rate. Thus, the overall performance of the LF-ASD for these subjects was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4%. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. In the future with the codebook derived from the normalized data, the performance could be further improved. References [1] Mason, S. G. and Birch, G.

We provide a mathematical description of the operations performed on auditory input signals by the barn owl that facilitate the creation of a representation of auditory space.

We have proved that for the estimated overcomplete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coefﬁcient matrix) with minimum l1 −norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm.

Indeed, it seems very likely that stimulus-evoked activity would follow strongly correlated time-courses in different brain areas. Here, we present, and validate through simulations, a new approach to source reconstruction in which the correlation between sources is modelled and estimated explicitly by variational Bayesian methods, facilitating accurate recovery of source locations and the time-courses of their activation. 1</p><p>3 0.60794121 <a title="179-lsi-3" href="./nips-2003-Subject-Independent_Magnetoencephalographic_Source_Localization_by_a_Multilayer_Perceptron.html">182 nips-2003-Subject-Independent Magnetoencephalographic Source Localization by a Multilayer Perceptron</a></p>
<p>Author: Sung C. Jun, Barak A. Pearlmutter</p><p>Abstract: We describe a system that localizes a single dipole to reasonable accuracy from noisy magnetoencephalographic (MEG) measurements in real time. At its core is a multilayer perceptron (MLP) trained to map sensor signals and head position to dipole location. Including head position overcomes the previous need to retrain the MLP for each subject and session. The training dataset was generated by mapping randomly chosen dipoles and head positions through an analytic model and adding noise from real MEG recordings. After training, a localization took 0.7 ms with an average error of 0.90 cm. A few iterations of a Levenberg-Marquardt routine using the MLP’s output as its initial guess took 15 ms and improved the accuracy to 0.53 cm, only slightly above the statistical limits on accuracy imposed by the noise. We applied these methods to localize single dipole sources from MEG components isolated by blind source separation and compared the estimated locations to those generated by standard manually-assisted commercial software. 1</p><p>4 0.57729399 <a title="179-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Impact_of_an_Energy_Normalization_Transform_on_the_Performance_of_the_LF-ASD_Brain_Computer_Interface.html">89 nips-2003-Impact of an Energy Normalization Transform on the Performance of the LF-ASD Brain Computer Interface</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Zhou, Steven G. Mason, Gary E. Birch</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an energy normalization transform as a method to reduce system errors in the LF-ASD brain-computer interface. The energy normalization transform has two major benefits to the system performance. First, it can increase class separation between the active and idle EEG data. Second, it can desensitize the system to the signal amplitude variability. For four subjects in the study, the benefits resulted in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD in the range from 7.7% to 18.9%, while for the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. 1 In trod u ction In an effort to provide alternative communication channels for people who suffer from severe loss of motor function, several researchers have worked over the past two decades to develop a direct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has good time resolution and is non-invasive, it is commonly used for data source of a BCI. A BCI system converts the input EEG into control signals, which are then used to control devices like computers, environmental control system and neuro-prostheses. Mason and Birch [1] proposed the Low-Frequency Asynchronous Switch Design (LF-ASD) as a BCI which detected imagined voluntary movement-related potentials (IVMRPs) in spontaneous EEG. The principle signal processing components of the LF-ASD are shown in Figure 1. sIN Feature Extractor sLPF LPF Feature Classifier sFE sFC Figure 1: The original LF-ASD design. The input to the low-pass filter (LPF), denoted as SIN in Figure 1, are six bipolar EEG signals recorded from F1-FC1, Fz-FCz, F2-FC2, FC1-C1, FCz-Cz and FC2-C2 sampled at 128 Hz. The cutoff frequency of the LPF implemented by Mason and Birch was 4 Hz. The Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD extracts custom features related to IVMRPs. The Feature Classifier implements a one-nearest-neighbor (1NN) classifier, which determines if the input signals are related to a user state of voluntary movement or passive (idle) observation. The LF-ASD was able to achieve True Positive (TP) values in the range of 44%-81%, with the corresponding False Positive (FP) values around 1% [1]. Although encouraging, the current error rates of the LF-ASD are insufficient for real-world applications. This paper proposes a method to improve the system performance. 2 Design and Rationale The improved design of the LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is provided in Figure 2. SIN ENT SN SNLPF LPF Feature Extractor SNFE SNFC Feature Classifier Figure 2: The improved LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform. The design of the Feature Extractor and Feature Classifier were the same as shown in Figure 1. The Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is implemented as S N (n ) = S s=( w s= − ( N ∑ w IN S IN −1) / 2 N −1) / 2 (n ) 2 (n − s) w N where W N (normalization window size) is the only parameter in the equation. The optimal parameter value was obtained by exhaustive search for the best class separation between active and idle EEG data. The method of obtaining the active and idle EEG data is provided in Section 3.1. The idea to use energy normalization to improve the LF-ASD design was based primarily on an observation that high frequency power decreases significantly around movement. For example, Jasper and Penfield [3] and Pfurtscheller et al, [4] reported EEG power decrease in the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta rhythm (18-26 Hz) when people are involved in motor related activity. Also Mason [5] found that the power in the frequency components greater than 4Hz decreased significantly during movement-related potential periods, while power in the frequency components less than 4Hz did not. Thus energy normalization, which would increase the low frequency power level, would strengthen the 0-4 Hz features used in the LF-ASD and hence reduce errors. In addition, as a side benefit, it can automatically adjust the mean scale of the input signal and desensitize the system to change in EEG power, which is known to vary over time [2]. Therefore, it was postulated that the addition of ENT into the improved design would have two major benefits. First, it can increase the EEG power around motor potentials, consequently increasing the class separation and feature strength. Second, it can desensitize the system to amplitude variance of the input signal. In addition, since the system components of the modified LF-ASD after the ENT were the same as in the original design, a major concern was whether or not the ENT distorted the features used by the LF-ASD. Since the features used by the LFASD are generated from the 0-4 Hz band, if the ENT does not distort the phase and magnitude spectrum in this specific band, it would not distort the features related to movement potential detection in the application. 3 3.1 Evaluation Test data Two types of EEG data were pre-recorded from five able-bodied individuals as shown in Figure 3. Active Data Type and Idle Data Type. Active Data was recorded during repeated right index finger flexions alternating with periods of no motor activity; Idle Data was recorded during extended periods of passive observation. Figure 3: Data Definition of M1, M2, Idle1 and Idle2. Observation windows centered at the time of the finger switch activations (as shown in Figure 4) were imposed in the active data to separate data related to movements from data during periods of idleness. For purpose of this study, data in the front part of the observation window was defined as M1 and data in the rear part of the window was defined as M2. Data falling out of the observation window was defined as Idle2. All the data in the Idle Data Type was defined as Idle1 for comparison with Idle2. Figure 4: Ensemble Average of EEG centered on finger activations. Figure 5: Density distribution of Idle1, Idle2, M1 and M2. It was noted, in terms of the density distribution of active and idle data, the separation between M2 and Idle2 was the largest and Idle1 and Idle2 were nearly identical (see Figure 5). For the study, M2 and Idle2 were chosen to represent the active and idle data classes and the separation between M2 and Idle2 data was defined by the difference of means (DOM) scaled by the amplitude range of Idle2. 3.2 Optimal parameter determination The optimal combination of normalization window size, W N, and observation window size, W O was selected to be that which achieved the maximal DOM value. This was determined by exhaustive search, and discussed in Section 4.1. 3.3 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output As mentioned previously, it was postulated that the ENT had two major impacts: increasing the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitizing the system to the signal amplitude variance. The hypothesis was evaluated by comparing characteristics of SNLPF and SLPF in Figure 1 and Figure 2. DOM was applied to measure the increased class separation. The signal with the larger DOM meant larger class separation. In addition, the signal with smaller standard deviation may result in a more stable feature set. 3.4 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The performances of the original and improved designs were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics of SNFC in Figure 2 to SFC in Figure 1. A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) [6] was generated for the original and improved designs. The ROC Curve characterizes the system performance over a range of TP vs. FP values. The larger area under ROC Curve indicates better system performance. In real applications, a BCI with high-level FP rates could cause frustration for subjects. Therefore, in this work only the LF-ASD performance when the FP values are less than 1% were studied. 4 4.1 Results Optimal normalization window size (WN) The method to choose optimal WN was an exhaustive search for maximal DOM between active and idle classes. This method was possibly dependent on the observation window size (W O). However, as shown in Figure 6a, the optimal WN was found to be independent of WO. Experimentally, the W O values were selected in the range of 50-60 samples, which corresponded to largest DOM between nonnormalized active and idle data. The optimal WN was obtained by exhaustive search for the largest DOM through normalized active and idle data. The DOM vs. WN profile for Subject 1 is shown in Figure 6b. a) b) Figure 6: Optimal parameter determination for Subject 1 in Channel 1 a) DOM vs. WO; b) DOM vs. WN. When using ENT, a small W N value may cause distortion to the feature set used by the LF-ASD. Thus, the optimal W N was not selected in this range (< 40 samples). When W N is greater than 200, the ENT has lost its capability to increase class separation and the DOM curve gradually goes towards the best separation without normalization. Thus, the optimal W N should correspond to the maximal DOM value when W N is in the range from 40 to 200. In Figure 6b, the optimal WN is around 51. 4.2 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output With ENT, the standard deviation of the low frequency EEG signal decreased from around 1.90 to 1.30 over the six channels and over the five subjects. This change resulted in more stable feature sets. Thus, the ENT desensitizes the system to input signal variance. a) b) Figure 7: Density distribution of the active vs. idle class without (a) and with (b) ENT, for Subject 1 in Channel 1. As shown in Figure 7, by increasing the EEG power around motor potentials, ENT can increase class separations between active and idle EEG data. The class separation in (frontal) Channels 1-3 across all subjects increased consistently with the proposed ENT. The same was true for (midline) Channels 4-6, for all subjects except Subject 5, whose DOM in channel 5-6 decreased by 2.3% and 3.4% respectively with normalization. That is consistent with the fact that his EEG power in Channels 4-6 does not decrease. On average, across all five subjects, DOM increases with normalization to about 28.8%, 26.4%, 39.4%, 20.5%, 17.8% and 22.5% over six channels respectively. In addition, the magnitude and phase spectrums of the EEG signal before and after ENT is provided in Figure 8. The ENT has no visible distortion to the signal in the low frequency band (0-4 Hz) used by the LF-ASD. Therefore, the ENT does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. (a) (b) Figure 8: Magnitude and phase spectrum of the EEG signal before and after ENT. 4.3 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The two major benefits of the ENT to the low frequency EEG data result in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD. Subject 1’s ROC Curves with and without ENT is shown in Figure 9, where the ROC-Curve with ENT of optimal parameter value is above the ROC Curve without ENT. This indicates that the improved LF-ASD performs better. Table I compares the system performance with and without ENT in terms of TP with corresponding FP at 1% across all the 5 subjects. Figure 9: The ROC Curves (in the section of interest) of Subject 1 with different WN values and the corresponding ROC Curve without ENT. Table I: Performance of the LF-ASD with and without LF-ASD in terms of the True Positive rate with corresponding False Positive at 1%. Subject 1 Subject 2 Subject 3 Subject 4 Subject 5 TP without ENT 66.1% 82.7% 79.7% 79.3% 90.5% TP with ENT 85.0% 90.4% 88.0% 87.8% 88.7% Performance Improvement 18.9% 7.7% 8.3% 8.5% -1.8% For 4 out of 5 subjects, corresponding with the FP at 1%, the improved system with ENT increased the TP value by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively. Thus, for these subjects, the range of TP with FP at 1% was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4% with ENT. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance remained around 90% with ENT. In addition, this evaluation is conservative. Since the codebook in the Feature Classifier and the parameters in the Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD were derived from nonnormalized EEG, they work in favor of the non-normalized EEG. Therefore, if the parameters and the codebook of the modified LF-ASD are generated from the normalized EEG in the future, the modified LF-ASD may show better performance than this evaluation. 5 Conclusion The evaluation with data from five able-bodied subjects indicates that the proposed system with Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) has better performance than the original. This study has verified the original hypotheses that the improved design with ENT might have two major benefits: increased the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitized the system performance to input amplitude variance. As a side benefit, the ENT can also make the design less sensitive to the mean input scale. In the broad band, the Energy Normalization Transform is a non-linear transform. However, it has no visible distortion to the signal in the 0-4 Hz band. Therefore, it does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. For 4 out of 5 subjects, with the corresponding False Positive rate at 1%, the proposed transform increased the system performance by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively in terms of True Positive rate. Thus, the overall performance of the LF-ASD for these subjects was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4%. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. In the future with the codebook derived from the normalized data, the performance could be further improved. References [1] Mason, S. G. and Birch, G.

<p>Author: Yuanqing Li, Shun-ichi Amari, Sergei Shishkin, Jianting Cao, Fanji Gu, Andrzej S. Cichocki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, sparse representation (factorization) of a data matrix is ﬁrst discussed. An overcomplete basis matrix is estimated by using the K−means method. We have proved that for the estimated overcomplete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coefﬁcient matrix) with minimum l1 −norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm. The comparisons of the l1 −norm solution and the l0 −norm solution are also presented, which can be used in recoverability analysis of blind source separation (BSS). Next, we apply the sparse matrix factorization approach to BSS in the overcomplete case. Generally, if the sources are not sufﬁciently sparse, we perform blind separation in the time-frequency domain after preprocessing the observed data using the wavelet packets transformation. Third, an EEG experimental data analysis example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its performance. Two almost independent components obtained by the sparse representation method are selected for phase synchronization analysis, and their periods of signiﬁcant phase synchronization are found which are related to tasks. Finally, concluding remarks review the approach and state areas that require further study. 1</p><p>2 0.66505009 <a title="179-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Decoding_V1_Neuronal_Activity_using_Particle_Filtering_with_Volterra_Kernels.html">49 nips-2003-Decoding V1 Neuronal Activity using Particle Filtering with Volterra Kernels</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan C. Kelly, Tai Sing Lee</p><p>Abstract: Decoding is a strategy that allows us to assess the amount of information neurons can provide about certain aspects of the visual scene. In this study, we develop a method based on Bayesian sequential updating and the particle ﬁltering algorithm to decode the activity of V1 neurons in awake monkeys. A distinction in our method is the use of Volterra kernels to ﬁlter the particles, which live in a high dimensional space. This parametric Bayesian decoding scheme is compared to the optimal linear decoder and is shown to work consistently better than the linear optimal decoder. Interestingly, our results suggest that for decoding in real time, spike trains of as few as 10 independent but similar neurons would be sufﬁcient for decoding a critical scene variable in a particular class of visual stimuli. The reconstructed variable can predict the neural activity about as well as the actual signal with respect to the Volterra kernels. 1</p><p>3 0.65374792 <a title="179-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Online_Passive-Aggressive_Algorithms.html">148 nips-2003-Online Passive-Aggressive Algorithms</a></p>

<p>Author: Koby Crammer, Jaz Kandola, Yoram Singer</p><p>Abstract: Online algorithms for classiﬁcation often require vast amounts of memory and computation time when employed in conjunction with kernel functions. In this paper we describe and analyze a simple approach for an on-the-ﬂy reduction of the number of past examples used for prediction. Experiments performed with real datasets show that using the proposed algorithmic approach with a single epoch is competitive with the support vector machine (SVM) although the latter, being a batch algorithm, accesses each training example multiple times. 1 Introduction and Motivation Kernel-based methods are widely being used for data modeling and prediction because of their conceptual simplicity and outstanding performance on many real-world tasks. The support vector machine (SVM) is a well known algorithm for ﬁnding kernel-based linear classiﬁers with maximal margin [7]. The kernel trick can be used to provide an effective method to deal with very high dimensional feature spaces as well as to model complex input phenomena via embedding into inner product spaces. However, despite generalization error being upper bounded by a function of the margin of a linear classiﬁer, it is notoriously difﬁcult to implement such classiﬁers efﬁciently. Empirically this often translates into very long training times. A number of alternative algorithms exist for ﬁnding a maximal margin hyperplane many of which have been inspired by Rosenblatt’s Perceptron algorithm [6] which is an on-line learning algorithm for linear classiﬁers. The work on SVMs has inspired a number of modiﬁcations and enhancements to the original Perceptron algorithm. These incorporate the notion of margin to the learning and prediction processes whilst exhibiting good empirical performance in practice. Examples of such algorithms include the Relaxed Online Maximum Margin Algorithm (ROMMA) [4], the Approximate Maximal Margin Classiﬁcation Algorithm (ALMA) [2], and the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) [1] which can be used in conjunction with kernel functions. A notable limitation of kernel based methods is their computational complexity since the amount of computer memory that they require to store the so called support patterns grows linearly with the number prediction errors. A number of attempts have been made to speed up the training and testing of SVM’s by enforcing a sparsity condition. In this paper we devise an online algorithm that is not only sparse but also generalizes well. To achieve this goal our algorithm employs an insertion and deletion process. Informally, it can be thought of as revising the weight vector after each example on which a prediction mistake has been made. Once such an event occurs the algorithm adds the new erroneous example (the insertion phase), and then immediately searches for past examples that appear to be redundant given the recent addition (the deletion phase). As we describe later, making this adjustment to the algorithm allows us to modify the standard online proof techniques so as to provide a bound on the total number of examples the algorithm keeps. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. 2 we formalize the problem setting and provide a brief outline of our method for obtaining a sparse set of support patterns in an online setting. In Sec. 3 we present both theoretical and algorithmic details of our approach and provide a bound on the number of support patterns that constitute the cache. Sec. 4 provides experimental details, evaluated on three real world datasets, to illustrate the performance and merits of our sparse online algorithm. We end the paper with conclusions and ideas for future work. 2 Problem Setting and Algorithms This work focuses on online additive algorithms for classiﬁcation tasks. In such problems we are typically given a stream of instance-label pairs (x1 , y1 ), . . . , (xt , yt ), . . .. we assume that each instance is a vector xt ∈ Rn and each label belongs to a ﬁnite set Y. In this and the next section we assume that Y = {−1, +1} but relax this assumption in Sec. 4 where we describe experiments with datasets consisting of more than two labels. When dealing with the task of predicting new labels, thresholded linear classiﬁers of the form h(x) = sign(w · x) are commonly employed. The vector w is typically represented as a weighted linear combination of the examples, namely w = t αt yt xt where αt ≥ 0. The instances for which αt > 0 are referred to as support patterns. Under this assumption, the output of the classiﬁer solely depends on inner-products of the form x · xt the use of kernel functions can easily be employed simply by replacing the standard scalar product with a function K(·, ·) which satisﬁes Mercer conditions [7]. The resulting classiﬁcation rule takes the form h(x) = sign(w · x) = sign( t αt yt K(x, xt )). The majority of additive online algorithms for classiﬁcation, for example the well known Perceptron [6], share a common algorithmic structure. These online algorithms typically work in rounds. On the tth round, an online algorithm receives an instance xt , computes the inner-products st = i  0. The various online algorithms differ in the way the values of the parameters βt , αt and ct are set. A notable example of an online algorithm is the Perceptron algorithm [6] for which we set βt = 0, αt = 1 and ct = 1. More recent algorithms such as the Relaxed Online Maximum Margin Algorithm (ROMMA) [4] the Approximate Maximal Margin Classiﬁcation Algorithm (ALMA) [2] and the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) [1] can also be described in this framework although the constants βt , αt and ct are not as simple as the ones employed by the Perceptron algorithm. An important computational consideration needs to be made when employing kernel functions for machine learning tasks. This is because the amount of memory required to store the so called support patterns grows linearly with the number prediction errors. In Input: Tolerance β. Initialize: Set ∀t αt = 0 , w0 = 0 , C0 = ∅.

Figure 1: The aggressive Perceptron algorithm with a variable-size cache. this paper we shift the focus to the problem of devising online algorithms which are budget-conscious as they attempt to keep the number of support patterns small. The approach is attractive for at least two reasons. Firstly, both the training time and classiﬁcation time can be reduced signiﬁcantly if we store only a fraction of the potential support patterns. Secondly, a classier with a small number of support patterns is intuitively ”simpler”, and hence are likely to exhibit good generalization properties rather than complex classiﬁers with large numbers of support patterns. (See for instance [7] for formal results connecting the number of support patterns to the generalization error.) In Sec. 3 we present a formal analysis and Input: C, w, (α1 , . . . , αt ). the algorithmic details of our approach. Loop: Let us now provide a general overview • Choose i ∈ C such that of how to restrict the number of support β ≤ yi (w − αi yi xi ). patterns in an online setting.

However, Return : C, w, (α1 , . . . , αt ). as the online algorithm receives more examples, the performance of the classiﬁer Figure 2: DistillCache improves, and some of the past examples may have become redundant and hence can be removed. Put another way, old examples may have been inserted into the cache simply due the lack of support patterns in early rounds. As more examples are observed, the old examples maybe replaced with new examples whose location is closer to the decision boundary induced by the online classiﬁer. We thus add a new stage to the online algorithm in which we discard a few old examples from the cache Ct . We suggest a modiﬁcation of the online algorithm structure as follows. Whenever yt i  0. Then the number of support patterns constituting the cache is at most S ≤ (R2 + 2β)/γ 2 . Proof: The proof of the theorem is based on the mistake bound of the Perceptron algorithm [5]. To prove the theorem we bound wT 2 from above and below and compare the 2 t bounds. Denote by αi the weight of the ith example at the end of round t (after stage 4 of the algorithm). Similarly, we denote by αi to be the weight of the ith example on round ˜t t after stage 3, before calling the DistillCache (Fig. 2) procedure. We analogously ˜ denote by wt and wt the corresponding instantaneous classiﬁers. First, we derive a lower bound on wT 2 by bounding the term wT · u from below in a recursive manner. T αt yt (xt · u) wT · u = t∈CT T αt = γ S . ≥ γ (1) t∈CT We now turn to upper bound wT 2 . Recall that each example may be added to the cache and removed from the cache a single time. Let us write wT 2 as a telescopic sum, wT 2 = ( wT 2 ˜ − wT 2 ˜ ) + ( wT 2 − wT −1 2 ˜ ) + . . . + ( w1 2 − w0 2 ) . (2) We now consider three different scenarios that may occur for each new example. The ﬁrst case is when we did not insert the tth example into the cache at all. In this case, ˜ ( wt 2 − wt−1 2 ) = 0. The second scenario is when an example is inserted into the cache and is never discarded in future rounds, thus, ˜ wt 2 = wt−1 + yt xt 2 = wt−1 2 + 2yt (wt−1 · xt ) + xt 2 . Since we inserted (xt , yt ), the condition yt (wt−1 · xt ) ≤ β must hold. Combining this ˜ with the assumption that the examples are enclosed in a ball of radius R we get, ( wt 2 − wt−1 2 ) ≤ 2β + R2 . The last scenario occurs when an example is inserted into the cache on some round t, and is then later on removed from the cache on round t + p for p > 0. As in the previous case we can bound the value of summands in Equ. (2), ˜ ( wt 2 − wt−1 2 ) + ( wt+p 2 ˜ − wt+p 2 ) Input: Tolerance β, Cache Limit n. Initialize: Set ∀t αt = 0 , w0 = 0 , C0 = ∅. Loop: For t = 1, 2, . . . , T • Get a new instance xt ∈ Rn . • Predict yt = sign (yt (xt · wt−1 )). ˆ • Get a new label yt . • if yt (xt · wt−1 ) ≤ β update: 1. If |Ct | = n remove one example: (a) Find i = arg maxj∈Ct {yj (wt−1 − αj yj xj )}. (b) Update wt−1 ← wt−1 − αi yi xi . (c) Remove Ct−1 ← Ct−1 /{i} 2. Insert Ct ← Ct−1 ∪ {t}. 3. Set αt = 1. 4. Compute wt ← wt−1 + yt αt xt . Output : H(x) = sign(wT · x). Figure 3: The aggressive Perceptron algorithm with as ﬁxed-size cache. ˜ = 2yt (wt−1 · xt ) + xt 2 − 2yt (wt+p · xt ) + xt ˜ = 2 [yt (wt−1 · xt ) − yt ((wt+p − yt xt ) · xt )] ˜ ≤ 2 [β − yt ((wt+p − yt xt ) · xt )] . 2 ˜ Based on the form of the cache update we know that yt ((wt+p − yt xt ) · xt ) ≥ β, and thus, ˜ ˜ ( wt 2 − wt−1 2 ) + ( wt+p 2 − wt+p 2 ) ≤ 0 . Summarizing all three cases we see that only the examples which persist in the cache contribute a factor of R2 + 2β each to the bound of the telescopic sum of Equ. (2) and the rest of the examples do contribute anything to the bound. Hence, we can bound the norm of wT as follows, wT 2 ≤ S R2 + 2β . (3) We ﬁnish up the proof by applying the Cauchy-Swartz inequality and the assumption u = 1. Combining Equ. (1) and Equ. (3) we get, γ 2 S 2 ≤ (wT · u)2 ≤ wT 2 u 2 ≤ S(2β + R2 ) , which gives the desired bound. 4 Experiments In this section we describe the experimental methods that were used to compare the performance of standard online algorithms with the new algorithm described above. We also describe shortly another variant that sets a hard limit on the number of support patterns. The experiments were designed with the aim of trying to answer the following questions. First, what is effect of the number of support patterns on the generalization error (measured in terms of classiﬁcation accuracy on unseen data), and second, would the algorithm described in Fig. 2 be able to ﬁnd an optimal cache size that is able to achieve the best generalization performance. To examine each question separately we used a modiﬁed version of the algorithm described by Fig. 2 in which we restricted ourselves to have a ﬁxed bounded cache. This modiﬁed algorithm (which we refer to as the ﬁxed budget Perceptron) Name mnist letter usps No. of Training Examples 60000 16000 7291 No. of Test Examples 10000 4000 2007 No. of Classes 10 26 10 No. of Attributes 784 16 256 Table 1: Description of the datasets used in experiments. simulates the original Perceptron algorithm with one notable difference. When the number of support patterns exceeds a pre-determined limit, it chooses a support pattern from the cache and discards it. With this modiﬁcation the number of support patterns can never exceed the pre-determined limit. This modiﬁed algorithm is described in Fig. 3. The algorithm deletes the example which seemingly attains the highest margin after the removal of the example itself (line 1(a) in Fig. 3). Despite the simplicity of the original Perceptron algorithm [6] its good generalization performance on many datasets is remarkable. During the last few year a number of other additive online algorithms have been developed [4, 2, 1] that have shown better performance on a number of tasks. In this paper, we have preferred to embed these ideas into another online algorithm and start with a higher baseline performance. We have chosen to use the Margin Infused Relaxed Algorithm (MIRA) as our baseline algorithm since it has exhibited good generalization performance in previous experiments [1] and has the additional advantage that it is designed to solve multiclass classiﬁcation problem directly without any recourse to performing reductions. The algorithms were evaluated on three natural datasets: mnist1 , usps2 and letter3 . The characteristics of these datasets has been summarized in Table 1. A comprehensive overview of the performance of various algorithms on these datasets can be found in a recent paper [2]. Since all of the algorithms that we have evaluated are online, it is not implausible for the speciﬁc ordering of examples to affect the generalization performance. We thus report results averaged over 11 random permutations for usps and letter and over 5 random permutations for mnist. No free parameter optimization was carried out and instead we simply used the values reported in [1]. More speciﬁcally, the margin parameter was set to β = 0.01 for all algorithms and for all datasets. A homogeneous polynomial kernel of degree 9 was used when training on the mnist and usps data sets, and a RBF kernel for letter data set. (The variance of the RBF kernel was identical to the one used in [1].) We evaluated the performance of four algorithms in total. The ﬁrst algorithm was the standard MIRA online algorithm, which does not incorporate any budget constraints. The second algorithm is the version of MIRA described in Fig. 3 which uses a ﬁxed limited budget. Here we enumerated the cache size limit in each experiment we performed. The different sizes that we tested are dataset dependent but for each dataset we evaluated at least 10 different sizes. We would like to note that such an enumeration cannot be done in an online fashion and the goal of employing the the algorithm with a ﬁxed-size cache is to underscore the merit of the truly adaptive algorithm. The third algorithm is the version of MIRA described in Fig. 2 that adapts the cache size during the running of the algorithms. We also report additional results for a multiclass version of the SVM [1]. Whilst this algorithm is not online and during the training process it considers all the examples at once, this algorithm serves as our gold-standard algorithm against which we want to compare 1 Available from http://www.research.att.com/˜yann Available from ftp.kyb.tuebingen.mpg.de 3 Available from http://www.ics.uci.edu/˜mlearn/MLRepository.html 2 usps mnist Fixed Adaptive SVM MIRA 1.8 4.8 4.7 letter Fixed Adaptive SVM MIRA 5.5 1.7 4.6 5 1.5 1.4 Test Error 4.5 Test Error Test Error 1.6 Fixed Adaptive SVM MIRA 6 4.4 4.3 4.5 4 3.5 4.2 4.1 3 4 2.5 1.3 1.2 3.9 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 # Support Patterns 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 500 4 2 1000 1500 x 10 mnist 2000 2500 # Support Patterns 3000 3500 1000 2000 3000 usps Fixed Adaptive MIRA 1550 7000 8000 9000 letter Fixed Adaptive MIRA 270 4000 5000 6000 # Support Patterns Fixed Adaptive MIRA 1500 265 1500 1400 260 Training Online Errors Training Online Errors Training Online Errors 1450 1450 255 250 245 1400 1350 1300 1350 240 1250 235 1300 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 # Support Patterns 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 500 4 1000 1500 x 10 mnist 4 x 10 2000 2500 # Support Patterns 3000 3500 1000 usps 6500 Fixed Adaptive MIRA 5.5 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 # Support Patterns 7000 Fixed Adaptive MIRA 1.5 6000 9000 letter 4 x 10 1.6 Fixed Adaptive MIRA 8000 4 3.5 3 1.4 5500 Training Margin Errors Training Margin Errors Training Margin Errors 5 4.5 5000 4500 1.3 1.2 1.1 4000 1 2.5 3500 0.9 2 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1 1.2 1.4 # Support Patterns 1.6 1.8 2 2.2 4 x 10 500 1000 1500 2000 2500 # Support Patterns 3000 3500 1000 2000 3000 4000 5000 6000 # Support Patterns 7000 8000 9000 Figure 4: Results on a three data sets - mnist (left), usps (center) and letter (right). Each point in a plot designates the test error (y-axis) vs. the number of support patterns used (x-axis). Four algorithms are compared - SVM, MIRA, MIRA with a ﬁxed cache size and MIRA with a variable cache size. performance. Note that for the multiclass SVM we report the results using the best set of parameters, which does not coincide with the set of parameters used for the online training. The results are summarized in Fig 4. This ﬁgure is composed of three different plots organized in columns. Each of these plots corresponds to a different dataset - mnist (left), usps (center) and letter (right). In each of the three plots the x-axis designates number of support patterns the algorithm uses. The results for the ﬁxed-size cache are connected with a line to emphasize the performance dependency on the size of the cache. The top row of the three columns shows the generalization error. Thus the y-axis designates the test error of an algorithm on unseen data at the end of the training. Looking at the error of the algorithm with a ﬁxed-size cache reveals that there is a broad range of cache size where the algorithm exhibits good performance. In fact for MNIST and USPS there are sizes for which the test error of the algorithm is better than SVM’s test error. Naturally, we cannot ﬁx the correct size in hindsight so the question is whether the algorithm with variable cache size is a viable automatic size-selection method. Analyzing each of the datasets in turn reveals that this is indeed the case – the algorithm obtains a very similar number of support patterns and test error when compared to the SVM method. The results are somewhat less impressive for the letter dataset which contains less examples per class. One possible explanation is that the algorithm had fewer chances to modify and distill the cache. Nonetheless, overall the results are remarkable given that all the online algorithms make a single pass through the data and the variable-size method ﬁnds a very good cache size while making it also comparable to the SVM in terms of performance. The MIRA algorithm, which does not incorporate any form of example insertion or deletion in its algorithmic structure, obtains the poorest level of performance not only in terms of generalization error but also in terms of number of support patterns. The plot of online training error against the number of support patterns, in row 2 of Fig 4, can be considered to be a good on-the-ﬂy validation of generalization performance. As the plots indicate, for the ﬁxed and adaptive versions of the algorithm, on all the datasets, a low online training error translates into good generalization performance. Comparing the test error plots with the online error plots we see a nice similarity between the qualitative behavior of the two errors. Hence, one can use the online error, which is easy to evaluate, to choose a good cache size for the ﬁxed-size algorithm. The third row gives the online training margin errors that translates directly to the number of insertions into the cache. Here we see that the good test error and compactness of the algorithm with a variable cache size come with a price. Namely, the algorithm makes signiﬁcantly more insertions into the cache than the ﬁxed size version of the algorithm. However, as the upper two sets of plots indicate, the surplus in insertions is later taken care of by excess deletions and the end result is very good overall performance. In summary, the online algorithm with a variable cache and SVM obtains similar levels of generalization and also number of support patterns. While the SVM is still somewhat better in both aspects for the letter dataset, the online algorithm is much simpler to implement and performs a single sweep through the training data. 5 Summary We have described and analyzed a new sparse online algorithm that attempts to deal with the computational problems implicit in classiﬁcation algorithms such as the SVM. The proposed method was empirically tested and its performance in both the size of the resulting classiﬁer and its error rate are comparable to SVM. There are a few possible extensions and enhancements. We are currently looking at alternative criteria for the deletions of examples from the cache. For instance, the weight of examples might relay information on their importance for accurate classiﬁcation. Incorporating prior knowledge to the insertion and deletion scheme might also prove important. We hope that such enhancements would make the proposed approach a viable alternative to SVM and other batch algorithms.

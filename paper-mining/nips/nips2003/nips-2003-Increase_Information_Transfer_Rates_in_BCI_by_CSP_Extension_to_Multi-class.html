</p><p>4 1  Introduction  The goal of a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) is to establish a communication channel for translating human intentions – reﬂected by suitable brain signals – into a control signal for, e. [sent-18, score-0.247]
</p><p>5 In a BCI system a subject tries to convey her/his intentions by behaving according to welldeﬁned paradigms, like imagination of speciﬁc movements. [sent-25, score-0.132]
</p><p>6 An effective discrimination of different brain states is important in order to implement a suitable system for human subjects. [sent-26, score-0.181]
</p><p>7 For non-invasive BCI systems that are based on discrimination of voluntarily induced brain states three approaches are characteristic. [sent-30, score-0.124]
</p><p>8 (1) The Tübingen Thought Translation Device (TTD) [7] enables subjects to learn self-regulation of slow cortical potentials (SCP), i. [sent-31, score-0.136]
</p><p>9 After some training in experiments with vertical cursor movement as feedback navigated by the SCP from central scalp position, patients are able to generate binary decisions in a 4-6 second pace with an accuracy of up to 85 %. [sent-34, score-0.198]
</p><p>10 , in [11] a suitable modiﬁcation to movementrelated potentials was presented. [sent-48, score-0.057]
</p><p>11 Further in [12] a ﬁrst multi-class extension of CSP is presented which is based on pairwise classiﬁcation and voting. [sent-49, score-0.097]
</p><p>12 In this paper we present further ways to extend this approach to many classes and compare to prior work. [sent-50, score-0.157]
</p><p>13 By extending a BCI system to many classes a gain in performance can be obtained since the ITR can increase even if the percentage of correct classiﬁcations decreases. [sent-51, score-0.157]
</p><p>14 In [13] a ﬁrst study for increasing the number of classes is demonstrated based on a hidden markov model approach. [sent-52, score-0.157]
</p><p>15 The authors conclude to use three classes which attains the highest ITR. [sent-53, score-0.19]
</p><p>16 However, in a theoretical part we show that using more classes can be worth the effort if a suitable accuracy of all pairwise classiﬁcations is available. [sent-55, score-0.284]
</p><p>17 Consequently, extensions to multi-class settings are worthwhile for a BCI system, if and only if a suitable number of effectivly separable human brain states can be assigned. [sent-56, score-0.215]
</p><p>18 Out of many different brain states (classes) our task is to ﬁnd a subset of classes which is most proﬁtable for the user of a BCI system. [sent-58, score-0.281]
</p><p>19 Using more classes holds the potential to increase ITR, although the rate of correct classiﬁcations decreases. [sent-60, score-0.157]
</p><p>20 For the subsequent theoretical considerations we assume gaussian distributions with equal covariance matrices for all classes which is a reasonable assumption for a wide range of EEG features, see section 4. [sent-61, score-0.157]
</p><p>21 For three classes and equal pairwise classiﬁcations errors err, bounds for the expected classiﬁcation error can be calculated in the following way: Let (X,Y ) ∈ IRn × Y (Y = {1, 2, 3}) be random variables and P ∼ N (µ1,2,3 , Σ) the probability distribution. [sent-64, score-0.254]
</p><p>22 We deﬁne the optimal classiﬁer by f ∗ : IRn → Y with f ∗ = argmin f ∈F P( f (X) = Y ), where F is some class of ∗ functions1 . [sent-66, score-0.042]
</p><p>23 Similarly fi, j describes the optimal classiﬁer between classes i and j. [sent-67, score-0.157]
</p><p>24 Directly ∗ we get err := P( f i, j (X) = Y ) = G(||µi − µ j ||/2) with G(x) := √1 π x∞ exp(−x2 /2)dx and 2 1 For  the moment we pay no attention to whether such a function exists. [sent-68, score-0.058]

</p><p>27 The ﬁgure on the right shows the ITR [bits per decision] depending on the classiﬁcation error [%] for simulated data for different number of classes (3-6 sim) and for 2 classes the real values (2 calc). [sent-74, score-0.314]
</p><p>28 Additionally the expected range (see (1)) (3 range) for three classes is visualized. [sent-75, score-0.157]
</p><p>29 Due symmetry, the equilateral triangle and polar coordinates transformation we get ﬁnally exp(−Φ2 /6) exp(−Φ2 /8) ≤ P( f ∗ (X) = Y ) ≤ err + . [sent-82, score-0.092]
</p><p>30 Figure 1 (right) shows the bounds in (1) for the ITR as a function of the expected pairwise misclassiﬁcation errors. [sent-85, score-0.097]
</p><p>31 Additionally the same values on simulated data (100000 data points for each class) under the assumptions described above (equal pairwise performance, Gaussian distributed . [sent-86, score-0.097]
</p><p>32 However, the gain of using more than 4 classes is tiny if the pairwise classiﬁcation error is about 10 % or more. [sent-95, score-0.254]
</p><p>33 , more classes have increasing pairwise classiﬁcation error compared to a wisely chosen subset it is improbable to increase the bit rate by increasing the number of classes higher than three or four. [sent-98, score-0.45]
</p><p>34 If a suitable number of different brain states that can be discriminitated well, then indeed extensions to more classes are useful. [sent-100, score-0.345]
</p><p>35 err +  3  CSP and some multi-class extension  The CSP algorithm in its original form can be utilized for brain states that are characterized by a decrease or increase of a cortical rhythm with a characteristic topographic pattern. [sent-101, score-0.211]
</p><p>36 1  CSP in a binary problem  Let Σ1,2 be the centered covariance matrices calculated in the standard way of a trialconcatenated vector of dimension [channels × concatenated timepoints] belonging to the respective label. [sent-103, score-0.043]
</p><p>37 , for slow cortical features such as the lateralized readiness potential (cf. [sent-106, score-0.091]
</p><p>38 Only a few projections with the highest ratio between their eigenvalues (lowest and highest ratios) are selected. [sent-109, score-0.105]
</p><p>39 Intuitively the CSP projections provide the scalp patterns which are most discriminative (see e. [sent-110, score-0.144]
</p><p>40 2  Multi-Class extensions  Using CSP within the classiﬁer (IN): This algorithm reduces a multi-class to several binary problems (cf. [sent-114, score-0.077]
</p><p>41 For all combinations of two different classes the CSP patterns are calculated as described in Eq. [sent-116, score-0.243]
</p><p>42 New trials are projected on these CSP patterns and are assigned to the class for which most classiﬁers are voting. [sent-119, score-0.195]
</p><p>43 We compute spatial patterns for each class against all others2 . [sent-121, score-0.17]
</p><p>44 Then we project the EEG signals on all these CSP patterns, calculate the variances as before and then perform an LDA multi-class classiﬁcation. [sent-122, score-0.065]
</p><p>45 The approach OVR appears rather similar to the approach IN, but there is in fact a large practical difference (additionally to the one-versus-rest strategy as opposed to pairwise binary subproblems). [sent-123, score-0.14]
</p><p>46 In the approach IN classiﬁcation is only done binary on the CSP patterns according to the binary choice. [sent-124, score-0.172]
</p><p>47 Simultaneous diagonalization (SIM): The main trick in the binary case is that the CSP algorithm ﬁnds a simultaneous diagonalization of both covariance matrices whose eigenvalues sum to one. [sent-126, score-0.287]
</p><p>48 There are several algorithms for approximate simultaneous diagonalization (cf. [sent-140, score-0.123]
</p><p>49 Finally, the best strategy was based on the assumption that two different eigenvalues for the same pattern have the same effect if their ratios to the mean of the eigenvalues of the other classes are multiplicatively inverse to each other, i. [sent-144, score-0.235]
</p><p>50 Thus all eigenvalues λ are mapped to max(λ , (1 − λ )/(1 − λ + (N − 1) 2 λ )) and a speciﬁed number m of highest eigenvalues for each class are used as CSP patterns. [sent-147, score-0.153]
</p><p>51 It should be mentioned that each pattern is only used once, namely for the class which has the highest modiﬁed eigenvalue. [sent-148, score-0.075]
</p><p>52 If a second class would choose this pattern it is left out for this class and the next one is chosen. [sent-149, score-0.084]
</p><p>53 Finally variances are computed on the projected trials as before and conventional LDA multi-class classiﬁcation is done. [sent-150, score-0.099]
</p><p>54 1  Data acquisition and analysis methods Experiments  We recorded brain activity from 4 subjects (codes aa, af, ak and ar) with multi-channel EEG ampliﬁers using 64 (128 for aa) channels band-pass ﬁltered between 0. [sent-152, score-0.219]
</p><p>55 Surface EMG at both forearms and one leg, as well as horizontal and vertical EOG signals, were recorded to check for muscle activation and eye movements, but no trial was rejected. [sent-155, score-0.058]
</p><p>56 2 Note that this can be done similarly with pairwise patterns, but in our studies no substantical difference was observable and therefore one-versus-rest is favourable, since it chooses less patterns. [sent-156, score-0.097]
</p><p>57 The subjects in this experiment were sitting in a comfortable chair with arms lying relaxed on the armrests. [sent-157, score-0.08]
</p><p>58 During this period the subject should imagine one of 6 different actions according to the displayed letter: imagination of left or right hand or f oot movement, or imagination of a visual, auditory or tactile sensation. [sent-160, score-0.146]
</p><p>59 Subject aa took only part in an experiment with the 3 classes l, r and f. [sent-161, score-0.25]
</p><p>60 The aim of classiﬁcation in these experiments is to discriminate trials of different classes using the whole period of imagination. [sent-164, score-0.196]
</p><p>61 Note that the classes v, a and t were originally not intended to be BCI paradigms. [sent-166, score-0.157]
</p><p>62 Rather, these experiments were included to explore multi-class single-trial detection for brain states related to different sensory modalities for which it can reasonably be assumed that the regional activations can be well differentiated at a macroscopic scale of several centimeters. [sent-167, score-0.124]
</p><p>63 Further, each trial consists of a two second window starting 500 ms after the visual stimulus. [sent-170, score-0.058]
</p><p>64 Then, the CSP algorithm is applied and ﬁnally variances of the projected trials were calculated to acquire the feature vectors. [sent-171, score-0.099]
</p><p>65 Alternatively, to see how effective the CSP algorithm is, the projection is left out for the binary classiﬁcation task and we use instead techniques like Laplace ﬁltering or common average reference (CAR) with a regularized LDA classiﬁer on the variances. [sent-172, score-0.043]
</p><p>66 The number of chosen CSP patterns is a further variable. [sent-175, score-0.086]
</p><p>67 To have similar number of patterns for each algorithm we choose for IN 2 patterns from each side in each pairwise classiﬁcation (resulting in 2N(N −1) patterns), for OVR 2 patterns from each side in each one-versus rest choice and for SIM 4 patterns for each class (both resulting in 4N patterns). [sent-177, score-0.483]
</p><p>68 For the purpose of this paper the best conﬁguration of classes should be found. [sent-187, score-0.157]
</p><p>69 A more useful way is to do in a preliminary step experiments with many classes and choose within an ofﬂine analysis which is the best subset by testing all combinations. [sent-190, score-0.157]
</p><p>70 4 In Figure 2 the bit rates for all binary combinations of two classes and for all subjects are shown. [sent-196, score-0.349]
</p><p>71 FurFigure 2: In the scatter plot thermore it is observable that the pairwise classiﬁcation the ITRs [bits per decision] performances differ strongly. [sent-205, score-0.13]
</p><p>72 According to our theoretfor all 2-class combinations for ical considerations we should therefore assume that in all subjects obtained by CSP the multi-class case a conﬁguration with 3 classes will are shown on the x-axis while perform best. [sent-206, score-0.237]
</p><p>73 SIM shows the best mean performance for subjects ak and ar but the performance falls off for subject af. [sent-219, score-0.241]
</p><p>74 Since for aa only one three class combination is available, we omit a visualization. [sent-220, score-0.135]
</p><p>75 , classiﬁcation of {l,r,f } and {l,a,t} are dependent since the trials of class l are involved in both. [sent-224, score-0.081]
</p><p>76 For a given number of classes Figure 4 shows the ITR obtained for the optimal subset of brain states by the best of the presented algorithms. [sent-225, score-0.281]
</p><p>77 As conjectured from ﬂuctuations in pairwise discriminability, the bit rates decrease when using more than three classes. [sent-226, score-0.166]
</p><p>78 In three out of four subjects the peak ITR is obtained with three classes, only for subject aa pairwise classiﬁcation is better. [sent-227, score-0.3]
</p><p>79 Additionally to the variance, autoregressive parameters can be calculated on the projections on the CSP patterns ﬁltered here at 7–30 Hz and used for classiﬁcation. [sent-229, score-0.086]
</p><p>80 In this case the pairwise classiﬁcation errors are more balanced such that we acquire ﬁnally an ITR of 0. [sent-230, score-0.097]
</p><p>81 6  ar  Figure 4: The ﬁgure on the left shows the ITR per trial for different number of classes with the best algorithm described above. [sent-274, score-0.293]
</p><p>82 The ﬁgure on the right visualizes the ﬁrst pattern chosen by SIM for each class for aa. [sent-275, score-0.076]
</p><p>83 per decision, whereas the best binary combination has 0. [sent-276, score-0.043]
</p><p>84 For the other subjects similar gains could not be observed by using AR parameters. [sent-279, score-0.08]
</p><p>85 Finally the CSP algorithm contains some further feature, namely that the spatial patterns can be plotted as scalp topographies. [sent-280, score-0.186]
</p><p>86 In Figure 4 the ﬁrst pattern for each class of algorithm SIM is shown for subject aa. [sent-281, score-0.072]
</p><p>87 Evidently, this algorithm can reproduce neurophysiological prior knowledge about the location of ERD effects because for each activated limb the appropriate region of motor cortex is activated, e. [sent-282, score-0.064]
</p><p>88 In principle, multi-class decisions can be derived from a decision space natural to human subjects. [sent-286, score-0.057]
</p><p>89 , without a need for prolonged training, if the differential brain states are naturally related to a set of intended actions. [sent-289, score-0.124]

[sent-292, score-0.265]
</p><p>91 In contrast, having to imagine a tune in order to move a cursor upwards vs imaging a visual scene to induce a downward movement will produce spatially discriminable patterns of EEG signals related to either auditory or visual imagery, but its action-effect-contingency would be counter-intuitive. [sent-293, score-0.25]
</p><p>92 Another important aspect of multi-class settings is that the use of more classes which is discriminated by the BCI device only at lower accuracy is likely to confuse the user. [sent-295, score-0.192]
</p><p>93 , new ﬁltering, feature extraction and sophisticated classiﬁers are constantly tuned and improved3 , (4) faster trial speeds and ﬁnally (5) more classes among which the BCI user is choosing. [sent-299, score-0.215]
</p><p>94 Comparing the results of SIM, OVR and IN we ﬁnd that for most of the subjects SIM or OVR provide better results. [sent-309, score-0.08]
</p><p>95 Assuringly the algorithms SIM, OVR and IN allow to extract scalp pattern for the classiﬁcation that match well with neurophysiological textbook knowledge (cf. [sent-310, score-0.091]

<p>Author: Yu Zhou, Steven G. Mason, Gary E. Birch</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an energy normalization transform as a method to reduce system errors in the LF-ASD brain-computer interface. The energy normalization transform has two major benefits to the system performance. First, it can increase class separation between the active and idle EEG data. Second, it can desensitize the system to the signal amplitude variability. For four subjects in the study, the benefits resulted in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD in the range from 7.7% to 18.9%, while for the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. 1 In trod u ction In an effort to provide alternative communication channels for people who suffer from severe loss of motor function, several researchers have worked over the past two decades to develop a direct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has good time resolution and is non-invasive, it is commonly used for data source of a BCI. A BCI system converts the input EEG into control signals, which are then used to control devices like computers, environmental control system and neuro-prostheses. Mason and Birch [1] proposed the Low-Frequency Asynchronous Switch Design (LF-ASD) as a BCI which detected imagined voluntary movement-related potentials (IVMRPs) in spontaneous EEG. The principle signal processing components of the LF-ASD are shown in Figure 1. sIN Feature Extractor sLPF LPF Feature Classifier sFE sFC Figure 1: The original LF-ASD design. The input to the low-pass filter (LPF), denoted as SIN in Figure 1, are six bipolar EEG signals recorded from F1-FC1, Fz-FCz, F2-FC2, FC1-C1, FCz-Cz and FC2-C2 sampled at 128 Hz. The cutoff frequency of the LPF implemented by Mason and Birch was 4 Hz. The Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD extracts custom features related to IVMRPs. The Feature Classifier implements a one-nearest-neighbor (1NN) classifier, which determines if the input signals are related to a user state of voluntary movement or passive (idle) observation. The LF-ASD was able to achieve True Positive (TP) values in the range of 44%-81%, with the corresponding False Positive (FP) values around 1% [1]. Although encouraging, the current error rates of the LF-ASD are insufficient for real-world applications. This paper proposes a method to improve the system performance. 2 Design and Rationale The improved design of the LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is provided in Figure 2. SIN ENT SN SNLPF LPF Feature Extractor SNFE SNFC Feature Classifier Figure 2: The improved LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform. The design of the Feature Extractor and Feature Classifier were the same as shown in Figure 1. The Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is implemented as S N (n ) = S s=( w s= − ( N ∑ w IN S IN −1) / 2 N −1) / 2 (n ) 2 (n − s) w N where W N (normalization window size) is the only parameter in the equation. The optimal parameter value was obtained by exhaustive search for the best class separation between active and idle EEG data. The method of obtaining the active and idle EEG data is provided in Section 3.1. The idea to use energy normalization to improve the LF-ASD design was based primarily on an observation that high frequency power decreases significantly around movement. For example, Jasper and Penfield [3] and Pfurtscheller et al, [4] reported EEG power decrease in the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta rhythm (18-26 Hz) when people are involved in motor related activity. Also Mason [5] found that the power in the frequency components greater than 4Hz decreased significantly during movement-related potential periods, while power in the frequency components less than 4Hz did not. Thus energy normalization, which would increase the low frequency power level, would strengthen the 0-4 Hz features used in the LF-ASD and hence reduce errors. In addition, as a side benefit, it can automatically adjust the mean scale of the input signal and desensitize the system to change in EEG power, which is known to vary over time [2]. Therefore, it was postulated that the addition of ENT into the improved design would have two major benefits. First, it can increase the EEG power around motor potentials, consequently increasing the class separation and feature strength. Second, it can desensitize the system to amplitude variance of the input signal. In addition, since the system components of the modified LF-ASD after the ENT were the same as in the original design, a major concern was whether or not the ENT distorted the features used by the LF-ASD. Since the features used by the LFASD are generated from the 0-4 Hz band, if the ENT does not distort the phase and magnitude spectrum in this specific band, it would not distort the features related to movement potential detection in the application. 3 3.1 Evaluation Test data Two types of EEG data were pre-recorded from five able-bodied individuals as shown in Figure 3. Active Data Type and Idle Data Type. Active Data was recorded during repeated right index finger flexions alternating with periods of no motor activity; Idle Data was recorded during extended periods of passive observation. Figure 3: Data Definition of M1, M2, Idle1 and Idle2. Observation windows centered at the time of the finger switch activations (as shown in Figure 4) were imposed in the active data to separate data related to movements from data during periods of idleness. For purpose of this study, data in the front part of the observation window was defined as M1 and data in the rear part of the window was defined as M2. Data falling out of the observation window was defined as Idle2. All the data in the Idle Data Type was defined as Idle1 for comparison with Idle2. Figure 4: Ensemble Average of EEG centered on finger activations. Figure 5: Density distribution of Idle1, Idle2, M1 and M2. It was noted, in terms of the density distribution of active and idle data, the separation between M2 and Idle2 was the largest and Idle1 and Idle2 were nearly identical (see Figure 5). For the study, M2 and Idle2 were chosen to represent the active and idle data classes and the separation between M2 and Idle2 data was defined by the difference of means (DOM) scaled by the amplitude range of Idle2. 3.2 Optimal parameter determination The optimal combination of normalization window size, W N, and observation window size, W O was selected to be that which achieved the maximal DOM value. This was determined by exhaustive search, and discussed in Section 4.1. 3.3 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output As mentioned previously, it was postulated that the ENT had two major impacts: increasing the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitizing the system to the signal amplitude variance. The hypothesis was evaluated by comparing characteristics of SNLPF and SLPF in Figure 1 and Figure 2. DOM was applied to measure the increased class separation. The signal with the larger DOM meant larger class separation. In addition, the signal with smaller standard deviation may result in a more stable feature set. 3.4 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The performances of the original and improved designs were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics of SNFC in Figure 2 to SFC in Figure 1. A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) [6] was generated for the original and improved designs. The ROC Curve characterizes the system performance over a range of TP vs. FP values. The larger area under ROC Curve indicates better system performance. In real applications, a BCI with high-level FP rates could cause frustration for subjects. Therefore, in this work only the LF-ASD performance when the FP values are less than 1% were studied. 4 4.1 Results Optimal normalization window size (WN) The method to choose optimal WN was an exhaustive search for maximal DOM between active and idle classes. This method was possibly dependent on the observation window size (W O). However, as shown in Figure 6a, the optimal WN was found to be independent of WO. Experimentally, the W O values were selected in the range of 50-60 samples, which corresponded to largest DOM between nonnormalized active and idle data. The optimal WN was obtained by exhaustive search for the largest DOM through normalized active and idle data. The DOM vs. WN profile for Subject 1 is shown in Figure 6b. a) b) Figure 6: Optimal parameter determination for Subject 1 in Channel 1 a) DOM vs. WO; b) DOM vs. WN. When using ENT, a small W N value may cause distortion to the feature set used by the LF-ASD. Thus, the optimal W N was not selected in this range (< 40 samples). When W N is greater than 200, the ENT has lost its capability to increase class separation and the DOM curve gradually goes towards the best separation without normalization. Thus, the optimal W N should correspond to the maximal DOM value when W N is in the range from 40 to 200. In Figure 6b, the optimal WN is around 51. 4.2 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output With ENT, the standard deviation of the low frequency EEG signal decreased from around 1.90 to 1.30 over the six channels and over the five subjects. This change resulted in more stable feature sets. Thus, the ENT desensitizes the system to input signal variance. a) b) Figure 7: Density distribution of the active vs. idle class without (a) and with (b) ENT, for Subject 1 in Channel 1. As shown in Figure 7, by increasing the EEG power around motor potentials, ENT can increase class separations between active and idle EEG data. The class separation in (frontal) Channels 1-3 across all subjects increased consistently with the proposed ENT. The same was true for (midline) Channels 4-6, for all subjects except Subject 5, whose DOM in channel 5-6 decreased by 2.3% and 3.4% respectively with normalization. That is consistent with the fact that his EEG power in Channels 4-6 does not decrease. On average, across all five subjects, DOM increases with normalization to about 28.8%, 26.4%, 39.4%, 20.5%, 17.8% and 22.5% over six channels respectively. In addition, the magnitude and phase spectrums of the EEG signal before and after ENT is provided in Figure 8. The ENT has no visible distortion to the signal in the low frequency band (0-4 Hz) used by the LF-ASD. Therefore, the ENT does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. (a) (b) Figure 8: Magnitude and phase spectrum of the EEG signal before and after ENT. 4.3 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The two major benefits of the ENT to the low frequency EEG data result in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD. Subject 1’s ROC Curves with and without ENT is shown in Figure 9, where the ROC-Curve with ENT of optimal parameter value is above the ROC Curve without ENT. This indicates that the improved LF-ASD performs better. Table I compares the system performance with and without ENT in terms of TP with corresponding FP at 1% across all the 5 subjects. Figure 9: The ROC Curves (in the section of interest) of Subject 1 with different WN values and the corresponding ROC Curve without ENT. Table I: Performance of the LF-ASD with and without LF-ASD in terms of the True Positive rate with corresponding False Positive at 1%. Subject 1 Subject 2 Subject 3 Subject 4 Subject 5 TP without ENT 66.1% 82.7% 79.7% 79.3% 90.5% TP with ENT 85.0% 90.4% 88.0% 87.8% 88.7% Performance Improvement 18.9% 7.7% 8.3% 8.5% -1.8% For 4 out of 5 subjects, corresponding with the FP at 1%, the improved system with ENT increased the TP value by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively. Thus, for these subjects, the range of TP with FP at 1% was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4% with ENT. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance remained around 90% with ENT. In addition, this evaluation is conservative. Since the codebook in the Feature Classifier and the parameters in the Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD were derived from nonnormalized EEG, they work in favor of the non-normalized EEG. Therefore, if the parameters and the codebook of the modified LF-ASD are generated from the normalized EEG in the future, the modified LF-ASD may show better performance than this evaluation. 5 Conclusion The evaluation with data from five able-bodied subjects indicates that the proposed system with Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) has better performance than the original. This study has verified the original hypotheses that the improved design with ENT might have two major benefits: increased the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitized the system performance to input amplitude variance. As a side benefit, the ENT can also make the design less sensitive to the mean input scale. In the broad band, the Energy Normalization Transform is a non-linear transform. However, it has no visible distortion to the signal in the 0-4 Hz band. Therefore, it does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. For 4 out of 5 subjects, with the corresponding False Positive rate at 1%, the proposed transform increased the system performance by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively in terms of True Positive rate. Thus, the overall performance of the LF-ASD for these subjects was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4%. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. In the future with the codebook derived from the normalized data, the performance could be further improved. References [1] Mason, S. G. and Birch, G.

<p>Author: Felix A. Wichmann, Arnulf B. Graf</p><p>Abstract: We attempt to understand visual classiﬁcation in humans using both psychophysical and machine learning techniques. Frontal views of human faces were used for a gender classiﬁcation task. Human subjects classiﬁed the faces and their gender judgment, reaction time and conﬁdence rating were recorded. Several hyperplane learning algorithms were used on the same classiﬁcation task using the Principal Components of the texture and shape representation of the faces. The classiﬁcation performance of the learning algorithms was estimated using the face database with the true gender of the faces as labels, and also with the gender estimated by the subjects. We then correlated the human responses to the distance of the stimuli to the separating hyperplane of the learning algorithms. Our results suggest that human classiﬁcation can be modeled by some hyperplane algorithms in the feature space we used. For classiﬁcation, the brain needs more processing for stimuli close to that hyperplane than for those further away. 1</p><p>4 0.089530557 <a title="90-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Training_fMRI_Classifiers_to_Detect_Cognitive_States_across_Multiple_Human_Subjects.html">188 nips-2003-Training fMRI Classifiers to Detect Cognitive States across Multiple Human Subjects</a></p>
<p>Author: Xuerui Wang, Rebecca Hutchinson, Tom M. Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning to classify cognitive states of human subjects, based on their brain activity observed via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This problem is important because such classiﬁers constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden cognitive states, which may be useful in cognitive science research and clinical applications. In recent work, Mitchell, et al. [6,7,9] have demonstrated the feasibility of training such classiﬁers for individual human subjects (e.g., to distinguish whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or unambiguous sentence, or whether they are reading a noun or a verb). Here we extend that line of research, exploring how to train classiﬁers that can be applied across multiple human subjects, including subjects who were not involved in training the classiﬁer. We describe the design of several machine learning approaches to training multiple-subject classiﬁers, and report experimental results demonstrating the success of these methods in learning cross-subject classiﬁers for two different fMRI data sets. 1</p><p>5 0.079520725 <a title="90-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Sparse_Representation_and_Its_Applications_in_Blind_Source_Separation.html">179 nips-2003-Sparse Representation and Its Applications in Blind Source Separation</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuanqing Li, Shun-ichi Amari, Sergei Shishkin, Jianting Cao, Fanji Gu, Andrzej S. Cichocki</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, sparse representation (factorization) of a data matrix is ﬁrst discussed. An overcomplete basis matrix is estimated by using the K−means method. We have proved that for the estimated overcomplete basis matrix, the sparse solution (coefﬁcient matrix) with minimum l1 −norm is unique with probability of one, which can be obtained using a linear programming algorithm. The comparisons of the l1 −norm solution and the l0 −norm solution are also presented, which can be used in recoverability analysis of blind source separation (BSS). Next, we apply the sparse matrix factorization approach to BSS in the overcomplete case. Generally, if the sources are not sufﬁciently sparse, we perform blind separation in the time-frequency domain after preprocessing the observed data using the wavelet packets transformation. Third, an EEG experimental data analysis example is presented to illustrate the usefulness of the proposed approach and demonstrate its performance. Two almost independent components obtained by the sparse representation method are selected for phase synchronization analysis, and their periods of signiﬁcant phase synchronization are found which are related to tasks. Finally, concluding remarks review the approach and state areas that require further study. 1</p><p>6 0.072005376 <a title="90-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Probabilistic_Inference_in_Human_Sensorimotor_Processing.html">161 nips-2003-Probabilistic Inference in Human Sensorimotor Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Guido Dornhege, Benjamin Blankertz, Gabriel Curio, Klaus-Robert Müller</p><p>Abstract: Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCI) are an interesting emerging technology that is driven by the motivation to develop an effective communication interface translating human intentions into a control signal for devices like computers or neuroprostheses. If this can be done bypassing the usual human output pathways like peripheral nerves and muscles it can ultimately become a valuable tool for paralyzed patients. Most activity in BCI research is devoted to ﬁnding suitable features and algorithms to increase information transfer rates (ITRs). The present paper studies the implications of using more classes, e.g., left vs. right hand vs. foot, for operating a BCI. We contribute by (1) a theoretical study showing under some mild assumptions that it is practically not useful to employ more than three or four classes, (2) two extensions of the common spatial pattern (CSP) algorithm, one interestingly based on simultaneous diagonalization, and (3) controlled EEG experiments that underline our theoretical ﬁndings and show excellent improved ITRs. 1</p><p>2 0.79266995 <a title="90-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Impact_of_an_Energy_Normalization_Transform_on_the_Performance_of_the_LF-ASD_Brain_Computer_Interface.html">89 nips-2003-Impact of an Energy Normalization Transform on the Performance of the LF-ASD Brain Computer Interface</a></p>
<p>Author: Yu Zhou, Steven G. Mason, Gary E. Birch</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an energy normalization transform as a method to reduce system errors in the LF-ASD brain-computer interface. The energy normalization transform has two major benefits to the system performance. First, it can increase class separation between the active and idle EEG data. Second, it can desensitize the system to the signal amplitude variability. For four subjects in the study, the benefits resulted in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD in the range from 7.7% to 18.9%, while for the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. 1 In trod u ction In an effort to provide alternative communication channels for people who suffer from severe loss of motor function, several researchers have worked over the past two decades to develop a direct Brain-Computer Interface (BCI). Since electroencephalographic (EEG) signal has good time resolution and is non-invasive, it is commonly used for data source of a BCI. A BCI system converts the input EEG into control signals, which are then used to control devices like computers, environmental control system and neuro-prostheses. Mason and Birch [1] proposed the Low-Frequency Asynchronous Switch Design (LF-ASD) as a BCI which detected imagined voluntary movement-related potentials (IVMRPs) in spontaneous EEG. The principle signal processing components of the LF-ASD are shown in Figure 1. sIN Feature Extractor sLPF LPF Feature Classifier sFE sFC Figure 1: The original LF-ASD design. The input to the low-pass filter (LPF), denoted as SIN in Figure 1, are six bipolar EEG signals recorded from F1-FC1, Fz-FCz, F2-FC2, FC1-C1, FCz-Cz and FC2-C2 sampled at 128 Hz. The cutoff frequency of the LPF implemented by Mason and Birch was 4 Hz. The Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD extracts custom features related to IVMRPs. The Feature Classifier implements a one-nearest-neighbor (1NN) classifier, which determines if the input signals are related to a user state of voluntary movement or passive (idle) observation. The LF-ASD was able to achieve True Positive (TP) values in the range of 44%-81%, with the corresponding False Positive (FP) values around 1% [1]. Although encouraging, the current error rates of the LF-ASD are insufficient for real-world applications. This paper proposes a method to improve the system performance. 2 Design and Rationale The improved design of the LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is provided in Figure 2. SIN ENT SN SNLPF LPF Feature Extractor SNFE SNFC Feature Classifier Figure 2: The improved LF-ASD with the Energy Normalization Transform. The design of the Feature Extractor and Feature Classifier were the same as shown in Figure 1. The Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) is implemented as S N (n ) = S s=( w s= − ( N ∑ w IN S IN −1) / 2 N −1) / 2 (n ) 2 (n − s) w N where W N (normalization window size) is the only parameter in the equation. The optimal parameter value was obtained by exhaustive search for the best class separation between active and idle EEG data. The method of obtaining the active and idle EEG data is provided in Section 3.1. The idea to use energy normalization to improve the LF-ASD design was based primarily on an observation that high frequency power decreases significantly around movement. For example, Jasper and Penfield [3] and Pfurtscheller et al, [4] reported EEG power decrease in the mu (8-12 Hz) and beta rhythm (18-26 Hz) when people are involved in motor related activity. Also Mason [5] found that the power in the frequency components greater than 4Hz decreased significantly during movement-related potential periods, while power in the frequency components less than 4Hz did not. Thus energy normalization, which would increase the low frequency power level, would strengthen the 0-4 Hz features used in the LF-ASD and hence reduce errors. In addition, as a side benefit, it can automatically adjust the mean scale of the input signal and desensitize the system to change in EEG power, which is known to vary over time [2]. Therefore, it was postulated that the addition of ENT into the improved design would have two major benefits. First, it can increase the EEG power around motor potentials, consequently increasing the class separation and feature strength. Second, it can desensitize the system to amplitude variance of the input signal. In addition, since the system components of the modified LF-ASD after the ENT were the same as in the original design, a major concern was whether or not the ENT distorted the features used by the LF-ASD. Since the features used by the LFASD are generated from the 0-4 Hz band, if the ENT does not distort the phase and magnitude spectrum in this specific band, it would not distort the features related to movement potential detection in the application. 3 3.1 Evaluation Test data Two types of EEG data were pre-recorded from five able-bodied individuals as shown in Figure 3. Active Data Type and Idle Data Type. Active Data was recorded during repeated right index finger flexions alternating with periods of no motor activity; Idle Data was recorded during extended periods of passive observation. Figure 3: Data Definition of M1, M2, Idle1 and Idle2. Observation windows centered at the time of the finger switch activations (as shown in Figure 4) were imposed in the active data to separate data related to movements from data during periods of idleness. For purpose of this study, data in the front part of the observation window was defined as M1 and data in the rear part of the window was defined as M2. Data falling out of the observation window was defined as Idle2. All the data in the Idle Data Type was defined as Idle1 for comparison with Idle2. Figure 4: Ensemble Average of EEG centered on finger activations. Figure 5: Density distribution of Idle1, Idle2, M1 and M2. It was noted, in terms of the density distribution of active and idle data, the separation between M2 and Idle2 was the largest and Idle1 and Idle2 were nearly identical (see Figure 5). For the study, M2 and Idle2 were chosen to represent the active and idle data classes and the separation between M2 and Idle2 data was defined by the difference of means (DOM) scaled by the amplitude range of Idle2. 3.2 Optimal parameter determination The optimal combination of normalization window size, W N, and observation window size, W O was selected to be that which achieved the maximal DOM value. This was determined by exhaustive search, and discussed in Section 4.1. 3.3 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output As mentioned previously, it was postulated that the ENT had two major impacts: increasing the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitizing the system to the signal amplitude variance. The hypothesis was evaluated by comparing characteristics of SNLPF and SLPF in Figure 1 and Figure 2. DOM was applied to measure the increased class separation. The signal with the larger DOM meant larger class separation. In addition, the signal with smaller standard deviation may result in a more stable feature set. 3.4 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The performances of the original and improved designs were evaluated by comparing the signal characteristics of SNFC in Figure 2 to SFC in Figure 1. A Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC Curve) [6] was generated for the original and improved designs. The ROC Curve characterizes the system performance over a range of TP vs. FP values. The larger area under ROC Curve indicates better system performance. In real applications, a BCI with high-level FP rates could cause frustration for subjects. Therefore, in this work only the LF-ASD performance when the FP values are less than 1% were studied. 4 4.1 Results Optimal normalization window size (WN) The method to choose optimal WN was an exhaustive search for maximal DOM between active and idle classes. This method was possibly dependent on the observation window size (W O). However, as shown in Figure 6a, the optimal WN was found to be independent of WO. Experimentally, the W O values were selected in the range of 50-60 samples, which corresponded to largest DOM between nonnormalized active and idle data. The optimal WN was obtained by exhaustive search for the largest DOM through normalized active and idle data. The DOM vs. WN profile for Subject 1 is shown in Figure 6b. a) b) Figure 6: Optimal parameter determination for Subject 1 in Channel 1 a) DOM vs. WO; b) DOM vs. WN. When using ENT, a small W N value may cause distortion to the feature set used by the LF-ASD. Thus, the optimal W N was not selected in this range (< 40 samples). When W N is greater than 200, the ENT has lost its capability to increase class separation and the DOM curve gradually goes towards the best separation without normalization. Thus, the optimal W N should correspond to the maximal DOM value when W N is in the range from 40 to 200. In Figure 6b, the optimal WN is around 51. 4.2 Effect of ENT on the Low Pass Filter output With ENT, the standard deviation of the low frequency EEG signal decreased from around 1.90 to 1.30 over the six channels and over the five subjects. This change resulted in more stable feature sets. Thus, the ENT desensitizes the system to input signal variance. a) b) Figure 7: Density distribution of the active vs. idle class without (a) and with (b) ENT, for Subject 1 in Channel 1. As shown in Figure 7, by increasing the EEG power around motor potentials, ENT can increase class separations between active and idle EEG data. The class separation in (frontal) Channels 1-3 across all subjects increased consistently with the proposed ENT. The same was true for (midline) Channels 4-6, for all subjects except Subject 5, whose DOM in channel 5-6 decreased by 2.3% and 3.4% respectively with normalization. That is consistent with the fact that his EEG power in Channels 4-6 does not decrease. On average, across all five subjects, DOM increases with normalization to about 28.8%, 26.4%, 39.4%, 20.5%, 17.8% and 22.5% over six channels respectively. In addition, the magnitude and phase spectrums of the EEG signal before and after ENT is provided in Figure 8. The ENT has no visible distortion to the signal in the low frequency band (0-4 Hz) used by the LF-ASD. Therefore, the ENT does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. (a) (b) Figure 8: Magnitude and phase spectrum of the EEG signal before and after ENT. 4.3 Effect of ENT on the LF-ASD output The two major benefits of the ENT to the low frequency EEG data result in the performance improvement of the LF-ASD. Subject 1’s ROC Curves with and without ENT is shown in Figure 9, where the ROC-Curve with ENT of optimal parameter value is above the ROC Curve without ENT. This indicates that the improved LF-ASD performs better. Table I compares the system performance with and without ENT in terms of TP with corresponding FP at 1% across all the 5 subjects. Figure 9: The ROC Curves (in the section of interest) of Subject 1 with different WN values and the corresponding ROC Curve without ENT. Table I: Performance of the LF-ASD with and without LF-ASD in terms of the True Positive rate with corresponding False Positive at 1%. Subject 1 Subject 2 Subject 3 Subject 4 Subject 5 TP without ENT 66.1% 82.7% 79.7% 79.3% 90.5% TP with ENT 85.0% 90.4% 88.0% 87.8% 88.7% Performance Improvement 18.9% 7.7% 8.3% 8.5% -1.8% For 4 out of 5 subjects, corresponding with the FP at 1%, the improved system with ENT increased the TP value by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively. Thus, for these subjects, the range of TP with FP at 1% was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4% with ENT. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance remained around 90% with ENT. In addition, this evaluation is conservative. Since the codebook in the Feature Classifier and the parameters in the Feature Extractor of the LF-ASD were derived from nonnormalized EEG, they work in favor of the non-normalized EEG. Therefore, if the parameters and the codebook of the modified LF-ASD are generated from the normalized EEG in the future, the modified LF-ASD may show better performance than this evaluation. 5 Conclusion The evaluation with data from five able-bodied subjects indicates that the proposed system with Energy Normalization Transform (ENT) has better performance than the original. This study has verified the original hypotheses that the improved design with ENT might have two major benefits: increased the class separation between active and idle EEG and desensitized the system performance to input amplitude variance. As a side benefit, the ENT can also make the design less sensitive to the mean input scale. In the broad band, the Energy Normalization Transform is a non-linear transform. However, it has no visible distortion to the signal in the 0-4 Hz band. Therefore, it does not distort the features used by the LF-ASD. For 4 out of 5 subjects, with the corresponding False Positive rate at 1%, the proposed transform increased the system performance by 7.7%, 8.3%, 8.5% and 18.9% respectively in terms of True Positive rate. Thus, the overall performance of the LF-ASD for these subjects was improved from 66.1%-82.7% to 85.0%-90.4%. For the fifth subject, who had the highest non-normalized accuracy of 90.5%, the performance did not change notably with normalization. In the future with the codebook derived from the normalized data, the performance could be further improved. References [1] Mason, S. G. and Birch, G.

<p>Author: Xuerui Wang, Rebecca Hutchinson, Tom M. Mitchell</p><p>Abstract: We consider learning to classify cognitive states of human subjects, based on their brain activity observed via functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). This problem is important because such classiﬁers constitute “virtual sensors” of hidden cognitive states, which may be useful in cognitive science research and clinical applications. In recent work, Mitchell, et al. [6,7,9] have demonstrated the feasibility of training such classiﬁers for individual human subjects (e.g., to distinguish whether the subject is reading an ambiguous or unambiguous sentence, or whether they are reading a noun or a verb). Here we extend that line of research, exploring how to train classiﬁers that can be applied across multiple human subjects, including subjects who were not involved in training the classiﬁer. We describe the design of several machine learning approaches to training multiple-subject classiﬁers, and report experimental results demonstrating the success of these methods in learning cross-subject classiﬁers for two different fMRI data sets. 1</p><p>4 0.53082895 <a title="90-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Insights_from_Machine_Learning_Applied_to_Human_Visual_Classification.html">95 nips-2003-Insights from Machine Learning Applied to Human Visual Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Felix A. Wichmann, Arnulf B. Graf</p><p>Abstract: We attempt to understand visual classiﬁcation in humans using both psychophysical and machine learning techniques. Frontal views of human faces were used for a gender classiﬁcation task. Human subjects classiﬁed the faces and their gender judgment, reaction time and conﬁdence rating were recorded. Several hyperplane learning algorithms were used on the same classiﬁcation task using the Principal Components of the texture and shape representation of the faces. The classiﬁcation performance of the learning algorithms was estimated using the face database with the true gender of the faces as labels, and also with the gender estimated by the subjects. We then correlated the human responses to the distance of the stimuli to the separating hyperplane of the learning algorithms. Our results suggest that human classiﬁcation can be modeled by some hyperplane algorithms in the feature space we used. For classiﬁcation, the brain needs more processing for stimuli close to that hyperplane than for those further away. 1</p><p>5 0.47888166 <a title="90-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Statistical_Debugging_of_Sampled_Programs.html">181 nips-2003-Statistical Debugging of Sampled Programs</a></p>

<p>Author: Maneesh Sahani, Srikantan S. Nagarajan</p><p>Abstract: Existing source location and recovery algorithms used in magnetoencephalographic imaging generally assume that the source activity at different brain locations is independent or that the correlation structure is known. However, electrophysiological recordings of local ﬁeld potentials show strong correlations in aggregate activity over signiﬁcant distances. Indeed, it seems very likely that stimulus-evoked activity would follow strongly correlated time-courses in different brain areas. Here, we present, and validate through simulations, a new approach to source reconstruction in which the correlation between sources is modelled and estimated explicitly by variational Bayesian methods, facilitating accurate recovery of source locations and the time-courses of their activation. 1</p><p>2 0.99531066 <a title="90-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Learning_the_k_in_k-means.html">111 nips-2003-Learning the k in k-means</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical signiﬁcance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity. 1 Introduction and related work Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density estimation, and many other important tasks. However, most clustering algorithms require the user to specify the number of clusters (called k), and it is not always clear what is the best value for k. Figure 1 shows examples where k has been improperly chosen. Choosing k is often an ad hoc decision based on prior knowledge, assumptions, and practical experience. Choosing k is made more difﬁcult when the data has many dimensions, even when clusters are well-separated. Center-based clustering algorithms (in particular k-means and Gaussian expectationmaximization) usually assume that each cluster adheres to a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian. With these methods, only one center should be used to model each subset of data that follows a unimodal distribution. If multiple centers are used to describe data drawn from one mode, the centers are a needlessly complex description of the data, and in fact the multiple centers capture the truth about the subset less well than one center. In this paper we present a simple algorithm called G-means that discovers an appropriate k using a statistical test for deciding whether to split a k-means center into two centers. We describe examples and present experimental results that show that the new algorithm 0.9 4 0.8 3 0.7 2 0.6 1 0.5 0 0.4 −1 0.3 −2 −3 0.2 0.1 −0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: Two clusterings where k was improperly chosen.

In general, one center should be used to represent one Gaussian cluster. is successful. This technique is useful and applicable for many clustering algorithms other than k-means, but here we consider only the k-means algorithm for simplicity. Several algorithms have been proposed previously to determine k automatically. Like our method, most previous methods are wrappers around k-means or some other clustering algorithm for ﬁxed k. Wrapper methods use splitting and/or merging rules for centers to increase or decrease k as the algorithm proceeds. Pelleg and Moore [14] proposed a regularization framework for learning k, which they call X-means. The algorithm searches over many values of k and scores each clustering model using the so-called Bayesian Information Criterion [10]: BIC(C|X) = L(X|C) − p log n 2 where L(X|C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C, p = k(d + 1) is the number of parameters in the model C with dimensionality d and k cluster centers, and n is the number of points in the dataset. X-means chooses the model with the best BIC score on the data. Aside from the BIC, other scoring functions are also available. Bischof et al. [1] use a minimum description length (MDL) framework, where the description length is a measure of how well the data are ﬁt by the model. Their algorithm starts with a large value for k and removes centers (reduces k) whenever that choice reduces the description length. Between steps of reducing k, they use the k-means algorithm to optimize the model ﬁt to the data. With hierarchical clustering algorithms, other methods may be employed to determine the best number of clusters. One is to build a merging tree (“dendrogram”) of the data based on a cluster distance metric, and search for areas of the tree that are stable with respect to inter- and intra-cluster distances [9, Section 5.1]. This method of estimating k is best applied with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and human intuition. 2 The Gaussian-means (G-means) algorithm The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to reﬁne the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each center. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center. However, if the same data do not appear Algorithm 1 G-means(X, α) 1: Let C be the initial set of centers (usually C ← {¯}). x 2: C ← kmeans(C, X). 3: Let {xi |class(xi ) = j} be the set of datapoints assigned to center cj . 4: Use a statistical test to detect if each {xi |class(xi ) = j} follow a Gaussian distribution (at conﬁdence level α). 5: If the data look Gaussian, keep cj . Otherwise replace cj with two centers. 6: Repeat from step 2 until no more centers are added. to be Gaussian, then we want to use multiple centers to model the data properly. The algorithm will run k-means multiple times (up to k times when ﬁnding k centers), so the time complexity is at most O(k) times that of k-means. The k-means algorithm implicitly assumes that the datapoints in each cluster are spherically distributed around the center. Less restrictively, the Gaussian expectation-maximization algorithm assumes that the datapoints in each cluster have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that may or may not be ﬁxed, or shared. The Gaussian distribution test that we present below are valid for either covariance matrix assumption. The test also accounts for the number of datapoints n tested by incorporating n in the calculation of the critical value of the test (see Equation 2). This prevents the G-means algorithm from making bad decisions about clusters with few datapoints. 2.1 Testing clusters for Gaussian ﬁt To specify the G-means algorithm fully we need a test to detect whether the data assigned to a center are sampled from a Gaussian. The alternative hypotheses are • H0 : The data around the center are sampled from a Gaussian. • H1 : The data around the center are not sampled from a Gaussian. If we accept the null hypothesis H0 , then we believe that the one center is sufﬁcient to model its data, and we should not split the cluster into two sub-clusters. If we reject H0 and accept H1 , then we want to split the cluster. The test we use is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic. This one-dimensional test has been shown empirically to be the most powerful normality test that is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). Given a list of values xi that have been converted to mean 0 and variance 1, let x(i) be the ith ordered value. Let zi = F (x(i) ), where F is the N (0, 1) cumulative distribution function. Then the statistic is A2 (Z) = − 1 n n (2i − 1) [log(zi ) + log(1 − zn+1−i )] − n (1) i=1 Stephens [17] showed that for the case where µ and σ are estimated from the data (as in clustering), we must correct the statistic according to A2 (Z) ∗ = A2 (Z)(1 + 4/n − 25/(n2 )) (2) Given a subset of data X in d dimensions that belongs to center c, the hypothesis test proceeds as follows: 1. Choose a signiﬁcance level α for the test. 2. Initialize two centers, called “children” of c. See the text for good ways to do this. 3. Run k-means on these two centers in X. This can be run to completion, or to some early stopping point if desired. Let c1 , c2 be the child centers chosen by k-means. 4. Let v = c1 − c2 be a d-dimensional vector that connects the two centers. This is the direction that k-means believes to be important for clustering. Then project X onto v: xi = xi , v /||v||2 . X is a 1-dimensional representation of the data projected onto v. Transform X so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. 5. Let zi = F (x(i) ). If A2 (Z) is in the range of non-critical values at conﬁdence ∗ level α, then accept H0 , keep the original center, and discard {c1 , c2 }. Otherwise, reject H0 and keep {c1 , c2 } in place of the original center. A primary contribution of this work is simplifying the test for Gaussian ﬁt by projecting the data to one dimension where the test is simple to apply. The authors of [5] also use this approach for online dimensionality reduction during clustering. The one-dimensional representation of the data allows us to consider only the data along the direction that kmeans has found to be important for separating the data. This is related to the problem of projection pursuit [7], where here k-means searches for a direction in which the data appears non-Gaussian. We must choose the signiﬁcance level of the test, α, which is the desired probability of making a Type I error (i.e. incorrectly rejecting H0 ). It is appropriate to use a Bonferroni adjustment to reduce the chance of making Type I errors over multiple tests. For example, if we want a 0.01 chance of making a Type I error in 100 tests, we should apply a Bonferroni adjustment to make each test use α = 0.01/100 = 0.0001. To ﬁnd k ﬁnal centers the G-means algorithm makes k statistical tests, so the Bonferroni correction does not need to be extreme. In our tests, we always use α = 0.0001. We consider two ways to initialize the two child centers. Both approaches initialize with c ± m, where c is a center and m is chosen. The ﬁrst method chooses m as a random d-dimensional vector such that ||m|| is small compared to the distortion of the data. A second method ﬁnds the main principal component s of the data (having eigenvalue λ), and chooses m = s 2λ/π. This deterministic method places the two centers in their expected locations under H0 . The principal component calculations require O(nd2 + d3 ) time and O(d2 ) space, but since we only want the main principal component, we can use fast methods like the power method, which takes time that is at most linear in the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues [4]. In this paper we use principal-component-based splitting. 2.2 An example Figure 2 shows a run of the G-means algorithm on a synthetic dataset with two true clusters and 1000 points, using α = 0.0001. The critical value for the Anderson-Darling test is 1.8692 for this conﬁdence level. Starting with one center, after one iteration of G-means, we have 2 centers and the A2 statistic is 38.103. This is much larger than the critical value, ∗ so we reject H0 and accept this split. On the next iteration, we split each new center and repeat the statistical test. The A2 values for the two splits are 0.386 and 0.496, both of ∗ which are well below the critical value. Therefore we accept H0 for both tests, and discard these splits. Thus G-means gives a ﬁnal answer of k = 2. 2.3 Statistical power Figure 3 shows the power of the Anderson-Darling test, as compared to the BIC. Lower is better for both plots. We run 1000 tests for each data point plotted for both plots.

Starting with one center (left plot), G-means splits into two centers (middle). The test for normality is signiﬁcant, so G-means rejects H0 and keeps the split. After splitting each center again (right), the test values are not signiﬁcant, so G-means accepts H0 for both tests and does not accept these splits. The middle plot is the G-means answer. See the text for further details. 1 1 G-means X-means 0.8 P(Type II error) P(Type I error) 0.8 G-means X-means 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 Figure 3: A comparison of the power of the Anderson-Darling test versus the BIC. For the AD test we ﬁx the signiﬁcance level (α = 0.0001), while the BIC’s signiﬁcance level depends on n. The left plot shows the probability of incorrectly splitting (Type I error) one true 2-d cluster that is 5% elliptical. The right plot shows the probability of incorrectly not splitting two true clusters separated by 5σ (Type II error). Both plots are functions of n. Both plots show that the BIC overﬁts (splits clusters) when n is small. plot, for each test we generate n datapoints from a single true Gaussian distribution, and then plot the frequency with which BIC and G-means will choose k = 2 rather than k = 1 (i.e. commit a Type I error). BIC tends to overﬁt by choosing too many centers when the data is not strictly spherical, while G-means does not. This is consistent with the tests of real-world data in the next section. While G-means commits more Type II errors when n is small, this prevents it from overﬁtting the data. The BIC can be considered a likelihood ratio test, but with a signiﬁcance level that cannot be ﬁxed. The signiﬁcance level instead varies depending on n and ∆k (the change in the number of model parameters between two models). As n or ∆k decrease, the signiﬁcance level increases (the BIC becomes weaker as a statistical test) [10]. Figure 3 shows this effect for varying n. In [11] the authors show that penalty-based methods require problemspeciﬁc tuning and don’t generalize as well as other methods, such as cross validation. 3 Experiments Table 1 shows the results from running G-means and X-means on many large synthetic. On synthetic datasets with spherically distributed clusters, G-means and X-means do equally Table 1: Results for many synthetic datasets. We report distortion relative to the optimum distortion for the correct clustering (closer to one is better), and time is reported relative to k-means run with the correct k. For BIC, larger values are better, but it is clear that ﬁnding the correct clustering does not always coincide with ﬁnding a larger BIC. Items with a star are where X-means always chose the largest number of centers we allowed. dataset synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 d 2 k found 9.1± 9.9 18.1± 3.2 20.1± 0.6 70.5±11.6 80.0± 0.2 171.7±23.7 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.1 *80.0± 0.0 80.2± 0.5 229.2±36.8 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.0 *80.0± 0.0 80.0± 0.0 171.5±10.9 method G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means 2 2 8 8 8 32 32 32 BIC(×104 ) -0.19±2.70 0.70±0.93 0.21±0.18 14.83±3.50 1.84±0.12 40.16±6.59 -0.74±0.16 -2.28±0.20 -0.18±0.17 14.36±0.21 1.45±0.20 52.28±9.26 -3.36±0.21 -27.92±0.22 -2.73±0.22 -11.13±0.23 -1.10±0.16 11.78±2.74 distortion(× optimal) 0.89± 0.23 0.37± 0.12 0.99± 0.01 9.45±28.02 1.00± 0.01 48.49±70.04 1.00± 0.00 0.47± 0.03 0.99± 0.00 0.47± 0.01 0.99± 0.00 0.57± 0.06 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.00 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.01 1.00± 0.00 0.84± 0.01 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 time(× k-means) 13.2 2.8 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.8 4.6 11.0 2.6 4.0 2.9 6.5 4.4 29.9 2.3 21.2 2.8 53.3 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Figure 4: 2-d synthetic dataset with 5 true clusters. On the left, G-means correctly chooses 5 centers and deals well with non-spherical data. On the right, the BIC causes X-means to overﬁt the data, choosing 20 unevenly distributed clusters. well at ﬁnding the correct k and maximizing the BIC statistic, so we don’t show these results here. Most real-world data is not spherical, however. The synthetic datasets used here each have 5000 datapoints in d = 2/8/32 dimensions. The true ks are 5, 20, and 80. For each synthetic dataset type, we generate 30 datasets with the true center means chosen uniformly randomly from the unit hypercube, and choosing σ so that no two clusters are closer than 3σ apart. Each cluster is also given a transformation to make it non-spherical, by multiplying the data by a randomly chosen scaling and rotation matrix. We run G-means starting with one center. We allow X-means to search between 2 and 4k centers (where here k is the true number of clusters). The G-means algorithm clearly does better at ﬁnding the correct k on non-spherical data. Its results are closer to the true distortions and the correct ks. The BIC statistic that X-means uses has been formulated to maximize the likelihood for spherically-distributed data. Thus it overestimates the number of true clusters in non-spherical data. This is especially evident when the number of points per cluster is small, as in datasets with 80 true clusters. 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Digit 0 1 Digit 0 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Cluster 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cluster Figure 5: NIST and Pendigits datasets: correspondence between each digit (row) and each cluster (column) found by G-means. G-means did not have the labels, yet it found meaningful clusters corresponding with the labels. Because of this overestimation, X-means often hits our limit of 4k centers. Figure 4 shows an example of overﬁtting on a dataset with 5 true clusters. X-means chooses k = 20 while G-means ﬁnds all 5 true cluster centers. Also of note is that X-means does not distribute centers evenly among clusters; some clusters receive one center, but others receive many. G-means runs faster than X-means for 8 and 32 dimensions, which we expect, since the kd-tree structures which make X-means fast in low dimensions take time exponential in d, making them slow for more than 8 to 12 dimensions. All our code is written in Matlab; X-means is written in C. 3.1 Discovering true clusters in labeled data We tested these algorithms on two real-world datasets for handwritten digit recognition: the NIST dataset [12] and the Pendigits dataset [2]. The goal is to cluster the data without knowledge of the labels and measure how well the clustering captures the true labels. Both datasets have 10 true classes (digits 0-9). NIST has 60000 training examples and 784 dimensions (28×28 pixels). We use 6000 randomly chosen examples and we reduce the dimension to 50 by random projection (following [3]). The Pendigits dataset has 7984 examples and 16 dimensions; we did not change the data in any way. We cluster each dataset with G-means and X-means, and measure performance by comparing the cluster labels Lc with the true labels Lt . We deﬁne the partition quality (PQ) as kt kc kt 2 2 pq = i=1 j=1 p(i, j) i=1 p(i) where kt is the true number of classes, and kc is the number of clusters found by the algorithm. This metric is maximized when Lc induces the same partition of the data as Lt ; in other words, when all points in each cluster have the same true label, and the estimated k is the true k. The p(i, j) term is the frequency-based probability that a datapoint will be labeled i by Lt and j by Lc . This quality is normalized by the sum of true probabilities, squared. This statistic is related to the Rand statistic for comparing partitions [8]. For the NIST dataset, G-means ﬁnds 31 clusters in 30 seconds with a PQ score of 0.177. X-means ﬁnds 715 clusters in 4149 seconds, and 369 of these clusters contain only one point, indicating an overestimation problem with the BIC. X-means receives a PQ score of 0.024. For the Pendigits dataset, G-means ﬁnds 69 clusters in 30 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.196; X-means ﬁnds 235 clusters in 287 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.057. Figure 5 shows Hinton diagrams of the G-means clusterings of both datasets, showing that G-means succeeds at identifying the true clusters concisely, without aid of the labels. The confusions between different digits in the NIST dataset (seen in the off-diagonal elements) are common for other researchers using more sophisticated techniques, see [3]. 4 Discussion and conclusions We have introduced the new G-means algorithm for learning k based on a statistical test for determining whether datapoints are a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary dimension and covariance matrix. The splitting uses dimension reduction and a powerful test for Gaussian ﬁtness. G-means uses this statistical test as a wrapper around k-means to discover the number of clusters automatically. The only parameter supplied to the algorithm is the signiﬁcance level of the statistical test, which can easily be set in a standard way. The G-means algorithm takes linear time and space (plus the cost of the splitting heuristic and test) in the number of datapoints and dimension, since k-means is itself linear in time and space. Empirically, the G-means algorithm works well at ﬁnding the correct number of clusters and the locations of genuine cluster centers, and we have shown it works well in moderately high dimensions. Clustering in high dimensions has been an open problem for many years. Recent research has shown that it may be preferable to use dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering, and then use a low-dimensional clustering algorithm such as k-means, rather than clustering in the high dimension directly. In [3] the author shows that using a simple, inexpensive linear projection preserves many of the properties of data (such as cluster distances), while making it easier to ﬁnd the clusters. Thus there is a need for good-quality, fast clustering algorithms for low-dimensional data. Our work is a step in this direction. Additionally, recent image segmentation algorithms such as normalized cut [16, 13] are based on eigenvector computations on distance matrices. These “spectral” clustering algorithms still use k-means as a post-processing step to ﬁnd the actual segmentation and they require k to be speciﬁed. Thus we expect G-means will be useful in combination with spectral clustering. References [1] Horst Bischof, Aleˇ Leonardis, and Alexander Selb. MDL principle for robust vector quantisation.

<p>Author: Gal Chechik, Amir Globerson, Naftali Tishby, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of extracting the relevant aspects of data was addressed through the information bottleneck (IB) method, by (soft) clustering one variable while preserving information about another - relevance - variable. An interesting question addressed in the current work is the extension of these ideas to obtain continuous representations that preserve relevant information, rather than discrete clusters. We give a formal deﬁnition of the general continuous IB problem and obtain an analytic solution for the optimal representation for the important case of multivariate Gaussian variables. The obtained optimal representation is a noisy linear projection to eigenvectors of the normalized correlation matrix Σx|y Σ−1 , which x is also the basis obtained in Canonical Correlation Analysis. However, in Gaussian IB, the compression tradeoﬀ parameter uniquely determines the dimension, as well as the scale of each eigenvector. This introduces a novel interpretation where solutions of diﬀerent ranks lie on a continuum parametrized by the compression level. Our analysis also provides an analytic expression for the optimal tradeoﬀ - the information curve - in terms of the eigenvalue spectrum. 1</p><p>4 0.99022996 <a title="90-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Circuit_Optimization_Predicts_Dynamic_Networks_for_Chemosensory_Orientation_in_Nematode_C._elegans.html">45 nips-2003-Circuit Optimization Predicts Dynamic Networks for Chemosensory Orientation in Nematode C. elegans</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan A. Dunn, John S. Conery, Shawn R. Lockery</p><p>Abstract: The connectivity of the nervous system of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has been described completely, but the analysis of the neuronal basis of behavior in this system is just beginning. Here, we used an optimization algorithm to search for patterns of connectivity sufﬁcient to compute the sensorimotor transformation underlying C. elegans chemotaxis, a simple form of spatial orientation behavior in which turning probability is modulated by the rate of change of chemical concentration. Optimization produced differentiator networks with inhibitory feedback among all neurons. Further analysis showed that feedback regulates the latency between sensory input and behavior. Common patterns of connectivity between the model and biological networks suggest new functions for previously identiﬁed connections in the C. elegans nervous system. 1</p><p>5 0.98633063 <a title="90-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Efficient_and_Robust_Feature_Extraction_by_Maximum_Margin_Criterion.html">59 nips-2003-Efficient and Robust Feature Extraction by Maximum Margin Criterion</a></p>
<p>Author: Haifeng Li, Tao Jiang, Keshu Zhang</p><p>Abstract: A new feature extraction criterion, maximum margin criterion (MMC), is proposed in this paper. This new criterion is general in the sense that, when combined with a suitable constraint, it can actually give rise to the most popular feature extractor in the literature, linear discriminate analysis (LDA). We derive a new feature extractor based on MMC using a different constraint that does not depend on the nonsingularity of the within-class scatter matrix Sw . Such a dependence is a major drawback of LDA especially when the sample size is small. The kernelized (nonlinear) counterpart of this linear feature extractor is also established in this paper. Our preliminary experimental results on face images demonstrate that the new feature extractors are efﬁcient and stable. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.98364294 <a title="90-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Increase_Information_Transfer_Rates_in_BCI_by_CSP_Extension_to_Multi-class.html">90 nips-2003-Increase Information Transfer Rates in BCI by CSP Extension to Multi-class</a></p>

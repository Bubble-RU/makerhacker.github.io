<p>Author: Leonid Sigal, Michael Isard, Benjamin H. Sigelman, Michael J. Black</p><p>Abstract: The detection and pose estimation of people in images and video is made challenging by the variability of human appearance, the complexity of natural scenes, and the high dimensionality of articulated body models. To cope with these problems we represent the 3D human body as a graphical model in which the relationships between the body parts are represented by conditional probability distributions. We formulate the pose estimation problem as one of probabilistic inference over a graphical model where the random variables correspond to the individual limb parameters (position and orientation). Because the limbs are described by 6-dimensional vectors encoding pose in 3-space, discretization is impractical and the random variables in our model must be continuousvalued. To approximate belief propagation in such a graph we exploit a recently introduced generalization of the particle ﬁlter. This framework facilitates the automatic initialization of the body-model from low level cues and is robust to occlusion of body parts and scene clutter. 1</p><p>3 0.12766267 <a title="195-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Unsupervised_Color_Decomposition_Of_Histologically_Stained_Tissue_Samples.html">190 nips-2003-Unsupervised Color Decomposition Of Histologically Stained Tissue Samples</a></p>

<p>Author: Victor Lavrenko, R. Manmatha, Jiwoon Jeon</p><p>Abstract: We propose an approach to learning the semantics of images which allows us to automatically annotate an image with keywords and to retrieve images based on text queries. We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated images. We assume that every image is divided into regions, each described by a continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations, we compute a joint probabilistic model of image features and words which allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments show that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the best of the previously reported results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval. 1</p><p>5 0.087047726 <a title="195-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-A_Sampled_Texture_Prior_for_Image_Super-Resolution.html">17 nips-2003-A Sampled Texture Prior for Image Super-Resolution</a></p>
<p>Author: Lyndsey C. Pickup, Stephen J. Roberts, Andrew Zisserman</p><p>Abstract: Super-resolution aims to produce a high-resolution image from a set of one or more low-resolution images by recovering or inventing plausible high-frequency image content. Typical approaches try to reconstruct a high-resolution image using the sub-pixel displacements of several lowresolution images, usually regularized by a generic smoothness prior over the high-resolution image space. Other methods use training data to learn low-to-high-resolution matches, and have been highly successful even in the single-input-image case. Here we present a domain-speciﬁc image prior in the form of a p.d.f. based upon sampled images, and show that for certain types of super-resolution problems, this sample-based prior gives a signiﬁcant improvement over other common multiple-image super-resolution techniques. 1</p><p>6 0.081401251 <a title="195-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Image_Reconstruction_by_Linear_Programming.html">88 nips-2003-Image Reconstruction by Linear Programming</a></p>

<p>Author: Charles Rosenberg, Alok Ladsariya, Tom Minka</p><p>Abstract: We present a Bayesian approach to color constancy which utilizes a nonGaussian probabilistic model of the image formation process. The parameters of this model are estimated directly from an uncalibrated image set and a small number of additional algorithmic parameters are chosen using cross validation. The algorithm is empirically shown to exhibit RMS error lower than other color constancy algorithms based on the Lambertian surface reﬂectance model when estimating the illuminants of a set of test images. This is demonstrated via a direct performance comparison utilizing a publicly available set of real world test images and code base.</p><p>4 0.49479473 <a title="195-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Attractive_People%3A_Assembling_Loose-Limbed_Models_using_Non-parametric_Belief_Propagation.html">35 nips-2003-Attractive People: Assembling Loose-Limbed Models using Non-parametric Belief Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Deva Ramanan, David A. Forsyth</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a system that can annotate a video sequence with: a description of the appearance of each actor; when the actor is in view; and a representation of the actor’s activity while in view. The system does not require a ﬁxed background, and is automatic. The system works by (1) tracking people in 2D and then, using an annotated motion capture dataset, (2) synthesizing an annotated 3D motion sequence matching the 2D tracks. The 3D motion capture data is manually annotated off-line using a class structure that describes everyday motions and allows motion annotations to be composed — one may jump while running, for example. Descriptions computed from video of real motions show that the method is accurate.</p><p>4 0.93443817 <a title="195-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-An_MCMC-Based_Method_of_Comparing_Connectionist_Models_in_Cognitive_Science.html">25 nips-2003-An MCMC-Based Method of Comparing Connectionist Models in Cognitive Science</a></p>
<p>Author: Woojae Kim, Daniel J. Navarro, Mark A. Pitt, In J. Myung</p><p>Abstract: Despite the popularity of connectionist models in cognitive science, their performance can often be diﬃcult to evaluate. Inspired by the geometric approach to statistical model selection, we introduce a conceptually similar method to examine the global behavior of a connectionist model, by counting the number and types of response patterns it can simulate. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo-based algorithm that we constructed Þnds these patterns eﬃciently. We demonstrate the approach using two localist network models of speech perception. 1</p><p>5 0.92921185 <a title="195-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Boosting_versus_Covering.html">41 nips-2003-Boosting versus Covering</a></p>
<p>Author: Kohei Hatano, Manfred K. Warmuth</p><p>Abstract: We investigate improvements of AdaBoost that can exploit the fact that the weak hypotheses are one-sided, i.e. either all its positive (or negative) predictions are correct. In particular, for any set of m labeled examples consistent with a disjunction of k literals (which are one-sided in this case), AdaBoost constructs a consistent hypothesis by using O(k 2 log m) iterations. On the other hand, a greedy set covering algorithm ﬁnds a consistent hypothesis of size O(k log m). Our primary question is whether there is a simple boosting algorithm that performs as well as the greedy set covering. We ﬁrst show that InfoBoost, a modiﬁcation of AdaBoost proposed by Aslam for a diﬀerent purpose, does perform as well as the greedy set covering algorithm. We then show that AdaBoost requires Ω(k 2 log m) iterations for learning k-literal disjunctions. We achieve this with an adversary construction and as well as in simple experiments based on artiﬁcial data. Further we give a variant called SemiBoost that can handle the degenerate case when the given examples all have the same label. We conclude by showing that SemiBoost can be used to produce small conjunctions as well. 1</p><p>6 0.75898433 <a title="195-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-A_Model_for_Learning_the_Semantics_of_Pictures.html">12 nips-2003-A Model for Learning the Semantics of Pictures</a></p>

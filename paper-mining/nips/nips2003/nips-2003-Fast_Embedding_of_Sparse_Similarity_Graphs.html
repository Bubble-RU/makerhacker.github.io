Roux, Marie Ouimet</p><p>Abstract: Several unsupervised learning algorithms based on an eigendecomposition provide either an embedding or a clustering only for given training points, with no straightforward extension for out-of-sample examples short of recomputing eigenvectors. This paper provides a uniﬁed framework for extending Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (for dimensionality reduction) as well as for Spectral Clustering. This framework is based on seeing these algorithms as learning eigenfunctions of a data-dependent kernel. Numerical experiments show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms due to the choice of training data. 1</p><p>3 0.13236421 <a title="71-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Learning_a_Distance_Metric_from_Relative_Comparisons.html">108 nips-2003-Learning a Distance Metric from Relative Comparisons</a></p>

Taking a Support Vector Machine (SVM) approach, we develop an algorithm that provides a ﬂexible way of describing qualitative training data as a set of constraints. We show that such constraints lead to a convex quadratic programming problem that can be solved by adapting standard methods for SVM training.

<p>Author: Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: Spectral methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) impose a neighborhood graph on point data and compute eigenfunctions of a quadratic form generated from the graph. We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>5 0.08962632 <a title="71-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Clustering_with_the_Connectivity_Kernel.html">46 nips-2003-Clustering with the Connectivity Kernel</a></p>
<p>Author: Bernd Fischer, Volker Roth, Joachim M. Buhmann</p><p>Abstract: Clustering aims at extracting hidden structure in dataset. While the problem of ﬁnding compact clusters has been widely studied in the literature, extracting arbitrarily formed elongated structures is considered a much harder problem. In this paper we present a novel clustering algorithm which tackles the problem by a two step procedure: ﬁrst the data are transformed in such a way that elongated structures become compact ones. In a second step, these new objects are clustered by optimizing a compactness-based criterion. The advantages of the method over related approaches are threefold: (i) robustness properties of compactness-based criteria naturally transfer to the problem of extracting elongated structures, leading to a model which is highly robust against outlier objects; (ii) the transformed distances induce a Mercer kernel which allows us to formulate a polynomial approximation scheme to the generally N Phard clustering problem; (iii) the new method does not contain free kernel parameters in contrast to methods like spectral clustering or mean-shift clustering. 1</p><p>6 0.079947062 <a title="71-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Measure_Based_Regularization.html">126 nips-2003-Measure Based Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: This paper applies fast sparse multidimensional scaling (MDS) to a large graph of music similarity, with 267K vertices that represent artists, albums, and tracks; and 3.22M edges that represent similarity between those entities. Once vertices are assigned locations in a Euclidean space, the locations can be used to browse music and to generate playlists. MDS on very large sparse graphs can be effectively performed by a family of algorithms called Rectangular Dijsktra (RD) MDS algorithms. These RD algorithms operate on a dense rectangular slice of the distance matrix, created by calling Dijsktra a constant number of times. Two RD algorithms are compared: Landmark MDS, which uses the Nyström approximation to perform MDS; and a new algorithm called Fast Sparse Embedding, which uses FastMap. These algorithms compare favorably to Laplacian Eigenmaps, both in terms of speed and embedding quality. 1</p><p>2 0.66682518 <a title="71-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Out-of-Sample_Extensions_for_LLE%2C_Isomap%2C_MDS%2C_Eigenmaps%2C_and_Spectral_Clustering.html">150 nips-2003-Out-of-Sample Extensions for LLE, Isomap, MDS, Eigenmaps, and Spectral Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Matthew Brand</p><p>Abstract: Spectral methods for nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) impose a neighborhood graph on point data and compute eigenfunctions of a quadratic form generated from the graph. We introduce a more general and more robust formulation of NLDR based on the singular value decomposition (SVD). In this framework, most spectral NLDR principles can be recovered by taking a subset of the constraints in a quadratic form built from local nullspaces on the manifold. The minimax formulation also opens up an interesting class of methods in which the graph is “decorated” with information at the vertices, offering discrete or continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and immunity to some solution instabilities of eigenfunction approaches. Apropos, we show almost all NLDR methods based on eigenvalue decompositions (EVD) have a solution instability that increases faster than problem size. This pathology can be observed (and corrected via the minimax formulation) in problems as small as N < 100 points. 1 Nonlinear dimensionality reduction (NLDR) . Spectral NLDR methods are graph embedding problems where a set of N points X = [x1 , · · · , xN ] ∈ RD×N sampled from a low-dimensional manifold in a ambient space RD is reparameterized by imposing a neighborhood graph G on X and embedding the graph with minimal distortion in a “parameterization” space Rd , d < D. Typically the graph is sparse and local, with edges connecting points to their immediate neighbors. The embedding must keep these edges short or preserve their length (for isometry) or angles (for conformality). The graph-embedding problem was ﬁrst introduced as a least-squares problem by Tutte [1], and as an eigenvalue problem by Fiedler [2]. The use of sparse graphs to generate metrics for least-squares problems has been studied intensely in the following three decades (see [3]). Modern NLDR methods use graph constraints to generate a metric in a space of embeddings RN . Eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) gives the directions of least or greatest variance under this metric. Typically a subset of d extremal eigenvectors gives the embedding of N points in Rd parameterization space. This includes the IsoMap family [4], the locally linear embedding (LLE) family [5,6], and Laplacian methods [7,8]. Using similar methods, the Automatic Alignment [6] and Charting [9] algorithms embed local subspaces instead of points, and by combining subspace projections thus obtain continuous maps between RD and Rd . This paper introduces a general algebraic framework for computing optimal embeddings directly from graph constraints. The aforementioned methods can can be recovered as special cases. The framework also suggests some new methods with very attractive properties, including continuous maps, reduced computational complexity, and control over the degree of conformality/isometry in the desired map. It also eliminates a solution instability that is intrinsic to EVD-based approaches. A perturbational analysis quantiﬁes the instability. 2 Minimax theorem for graph embeddings We begin with neighborhood graph speciﬁed by a nondiagonal weighted adjacency matrix M ∈ RN×N that has the data-reproducing property XM = X (this can be relaxed to XM ≈ X in practice). The graph-embedding and NLDR literatures offer various constructions of M, each appropriate to different sets of assumptions about the original embedding and its sampling X (e.g., isometry, local linearity, noiseless samples, regular sampling, etc.). Typically Mi j = 0 if points i, j are nearby on the intrinsic manifold and |Mi j | is small or zero otherwise. Each point is taken to be a linear or convex combination of its neighbors, and thus M speciﬁes manifold connectivity in the sense that any nondegenerate embedding Y that satisﬁes YM ≈ Y with small residual YM − Y F will preserve this connectivity and the structure of local neighborhoods. For example, in barycentric embeddings, each point is the average of its neighbors and thus Mi j = 1/k if vertex i is connected to vertex j (of degree k). We will also consider three optional constraints on the embedding : 1. A null-space restriction, where the solution must be outside to the column-space of C ∈ RN×M , M < N. For example, it is common to stipulate that the solution Y be centered, i.e., YC = 0 for C = 1, the constant vector. 2. A basis restriction, where the solution must be a linear combination of the rows of basis Z ∈ RK×N , K ≤ N. This can be thought of as information placed at the vertices of the graph that serves as example inputs for a target NLDR function. We will use this to construct dimension-reducing radial basis function networks. 3. A metric Σ ∈ RN×N that determines how error is distributed over the points. For example, it might be important that boundary points have less error. We assume that Σ is symmetric positive deﬁnite and has factorization Σ = AA (e.g., A could be a Cholesky factor of Σ). In most settings, the optional matrices will default to the identity matrix. In this context, we deﬁne the per-dimension embedding error of row-vector yi ∈ rows(Y) to be . EM (yi ) = max yi ∈range(Z),, K∈RM×N (yi (M + CD) − yi )A yi A (1) where D is a matrix constructed by an adversary to maximize the error. The optimizing yi is a vector inside the subspace spanned by the rows of Z and outside the subspace spanned by the columns of C, for which the reconstruction residual yi M−yi has smallest norm w.r.t. the metric Σ. The following theorem identiﬁes the optimal embedding Y for any choice of M, Z, C, Σ: Minimax solution: Let Q ∈ SK×P be a column-orthonormal basis of the null-space of the rows of ZC, with P = K − rank(C). Let B ∈ RP×P be a square factor satisfying B B = Q ZΣZ Q, e.g., a Cholesky factor (or the “R” factor in QR-decomposition of (Q ZA) ). Compute the left singular vectors U ∈ SN×N of Udiag(s)V = B− Q Z(I − M)A, with . singular values s = [s1 , · · · , sP ] ordered s1 ≤ s2 ≤ · · · ≤ s p . Using the leading columns U1:d of U, set Y = U1:d B− Q Z. Theorem 1. Y is the optimal (minimax) embedding in Rd with error [s1 , · · · , sd ] 2 : . Y = U1:d B− Q Z = arg min ∑ EM (yi )2 with EM (yi ) = si . Y∈Rd×N y ∈rows(Y) i (2) Appendix A develops the proof and other error measures that are minimized. Local NLDR techniques are easily expressed in this framework. When Z = A = I, C = [], and M reproduces X through linear combinations with M 1 = 1, we recover LLE [5]. When Z = I, C = [], I − M is the normalized graph Laplacian, and A is a diagonal matrix of vertex degrees, we recover Laplacian eigenmaps [7]. When further Z = X we recover locally preserving projections [8]. 3 Analysis and generalization of charting The minimax construction of charting [9] takes some development, but offers an interesting insight into the above-mentioned methods. Recall that charting ﬁrst solves for a set of local afﬁne subspace axes S1 ∈ RD×d , S2 , · · · at offsets µ1 ∈ RD , µ2 , · · · that best cover the data and vary smoothly over the manifold. Each subspace offers a chart—a local parameterization of the data by projection onto the local axes. Charting then constructs a weighted mixture of afﬁne projections that merges the charts into a global parameterization. If the data manifold is curved, each projection will assign a point a slightly different embedding, so the error is measured as the variance of these proposed embeddings about their mean. This maximizes consistency and tends to produce isometric embeddings; [9] discusses ways to explicitly optimize the isometry of the embedding. Under the assumption of isometry, the charting error is equivalent to the sumsquared displacements of an embedded point relative to its immediate neighbors (summed over all neighborhoods). To construct the same error criteria in the minimax setting, let xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k denote points in the ith neighborhood and let the columns of Vi ∈ R(2k+1)×d be an orthonormal basis of rows of the local parameterization Si [xi−k , · · · , xi , · · · , xi+k ]. Then a nonzero reparameterization will satisfy [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ]Vi Vi = [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ] if and only if it preserves the relative position of the points in the local parameterization. Conversely, any relative displacements of the points are isolated by the formula [yi−k , · · · , yi , · · · , yi+k ](I − Vi Vi ). Minimizing the Frobenius norm of this expression is thus equivalent to minimizing the local error in charting. We sum these constraints over all neighborhoods to obtain the constraint matrix M = I − ∑i Fi (I − Vi Vi )Fi , where (Fi )k j = 1 iff the jth point of the ith neighborhood is the kth point of the dataset. Because Vi Vi and (I − Vi Vi ) are complementary, it follows that the error criterion of any local NLDR method (e.g., LLE, Laplacian eigenmaps, etc.) must measure the projection of the embedding onto some subspace of (I − Vi Vi ). To construct a continuous map, charting uses an overcomplete radial basis function (RBF) representation Z = [z(x1 ), z(x2 ), · · · z(xN )], where z(x) is a vector that stacks z1 (x), z2 (x), etc., and pm (x) . Km (x − µm ) , zm (x) = 1 ∑m pm (x) −1 . pm (x) = N (x|µm , Σm ) ∝ e−(x−µm ) Σm (x−µm )/2 (3) (4) and Km is any local linear dimensionality reducer, typically Sm itself. Each column of Z contains many “views” of the same point that are combined to give its low-dimensional embedding. Finally, we set C = 1, which forces the embedding of the full data to be centered. Applying the minimax solution to these constraints yields the RBF network mixing ma. trix, f (x) = U1:d B− Q z(x). Theorem 1 guarantees that the resulting embedding is leastsquares optimal w.r.t. Z, M, C, A at the datapoints f (xi ), and because f (·) is an afﬁne transform of z(·) it smoothly interpolates the embedding between points. There are some interesting variants: Kernel embeddings of the twisted swiss roll generalized EVD minimax SVD UR corner detail LL corner detail Fig. 1. Minimax and generalized EVD solution for kernel eigenmap of a non-developable swiss roll. Points are connected into a grid which ideally should be regular. The EVD solution shows substantial degradation. Insets detail corners where the EVD solution crosses itself repeatedly. The border compression is characteristic of Laplacian constraints. One-shot charting: If we set the local dimensionality reducers to the identity matrix (all Km = I), then the minimax method jointly optimizes the local dimensionality reduction to charts and the global coordination of the charts (under any choice of M). This requires that rows(Z) ≤ N for a fully determined solution. Discrete isometric charting: If Z = I then we directly obtain a discrete isometric embedding of the data, rather than a continuous map, making this a local equivalent of IsoMap. Reduced basis charting: Let Z be constructed using just a small number of kernels randomly placed on the data manifold, such that rows(Z) N. Then the size of the SVD problem is substantially reduced. 4 Numerical advantage of minimax method Note that the minimax method projects the constraint matrix M into a subspace derived from C and Z and decomposes it there. This suppresses unwanted degrees of freedom (DOFs) admitted by the problem constraints, for example the trivial R0 embedding where all points are mapped to a single point yi = N −1/2 . The R0 embedding serves as a translational DOF in the solution. LLE- and eigenmap-based methods construct M to have a constant null-space so that the translational DOF will be isolated in the EVD as null eigenvalue paired to a constant eigenvector, which is then discarded. However, section 4.1 shows that this construction makes the EVD increasingly unstable as problem size grows and/or the data becomes increasing amenable to low-residual embeddings, ultimately causing solution collapse. As the next paragraph demonstrates, the problem is exacerbated when embedding w.r.t. a basis Z (via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem), partly because the eigenvector associated with the unwanted DOF can have arbitrary structure. In all cases the problem can be averted by using the minimax formulation with C = 1 to suppress the DOF. A 2D plane was embedded in 3D with a curl, a twist, and 2.5% Gaussian noise, then regularly sampled at 900 points. We computed a kernelized Laplacian eigenmap using 70 random points as RBF centers, i.e., a continous map using M derived from the graph Laplacian and Z constructed as above. The map was computed both via the minimax (SVD) method and via the equivalent generalized eigenproblem, where the translational degree of freedom must be removed by discarding an eigenvector from the solution. The two solutions are algebraically equivalent in every other regard. A variety of eigensolvers were tried; we took −5 excess energy x 10 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 15 10 5 0 −5 Eigen spectrum compared to minimax spectrum 2 15 deviation excess energy x 10 10 5 100 200 eigenvalue Error in null embedding −5 x 10 0 −2 −4 −6 −8 0 100 −5 eigenvalue Error in null embedding 200 100 200 300 400 500 point 600 700 800 900 Fig. 2. Excess energy in the eigenspectrum indicates that the translational DOF has contam2 inated many eigenvectors. If the EVD had successfully isolated the unwanted DOF, then its 0 remaining eigenvalues should be identical to those derived from the minimax solution. The −2 −4 graph at left shows the difference in the eigenspectra. The graph at right shows the EVD −6 solution’s deviation from the translational vector y0 = 1 · N −1/2 ≈ .03333.

Figure 1 shows that the EVD solution exhibits many defects, particularly a folding-over of the manifold at the top and bottom edges and at the corners. Figure 2 shows that the noisiness of the EVD solution is due largely to mutual contamination of numerically unstable eigenvectors. 4.1 Numerical instability of eigen-methods The following theorem uses tools of matrix perturbation theory to show that as the problem size increases, the desired and unwanted eigenvectors become increasingly wobbly and gradually contaminate each other, leading to degraded solutions. More precisely, the low-order eigenvalues are ill-conditioned and exhibit multiplicities that may be true (due to noiseless samples from low-curvature manifolds) or false (due to numerical noise). Although in many cases some post-hoc algebra can “ﬁlter” the unwanted components out of the contaminated eigensolution, it is not hard to construct cases where the eigenvectors cannot be cleanly separated. The minimax formulation is immune to this problem because it explicitly suppresses the gratuitous component(s) before matrix decomposition. Theorem 2. For any ﬁnite numerical precision, as the number of points N increases, the Frobenius norm of numerical noise in the null eigenvector v0 can grow as O(N 3/2 ), and the eigenvalue problem can approach a false multiplicity at a rate as fast as O(N 3/2 ), at which point the eigenvectors of interest—embedding and translational—are mutually contaminated and/or have an indeterminate eigenvalue ordering. Please see appendix B for the proof. This theorem essentially lower-bounds an upperbound on error; examples can be constructed in which the problem is worse. For example, it can be shown analytically that when embedding points drawn from the simple curve xi = [a, cos πa] , a ∈ [0, 1] with K = 2 neighbors, instabilities cannot be bounded better than O(N 5/2 ); empirically we see eigenvector mixing with N < 100 points and we see it grow at the rate ≈ O(N 4 )—in many different eigensolvers. At very large scales, more pernicious instabilities set in. E.g., by N = 20000 points, the solution begins to fold over. Although algebraic multiplicity and instability of the eigenproblem is conceptually a minor oversight in the algorithmic realizations of eigenfunction embeddings, as theorem 2 shows, the consequences are eventually fatal. 5 Summary One of the most appealing aspects of the spectral NLDR literature is that algorithms are usually motivated from analyses of linear operators on smooth differentiable manifolds, e.g., [7]. Understandably, these analysis rely on assumptions (e.g., smoothness or isometry or noiseless sampling) that make it difﬁcult to predict what algorithmic realizations will do when real, noisy data violates these assumptions. The minimax embedding theorem provides a complete algebraic characterization of this discrete NLDR problem, and provides a solution that recovers numerically robustiﬁed versions of almost all known algorithms. It offers a principled way of constructing new algorithms with clear optimality properties and good numerical conditioning—notably the construction of a continuous NLDR map (an RBF network) in a one-shot optimization ( SVD ). We have also shown how to cast several local NLDR principles in this framework, and upgrade these methods to give continuous maps. Working in the opposite direction, we sketched the minimax formulation of isometric charting and showed that its constraint matrix contains a superset of all the algebraic constraints used in local NLDR techniques.

A Proof of minimax embedding theorem (1) The burden of this proof is carried by supporting lemmas, below. To emphasize the proof strategy, we give the proof ﬁrst; supporting lemmas follow. Proof. Setting yi = li Z, we will solve for li ∈ columns(L). Writing the error in terms of li , EM (li ) = max K∈RM×N li Z(I − M − CK)A li Z(I − M)A − li ZCKA = max . M×N li ZA li ZA K∈R (5) The term li ZCKA produces inﬁnite error unless li ZC = 0, so we accept this as a constraint and seek li Z(I − M)A min . (6) li ZA li ZC=0 By lemma 1, that orthogonality is satisﬁed by solving the problem in the space orthogonal . to ZC; the basis for this space is given by columns of Q = null((ZC) ). By lemma 2, the denominator of the error speciﬁes the metric in solution space to be ZAA Z ; when the problem is projected into the space orthogonal to ZC it becomes Q (ZAA Z )Q. Nesting the “orthogonally-constrained-SVD” construction of lemma 1 inside the “SVD-under-a-metric” lemma 2, we obtain a solution that uses the correct metric in the orthogonal space: B B = Q ZAA Z Q − Udiag(s)V = B (7) {Q(Z(I − M)A)} (8) L = QB−1 U (9) where braces indicate the nesting of lemmas. By the “best-projection” lemma (#3), if we order the singular values by ascending magnitude, L1:d = arg min J∈RN×d ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j Z(I − M)A / j )2 ZΣZ The proof is completed by making the substitutions L Z → Y and x A → x Σ = AA ), and leaving off the ﬁnal square root operation to obtain (Y )1:d = arg min ∑ji ∈cols(J) j (I − M) Σ / j J∈RN×d (10) Σ (for 2 Σ . (11) Lemma 1. Orthogonally constrained SVD: The left singular vectors L of matrix M under . SVD the constraint U C = 0 are calculated as Q = null(C ), Udiag(s)V ← Q M, L = QU. Proof. First observe that L is orthogonal to C: By deﬁnition, the null-space basis satisﬁes Q C = 0, thus L C = U Q C = 0. Let J be an orthonormal basis for C, with J J = I and Q J = 0. Then Ldiag(s)V = QQ M = (I − JJ )M, the orthogonal projector of C applied to M, proving that the SVD captures the component of M that is orthogonal to C. Lemma 2. SVD with respect to a metric: The vectors li ∈ L, vi ∈ V that diagonalize matrix M with respect to positive deﬁnite column-space metric Σ are calculated as B B ← Σ, SVD . Udiag(s)V ← B− M, L = B−1 U satisfy li M / li Σ = si and extremize this form for the extremal singular values smin , smax . Proof. By construction, L and V diagonalize M: L MV = (B−1 U) MV = U (B− M)V = diag(s) (12) B− and diag(s)V = M. Forming the gram matrices of both sides of the last line, we obtain the identity Vdiag(s)2 V = M B−1 B− M = M Σ−1 M, which demonstrates that si ∈ s are the singular values of M w.r.t. column-space metric Σ. Finally, L is orthonormal w.r.t. the metric Σ, because L 2 = L ΣL = U B− B BB−1 U = I. Consequently, Σ l M / l Σ = l M /1 = si vi and by the Courant-Hilbert theorem, smax = max l M / l Σ ; = si . smin = min l M / l Σ . l l (13) (14) Lemma 3. Best projection: Taking L and s from lemma 2, let the columns of L and elements of s be sorted so that s1 ≥ s2 ≥ · · · ≥ sN . Then for any dimensionality 1 ≤ d ≤ N, . L1:d = [l1 , · · · , ld ] = arg max J M (J ΣJ)−1 (15) J∈RN×d = arg max F (16) ∑ji ∈cols(J) ( j M / j Σ )2 (17) J∈RN×d |J ΣJ=I = arg max J∈RN×d J M with the optimum value of all right hand sides being (∑d s2 )1/2 . If the sort order is rei=1 i versed, the minimum of this form is obtained. Proof. By the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, if U MV = diag(s) with singular values . sorted in descending order, then U1:d = [u1 , · · · , ud ] = arg maxU∈SN×d U M F . We ﬁrst extend this to a non-orthonogonal basis J under a Mahalonobis norm: maxJ∈RN×d J M (J J)−1 = maxU∈SN×d U M F (18) because J M 2 (J J)−1 = trace(M J(J J)−1 J M) = trace(M JJ+ (JJ+ ) M) = (JJ+ )M 2 = UU M 2 = U M 2 since JJ+ is a (symmetric) orthogonal proF F F jector having binary eigenvalues λ ∈ {0, 1} and therefore it is the gram of an thin orthogonal matrix. We then impose a metric Σ on the column-space of J to obtain the ﬁrst criterion (equation 15), which asks what maximizes variance in J M while minimizing the norm of J w.r.t. metric Σ. Here it sufﬁces to substitute in the leading (resp., trailing) columns of L and verify that the norm is maximized (resp., minimized). Expanding, L1:d M 2 ΣL )−1 = trace((L1:d M) (L1:d ΣL1:d )−1 (L1:d M)) = (L 1:d 1:d trace((L1:d M) I(L1:d M)) = trace((diag(s1:d )V1:d ) (diag(s1:d )V1:d )) = s1:d 2 . Again, by the Eckart-Young-Mirsky theorem, these are the maximal variance-preserving projections, so the ﬁrst criterion is indeed maximized by setting J to the columns in L corresponding to the largest values in s. Criterion #2 restates the ﬁrst criterion with the set of candidates for J restricted to (the hyperelliptical manifold of) matrices that reduce the metric on the norm to the identity matrix (thereby recovering the Frobenius norm). Criterion #3 criterion merely expands the above trace by individual singular values. Note that the numerator and denominator can have different metrics because they are norms in different spaces, possibly of different dimension. Finally, that the trailing d eigenvectors minimize these criteria follows directly from the fact that leading N − d singular values account for the maximal part of the variance. B Proof of instability theorem (2) Proof. When generated from a sparse graph with average degree K, weighted connectivity matrix W is sparse and has O(NK) entries. Since the graph vertices represent samples from a smooth manifold, increasing the sampling density N does not change the distribution of magnitudes in W. Consider a perturbation of the nonzero values in W, e.g., W → W + E due to numerical noise E created by ﬁnite machine precision. By the weak law of large √ numbers, the Frobenius norm of the sparse perturbation grows as E F ∼ O( N). However the t th -smallest nonzero eigenvalue λt (W) grows as λt (W) = vt Wvt ∼ O(N −1 ), because elements of corresponding eigenvector vt grow as O(N −1/2 ) and only K of those elements are multiplied by nonzero values to form each element of Wvt . In sum, the perturbation E F grows while the eigenvalue λt (W) shrinks. In linear embedding algorithms, . the eigengap of interest is λgap = λ1 − λ0 . The tail eigenvalue λ0 = 0 by construction but it is possible that λ0 > 0 with numerical error, thus λgap ≤ λ1 . Combining these facts, the ratio between the perturbation and the eigengap grows as E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ) or faster. Now consider the shifted eigenproblem I − W with leading (maximal) eigenvalues 1 − λ0 ≥ 1 − λ1 ≥ · · · and unchanged eigenvectors. From matrix perturbation the. ory [10, thm. V.2.8], when W is perturbed to W = W + E, the change in the lead√ ing eigenvalue from 1 − λ0 to 1 − λ0 is bounded as |λ0 − λ0 | ≤ 2 E F and similarly √ √ 1 − λ1 ≤ 1 − λ1 + 2 E F . Thus λgap ≥ λgap − 2 E F . Since E F /λgap ∼ O(N 3/2 ), the right hand side of the gap bound goes negative at a supralinear rate, implying that the eigenvalue ordering eventually becomes unstable with the possibility of the ﬁrst and second eigenvalue/vector pairs being swapped. Mutual contamination of the eigenvectors happens well before: Under general (dense) conditions, the change in the eigenvector v0 is bounded E F as v0 − v0 ≤ |λ −λ4 |−√2 E [10, thm. V.2.8]. (This bound is often tight enough to serve F 0 1 as a good approximation.) Specializing this to the sparse embedding matrix, we ﬁnd that √ √ O( N) O( N) the bound weakens to v0 − 1 · N −1/2 ∼ O(N −1 )−O(√N) > O(N −1 ) = O(N 3/2 ).</p><p>5 0.45930943 <a title="71-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Measure_Based_Regularization.html">126 nips-2003-Measure Based Regularization</a></p>

<p>Author: John C. Platt</p><p>Abstract: This paper applies fast sparse multidimensional scaling (MDS) to a large graph of music similarity, with 267K vertices that represent artists, albums, and tracks; and 3.22M edges that represent similarity between those entities. Once vertices are assigned locations in a Euclidean space, the locations can be used to browse music and to generate playlists. MDS on very large sparse graphs can be effectively performed by a family of algorithms called Rectangular Dijsktra (RD) MDS algorithms. These RD algorithms operate on a dense rectangular slice of the distance matrix, created by calling Dijsktra a constant number of times. Two RD algorithms are compared: Landmark MDS, which uses the Nyström approximation to perform MDS; and a new algorithm called Fast Sparse Embedding, which uses FastMap. These algorithms compare favorably to Laplacian Eigenmaps, both in terms of speed and embedding quality. 1</p><p>2 0.29939693 <a title="71-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Learning_the_k_in_k-means.html">111 nips-2003-Learning the k in k-means</a></p>
<p>Author: Greg Hamerly, Charles Elkan</p><p>Abstract: When clustering a dataset, the right number k of clusters to use is often not obvious, and choosing k automatically is a hard algorithmic problem. In this paper we present an improved algorithm for learning k while clustering. The G-means algorithm is based on a statistical test for the hypothesis that a subset of data follows a Gaussian distribution. G-means runs k-means with increasing k in a hierarchical fashion until the test accepts the hypothesis that the data assigned to each k-means center are Gaussian. Two key advantages are that the hypothesis test does not limit the covariance of the data and does not compute a full covariance matrix. Additionally, G-means only requires one intuitive parameter, the standard statistical signiﬁcance level α. We present results from experiments showing that the algorithm works well, and better than a recent method based on the BIC penalty for model complexity. In these experiments, we show that the BIC is ineffective as a scoring function, since it does not penalize strongly enough the model’s complexity. 1 Introduction and related work Clustering algorithms are useful tools for data mining, compression, probability density estimation, and many other important tasks. However, most clustering algorithms require the user to specify the number of clusters (called k), and it is not always clear what is the best value for k. Figure 1 shows examples where k has been improperly chosen. Choosing k is often an ad hoc decision based on prior knowledge, assumptions, and practical experience. Choosing k is made more difﬁcult when the data has many dimensions, even when clusters are well-separated. Center-based clustering algorithms (in particular k-means and Gaussian expectationmaximization) usually assume that each cluster adheres to a unimodal distribution, such as Gaussian. With these methods, only one center should be used to model each subset of data that follows a unimodal distribution. If multiple centers are used to describe data drawn from one mode, the centers are a needlessly complex description of the data, and in fact the multiple centers capture the truth about the subset less well than one center. In this paper we present a simple algorithm called G-means that discovers an appropriate k using a statistical test for deciding whether to split a k-means center into two centers. We describe examples and present experimental results that show that the new algorithm 0.9 4 0.8 3 0.7 2 0.6 1 0.5 0 0.4 −1 0.3 −2 −3 0.2 0.1 −0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 −4 −3 −2 −1 0 1 2 3 Figure 1: Two clusterings where k was improperly chosen.

In general, one center should be used to represent one Gaussian cluster. is successful. This technique is useful and applicable for many clustering algorithms other than k-means, but here we consider only the k-means algorithm for simplicity. Several algorithms have been proposed previously to determine k automatically. Like our method, most previous methods are wrappers around k-means or some other clustering algorithm for ﬁxed k. Wrapper methods use splitting and/or merging rules for centers to increase or decrease k as the algorithm proceeds. Pelleg and Moore [14] proposed a regularization framework for learning k, which they call X-means. The algorithm searches over many values of k and scores each clustering model using the so-called Bayesian Information Criterion [10]: BIC(C|X) = L(X|C) − p log n 2 where L(X|C) is the log-likelihood of the dataset X according to model C, p = k(d + 1) is the number of parameters in the model C with dimensionality d and k cluster centers, and n is the number of points in the dataset. X-means chooses the model with the best BIC score on the data. Aside from the BIC, other scoring functions are also available. Bischof et al. [1] use a minimum description length (MDL) framework, where the description length is a measure of how well the data are ﬁt by the model. Their algorithm starts with a large value for k and removes centers (reduces k) whenever that choice reduces the description length. Between steps of reducing k, they use the k-means algorithm to optimize the model ﬁt to the data. With hierarchical clustering algorithms, other methods may be employed to determine the best number of clusters. One is to build a merging tree (“dendrogram”) of the data based on a cluster distance metric, and search for areas of the tree that are stable with respect to inter- and intra-cluster distances [9, Section 5.1]. This method of estimating k is best applied with domain-speciﬁc knowledge and human intuition. 2 The Gaussian-means (G-means) algorithm The G-means algorithm starts with a small number of k-means centers, and grows the number of centers. Each iteration of the algorithm splits into two those centers whose data appear not to come from a Gaussian distribution. Between each round of splitting, we run k-means on the entire dataset and all the centers to reﬁne the current solution. We can initialize with just k = 1, or we can choose some larger value of k if we have some prior knowledge about the range of k. G-means repeatedly makes decisions based on a statistical test for the data assigned to each center. If the data currently assigned to a k-means center appear to be Gaussian, then we want to represent that data with only one center. However, if the same data do not appear Algorithm 1 G-means(X, α) 1: Let C be the initial set of centers (usually C ← {¯}). x 2: C ← kmeans(C, X). 3: Let {xi |class(xi ) = j} be the set of datapoints assigned to center cj . 4: Use a statistical test to detect if each {xi |class(xi ) = j} follow a Gaussian distribution (at conﬁdence level α). 5: If the data look Gaussian, keep cj . Otherwise replace cj with two centers. 6: Repeat from step 2 until no more centers are added. to be Gaussian, then we want to use multiple centers to model the data properly. The algorithm will run k-means multiple times (up to k times when ﬁnding k centers), so the time complexity is at most O(k) times that of k-means. The k-means algorithm implicitly assumes that the datapoints in each cluster are spherically distributed around the center. Less restrictively, the Gaussian expectation-maximization algorithm assumes that the datapoints in each cluster have a multidimensional Gaussian distribution with a covariance matrix that may or may not be ﬁxed, or shared. The Gaussian distribution test that we present below are valid for either covariance matrix assumption. The test also accounts for the number of datapoints n tested by incorporating n in the calculation of the critical value of the test (see Equation 2). This prevents the G-means algorithm from making bad decisions about clusters with few datapoints. 2.1 Testing clusters for Gaussian ﬁt To specify the G-means algorithm fully we need a test to detect whether the data assigned to a center are sampled from a Gaussian. The alternative hypotheses are • H0 : The data around the center are sampled from a Gaussian. • H1 : The data around the center are not sampled from a Gaussian. If we accept the null hypothesis H0 , then we believe that the one center is sufﬁcient to model its data, and we should not split the cluster into two sub-clusters. If we reject H0 and accept H1 , then we want to split the cluster. The test we use is based on the Anderson-Darling statistic. This one-dimensional test has been shown empirically to be the most powerful normality test that is based on the empirical cumulative distribution function (ECDF). Given a list of values xi that have been converted to mean 0 and variance 1, let x(i) be the ith ordered value. Let zi = F (x(i) ), where F is the N (0, 1) cumulative distribution function. Then the statistic is A2 (Z) = − 1 n n (2i − 1) [log(zi ) + log(1 − zn+1−i )] − n (1) i=1 Stephens [17] showed that for the case where µ and σ are estimated from the data (as in clustering), we must correct the statistic according to A2 (Z) ∗ = A2 (Z)(1 + 4/n − 25/(n2 )) (2) Given a subset of data X in d dimensions that belongs to center c, the hypothesis test proceeds as follows: 1. Choose a signiﬁcance level α for the test. 2. Initialize two centers, called “children” of c. See the text for good ways to do this. 3. Run k-means on these two centers in X. This can be run to completion, or to some early stopping point if desired. Let c1 , c2 be the child centers chosen by k-means. 4. Let v = c1 − c2 be a d-dimensional vector that connects the two centers. This is the direction that k-means believes to be important for clustering. Then project X onto v: xi = xi , v /||v||2 . X is a 1-dimensional representation of the data projected onto v. Transform X so that it has mean 0 and variance 1. 5. Let zi = F (x(i) ). If A2 (Z) is in the range of non-critical values at conﬁdence ∗ level α, then accept H0 , keep the original center, and discard {c1 , c2 }. Otherwise, reject H0 and keep {c1 , c2 } in place of the original center. A primary contribution of this work is simplifying the test for Gaussian ﬁt by projecting the data to one dimension where the test is simple to apply. The authors of [5] also use this approach for online dimensionality reduction during clustering. The one-dimensional representation of the data allows us to consider only the data along the direction that kmeans has found to be important for separating the data. This is related to the problem of projection pursuit [7], where here k-means searches for a direction in which the data appears non-Gaussian. We must choose the signiﬁcance level of the test, α, which is the desired probability of making a Type I error (i.e. incorrectly rejecting H0 ). It is appropriate to use a Bonferroni adjustment to reduce the chance of making Type I errors over multiple tests. For example, if we want a 0.01 chance of making a Type I error in 100 tests, we should apply a Bonferroni adjustment to make each test use α = 0.01/100 = 0.0001. To ﬁnd k ﬁnal centers the G-means algorithm makes k statistical tests, so the Bonferroni correction does not need to be extreme. In our tests, we always use α = 0.0001. We consider two ways to initialize the two child centers. Both approaches initialize with c ± m, where c is a center and m is chosen. The ﬁrst method chooses m as a random d-dimensional vector such that ||m|| is small compared to the distortion of the data. A second method ﬁnds the main principal component s of the data (having eigenvalue λ), and chooses m = s 2λ/π. This deterministic method places the two centers in their expected locations under H0 . The principal component calculations require O(nd2 + d3 ) time and O(d2 ) space, but since we only want the main principal component, we can use fast methods like the power method, which takes time that is at most linear in the ratio of the two largest eigenvalues [4]. In this paper we use principal-component-based splitting. 2.2 An example Figure 2 shows a run of the G-means algorithm on a synthetic dataset with two true clusters and 1000 points, using α = 0.0001. The critical value for the Anderson-Darling test is 1.8692 for this conﬁdence level. Starting with one center, after one iteration of G-means, we have 2 centers and the A2 statistic is 38.103. This is much larger than the critical value, ∗ so we reject H0 and accept this split. On the next iteration, we split each new center and repeat the statistical test. The A2 values for the two splits are 0.386 and 0.496, both of ∗ which are well below the critical value. Therefore we accept H0 for both tests, and discard these splits. Thus G-means gives a ﬁnal answer of k = 2. 2.3 Statistical power Figure 3 shows the power of the Anderson-Darling test, as compared to the BIC. Lower is better for both plots. We run 1000 tests for each data point plotted for both plots.

Starting with one center (left plot), G-means splits into two centers (middle). The test for normality is signiﬁcant, so G-means rejects H0 and keeps the split. After splitting each center again (right), the test values are not signiﬁcant, so G-means accepts H0 for both tests and does not accept these splits. The middle plot is the G-means answer. See the text for further details. 1 1 G-means X-means 0.8 P(Type II error) P(Type I error) 0.8 G-means X-means 0.6 0.4 0.2 0.6 0.4 0.2 0 0 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 0 30 60 90 120 150 number of datapoints 180 210 Figure 3: A comparison of the power of the Anderson-Darling test versus the BIC.

Both plots show that the BIC overﬁts (splits clusters) when n is small. plot, for each test we generate n datapoints from a single true Gaussian distribution, and then plot the frequency with which BIC and G-means will choose k = 2 rather than k = 1 (i.e. commit a Type I error). BIC tends to overﬁt by choosing too many centers when the data is not strictly spherical, while G-means does not. This is consistent with the tests of real-world data in the next section. While G-means commits more Type II errors when n is small, this prevents it from overﬁtting the data. The BIC can be considered a likelihood ratio test, but with a signiﬁcance level that cannot be ﬁxed. The signiﬁcance level instead varies depending on n and ∆k (the change in the number of model parameters between two models). As n or ∆k decrease, the signiﬁcance level increases (the BIC becomes weaker as a statistical test) [10]. Figure 3 shows this effect for varying n. In [11] the authors show that penalty-based methods require problemspeciﬁc tuning and don’t generalize as well as other methods, such as cross validation. 3 Experiments Table 1 shows the results from running G-means and X-means on many large synthetic. On synthetic datasets with spherically distributed clusters, G-means and X-means do equally Table 1: Results for many synthetic datasets. We report distortion relative to the optimum distortion for the correct clustering (closer to one is better), and time is reported relative to k-means run with the correct k. For BIC, larger values are better, but it is clear that ﬁnding the correct clustering does not always coincide with ﬁnding a larger BIC. Items with a star are where X-means always chose the largest number of centers we allowed. dataset synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 synthetic k=5 synthetic k=20 synthetic k=80 d 2 k found 9.1± 9.9 18.1± 3.2 20.1± 0.6 70.5±11.6 80.0± 0.2 171.7±23.7 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.1 *80.0± 0.0 80.2± 0.5 229.2±36.8 5.0± 0.0 *20.0± 0.0 20.0± 0.0 *80.0± 0.0 80.0± 0.0 171.5±10.9 method G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means G-means X-means 2 2 8 8 8 32 32 32 BIC(×104 ) -0.19±2.70 0.70±0.93 0.21±0.18 14.83±3.50 1.84±0.12 40.16±6.59 -0.74±0.16 -2.28±0.20 -0.18±0.17 14.36±0.21 1.45±0.20 52.28±9.26 -3.36±0.21 -27.92±0.22 -2.73±0.22 -11.13±0.23 -1.10±0.16 11.78±2.74 distortion(× optimal) 0.89± 0.23 0.37± 0.12 0.99± 0.01 9.45±28.02 1.00± 0.01 48.49±70.04 1.00± 0.00 0.47± 0.03 0.99± 0.00 0.47± 0.01 0.99± 0.00 0.57± 0.06 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.00 1.00± 0.00 0.76± 0.01 1.00± 0.00 0.84± 0.01 7 7 6 6 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 time(× k-means) 13.2 2.8 2.1 1.2 2.2 1.8 4.6 11.0 2.6 4.0 2.9 6.5 4.4 29.9 2.3 21.2 2.8 53.3 1 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Figure 4: 2-d synthetic dataset with 5 true clusters. On the left, G-means correctly chooses 5 centers and deals well with non-spherical data. On the right, the BIC causes X-means to overﬁt the data, choosing 20 unevenly distributed clusters. well at ﬁnding the correct k and maximizing the BIC statistic, so we don’t show these results here. Most real-world data is not spherical, however. The synthetic datasets used here each have 5000 datapoints in d = 2/8/32 dimensions. The true ks are 5, 20, and 80. For each synthetic dataset type, we generate 30 datasets with the true center means chosen uniformly randomly from the unit hypercube, and choosing σ so that no two clusters are closer than 3σ apart. Each cluster is also given a transformation to make it non-spherical, by multiplying the data by a randomly chosen scaling and rotation matrix. We run G-means starting with one center. We allow X-means to search between 2 and 4k centers (where here k is the true number of clusters). The G-means algorithm clearly does better at ﬁnding the correct k on non-spherical data. Its results are closer to the true distortions and the correct ks. The BIC statistic that X-means uses has been formulated to maximize the likelihood for spherically-distributed data. Thus it overestimates the number of true clusters in non-spherical data. This is especially evident when the number of points per cluster is small, as in datasets with 80 true clusters. 1 2 2 3 3 4 4 Digit 0 1 Digit 0 5 5 6 6 7 7 8 8 9 9 5 10 15 20 25 30 Cluster 10 20 30 40 50 60 Cluster Figure 5: NIST and Pendigits datasets: correspondence between each digit (row) and each cluster (column) found by G-means. G-means did not have the labels, yet it found meaningful clusters corresponding with the labels. Because of this overestimation, X-means often hits our limit of 4k centers. Figure 4 shows an example of overﬁtting on a dataset with 5 true clusters. X-means chooses k = 20 while G-means ﬁnds all 5 true cluster centers. Also of note is that X-means does not distribute centers evenly among clusters; some clusters receive one center, but others receive many. G-means runs faster than X-means for 8 and 32 dimensions, which we expect, since the kd-tree structures which make X-means fast in low dimensions take time exponential in d, making them slow for more than 8 to 12 dimensions. All our code is written in Matlab; X-means is written in C. 3.1 Discovering true clusters in labeled data We tested these algorithms on two real-world datasets for handwritten digit recognition: the NIST dataset [12] and the Pendigits dataset [2]. The goal is to cluster the data without knowledge of the labels and measure how well the clustering captures the true labels. Both datasets have 10 true classes (digits 0-9). NIST has 60000 training examples and 784 dimensions (28×28 pixels). We use 6000 randomly chosen examples and we reduce the dimension to 50 by random projection (following [3]). The Pendigits dataset has 7984 examples and 16 dimensions; we did not change the data in any way. We cluster each dataset with G-means and X-means, and measure performance by comparing the cluster labels Lc with the true labels Lt . We deﬁne the partition quality (PQ) as kt kc kt 2 2 pq = i=1 j=1 p(i, j) i=1 p(i) where kt is the true number of classes, and kc is the number of clusters found by the algorithm. This metric is maximized when Lc induces the same partition of the data as Lt ; in other words, when all points in each cluster have the same true label, and the estimated k is the true k. The p(i, j) term is the frequency-based probability that a datapoint will be labeled i by Lt and j by Lc . This quality is normalized by the sum of true probabilities, squared. This statistic is related to the Rand statistic for comparing partitions [8]. For the NIST dataset, G-means ﬁnds 31 clusters in 30 seconds with a PQ score of 0.177. X-means ﬁnds 715 clusters in 4149 seconds, and 369 of these clusters contain only one point, indicating an overestimation problem with the BIC. X-means receives a PQ score of 0.024. For the Pendigits dataset, G-means ﬁnds 69 clusters in 30 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.196; X-means ﬁnds 235 clusters in 287 seconds, with a PQ score of 0.057. Figure 5 shows Hinton diagrams of the G-means clusterings of both datasets, showing that G-means succeeds at identifying the true clusters concisely, without aid of the labels. The confusions between different digits in the NIST dataset (seen in the off-diagonal elements) are common for other researchers using more sophisticated techniques, see [3]. 4 Discussion and conclusions We have introduced the new G-means algorithm for learning k based on a statistical test for determining whether datapoints are a random sample from a Gaussian distribution with arbitrary dimension and covariance matrix. The splitting uses dimension reduction and a powerful test for Gaussian ﬁtness. G-means uses this statistical test as a wrapper around k-means to discover the number of clusters automatically. The only parameter supplied to the algorithm is the signiﬁcance level of the statistical test, which can easily be set in a standard way. The G-means algorithm takes linear time and space (plus the cost of the splitting heuristic and test) in the number of datapoints and dimension, since k-means is itself linear in time and space. Empirically, the G-means algorithm works well at ﬁnding the correct number of clusters and the locations of genuine cluster centers, and we have shown it works well in moderately high dimensions. Clustering in high dimensions has been an open problem for many years. Recent research has shown that it may be preferable to use dimensionality reduction techniques before clustering, and then use a low-dimensional clustering algorithm such as k-means, rather than clustering in the high dimension directly. In [3] the author shows that using a simple, inexpensive linear projection preserves many of the properties of data (such as cluster distances), while making it easier to ﬁnd the clusters. Thus there is a need for good-quality, fast clustering algorithms for low-dimensional data. Our work is a step in this direction. Additionally, recent image segmentation algorithms such as normalized cut [16, 13] are based on eigenvector computations on distance matrices. These “spectral” clustering algorithms still use k-means as a post-processing step to ﬁnd the actual segmentation and they require k to be speciﬁed. Thus we expect G-means will be useful in combination with spectral clustering. References [1] Horst Bischof, Aleˇ Leonardis, and Alexander Selb. MDL principle for robust vector quantisation.

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Jean-françcois Paiement, Pascal Vincent, Olivier Delalleau, Nicolas L. Roux, Marie Ouimet</p><p>Abstract: Several unsupervised learning algorithms based on an eigendecomposition provide either an embedding or a clustering only for given training points, with no straightforward extension for out-of-sample examples short of recomputing eigenvectors. This paper provides a uniﬁed framework for extending Local Linear Embedding (LLE), Isomap, Laplacian Eigenmaps, Multi-Dimensional Scaling (for dimensionality reduction) as well as for Spectral Clustering. This framework is based on seeing these algorithms as learning eigenfunctions of a data-dependent kernel. Numerical experiments show that the generalizations performed have a level of error comparable to the variability of the embedding algorithms due to the choice of training data. 1</p><p>4 0.29128709 <a title="71-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Computing_Gaussian_Mixture_Models_with_EM_Using_Equivalence_Constraints.html">47 nips-2003-Computing Gaussian Mixture Models with EM Using Equivalence Constraints</a></p>
<p>Author: Noam Shental, Aharon Bar-hillel, Tomer Hertz, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: Density estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models is a popular generative technique used also for clustering. We develop a framework to incorporate side information in the form of equivalence constraints into the model estimation procedure. Equivalence constraints are deﬁned on pairs of data points, indicating whether the points arise from the same source (positive constraints) or from different sources (negative constraints). Such constraints can be gathered automatically in some learning problems, and are a natural form of supervision in others. For the estimation of model parameters we present a closed form EM procedure which handles positive constraints, and a Generalized EM procedure using a Markov net which handles negative constraints. Using publicly available data sets we demonstrate that such side information can lead to considerable improvement in clustering tasks, and that our algorithm is preferable to two other suggested methods using the same type of side information.</p><p>5 0.29102087 <a title="71-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Applying_Metric-Trees_to_Belief-Point_POMDPs.html">29 nips-2003-Applying Metric-Trees to Belief-Point POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Joelle Pineau, Geoffrey J. Gordon, Sebastian Thrun</p><p>Abstract: Recent developments in grid-based and point-based approximation algorithms for POMDPs have greatly improved the tractability of POMDP planning. These approaches operate on sets of belief points by individually learning a value function for each point. In reality, belief points exist in a highly-structured metric simplex, but current POMDP algorithms do not exploit this property. This paper presents a new metric-tree algorithm which can be used in the context of POMDP planning to sort belief points spatially, and then perform fast value function updates over groups of points. We present results showing that this approach can reduce computation in point-based POMDP algorithms for a wide range of problems. 1</p><p>6 0.28978664 <a title="71-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-An_Iterative_Improvement_Procedure_for_Hierarchical_Clustering.html">24 nips-2003-An Iterative Improvement Procedure for Hierarchical Clustering</a></p>

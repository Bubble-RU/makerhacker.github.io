<p>Author: Vincent Bonin, Valerio Mante, Matteo Carandini</p><p>Abstract: According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate on visual stimuli in a linear fashion. There is ample evidence, however, that LGN responses are not entirely linear. To account for nonlinearities we propose a model that synthesizes more than 30 years of research in the field. Model neurons have a linear receptive field, and a nonlinear, divisive suppressive field. The suppressive field computes local root-meansquare contrast. To test this model we recorded responses from LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. We estimate model parameters from a basic set of measurements and show that the model can accurately predict responses to novel stimuli. The model might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. It specifies how visual processing in LGN involves both linear filtering and divisive gain control. 1 In t rod u ct i on According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate linearly (Cai et al., 1997; Dan et al., 1996). Their response L(t) is the convolution of the map of stimulus contrast S(x,t) with a receptive field F(x,t): L (t ) = [ S∗ F ] ( 0, t ) The receptive field F(x,t) is typically taken to be a difference of Gaussians in space (Rodieck, 1965) and a difference of Gamma functions in time (Cai et al., 1997). This linear model accurately predicts the selectivity of responses for spatiotemporal frequency as measured with gratings (Cai et al., 1997; Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). It also predicts the main features of responses to complex dynamic video sequences (Dan et al., 1996). 150 spikes/s Data Model Figure 1. Response of an LGN neuron to a dynamic video sequence along with the prediction made by the linear model. Stimuli were sequences from Walt Disney’s “Tarzan”. From Mante et al. (2002). The linear model, however, suffers from limitations. For example, consider the response of an LGN neuron to a complex dynamic video sequences (Figure 1). The response is characterized by long periods of relative silence interspersed with brief events of high firing rate (Figure 1, thick traces). The linear model (Figure 1, thin traces) successfully predicts the timing of these firing events but fails to account for their magnitude (Mante et al., 2002). The limitations of the linear model are not surprising since there is ample evidence that LGN responses are nonlinear. For instance, responses to drifting gratings saturate as contrast is increased (Sclar et al., 1990) and are reduced, or masked, by superposition of a second grating (Bonin et al., 2002). Moreover, responses are selective for stimulus size (Cleland et al., 1983; Hubel and Wiesel, 1961; Jones and Sillito, 1991) in a nonlinear manner (Solomon et al., 2002). We propose that these and other nonlinearities can be explained by a nonlinear model incorporating a nonlinear suppressive field. The qualitative notion of a suppressive field was proposed three decades ago by Levick and collaborators (1972). We propose that the suppressive field computes local root-mean-square contrast, and operates divisively on the receptive field output. Basic elements of this model appeared in studies of contrast gain control in retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978) and in primary visual cortex (Cavanaugh et al., 2002; Heeger, 1992; Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). Some of these notions have been applied to LGN (Solomon et al., 2002), to fit responses to a limited set of stimuli with tailored parameter sets. Here we show that a single model with fixed parameters predicts responses to a broad range of stimuli. 2 Mod el In the model (Figure 2), the linear response of the receptive field L(t) is divided by the output of the suppressive field. The latter is a measure of local root-mean-square contrast c local. The result of the division is a generator potential V (t ) = Vmax L (t ) c50 + clocal , where c 50 is a constant.

The suppressive field operates on a filtered version of the stimulus, S*=S*H, where H is a linear filter and * denotes convolution. The squared output of the suppressive field is the local mean square (the local variance) of the filtered stimulus: clocal = S ( x, t ) G ( x ) dx dt , 2 * 2 ∫∫ where G(x) is a 2-dimensional Gaussian. Firing rate is a rectified version of generator potential, with threshold V thresh:   R(t ) = V (t ) − Vthresh + .   To test the nonlinear model, we recorded responses from neurons in the LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. Methods for these recordings were described elsewhere (Freeman et al., 2002). 3 Resu l t s We proceed in two steps: first we estimate model parameters by fitting the model to a large set of canonical data; second we fix model parameters and evaluate the model by predicting responses to a novel set of stimuli.

These stimuli elicit approximately constant output in the suppressive field, so they allow us to characterize the receptive field. Responses to different spatial frequencies constrain F(x,t) in space (Figure 3A). Responses to different temporal frequencies constrain F(x,t) in time (Figure 3B). 3.2 C h a r a c te r i z i n g t he s u p p r e s s i v e f i e l d To characterize the divisive stage, we start by measuring how responses saturate at high contrast (Figure 4A). A linear model cannot account for this contrast saturation (Figure 4A, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4A, solid curve) captures saturation because increases in receptive field output are attenuated by increases in suppressive field output. At low contrast, no saturation is observed because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50. From these data we estimate the value of c50. To obtain the parameters of the suppressive field, we recorded responses to sums of two drifting gratings (Figure 4B-D): an optimal test grating at 50% contrast, which elicits a large baseline response, and a mask grating that modulates this response. Test and mask temporal frequencies are incommensurate so that they temporally label a test response (at the frequency of the test) and a mask response (at the frequency of the mask) (Bonds, 1989). We vary mask attributes and study how they affect the test responses. Increasing mask contrast progressively suppresses responses (Figure 4B). The linear model fails to account for this suppression (Figure 4B, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4B, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask contrast increases the suppressive field output while the receptive field output (at the temporal frequency of the test) remains constant. With masks of low contrast there is little suppression because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50 . Similar effects are seen if we increase mask diameter. Responses decrease until they reach a plateau (Figure 4C). A linear model predicts no decrease (Figure 4C, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4C, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask diameter increases the suppressive field output while it does not affect the receptive field output. A plateau is reached once masks extend beyond the suppressive field. From these data we estimate the size of the Gaussian envelope G(x) of the suppressive field. Finally, the strength of suppression depends on mask spatial frequency (Figure 4D). At high frequencies, no suppression is elicited. Reducing spatial frequency increases suppression. This dependence of suppression on spatial frequency is captured in the nonlinear model by the filter H(x,t). From these data we estimate the spatial characteristics of the filter. From similar experiments involving different temporal frequencies (not shown), we estimate the filter’s selectivity for temporal frequency. 3.3 P r e d i c ti n g r e s p o n s e s t o n o v e l s ti m u l i We have seen that with a fixed set of parameters the model provides a good fit to a large set of measurements (Figure 3 and Figure 4). We now test whether the model predicts responses to a set of novel stimuli: drifting gratings varying in contrast and diameter. Responses to high contrast stimuli exhibit size tuning (Figure 5A, squares): they grow with size for small diameters, reach a maximum value at intermediate diameter and are reduced for large diameters (Jones and Sillito, 1991). Size tuning , however, strongly depends on stimulus contrast (Solomon et al., 2002): no size tuning is observed at low contrast (Figure 5A, circles). The model predicts these effects (Figure 5A, curves). For large, high contrast stimuli the output of the suppressive field is dominated by c local, resulting in suppression of responses. At low contrast, c local is much smaller than c50, and the suppressive field does not affect responses. Similar considerations can be made by plotting these data as a function of contrast (Figure 5B). As predicted by the nonlinear model (Figure 5B, curves), the effect of increasing contrast depends on stimulus size: responses to large stimuli show strong saturation (Figure 5B, squares), whereas responses to small stimuli grow linearly (Figure 5B, circles). The model predicts these effects because only large, high contrast stimuli elicit large enough responses from the suppressive field to cause suppression. For small, low contrast stimuli, instead, the linear model is a good approximation.

Curves show model predictions based on parameters as estimated in previous figures, not fitted to these data. A: Responses as function of diameter for different contrasts. B: Responses as function of contrast for different diameters. 3.4 M o d e l pe r f or m a nc e To assess model performance across neurons we calculate the percentage of variance in the data that is explained by the model (see Freeman et al., 2002 for methods). The model provides good fits to the data used to characterize the suppressive field (Figure 4), explaining more than 90% of the variance in the data for 9/13 cells (Figure 6A). Model parameters are then held fixed, and the model is used to predict responses to gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). The model performs well, explaining in 10/13 neurons above 90% of the variance in these novel data (Figure 6B, shaded histogram). The agreement between the quality of the fits and the quality of the predictions suggests that model parameters are well constrained and rules out a role of overfitting in determining the quality of the fits. To further confirm the performance of the model, in an additional 54 cells we ran a subset of the whole protocol, involving only the experiment for characterizing the receptive field (Figure 3), and the experiment involving gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). For these cells we estimate the suppressive field by fitting the model directly to the latter measurements. The model explains above 90% of the variance in these data in 20/54 neurons and more than 70% in 39/54 neurons (Figure 6B, white histogram). Considering the large size of the data set (more than 100 stimuli, requiring several hours of recordings per neuron) and the small number of free parameters (only 6 for the purpose of this work), the overall, quality of the model predictions is remarkable.

White histogram shows quality of fits. 4 Co n cl u si o n s The nonlinear model provides a unified description of visual processing in LGN neurons. Based on a fixed set of parameters, it can predict both linear properties (Figure 3), as well as nonlinear properties such as contrast saturation (Figure 4A) and masking (Figure 4B-D). Moreover, once the parameters are fixed, it predicts responses to novel stimuli (Figure 5). The model explains why responses are tuned for stimulus size at high contrast but not at low contrast, and it correctly predicts that only responses to large stimuli saturate with contrast, while responses to small stimuli grow linearly. The model implements a form of contrast gain control. A possible purpose for this gain control is to increase the range of contrast that can be transmitted given the limited dynamic range of single neurons. Divisive gain control may also play a role in population coding: a similar model applied to responses of primary visual cortex was shown to maximize independence of the responses across neurons (Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). We are working towards improving the model in two ways. First, we are characterizing the dynamics of the suppressive field, e.g. to predict how it responds to transient stimuli. Second, we are testing the assumption that the suppressive field computes root-mean-square contrast, a measure that solely depends on the secondorder moments of the light distribution. Our ultimate goal is to predict responses to complex stimuli such as those shown in Figure 1 and quantify to what degree the nonlinear model improves on the predictions of the linear model. Determining the role of visual nonlinearities under more natural stimulation conditions is also critical to understanding their function. The nonlinear model synthesizes more than 30 years of research. It is robust, tractable and generalizes to arbitrary stimuli. As a result it might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. Because the nonlinearities we discussed are already present in the retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978), and tend to get stronger as one ascends the visual hierarchy (Sclar et al., 1990), it may also be used to study how responses take shape from one stage to another in the visual system.

<p>Author: Liam Paninski, Eero P. Simoncelli, Jonathan W. Pillow</p><p>Abstract: Recent work has examined the estimation of models of stimulus-driven neural activity in which some linear ﬁltering process is followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spiking stage. We analyze the estimation of one such model for which this nonlinear step is implemented by a noisy, leaky, integrate-and-ﬁre mechanism with a spike-dependent aftercurrent. This model is a biophysically plausible alternative to models with Poisson (memory-less) spiking, and has been shown to effectively reproduce various spiking statistics of neurons in vivo. However, the problem of estimating the model from extracellular spike train data has not been examined in depth. We formulate the problem in terms of maximum likelihood estimation, and show that the computational problem of maximizing the likelihood is tractable. Our main contribution is an algorithm and a proof that this algorithm is guaranteed to ﬁnd the global optimum with reasonable speed. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our estimator with numerical simulations. A central issue in computational neuroscience is the characterization of the functional relationship between sensory stimuli and neural spike trains. A common model for this relationship consists of linear ﬁltering of the stimulus, followed by a nonlinear, probabilistic spike generation process. The linear ﬁlter is typically interpreted as the neuron’s “receptive ﬁeld,” while the spiking mechanism accounts for simple nonlinearities like rectiﬁcation and response saturation. Given a set of stimuli and (extracellularly) recorded spike times, the characterization problem consists of estimating both the linear ﬁlter and the parameters governing the spiking mechanism. One widely used model of this type is the Linear-Nonlinear-Poisson (LNP) cascade model, in which spikes are generated according to an inhomogeneous Poisson process, with rate determined by an instantaneous (“memoryless”) nonlinear function of the ﬁltered input. This model has a number of desirable features, including conceptual simplicity and computational tractability. Additionally, reverse correlation analysis provides a simple unbiased estimator for the linear ﬁlter [5], and the properties of estimators (for both the linear ﬁlter and static nonlinearity) have been thoroughly analyzed, even for the case of highly non-symmetric or “naturalistic” stimuli [12]. One important drawback of the LNP model, * JWP and LP contributed equally to this work. We thank E.J. Chichilnisky for helpful discussions.

In particular, the probability of observing a spike is not a functional of the stimulus only; it is also strongly affected by the recent history of spiking. The leaky integrate-and-ﬁre (LIF) model provides a biophysically more realistic spike mechanism with a simple form of spike-history dependence. This model is simple, wellunderstood, and has dynamics that are entirely linear except for a nonlinear “reset” of the membrane potential following a spike. Although this model’s overriding linearity is often emphasized (due to the approximately linear relationship between input current and ﬁring rate, and lack of active conductances), the nonlinear reset has signiﬁcant functional importance for the model’s response properties. In previous work, we have shown that standard reverse correlation analysis fails when applied to a neuron with deterministic (noise-free) LIF spike generation; we developed a new estimator for this model, and demonstrated that a change in leakiness of such a mechanism might underlie nonlinear effects of contrast adaptation in macaque retinal ganglion cells [15]. We and others have explored other “adaptive” properties of the LIF model [17, 13, 19]. In this paper, we consider a model consisting of a linear ﬁlter followed by noisy LIF spike generation with a spike-dependent after-current; this is essentially the standard LIF model driven by a noisy, ﬁltered version of the stimulus, with an additional current waveform injected following each spike. We will refer to this as the the “L-NLIF” model. The probabilistic nature of this model provides several important advantages over the deterministic version we have considered previously. First, an explicit noise model allows us to couch the problem in the terms of classical estimation theory. This, in turn, provides a natural “cost function” (likelihood) for model assessment and leads to more efﬁcient estimation of the model parameters. Second, noise allows us to explicitly model neural ﬁring statistics, and could provide a rigorous basis for a metric distance between spike trains, useful in other contexts [18]. Finally, noise inﬂuences the behavior of the model itself, giving rise to phenomena not observed in the purely deterministic model [11]. Our main contribution here is to show that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for the L-NLIF model is computationally tractable. Speciﬁcally, we describe an algorithm for computing the likelihood function, and prove that this likelihood function contains no non-global maxima, implying that the MLE can be computed efﬁciently using standard ascent techniques. The desirable statistical properties of this estimator (e.g. consistency, efﬁciency) are all inherited “for free” from classical estimation theory. Thus, we have a compact and powerful model for the neural code, and a well-motivated, efﬁcient way to estimate the parameters of this model from extracellular data. The Model We consider a model for which the (dimensionless) subthreshold voltage variable V evolves according to i−1 dV = − gV (t) + k · x(t) + j=0 h(t − tj ) dt + σNt , (1) and resets to Vr whenever V = 1. Here, g denotes the leak conductance, k · x(t) the projection of the input signal x(t) onto the linear kernel k, h is an “afterpotential,” a current waveform of ﬁxed amplitude and shape whose value depends only on the time since the last spike ti−1 , and Nt is an unobserved (hidden) noise process with scale parameter σ. Without loss of generality, the “leak” and “threshold” potential are set at 0 and 1, respectively, so the cell spikes whenever V = 1, and V decays back to 0 with time constant 1/g in the absence of input. Note that the nonlinear behavior of the model is completely determined by only a few parameters, namely {g, σ, Vr }, and h (where the function h is allowed to take values in some low-dimensional vector space). The dynamical properties of this type of “spike response model” have been extensively studied [7]; for example, it is known that this class of models can effectively capture much of the behavior of apparently more biophysically realistic models (e.g. Hodgkin-Huxley). Figures 1 and 2 show several simple comparisons of the L-NLIF and LNP models. In 1, note the ﬁne structure of spike timing in the responses of the L-NLIF model, which is qualitatively similar to in vivo experimental observations [2, 16, 9]). The LNP model fails to capture this ﬁne temporal reproducibility. At the same time, the L-NLIF model is much more ﬂexible and representationally powerful, as demonstrated in Fig. 2: by varying V r or h, for example, we can match a wide variety of dynamical behaviors (e.g. adaptation, bursting, bistability) known to exist in biological neurons. The Estimation Problem Our problem now is to estimate the model parameters {k, σ, g, Vr , h} from a sufﬁciently rich, dynamic input sequence x(t) together with spike times {ti }. A natural choice is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE), which is easily proven to be consistent and statistically efﬁcient here. To compute the MLE, we need to compute the likelihood and develop an algorithm for maximizing it. The tractability of the likelihood function for this model arises directly from the linearity of the subthreshold dynamics of voltage V (t) during an interspike interval. In the noiseless case [15], the voltage trace during an interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ] is given by the solution to equation (1) with σ = 0:   V0 (t) = Vr e−gt + t ti−1 i−1 k · x(s) + j=0 h(s − tj ) e−g(t−s) ds, (2) A stimulus h current responses 0 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 2. 0 t stimulus x 0 B c responses c=1 h current 0 c=2 2. 0 c=5 1 )ces( t t 0 0 stimulus C 0 h current responses Figure 2: Illustration of diverse behaviors of L-NLIF model. A: Firing rate adaptation. A positive DC current (top) was injected into three model cells differing only in their h currents (shown on left: top, h = 0; middle, h depolarizing; bottom, h hyperpolarizing). Voltage traces of each cell’s response (right, with spikes superimposed) exhibit rate facilitation for depolarizing h (middle), and rate adaptation for hyperpolarizing h (bottom). B: Bursting. The response of a model cell with a biphasic h current (left) is shown as a function of the three different levels of DC current. For small current levels (top), the cell responds rhythmically. For larger currents (middle and bottom), the cell responds with regular bursts of spikes. C: Bistability. The stimulus (top) is a positive followed by a negative current pulse. Although a cell with no h current (middle) responds transiently to the positive pulse, a cell with biphasic h (bottom) exhibits a bistable response: the positive pulse puts it into a stable ﬁring regime which persists until the arrival of a negative pulse. 0 0 1 )ces( t 0 5 0. t 0 which is simply a linear convolution of the input current with a negative exponential. It is easy to see that adding Gaussian noise to the voltage during each time step induces a Gaussian density over V (t), since linear dynamics preserve Gaussianity [8]. This density is uniquely characterized by its ﬁrst two moments; the mean is given by (2), and its covariance T is σ 2 Eg Eg , where Eg is the convolution operator corresponding to e−gt . Note that this density is highly correlated for nearby points in time, since noise is integrated by the linear dynamics. Intuitively, smaller leak conductance g leads to stronger correlation in V (t) at nearby time points. We denote this Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), where index i indicates the ith spike and the corresponding stimulus chunk xi (i.e. the stimuli that inﬂuence V (t) during the ith interspike interval). Now, on any interspike interval t ∈ [ti−1 , ti ], the only information we have is that V (t) is less than threshold for all times before ti , and exceeds threshold during the time bin containing ti . This translates to a set of linear constraints on V (t), expressed in terms of the set Ci = ti−1 ≤t < 1 ∩ V (ti ) ≥ 1 . Therefore, the likelihood that the neuron ﬁrst spikes at time ti , given a spike at time ti−1 , is the probability of the event V (t) ∈ Ci , which is given by Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), Ci the integral of the Gaussian density G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h) over the set Ci . sulumits Figure 3: Behavior of the L-NLIF model during a single interspike interval, for a single (repeated) input current (top).

This “renewal” property, in turn, implies that the density over V (t) for an entire experiment factorizes into a product of conditionally independent terms, where each of these terms is one of the Gaussian integrals derived above for a single interspike interval. The likelihood for the entire spike train is therefore the product of these terms over all observed spikes. Putting all the pieces together, then, the full likelihood is L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) = G(xi , k, σ, g, Vr , h), i Ci where the product, again, is over all observed spike times {ti } and corresponding stimulus chunks {xi }. Now that we have an expression for the likelihood, we need to be able to maximize it. Our main result now states, basically, that we can use simple ascent algorithms to compute the MLE without getting stuck in local maxima. Theorem 1. The likelihood L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) has no non-global extrema in the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), for any data {xi , ti }. The proof [14] is based on the log-concavity of L{xi ,ti } (k, σ, g, Vr , h) under a certain parametrization of (k, σ, g, Vr , h). The classical approach for establishing the nonexistence of non-global maxima of a given function uses concavity, which corresponds roughly to the function having everywhere non-positive second derivatives. However, the basic idea can be extended with the use of any invertible function: if f has no non-global extrema, neither will g(f ), for any strictly increasing real function g. The logarithm is a natural choice for g in any probabilistic context in which independence plays a role, since sums are easier to work with than products. Moreover, concavity of a function f is strictly stronger than logconcavity, so logconcavity can be a powerful tool even in situations for which concavity is useless (the Gaussian density is logconcave but not concave, for example). Our proof relies on a particular theorem [3] establishing the logconcavity of integrals of logconcave functions, and proceeds by making a correspondence between this type of integral and the integrals that appear in the deﬁnition of the L-NLIF likelihood above. We should also note that the proof extends without difﬁculty to some other noise processes which generate logconcave densities (where white noise has the standard Gaussian density); for example, the proof is nearly identical if Nt is allowed to be colored or nonGaussian noise, with possibly nonzero drift. Computational methods and numerical results Theorem 1 tells us that we can ascend the likelihood surface without fear of getting stuck in local maxima. Now how do we actually compute the likelihood? This is a nontrivial problem: we need to be able to quickly compute (or at least approximate, in a rational way) integrals of multivariate Gaussian densities G over simple but high-dimensional orthants Ci . We discuss two ways to compute these integrals; each has its own advantages. The ﬁrst technique can be termed “density evolution” [10, 13]. The method is based on the following well-known fact from the theory of stochastic differential equations [8]: given the data (xi , ti−1 ), the probability density of the voltage process V (t) up to the next spike ti satisﬁes the following partial differential (Fokker-Planck) equation: ∂P (V, t) σ2 ∂ 2 P ∂[(V − Veq (t))P ] = , +g 2 ∂t 2 ∂V ∂V under the boundary conditions (3) P (V, ti−1 ) = δ(V − Vr ), P (Vth , t) = 0; where Veq (t) is the instantaneous equilibrium potential:   i−1 1 Veq (t) = h(t − tj ) . k · x(t) + g j=0 Moreover, the conditional ﬁring rate f (t) satisﬁes t ti−1 f (s)ds = 1 − P (V, t)dV. Thus standard techniques for solving the drift-diffusion evolution equation (3) lead to a fast method for computing f (t) (as illustrated in Fig. 2). Finally, the likelihood Lxi ,ti (k, σ, g, Vr , h) is simply f (ti ). While elegant and efﬁcient, this density evolution technique turns out to be slightly more powerful than what we need for the MLE: recall that we do not need to compute the conditional rate function f at all times t, but rather just at the set of spike times {ti }, and thus we can turn to more specialized techniques for faster performance. We employ a rapid technique for computing the likelihood using an algorithm due to Genz [6], designed to compute exactly the kinds of multidimensional Gaussian probability integrals considered here. This algorithm works well when the orthants Ci are deﬁned by fewer than ≈ 10 linear constraints on V (t). The number of actual constraints on V (t) during an interspike interval (ti+1 − ti ) grows linearly in the length of the interval: thus, to use this algorithm in typical data situations, we adopt a strategy proposed in our work on the deterministic form of the model [15], in which we discard all but a small subset of the constraints. The key point is that, due to strong correlations in the noise and the fact that the constraints only ﬁgure signiﬁcantly when the V (t) is driven close to threshold, a small number of constraints often sufﬁce to approximate the true likelihood to a high degree of precision. h mitse h eurt K mitse ATS K eurt 0 0 06 )ekips retfa cesm( t 03 0 0 )ekips erofeb cesm( t 001- 002- Figure 4: Demonstration of the estimator’s performance on simulated data. Dashed lines show the true kernel k and aftercurrent h; k is a 12-sample function chosen to resemble the biphasic temporal impulse response of a macaque retinal ganglion cell, while h is function speciﬁed in a ﬁve-dimensional vector space, whose shape induces a slight degree of burstiness in the model’s spike responses. The L-NLIF model was stimulated with parameters g = 0.05 (corresponding to a membrane time constant of 20 time-samples), σ noise = 0.5, and Vr = 0. The stimulus was 30,000 time samples of white Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.5. With only 600 spikes of output, the estimator is able to retrieve an estimate of k (gray curve) which closely matches the true kernel. Note that the spike-triggered average (black curve), which is an unbiased estimator for the kernel of an LNP neuron [5], differs signiﬁcantly from this true kernel (see also [15]). The accuracy of this approach improves with the number of constraints considered, but performance is fastest with fewer constraints. Therefore, because ascending the likelihood function requires evaluating the likelihood at many different points, we can make this ascent process much quicker by applying a version of the coarse-to-ﬁne idea. Let L k denote the approximation to the likelihood given by allowing only k constraints in the above algorithm. Then we know, by a proof identical to that of Theorem 1, that Lk has no local maxima; in addition, by the above logic, Lk → L as k grows. It takes little additional effort to prove that argmax Lk → argmax L; thus, we can efﬁciently ascend the true likelihood surface by ascending the “coarse” approximants Lk , then gradually “reﬁning” our approximation by letting k increase. An application of this algorithm to simulated data is shown in Fig. 4. Further applications to both simulated and real data will be presented elsewhere. Discussion We have shown here that the L-NLIF model, which couples a linear ﬁltering stage to a biophysically plausible and ﬂexible model of neuronal spiking, can be efﬁciently estimated from extracellular physiological data using maximum likelihood. Moreover, this model lends itself directly to analysis via tools from the modern theory of point processes. For example, once we have obtained our estimate of the parameters (k, σ, g, Vr , h), how do we verify that the resulting model provides an adequate description of the data? This important “model validation” question has been the focus of some recent elegant research, under the rubric of “time rescaling” techniques [4]. While we lack the room here to review these methods in detail, we can note that they depend essentially on knowledge of the conditional ﬁring rate function f (t). Recall that we showed how to efﬁciently compute this function in the last section and examined some of its qualitative properties in the L-NLIF context in Figs. 2 and 3. We are currently in the process of applying the model to physiological data recorded both in vivo and in vitro, in order to assess whether it accurately accounts for the stimulus preferences and spiking statistics of real neurons. One long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the different roles of stimulus-driven and stimulus-independent activity on the spiking patterns of both single cells and multineuronal ensembles.

<p>Author: Yuval Aviel, David Horn, Moshe Abeles</p><p>Abstract: A balanced network leads to contradictory constraints on memory models, as exemplified in previous work on accommodation of synfire chains. Here we show that these constraints can be overcome by introducing a 'shadow' inhibitory pattern for each excitatory pattern of the model. This is interpreted as a doublebalance principle, whereby there exists both global balance between average excitatory and inhibitory currents and local balance between the currents carrying coherent activity at any given time frame. This principle can be applied to networks with Hebbian cell assemblies, leading to a high capacity of the associative memory. The number of possible patterns is limited by a combinatorial constraint that turns out to be P=0.06N within the specific model that we employ. This limit is reached by the Hebbian cell assembly network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such high memory capacities are demonstrated in the asynchronous state of models of spiking neurons. 1 In trod u ction Numerous studies analyze the different phases of unstructured networks of spiking neurons [1, 2]. These networks with random connectivity possess a phase of asynchronous activity, the asynchronous state (AS), which is the most interesting one from the biological perspective, since it is similar to physiological data. Unstructured networks, however, do not hold information in their connectivity matrix, and therefore do not store memories. Binary networks with ordered connectivity matrices, or structured networks, and their ability to store and retrieve memories, have been extensively studied in the past [3-8]. Applicability of these results to biologically plausible neuronal models is questionable. In particular, models of spiking neurons are known to have modes of synchronous global oscillations. Avoiding such modes, and staying in an AS, is a major constraint on networks of spiking neurons that is absent in most binary neural networks. As we will show below, it is this constraint that imposes a limit on capacity in our model. Existing associative memory models of spiking neurons have not strived for maximal pattern capacity [3, 4, 8]. Here, using an integrate-and-fire model, we embed structured synaptic connections in an otherwise unstructured network and study the capacity limit of the system. The system is therefore macroscopically unstructured, but microscopically structured. The unstructured network model is based on Brunel's [1] balanced network of integrate-and-fire neurons. In his model, the network possesses different phases, one of which is the AS. We replace his unstructured excitatory connectivity by a semistructured one, including a super-position of either synfire chains or Hebbian cell assemblies. The existence of a stable AS is a fundamental prerequisite of the system. There are two reasons for that: First, physiological measurements of cortical tissues reveal an irregular neuronal activity and an asynchronous population activity. These findings match the properties of the AS. Second, in term of information content, the entropy of the system is the highest when firing probability is uniformly distributed, as in an AS. In general, embedding one or two patterns will not destabilize the AS. Increasing the number of embedded patterns, however, will eventually destabilize the AS, leading to global oscillations. In previous work [9], we have demonstrated that the cause of AS instability is correlations between neurons that result from the presence of structure in the network. The patterns, be it Hebbian cell assemblies (HCA) or pools occurring in synfire chains (SFC), have an important characteristic: neurons that are members of the same pattern (or pool) share a large portion of their inputs. This common input correlates neuronal activities both when a pattern is activated and when both neurons are influenced by random activity. If too many patterns are embedded in the network, too many neurons become correlated due to common inputs, leading to globally synchronized deviations from mean activity. A qualitative understanding of this state of affairs is provided by a simple model of a threshold linear pair of neurons that receive n excitatory common, and correlated, inputs, and K-n excitatory, as well as K inhibitory, non-common uncorrelated inputs. Thinking of these neurons as belonging to a pattern or a pool within a network, we can obtain an interesting self-consistent result by assuming the correlation of the pair of neurons to be also the correlation in their common correlated input (as is likely to be the case in a network loaded with HCA or SFC). We find then [9] that there exists a critical pattern size, n c , below which correlations decay but above which correlations are amplified. Furthermore, the following scaling was found to exist (1) nc = rc K . Implications of this model for the whole network are that: (i) rc is independent of N, the size of the network, (ii) below nc the AS is stable, and (iii) above nc the AS is unstable. Using extensive computer simulations we were able [9] to validate all these predictions. In addition, keeping n  nmin, by the requirement that n excitatory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), on average, drive a neuron across its threshold. Since N>K and typically N>>K, together with Eq. (1) it follows that N >> (n min / rc ) . Hence rc and nmin set the lower bound of the network's size, 2 above which it is possible to embed a reasonable number of patterns in the network without losing the AS. In this paper we propose a solution that enables small n min and large r values, which in turn enables embedding a large number of patterns in much smaller networks. This is made possible by the doubly-balanced construction to be outlined below. 2 The double-balance principle Counteracting the excitatory correlations with inhibitory ones is the principle that will allow us to solve the problem. Since we deal with balanced networks, in which the mean excitatory input is balanced by an inhibitory one, we note that this principle imposes a second type of balancing condition, hence we refer to it as the double- balance principle. In the following, we apply this principle by introducing synaptic connections between any excitatory pattern and its randomly chosen inhibitory pattern. These inhibitory patterns, which we call shadow patterns, are activated after the excitatory patterns fire, but have no special in-pattern connectivity or structured projections onto other patterns. The premise is that correlations evolved in the excitatory patterns will elicit correlated inhibitory activity, thus balancing the network's average correlation level. The size of the shadow pattern has to be small enough, so that the global network activity will not be quenched, yet large enough, so that the excitatory correlation will be counteracted. A balanced network that is embedded with patterns and their shadow patterns will be referred to as a doubly balanced network (DBN), to be contrasted with the singly balanced network (SBN) where shadow patterns are absent. 3 3.1 Application of the double balance principle. The Network We model neuronal activity with the Integrate and Fire [10] model. All neurons have the same parameters: τ = 10ms , τ ref = 2.5ms , C=250pF. PSPs are modeled by a delta function with fixed delay. The number of synapses on a neuron is fixed and set to KE excitatory synapses from the local network, KE excitatory synapses from external sources and KI inhibitory synapses from the local network. See Aviel et al [9] for details. All synapses of each group will be given fixed values. It is allowed for one pre-synaptic neuron to make more than one connection to one postsynaptic neuron. The network possesses NE excitatory neurons and N I ≡ γN E inhibitory neurons. Connectivity is sparse, ε = 0.1 ). K E N E = K I N I = ε , (we use A Poisson process with rate vext=10Hz models the external source. If a neuron of population y innervates a neuron of population x its synaptic strength J xy is defined as J xE ≡ J 0 K E , J xI ≡ − gJ 0 with J0=10, and g=5. Note that J xI = − g γ KI J xE , hence g γ controls the balance between the two populations. Within an HCA pattern the neurons have high connection probability with one another. Here it is achieved by requiring L of the synapses of a neuron in the excitatory pattern to originate from within the pattern. Similarly, a neuron in the inhibitory shadow pattern dedicates L of its synapses to the associated excitatory pattern. In a SFC, each neuron in an excitatory pool is fed by L neurons from the previous pool. This forms a feed forward connectivity. In addition, when shadow pools are present, each neuron in a shadow pool is fed by L neurons from its associated excitatory pool. In both cases L = C L K E , with CL=2.5. The size of the excitatory patterns (i.e. the number of neurons participating in a pattern) or pools, nE, is also chosen to be proportional to K E (see Aviel et al. 2003 [9]), nE ≡ Cn K E , where Cn varies. This is a suitable choice, because of the behavior of the critical nc of Eq. (1), and is needed for the meaningful memory activity (of the HCA or SFC) to overcome synaptic noise. ~ The size of a shadow pattern is defined as nI ≡ d nE . This leads to the factor d, representing the relative strength of inhibitory and excitatory currents, due to a pattern or pool, affecting a neuron that is connected to both: d≡ (2) Thus it fixes nI = d − J xI nI J xE nE = gJ 0 K E d gd . = J0 K I γ ( )n . In the simulations reported below d varied between 1 γ g E and 3. Wiring the network is done in two stages, first all excitatory patterns are wired, and then random connections are added, complying with the fixed number of synapses. A volley of w spikes, normally distributed over time with width of 1ms, is used to ignite a memory pattern. In the case of SFC, the first pool is ignited, and under the right conditions the volley propagates along the chain without fading away and without destabilizing the AS. 3.2 Results First we show that the AS remains stable when embedding HCAs in a small DBN, whereas global oscillations take place if embedding is done without shadow pools. Figure 1 displays clearly the sustained activity of an HCA in the DBN. The same principle also enables embedding of SFCs in a small network. This is to be contrasted with the conclusions drawn in Aviel et al [9], where it was shown that otherwise very large networks are necessary to reach this goal. Figure 1: HCAs are embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. P=300 HCAs of size nE=194 excitatory neurons were embedded in a network of NE=15,000 excitatory neurons. The eleventh pattern is externally ignited at time t=100ms. A raster plot of 200ms is displayed. Without shadow patterns the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow patterns the network exhibits only minute oscillations, enabling the activity of the ignited pattern to be sustained. The size of the shadow patterns is set according to Eq. (2) with d=1. Neurons that participate in more than one HCA may appear more than once on the raster plot, whose y-axis is ordered according to HCAs, and represents every second neuron in each pattern. Figure 2: SFCs embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. The first pool is externally ignited at time t=100ms. d=0.5. The rest of the parameters are as in Figure 1. Here again, without shadow pools, the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow pools it has only minute oscillation, enabling a stable propagation of the synfire wave. 3.3 Maximum Capacity In this section we show that, within our DBN, it is the fixed number of synapses (rather than dynamical constraints) that dictates the maximal number of patterns or pools P that may be loaded onto the network. Let us start by noting that a neuron of population x (E or I) can participate in at most m ≡ K E L  patterns, hence N x m sets an upper bound on the number of neurons that participate in all patterns: P n x P ≤ m ⋅ N x . Next, defining α x ≡ , we find that Nx αx ≤ (3) m nx =  K E CL K E    nx To leading order in NE this turns into  K E CL K E   N = C C D −1 N − O αxNx =  n L x E E D C K (4) x n E ( ) ( NE ) (g γ ) if x=I, or 1 for x=E. where Dx ≡ d Thus we conclude that synaptic combinatorial considerations lead to a maximal number of patterns P. If DI<1, including the case DI=0 of the SBN, the excitatory neurons determine the limit to be P = (C n C L ) N E . If, as is the case in our DBN, −1 DI>1, then ( γα I < α E P = C n C L DI ) −1 and the inhibitory neurons set the maximum value to NE . For example, setting Cn=3.5, CL=2.4, g=3 and d=3, in Eq. (4), we get P=0.06NE. In Figure 3 we use these parameters. The capacity of a DBN is compared to that of an SBN for different network sizes. The maximal load is defined by the presence of global oscillation strong enough to prohibit sustained activity of patterns. The DBN reaches the combinatorial limit, whereas the SBN does not increase with N and obviously does not reach its combinatorial limit. 1400 1200 Pmax 1000 DBN SBN DBN Upper Limit SBN Upper Limit 800 600 400 200 0 0 5000 10000 NE 15000 Figure 3: A balanced network maximally loaded with HCAs.

<p>Author: Yoichi Miyawaki, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes neural mechanisms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS can stimulate the brain non-invasively through a brief magnetic pulse delivered by a coil placed on the scalp, interfering with speciﬁc cortical functions with a high temporal resolution. Due to these advantages, TMS has been a popular experimental tool in various neuroscience ﬁelds. However, the neural mechanisms underlying TMSinduced interference are still unknown; a theoretical basis for TMS has not been developed. This paper provides computational evidence that inhibitory interactions in a neural population, not an isolated single neuron, play a critical role in yielding the neural interference induced by TMS.</p><p>2 0.73524487 <a title="127-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-Circuit_Optimization_Predicts_Dynamic_Networks_for_Chemosensory_Orientation_in_Nematode_C._elegans.html">45 nips-2003-Circuit Optimization Predicts Dynamic Networks for Chemosensory Orientation in Nematode C. elegans</a></p>

Here, we used an optimization algorithm to search for patterns of connectivity sufﬁcient to compute the sensorimotor transformation underlying C. elegans chemotaxis, a simple form of spatial orientation behavior in which turning probability is modulated by the rate of change of chemical concentration. Optimization produced differentiator networks with inhibitory feedback among all neurons. Further analysis showed that feedback regulates the latency between sensory input and behavior.

<p>Author: Yuval Aviel, David Horn, Moshe Abeles</p><p>Abstract: A balanced network leads to contradictory constraints on memory models, as exemplified in previous work on accommodation of synfire chains. Here we show that these constraints can be overcome by introducing a 'shadow' inhibitory pattern for each excitatory pattern of the model. This is interpreted as a doublebalance principle, whereby there exists both global balance between average excitatory and inhibitory currents and local balance between the currents carrying coherent activity at any given time frame. This principle can be applied to networks with Hebbian cell assemblies, leading to a high capacity of the associative memory. The number of possible patterns is limited by a combinatorial constraint that turns out to be P=0.06N within the specific model that we employ. This limit is reached by the Hebbian cell assembly network. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that such high memory capacities are demonstrated in the asynchronous state of models of spiking neurons. 1 In trod u ction Numerous studies analyze the different phases of unstructured networks of spiking neurons [1, 2]. These networks with random connectivity possess a phase of asynchronous activity, the asynchronous state (AS), which is the most interesting one from the biological perspective, since it is similar to physiological data. Unstructured networks, however, do not hold information in their connectivity matrix, and therefore do not store memories. Binary networks with ordered connectivity matrices, or structured networks, and their ability to store and retrieve memories, have been extensively studied in the past [3-8]. Applicability of these results to biologically plausible neuronal models is questionable. In particular, models of spiking neurons are known to have modes of synchronous global oscillations. Avoiding such modes, and staying in an AS, is a major constraint on networks of spiking neurons that is absent in most binary neural networks. As we will show below, it is this constraint that imposes a limit on capacity in our model. Existing associative memory models of spiking neurons have not strived for maximal pattern capacity [3, 4, 8]. Here, using an integrate-and-fire model, we embed structured synaptic connections in an otherwise unstructured network and study the capacity limit of the system. The system is therefore macroscopically unstructured, but microscopically structured. The unstructured network model is based on Brunel's [1] balanced network of integrate-and-fire neurons. In his model, the network possesses different phases, one of which is the AS. We replace his unstructured excitatory connectivity by a semistructured one, including a super-position of either synfire chains or Hebbian cell assemblies. The existence of a stable AS is a fundamental prerequisite of the system. There are two reasons for that: First, physiological measurements of cortical tissues reveal an irregular neuronal activity and an asynchronous population activity. These findings match the properties of the AS. Second, in term of information content, the entropy of the system is the highest when firing probability is uniformly distributed, as in an AS. In general, embedding one or two patterns will not destabilize the AS. Increasing the number of embedded patterns, however, will eventually destabilize the AS, leading to global oscillations. In previous work [9], we have demonstrated that the cause of AS instability is correlations between neurons that result from the presence of structure in the network. The patterns, be it Hebbian cell assemblies (HCA) or pools occurring in synfire chains (SFC), have an important characteristic: neurons that are members of the same pattern (or pool) share a large portion of their inputs. This common input correlates neuronal activities both when a pattern is activated and when both neurons are influenced by random activity. If too many patterns are embedded in the network, too many neurons become correlated due to common inputs, leading to globally synchronized deviations from mean activity. A qualitative understanding of this state of affairs is provided by a simple model of a threshold linear pair of neurons that receive n excitatory common, and correlated, inputs, and K-n excitatory, as well as K inhibitory, non-common uncorrelated inputs. Thinking of these neurons as belonging to a pattern or a pool within a network, we can obtain an interesting self-consistent result by assuming the correlation of the pair of neurons to be also the correlation in their common correlated input (as is likely to be the case in a network loaded with HCA or SFC). We find then [9] that there exists a critical pattern size, n c , below which correlations decay but above which correlations are amplified. Furthermore, the following scaling was found to exist (1) nc = rc K . Implications of this model for the whole network are that: (i) rc is independent of N, the size of the network, (ii) below nc the AS is stable, and (iii) above nc the AS is unstable. Using extensive computer simulations we were able [9] to validate all these predictions. In addition, keeping n  nmin, by the requirement that n excitatory post-synaptic potentials (PSPs), on average, drive a neuron across its threshold. Since N>K and typically N>>K, together with Eq. (1) it follows that N >> (n min / rc ) . Hence rc and nmin set the lower bound of the network's size, 2 above which it is possible to embed a reasonable number of patterns in the network without losing the AS. In this paper we propose a solution that enables small n min and large r values, which in turn enables embedding a large number of patterns in much smaller networks. This is made possible by the doubly-balanced construction to be outlined below. 2 The double-balance principle Counteracting the excitatory correlations with inhibitory ones is the principle that will allow us to solve the problem. Since we deal with balanced networks, in which the mean excitatory input is balanced by an inhibitory one, we note that this principle imposes a second type of balancing condition, hence we refer to it as the double- balance principle. In the following, we apply this principle by introducing synaptic connections between any excitatory pattern and its randomly chosen inhibitory pattern. These inhibitory patterns, which we call shadow patterns, are activated after the excitatory patterns fire, but have no special in-pattern connectivity or structured projections onto other patterns. The premise is that correlations evolved in the excitatory patterns will elicit correlated inhibitory activity, thus balancing the network's average correlation level. The size of the shadow pattern has to be small enough, so that the global network activity will not be quenched, yet large enough, so that the excitatory correlation will be counteracted. A balanced network that is embedded with patterns and their shadow patterns will be referred to as a doubly balanced network (DBN), to be contrasted with the singly balanced network (SBN) where shadow patterns are absent. 3 3.1 Application of the double balance principle. The Network We model neuronal activity with the Integrate and Fire [10] model. All neurons have the same parameters: τ = 10ms , τ ref = 2.5ms , C=250pF. PSPs are modeled by a delta function with fixed delay. The number of synapses on a neuron is fixed and set to KE excitatory synapses from the local network, KE excitatory synapses from external sources and KI inhibitory synapses from the local network. See Aviel et al [9] for details. All synapses of each group will be given fixed values. It is allowed for one pre-synaptic neuron to make more than one connection to one postsynaptic neuron. The network possesses NE excitatory neurons and N I ≡ γN E inhibitory neurons. Connectivity is sparse, ε = 0.1 ). K E N E = K I N I = ε , (we use A Poisson process with rate vext=10Hz models the external source. If a neuron of population y innervates a neuron of population x its synaptic strength J xy is defined as J xE ≡ J 0 K E , J xI ≡ − gJ 0 with J0=10, and g=5. Note that J xI = − g γ KI J xE , hence g γ controls the balance between the two populations. Within an HCA pattern the neurons have high connection probability with one another. Here it is achieved by requiring L of the synapses of a neuron in the excitatory pattern to originate from within the pattern. Similarly, a neuron in the inhibitory shadow pattern dedicates L of its synapses to the associated excitatory pattern. In a SFC, each neuron in an excitatory pool is fed by L neurons from the previous pool. This forms a feed forward connectivity. In addition, when shadow pools are present, each neuron in a shadow pool is fed by L neurons from its associated excitatory pool. In both cases L = C L K E , with CL=2.5. The size of the excitatory patterns (i.e. the number of neurons participating in a pattern) or pools, nE, is also chosen to be proportional to K E (see Aviel et al. 2003 [9]), nE ≡ Cn K E , where Cn varies. This is a suitable choice, because of the behavior of the critical nc of Eq. (1), and is needed for the meaningful memory activity (of the HCA or SFC) to overcome synaptic noise. ~ The size of a shadow pattern is defined as nI ≡ d nE . This leads to the factor d, representing the relative strength of inhibitory and excitatory currents, due to a pattern or pool, affecting a neuron that is connected to both: d≡ (2) Thus it fixes nI = d − J xI nI J xE nE = gJ 0 K E d gd . = J0 K I γ ( )n . In the simulations reported below d varied between 1 γ g E and 3. Wiring the network is done in two stages, first all excitatory patterns are wired, and then random connections are added, complying with the fixed number of synapses. A volley of w spikes, normally distributed over time with width of 1ms, is used to ignite a memory pattern. In the case of SFC, the first pool is ignited, and under the right conditions the volley propagates along the chain without fading away and without destabilizing the AS. 3.2 Results First we show that the AS remains stable when embedding HCAs in a small DBN, whereas global oscillations take place if embedding is done without shadow pools. Figure 1 displays clearly the sustained activity of an HCA in the DBN. The same principle also enables embedding of SFCs in a small network. This is to be contrasted with the conclusions drawn in Aviel et al [9], where it was shown that otherwise very large networks are necessary to reach this goal. Figure 1: HCAs are embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. P=300 HCAs of size nE=194 excitatory neurons were embedded in a network of NE=15,000 excitatory neurons. The eleventh pattern is externally ignited at time t=100ms. A raster plot of 200ms is displayed. Without shadow patterns the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow patterns the network exhibits only minute oscillations, enabling the activity of the ignited pattern to be sustained. The size of the shadow patterns is set according to Eq. (2) with d=1. Neurons that participate in more than one HCA may appear more than once on the raster plot, whose y-axis is ordered according to HCAs, and represents every second neuron in each pattern. Figure 2: SFCs embedded in a balanced network without (left) and with (right) shadow patterns. The first pool is externally ignited at time t=100ms. d=0.5. The rest of the parameters are as in Figure 1. Here again, without shadow pools, the network exhibits global oscillations, but with shadow pools it has only minute oscillation, enabling a stable propagation of the synfire wave. 3.3 Maximum Capacity In this section we show that, within our DBN, it is the fixed number of synapses (rather than dynamical constraints) that dictates the maximal number of patterns or pools P that may be loaded onto the network. Let us start by noting that a neuron of population x (E or I) can participate in at most m ≡ K E L  patterns, hence N x m sets an upper bound on the number of neurons that participate in all patterns: P n x P ≤ m ⋅ N x . Next, defining α x ≡ , we find that Nx αx ≤ (3) m nx =  K E CL K E    nx To leading order in NE this turns into  K E CL K E   N = C C D −1 N − O αxNx =  n L x E E D C K (4) x n E ( ) ( NE ) (g γ ) if x=I, or 1 for x=E. where Dx ≡ d Thus we conclude that synaptic combinatorial considerations lead to a maximal number of patterns P. If DI<1, including the case DI=0 of the SBN, the excitatory neurons determine the limit to be P = (C n C L ) N E . If, as is the case in our DBN, −1 DI>1, then ( γα I < α E P = C n C L DI ) −1 and the inhibitory neurons set the maximum value to NE . For example, setting Cn=3.5, CL=2.4, g=3 and d=3, in Eq. (4), we get P=0.06NE. In Figure 3 we use these parameters. The capacity of a DBN is compared to that of an SBN for different network sizes. The maximal load is defined by the presence of global oscillation strong enough to prohibit sustained activity of patterns. The DBN reaches the combinatorial limit, whereas the SBN does not increase with N and obviously does not reach its combinatorial limit. 1400 1200 Pmax 1000 DBN SBN DBN Upper Limit SBN Upper Limit 800 600 400 200 0 0 5000 10000 NE 15000 Figure 3: A balanced network maximally loaded with HCAs.

<p>Author: Aaron J. Gruber, Peter Dayan, Boris S. Gutkin, Sara A. Solla</p><p>Abstract: Dopamine exerts two classes of effect on the sustained neural activity in prefrontal cortex that underlies working memory. Direct release in the cortex increases the contrast of prefrontal neurons, enhancing the robustness of storage. Release of dopamine in the striatum is associated with salient stimuli and makes medium spiny neurons bistable; this modulation of the output of spiny neurons affects prefrontal cortex so as to indirectly gate access to working memory and additionally damp sensitivity to noise. Existing models have treated dopamine in one or other structure, or have addressed basal ganglia gating of working memory exclusive of dopamine effects. In this paper we combine these mechanisms and explore their joint effect. We model a memory-guided saccade task to illustrate how dopamine’s actions lead to working memory that is selective for salient input and has increased robustness to distraction. 1</p><p>6 0.58480638 <a title="127-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-A_Recurrent_Model_of_Orientation_Maps_with_Simple_and_Complex_Cells.html">16 nips-2003-A Recurrent Model of Orientation Maps with Simple and Complex Cells</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoichi Miyawaki, Masato Okada</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes neural mechanisms of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). TMS can stimulate the brain non-invasively through a brief magnetic pulse delivered by a coil placed on the scalp, interfering with speciﬁc cortical functions with a high temporal resolution. Due to these advantages, TMS has been a popular experimental tool in various neuroscience ﬁelds. However, the neural mechanisms underlying TMSinduced interference are still unknown; a theoretical basis for TMS has not been developed.

<p>Author: Jeff Bondy, Ian Bruce, Suzanna Becker, Simon Haykin</p><p>Abstract: A major issue in evaluating speech enhancement and hearing compensation algorithms is to come up with a suitable metric that predicts intelligibility as judged by a human listener. Previous methods such as the widely used Speech Transmission Index (STI) fail to account for masking effects that arise from the highly nonlinear cochlear transfer function. We therefore propose a Neural Articulation Index (NAI) that estimates speech intelligibility from the instantaneous neural spike rate over time, produced when a signal is processed by an auditory neural model. By using a well developed model of the auditory periphery and detection theory we show that human perceptual discrimination closely matches the modeled distortion in the instantaneous spike rates of the auditory nerve. In highly rippled frequency transfer conditions the NAI’s prediction error is 8% versus the STI’s prediction error of 10.8%. 1 In trod u ction A wide range of intelligibility measures in current use rest on the assumption that intelligibility of a speech signal is based upon the sum of contributions of intelligibility within individual frequency bands, as first proposed by French and Steinberg [1]. This basic method applies a function of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) in a set of bands, then averages across these bands to come up with a prediction of intelligibility. French and Steinberg’s original Articulation Index (AI) is based on 20 equally contributing bands, and produces an intelligibility score between zero and one: 1 20 AI = (1) ∑ TI i , 20 i =1 th where TIi (Transmission Index i) is the normalized intelligibility in the i band. The TI per band is a function of the signal to noise ratio or: (2) SNRi + 12 30 for SNRs between –12 dB and 18 dB. A SNR of greater than 18 dB means that the band has perfect intelligibility and TI equals 1, while an SNR under –12 dB means that a band is not contributing at all, and the TI of that band equals 0. The overall intelligibility is then a function of the AI, but this function changes depending on the semantic context of the signal. TI i = Kryter validated many of the underlying AI principles [2]. Kryter also presented the mechanics for calculating the AI for different number of bands - 5,6,15 or the original 20 - as well as important correction factors [3]. Some of the most important correction factors account for the effects of modulated noise, peak clipping, and reverberation. Even with the application of various correction factors, the AI does not predict intelligibility in the presence of some time-domain distortions. Consequently, the Modulation Transfer Function (MTF) has been utilized to measure the loss of intelligibility due to echoes and reverberation [4]. Steeneken and Houtgast later extended this approach to include nonlinear distortions, giving a new name to the predictor: the Speech Transmission Index (STI) [5]. These metrics proved more valid for a larger range of environments and interferences. The STI test signal is a long-term average speech spectrum, gaussian random signal, amplitude modulated by a 0.63 Hz to 12.5 Hz tone. Acoustic components within different frequency bands are switched on and off over the testing sequence to come up with an intelligibility score between zero and one. Interband intermodulation sources can be discerned, as long as the product does not fall into the testing band. Therefore, the STI allows for standard AI-frequency band weighted SNR effects, MTF-time domain effects, and some limited measurements of nonlinearities. The STI shows a high correlation with empirical tests, and has been codified as an ANSI standard [6]. For general acoustics it is very good. However, the STI does not accurately model intraband masker non-linearities, phase distortions or the underlying auditory mechanisms (outside of independent frequency bands) We therefore sought to extend the AI/STI concepts to predict intelligibility, on the assumption that the closest physical variable we have to the perceptual variable of intelligibility is the auditory nerve response. Using a spiking model of the auditory periphery [7] we form the Neuronal Articulation Index (NAI) by describing distortions in the spike trains of different frequency bands. The spiking over time of an auditory nerve fiber for an undistorted speech signal (control case) is compared to the neural spiking over time for the same signal after undergoing some distortion (test case). The difference in the estimated instantaneous discharge rate for the two cases is used to calculate a neural equivalent to the TI, the Neural Distortion (ND), for each frequency band. Then the NAI is calculated with a weighted average of NDs at different Best Frequencies (BFs). In general detection theory terms, the control neuronal response sets some locus in a high dimensional space, then the distorted neuronal response will project near that locus if it is perceptually equivalent, or very far away if it is not. Thus, the distance between the control neuronal response and the distorted neuronal response is a function of intelligibility. Due to the limitations of the STI mentioned above it is predicted that a measure of the neural coding error will be a better predictor than SNR for human intelligibility word-scores. Our method also has the potential to shed light on the underlying neurobiological mechanisms. 2 2.1 Meth o d Model The auditory periphery model used throughout (and hereafter referred to as the Auditory Model) is from [7]. The system is shown in Figure 1. Figure 1 Block diagram of the computational model of the auditory periphery from the middle ear to the Auditory Nerve. Reprinted from Fig. 1 of [7] with permission from the Acoustical Society of America © (2003). The auditory periphery model comprises several sections, each providing a phenomenological description of a different part of the cat auditory periphery function. The first section models middle ear filtering. The second section, labeled the “control path,” captures the Outer Hair Cells (OHC) modulatory function, and includes a wideband, nonlinear, time varying, band-pass filter followed by an OHC nonlinearity (NL) and low-pass (LP) filter. This section controls the time-varying, nonlinear behavior of the narrowband signal-path basilar membrane (BM) filter. The control-path filter has a wider bandwidth than the signal-path filter to account for wideband nonlinear phenomena such as two-tone rate suppression. The third section of the model, labeled the “signal path”, describes the filter properties and traveling wave delay of the BM (time-varying, narrowband filter); the nonlinear transduction and low-pass filtering of the Inner Hair Cell (IHC NL and LP); spontaneous and driven activity and adaptation in synaptic transmission (synapse model); and spike generation and refractoriness in the auditory nerve (AN). In this model, CIHC and COHC are scaling constants that control IHC and OHC status, respectively. The parameters of the synapse section of the model are set to produce adaptation and discharge-rate versus level behavior appropriate for a high-spontaneous- rate/low-threshold auditory nerve fiber. In order to avoid having to generate many spike trains to obtain a reliable estimate of the instantaneous discharge rate over time, we instead use the synaptic release rate as an approximation of the discharge rate, ignoring the effects of neural refractoriness. 2.2 Neural articulation index These results emulate most of the simulations described in Chapter 2 of Steeneken’s thesis [8], as it describes the full development of an STI metric from inception to end. For those interested, the following simulations try to map most of the second chapter, but instead of basing the distortion metric on a SNR calculation, we use the neural distortion. There are two sets of experiments. The first, in section 3.1, deals with applying a frequency weighting structure to combine the band distortion values, while section 3.2 introduces redundancy factors also. The bands, chosen to match [8], are octave bands centered at [125, 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 4000, 8000] Hz. Only seven bands are used here. The Neural AI (NAI) for this is: NAI = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (3) th where •i is the i bands contribution and NTIi is the Neural Transmission Index in th the i band. Here all the •s sum to one, so each • factor can be thought of as the percentage contribution of a band to intelligibility. Since NTI is between [0,1], it can also be thought of as the percentage of acoustic features that are intelligible in a particular band. The ND per band is the projection of the distorted (Test) instantaneous spike rate against the clean (Control) instantaneous spike rate. ND = 1 − Test ⋅ Control T , Control ⋅ Control T (4) where Control and Test are vectors of the instantaneous spike rate over time, sampled at 22050 Hz. This type of error metric can only deal with steady state channel distortions, such as the ones used in [8]. ND was then linearly fit to resemble the TI equation 1-2, after normalizing each of the seven bands to have zero means and unit standard deviations across each of the seven bands. The NTI in the th i band was calculated as NDi − µ i (5) NTIi = m +b. σi NTIi is then thresholded to be no less then 0 and no greater then 1, following the TI thresholding. In equation (5) the factors, m = 2.5, b = -1, were the best linear fit to produce NTIi’s in bands with SNR greater then 15 dB of 1, bands with 7.5 dB SNR produce NTIi’s of 0.75, and bands with 0 dB SNR produced NTI i’s of 0.5. This closely followed the procedure outlined in section 2.3.3 of [8]. As the TI is a best linear fit of SNR to intelligibility, the NTI is a best linear fit of neural distortion to intelligibility. The input stimuli were taken from a Dutch corpus [9], and consisted of 10 Consonant-Vowel-Consonant (CVC) words, each spoken by four males and four females and sampled at 44100 Hz. The Steeneken study had many more, but the exact corpus could not be found. 80 total words is enough to produce meaningful frequency weighting factors. There were 26 frequency channel distortion conditions used for male speakers, 17 for female and three SNRs (+15 dB, +7.5 dB and 0 dB). The channel conditions were split into four groups given in Tables 1 through 4 for males, since females have negligible signal in the 125 Hz band, they used a subset, marked with an asterisk in Table 1 through Table 4.

A 1353 tap FIR filter was designed for each envelope condition. The female envelopes are a subset of these because they have no appreciable speech energy in the 125 Hz octave band. Using the 40 male utterances and 40 female utterances under distortion and calculating the NAI following equation (3) produces only a value between [0,1]. To produce a word-score intelligibility prediction between zero and 100 percent the NAI value was fit to a third order polynomial that produced the lowest standard deviation of error from empirical data. While Fletcher and Galt [10] state that the relation between AI and intelligibility is exponential, [8] fits with a third order polynomial, and we have chosen to compare to [8]. The empirical word-score intelligibility was from [8]. 3 3.1 R esu lts Determining frequency weighting structure For the first tests, the optimal frequency weights (the values of •i from equation 3) were designed through minimizing the difference between the predicted intelligibility and the empirical intelligibility. At each iteration one of the values was dithered up or down, and then the sum of the • i was normalized to one. This is very similar to [5] whose final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 12.8%, and 8.8% for females. The NAI’s final standard deviation of prediction error for males was 8.9%, and 7.1% for females. Figure 2 Relation between NAI and empirical word-score intelligibility for male (left) and female (right) speech with bandpass limiting and noise. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 8.9% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 12.8%, for females the fit has a s.d. = 7.1% versus the STI [5] s.d. = 8.8% The frequency weighting factors are similar for the NAI and the STI. The STI weighting factors from [8], which produced the optimal prediction of empirical data (male s.d. = 6.8%, female s.d. = 6.0%) and the NAI are plotted in Figure 3. Figure 3 Frequency weighting factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAI and published by Steeneken [8]. As one can see, the low frequency information is tremendously suppressed in the NAI, while the high frequencies are emphasized. This may be an effect of the stimuli corpus. The corpus has a high percentage of stops and fricatives in the initial and final consonant positions. Since these have a comparatively large amount of high frequency signal they may explain this discrepancy at the cost of the low frequency weights. [8] does state that these frequency weights are dependant upon the conditions used for evaluation. 3.2 Determining frequency weighting with redundancy factors In experiment two, rather then using equation (3) that assumes each frequency band contributes independently, we introduce redundancy factors. There is correlation between the different frequency bands of speech [11], which tends to make the STI over-predict intelligibility. The redundancy factors attempt to remove correlate signals between bands. Equation (3) then becomes: NAIr = α 1 ⋅ NTI1 − β 1 NTI1 ⋅ NTI2 + α 2 ⋅ NTI2 − β 1 NTI2 ⋅ NTI3 + ... + α 7 ⋅ NTI7 , (6) where the r subscript denotes a redundant NAI and • is the correlation factor. Only adjacent bands are used here to reduce complexity. We replicated Section 3.1 except using equation 6. The same testing, and adaptation strategy from Section 3.1 was used to find the optimal •s and •s. Figure 4 Relation between NAIr and empirical word-score intelligibility for male speech (right) and female speech (left) with bandpass limiting and noise with Redundancy Factors. The vertical spread from the best fitting polynomial for males has a s.d. = 6.9% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.7%, for females the best fitting polynomial has a s.d. = 5.4% versus the STIr [8] s.d. = 4.0%. The frequency weighting and redundancy factors given as optimal in Steeneken, versus calculated through optimizing the NAIr are given in Figure 5. Figure 5 Frequency and redundancy factors for the optimal predictor of male and female intelligibility calculated with the NAIr and published in [8]. The frequency weights for the NAIr and STIr are more similar than in Section 3.1. The redundancy factors are very different though. The NAI redundancy factors show no real frequency dependence unlike the convex STI redundancy factors. This may be due to differences in optimization that were not clear in [8]. Table 5: Standard Deviation of Prediction Error NAI STI [5] STI [8] MALE EQ. 3 8.9 % 12.8 % 6.8 % FEMALE EQ. 3 7.1 % 8.8 % 6.0 % MALE EQ. 6 6.9 % 4.7 % FEMALE EQ. 6 5.4 % 4.0 % The mean difference in error between the STI r, as given in [8], and the NAIr is 1.7%. This difference may be from the limited CVC word choice. It is well within the range of normal speaker variation, about 2%, so we believe that the NAI and NAIr are comparable to the STI and STI r in predicting speech intelligibility. 4 Conclusions These results are very encouraging. The NAI provides a modest improvement over STI in predicting intelligibility. We do not propose this as a replacement for the STI for general acoustics since the NAI is much more computationally complex then the STI. The NAI’s end applications are in predicting hearing impairment intelligibility and using statistical decision theory to describe the auditory systems feature extractors - tasks which the STI cannot do, but are available to the NAI. While the AI and STI can take into account threshold shifts in a hearing impaired individual, neither can account for sensorineural, suprathreshold degradations [12]. The accuracy of this model, based on cat anatomy and physiology, in predicting human speech intelligibility provides strong validation of attempts to design hearing aid amplification schemes based on physiological data and models [13]. By quantifying the hearing impairment in an intelligibility metric by way of a damaged auditory model one can provide a more accurate assessment of the distortion, probe how the distortion is changing the neuronal response and provide feedback for preprocessing via a hearing aid before the impairment. The NAI may also give insight into how the ear codes stimuli for the very robust, human auditory system. References [1] French, N.R. & Steinberg, J.C.

<p>Author: Michael Fink, Pietro Perona</p><p>Abstract: Mutual Boosting is a method aimed at incorporating contextual information to augment object detection. When multiple detectors of objects and parts are trained in parallel using AdaBoost [1], object detectors might use the remaining intermediate detectors to enrich the weak learner set. This method generalizes the efficient features suggested by Viola and Jones [2] thus enabling information inference between parts and objects in a compositional hierarchy. In our experiments eye-, nose-, mouth- and face detectors are trained using the Mutual Boosting framework. Results show that the method outperforms applications overlooking contextual information. We suggest that achieving contextual integration is a step toward human-like detection capabilities. 1 In trod u ction Classification of multiple objects in complex scenes is one of the next challenges facing the machine learning and computer vision communities. Although, real-time detection of single object classes has been recently demonstrated [2], naïve duplication of these detectors to the multiclass case would be unfeasible. Our goal is to propose an efficient method for detection of multiple objects in natural scenes. Hand-in-hand with the challenges entailing multiclass detection, some distinct advantages emerge as well. Knowledge on position of several objects might shed light on the entire scene (Figure 1). Detection systems that do not exploit the information provided by objects on the neighboring scene will be suboptimal. A B Figure 1: Contextual spatial relationships assist detection A. in absence of facial components (whitened blocking box) faces can be detected by context (alignment of neighboring faces). B. keyboards can be detected when they appear under monitors. Many human and computer vision models postulate explicitly or implicitly that vision follows a compositional hierarchy. Grounded features (that are innate/hardwired and are available prior to learning) are used to detect salient parts, these parts in turn enable detection of complex objects [3, 4], and finally objects are used to recognize the semantics of the entire scene. Yet, a more accurate assessment of human performance reveals that the visual system often violates this strictly hierarchical structure in two ways. First, part and whole detection are often evidently interacting [5, 6]. Second, several layers of the hierarchy are occasionally bypassed to enable swift direct detection. This phenomenon is demonstrated by gist recognition experiments where the semantic classification of an entire scene is performed using only minimal low level feature information [7]. The insights emerging from observing human perception were adopted by the object detection community. Many object detection algorithms bypass stages of a strict compositional hierarchy. The Viola & Jones (VJ) detector [2] is able to perform robust online face detection by directly agglomerating very low-level features (rectangle contrasts), without explicitly referring to facial parts. Gist detection from low-level spatial frequencies was demonstrated by Oliva and Torralba [8]. Recurrent optimization of parts and object constellation is also common in modern detection schemes [9]. Although Latent Semantic Analysis (making use of object cooccurrence information) has been adapted to images [10], the existing state of object detection methods is still far from unifying all the sources of visual contextual information integrated by the human perceptual system. Tackling the context integration problem and achieving robust multiclass object detection is a vital step for applications like image-content database indexing and autonomous robot navigation. We will propose a method termed Mutual Boosting to incorporate contextual information for object detection. Section 2 will start by posing the multiclass detection problem from labeled images. In Section 3 we characterize the feature sets implemented by Mutual Boosting and define an object's contextual neighborhood. Section 4 presents the Mutual Boosting framework aimed at integrating contextual information and inspired by the recurrent inferences dominating the human perceptual system. An application of the Mutual Boosting framework to facial component detection is presented in Section 5. We conclude with a discussion on the scope and limitations of the proposed framework. 2 Problem setting and basic notation Suppose we wish to detect multiple objects in natural scenes, and that these scenes are characterized by certain mutual positions between the composing objects. Could we make use of these objects' contextual relations to improve detection? Perceptual context might include multiple sources of information: information originating from the presence of existing parts, information derived from other objects in the perceptual vicinity and finally general visual knowledge on the scene. In order to incorporate these various sources of visual contextual information Mutual Boosting will treat parts, objects and scenes identically. We will therefore use the term object as a general term while referring to any entity in the compositional hierarchy. Let M denote the cardinality of the object set we wish to detect in natural scenes. Our goal is to optimize detection by exploiting contextual information while maintaining detection time comparable to M individual detectors trained without such information. We define the goal of the multiclass detection algorithm as generating M intensity maps Hm=1,..,M indicating the likelihood of object m appearing at different positions in a target image. We will use the following notation (Figure 2): • H0+/H0-: raw image input with/without the trained objects (A1 & A2) • Cm[i]: labeled position of instance i of object m in image H0+ • Hm: intensity map output indicating the likelihood of object m appearing in different positions in the image H0 (B) B.

First, they presented the rectangle contrast-features, features that are evaluated efficiently, using an integral-image. Second, VJ introduced AdaBoost [1] to object detection using rectangle features as weak learners. Finally a cascade method was developed to chain a sequence of increasingly complex AdaBoost learners to enable rapid filtering of non-relevant sections in the target image. The resulting cascade of AdaBoost face detectors achieves a 15 frame per second detection speed, with 90% detection rate and 2x10-6 false alarms. This detection speed is currently unmatched. In order to maintain efficient detection and in order to benchmark the performance of Mutual Boosting we will adopt the rectangle contrast feature framework suggested by VJ. It should be noted that the grayscale rectangle features could be naturally extended to any image channel that preserves the semantics of summation. A diversified feature set (including color features, texture features, etc.) might saturate later than a homogeneous channel feature set. By making use of features that capture the object regularities well, one can improve performance or reduce detection time. VJ extract training windows that capture the exact area of the training faces. We term this the local window approach. A second approach, in line with our attempt to incorporate information from neighboring parts or objects, would be to make use of training windows that capture wide regions around the object (Figure 3)1. A B Figure 3: A local window (VJ) and a contextual window that captures relative position information from objects or parts around and within the detected object. 1 Contextual neighborhoods emerge by downscaling larger regions in the original image to a PxP resolution window. The contextual neighborhood approach contributes to detection when the applied channels require a wide contextual range as will be demonstrated in the Mutual Boosting scheme presented in the following section2. 4 Mutual Boosting The AdaBoost algorithm maintains a clear distinction between the boosting level and the weak-learner training level. The basic insight guiding the Mutual Boosting method reexamines this distinction, stipulating that when multiple objects and parts are trained simultaneously using AdaBoost; any object detector might combine the previously evolving intermediate detectors to generate new weak learners. In order to elaborate this insight it should first be noted that while training a strong learner using 100 iterations of AdaBoost (abbreviated AB100) one could calculate an intermediate strong learner at each step on the way (AB2 - AB99). To apply this observation for our multiclass detection problem we simultaneously train M object detectors. At each boosting iteration t the M detectors (ABmt-1) emerging at the previous stage t-1, are used to filter positive and negative3 training images, thus producing intermediate m-detection maps Hmt-1 (likelihood of object m in the images4). Next, the Mutual Boosting stage takes place and all the existing Hmt-1 maps are used as additional channels out of which new contrast features are selected. This process gradually enriches the initial grounded features with composite contextual features. The composite features are searched on a PxP wide contextual neighborhood region rather than the PxP local window (Figure 3). Following a dynamic programming approach in training and detection, Hm=1,..,M detection maps are constantly maintained and updated so that the recalculation of Hmt only requires the last chosen weak learner WLmn*t to be evaluated on channel Hn*t-1 of the training image (Figure 4). This evaluation produces a binary detection layer that will be weighted by the AdaBoost weak-learner weighting scheme and added to the previous stage map5. Although Mutual Boosting examines a larger feature set during training, an iteration of Mutual Boosting detection of M objects is as time-consuming as performing an AdaBoost detection iteration for M individual objects. The advantage of Mutual Boosting emerges from introducing highly informative feature sets that can enhance detection or require fewer boosting iterations. While most object detection applications extract a local window containing the object information and discard the remaining image (including the object positional information). Mutual Boosting processes the entire image during training and detection and makes constant use of the information characterizing objects’ relative-position in the training images. As we have previously stated, the detected objects might be in various levels of a compositional hierarchy (e.g. complex objects or parts of other objects). Nevertheless, Mutual Boosting provides a similar treatment to objects, parts and scenes enabling any compositional structure of the data to naturally emerge. We will term any contextual reference that is not directly grounded to the basic features, as a cross referencing of objects6. 2 The most efficient size of the contextual neighborhoods might vary, from the immediate to the entire image, and therefore should be empirically learned. 3 Images without target objects (see experimental section below) 4 Unlike the weak learners, the intermediate strong learners do not apply a threshold 5 In order to optimize the number of detection map integral image recalculations these maps might be updated every k (e.g. 50) iterations rather than at each iteration. 6 Scenes can be crossed referenced as well if scene labels are available (office/lab etc.).

[1] Standard AdaBoost stages are not elaborated To maintain local and global natural scene statistics, negative training examples are generated by pairing each image with an image of equal size that does not contain the target objects and by centering the local and contextual windows of the positive and negative examples on the object positions in the positive images (see Figure 2). By using parallel boosting and efficient rectangle contrast features, Mutual Boosting is capable of incorporating many information inferences (references in Figure 5): • Features could be used to directly detect parts and objects (A & B) • Objects could be used to detect other (or identical) objects in the image (C) • Parts could be used to detect other (or identical) nearby parts (D & E) • Parts could be used to detect objects (F) • Objects could be used to detect parts A. eye feature from raw image B. face feature from raw image C. face E. mouth feature from eye feature from face detection image detection image F. face feature from mouth D. eye feature from eye detection image detection image Figure 5: A-E.

C. faces are detected using face detection maps HFace, exploiting the fact that faces tend to be horizontally aligned. 5 Experiments A. Pd In order to test the contribution of the Mutual Boosting process we focused on detection of objects in what we term a face-scene (right eye, left eye, nose, mouth and face). We chose to perform contextual detection in the face-scene for two main reasons. First as detailed in Figure 5, face scenes demonstrate a range of potential part and object cross references. Second, faces have been the focus of object detection research for many years, thus enabling a systematic result comparison. Experiment 1 was aimed at comparing the performance of Mutual Boosting to that of naïve independently trained object detectors using local windows. Pfa Figure 6: A. Two examples of the CMU/MIT face database. B. Mutual Boosting and AdaBoost ROCs on the CMU/MIT face database. Face-scene images were downloaded from the web and manually labeled7. Training relied on 450 positive and negative examples (~4% of the images used by VJ). 400 iterations of local window AdaBoost and contextual window Mutual Boosting were performed on the same image set. Contextual windows encompassed a region five times larger in width and height than the local windows8 (see Figure 3). 7 By following CMU database conventions (R-eye, L-eye, Nose & Mouth positions) we derive both the local window position and the relative position of objects in the image 8 Local windows were created by downscaling objects to 25x25 grids Test image detection maps emerge from iteratively summing T m-detection layers (Mutual Boosting stages C&D;). ROC performance on the CMU/MIT face database (see sample images in Figure 6A) was assessed using a threshold on position Cm[i] that best discriminated the final positive and negative detection maps Hm+/-T. Figure 6B demonstrates the superiority of Mutual Boosting to grounded feature AdaBoost. A. COV 0.25 COV 1.00 COV 4.00 Equal error performance Our second experiment was aimed at assessing the performance of Mutual Boosting as we change the detected configurations’ variance. Assuming normal distribution of face configurations we estimated (from our existing labeled set) the spatial covariance between four facial components (noses, mouths and both eyes). We then modified the covariance matrix, multiplying it by 0.25, 1 or 4 and generated 100 artificial configurations by positioning four contrasting rectangles in the estimated position of facial components. Although both Mutual Boosting and AdaBoost performance degraded as the configuration variance increased, the advantage of Mutual Boosting persists both in rigid and in varying configurations9 (Figure 7).

MB and AB Equal error rate performance on configurations with varying covariance as a function of boosting iterations. 6 D i s c u s s i on While evaluating the performance of Mutual Boosting it should be emphasized that we did not implement the VJ cascade approach; therefore we only attempt to demonstrate that the power of a single AdaBoost learner could be augmented by Mutual Boosting. The VJ detector is rescaled in order to perform efficient detection of objects in multiple scales. For simplicity, scale of neighboring objects and parts was assumed to be fixed so that a similar detector-rescaling approach could be followed. This assumption holds well for face-scenes, but if neighboring objects may vary in scale a single m-detection map will not suffice. However, by transforming each m-detection image to an m-detection cube, (having scale as the third dimension) multi-scale context detection could be achieved10. The dynamic programming characteristic of Mutual Boosting (simply reusing the multiple position and scale detections already performed by VJ) will ensure that the running time of varying scale context will only be doubled. It should be noted that the facescene is highly structured and therefore it is a good candidate for demonstrating 9 In this experiment the resolution of the MB windows (and the number of training features) was decreased so that information derived from the higher resolution of the parts would be ruled out as an explaining factor for the Mutual Boosting advantage. This procedure explains the superior AdaBoost performance in the first boosting iteration. 10 By using an integral cube, calculating the sum of a cube feature (of any size) requires 8 access operations (only double than the 4 operations required in the integral image case). Mutual Boosting; however as suggested by Figure 7B Mutual Boosting can handle highly varying configurations and the proposed method needs no modification when applied to other scenes, like the office scene in Figure 111. Notice that Mutual Boosting does not require a-priori knowledge of the compositional structure but rather permits structure to naturally emerge in the cross referencing pattern (see examples in Figure 5). Mutual Boosting could be enhanced by unifying the selection of weak-learners rather than selecting an individual weak learner for each object detector. Unified selection is aimed at choosing weak learners that maximize the entire object set detection rate, thus maximizing feature reuse [11]. This approach is optimal when many objects with common characteristics are trained. Is Mutual Boosting specific for image object detection? Indeed it requires labeled input of multiple objects in a scene supplying a local description of the objects as well as information on their contextual mutual positioning. But these criterions are shared by other complex</p><p>4 0.53445745 <a title="127-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Nonlinear_Processing_in_LGN_Neurons.html">140 nips-2003-Nonlinear Processing in LGN Neurons</a></p>
<p>Author: Vincent Bonin, Valerio Mante, Matteo Carandini</p><p>Abstract: According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate on visual stimuli in a linear fashion. There is ample evidence, however, that LGN responses are not entirely linear. To account for nonlinearities we propose a model that synthesizes more than 30 years of research in the field. Model neurons have a linear receptive field, and a nonlinear, divisive suppressive field. The suppressive field computes local root-meansquare contrast. To test this model we recorded responses from LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. We estimate model parameters from a basic set of measurements and show that the model can accurately predict responses to novel stimuli. The model might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. It specifies how visual processing in LGN involves both linear filtering and divisive gain control. 1 In t rod u ct i on According to a widely held view, neurons in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) operate linearly (Cai et al., 1997; Dan et al., 1996). Their response L(t) is the convolution of the map of stimulus contrast S(x,t) with a receptive field F(x,t): L (t ) = [ S∗ F ] ( 0, t ) The receptive field F(x,t) is typically taken to be a difference of Gaussians in space (Rodieck, 1965) and a difference of Gamma functions in time (Cai et al., 1997). This linear model accurately predicts the selectivity of responses for spatiotemporal frequency as measured with gratings (Cai et al., 1997; Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). It also predicts the main features of responses to complex dynamic video sequences (Dan et al., 1996). 150 spikes/s Data Model Figure 1. Response of an LGN neuron to a dynamic video sequence along with the prediction made by the linear model. Stimuli were sequences from Walt Disney’s “Tarzan”. From Mante et al. (2002). The linear model, however, suffers from limitations. For example, consider the response of an LGN neuron to a complex dynamic video sequences (Figure 1). The response is characterized by long periods of relative silence interspersed with brief events of high firing rate (Figure 1, thick traces). The linear model (Figure 1, thin traces) successfully predicts the timing of these firing events but fails to account for their magnitude (Mante et al., 2002). The limitations of the linear model are not surprising since there is ample evidence that LGN responses are nonlinear. For instance, responses to drifting gratings saturate as contrast is increased (Sclar et al., 1990) and are reduced, or masked, by superposition of a second grating (Bonin et al., 2002). Moreover, responses are selective for stimulus size (Cleland et al., 1983; Hubel and Wiesel, 1961; Jones and Sillito, 1991) in a nonlinear manner (Solomon et al., 2002). We propose that these and other nonlinearities can be explained by a nonlinear model incorporating a nonlinear suppressive field. The qualitative notion of a suppressive field was proposed three decades ago by Levick and collaborators (1972). We propose that the suppressive field computes local root-mean-square contrast, and operates divisively on the receptive field output. Basic elements of this model appeared in studies of contrast gain control in retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978) and in primary visual cortex (Cavanaugh et al., 2002; Heeger, 1992; Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). Some of these notions have been applied to LGN (Solomon et al., 2002), to fit responses to a limited set of stimuli with tailored parameter sets. Here we show that a single model with fixed parameters predicts responses to a broad range of stimuli. 2 Mod el In the model (Figure 2), the linear response of the receptive field L(t) is divided by the output of the suppressive field. The latter is a measure of local root-mean-square contrast c local. The result of the division is a generator potential V (t ) = Vmax L (t ) c50 + clocal , where c 50 is a constant.

The suppressive field operates on a filtered version of the stimulus, S*=S*H, where H is a linear filter and * denotes convolution. The squared output of the suppressive field is the local mean square (the local variance) of the filtered stimulus: clocal = S ( x, t ) G ( x ) dx dt , 2 * 2 ∫∫ where G(x) is a 2-dimensional Gaussian. Firing rate is a rectified version of generator potential, with threshold V thresh:   R(t ) = V (t ) − Vthresh + .   To test the nonlinear model, we recorded responses from neurons in the LGN of anesthetized paralyzed cats. Methods for these recordings were described elsewhere (Freeman et al., 2002). 3 Resu l t s We proceed in two steps: first we estimate model parameters by fitting the model to a large set of canonical data; second we fix model parameters and evaluate the model by predicting responses to a novel set of stimuli.

Dashed curves are predictions of linear model. Solid curves indicate fit of nonlinear model. 3.1 C h a r a c te r i z i n g t he r e c e p ti v e fi e l d We obtain the parameters of the receptive field F(x,t) from responses to large drifting gratings (Figure 3). These stimuli elicit approximately constant output in the suppressive field, so they allow us to characterize the receptive field. Responses to different spatial frequencies constrain F(x,t) in space (Figure 3A). Responses to different temporal frequencies constrain F(x,t) in time (Figure 3B). 3.2 C h a r a c te r i z i n g t he s u p p r e s s i v e f i e l d To characterize the divisive stage, we start by measuring how responses saturate at high contrast (Figure 4A). A linear model cannot account for this contrast saturation (Figure 4A, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4A, solid curve) captures saturation because increases in receptive field output are attenuated by increases in suppressive field output. At low contrast, no saturation is observed because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50. From these data we estimate the value of c50. To obtain the parameters of the suppressive field, we recorded responses to sums of two drifting gratings (Figure 4B-D): an optimal test grating at 50% contrast, which elicits a large baseline response, and a mask grating that modulates this response. Test and mask temporal frequencies are incommensurate so that they temporally label a test response (at the frequency of the test) and a mask response (at the frequency of the mask) (Bonds, 1989). We vary mask attributes and study how they affect the test responses. Increasing mask contrast progressively suppresses responses (Figure 4B). The linear model fails to account for this suppression (Figure 4B, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4B, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask contrast increases the suppressive field output while the receptive field output (at the temporal frequency of the test) remains constant. With masks of low contrast there is little suppression because the output of the suppressive field is dominated by the constant c 50 . Similar effects are seen if we increase mask diameter. Responses decrease until they reach a plateau (Figure 4C). A linear model predicts no decrease (Figure 4C, dashed curve). The nonlinear model (Figure 4C, solid curve) captures it because increasing mask diameter increases the suppressive field output while it does not affect the receptive field output. A plateau is reached once masks extend beyond the suppressive field. From these data we estimate the size of the Gaussian envelope G(x) of the suppressive field. Finally, the strength of suppression depends on mask spatial frequency (Figure 4D). At high frequencies, no suppression is elicited. Reducing spatial frequency increases suppression. This dependence of suppression on spatial frequency is captured in the nonlinear model by the filter H(x,t). From these data we estimate the spatial characteristics of the filter. From similar experiments involving different temporal frequencies (not shown), we estimate the filter’s selectivity for temporal frequency. 3.3 P r e d i c ti n g r e s p o n s e s t o n o v e l s ti m u l i We have seen that with a fixed set of parameters the model provides a good fit to a large set of measurements (Figure 3 and Figure 4). We now test whether the model predicts responses to a set of novel stimuli: drifting gratings varying in contrast and diameter. Responses to high contrast stimuli exhibit size tuning (Figure 5A, squares): they grow with size for small diameters, reach a maximum value at intermediate diameter and are reduced for large diameters (Jones and Sillito, 1991). Size tuning , however, strongly depends on stimulus contrast (Solomon et al., 2002): no size tuning is observed at low contrast (Figure 5A, circles). The model predicts these effects (Figure 5A, curves). For large, high contrast stimuli the output of the suppressive field is dominated by c local, resulting in suppression of responses. At low contrast, c local is much smaller than c50, and the suppressive field does not affect responses. Similar considerations can be made by plotting these data as a function of contrast (Figure 5B). As predicted by the nonlinear model (Figure 5B, curves), the effect of increasing contrast depends on stimulus size: responses to large stimuli show strong saturation (Figure 5B, squares), whereas responses to small stimuli grow linearly (Figure 5B, circles). The model predicts these effects because only large, high contrast stimuli elicit large enough responses from the suppressive field to cause suppression. For small, low contrast stimuli, instead, the linear model is a good approximation.

Stimuli are gratings varying in diameter and contrast, and responses are harmonic component of spike trains at grating temporal frequency. Curves show model predictions based on parameters as estimated in previous figures, not fitted to these data. A: Responses as function of diameter for different contrasts. B: Responses as function of contrast for different diameters. 3.4 M o d e l pe r f or m a nc e To assess model performance across neurons we calculate the percentage of variance in the data that is explained by the model (see Freeman et al., 2002 for methods). The model provides good fits to the data used to characterize the suppressive field (Figure 4), explaining more than 90% of the variance in the data for 9/13 cells (Figure 6A). Model parameters are then held fixed, and the model is used to predict responses to gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). The model performs well, explaining in 10/13 neurons above 90% of the variance in these novel data (Figure 6B, shaded histogram). The agreement between the quality of the fits and the quality of the predictions suggests that model parameters are well constrained and rules out a role of overfitting in determining the quality of the fits. To further confirm the performance of the model, in an additional 54 cells we ran a subset of the whole protocol, involving only the experiment for characterizing the receptive field (Figure 3), and the experiment involving gratings of different contrast and diameter (Figure 5). For these cells we estimate the suppressive field by fitting the model directly to the latter measurements. The model explains above 90% of the variance in these data in 20/54 neurons and more than 70% in 39/54 neurons (Figure 6B, white histogram). Considering the large size of the data set (more than 100 stimuli, requiring several hours of recordings per neuron) and the small number of free parameters (only 6 for the purpose of this work), the overall, quality of the model predictions is remarkable.

White histogram shows quality of fits. 4 Co n cl u si o n s The nonlinear model provides a unified description of visual processing in LGN neurons. Based on a fixed set of parameters, it can predict both linear properties (Figure 3), as well as nonlinear properties such as contrast saturation (Figure 4A) and masking (Figure 4B-D). Moreover, once the parameters are fixed, it predicts responses to novel stimuli (Figure 5). The model explains why responses are tuned for stimulus size at high contrast but not at low contrast, and it correctly predicts that only responses to large stimuli saturate with contrast, while responses to small stimuli grow linearly. The model implements a form of contrast gain control. A possible purpose for this gain control is to increase the range of contrast that can be transmitted given the limited dynamic range of single neurons. Divisive gain control may also play a role in population coding: a similar model applied to responses of primary visual cortex was shown to maximize independence of the responses across neurons (Schwartz and Simoncelli, 2001). We are working towards improving the model in two ways. First, we are characterizing the dynamics of the suppressive field, e.g. to predict how it responds to transient stimuli. Second, we are testing the assumption that the suppressive field computes root-mean-square contrast, a measure that solely depends on the secondorder moments of the light distribution. Our ultimate goal is to predict responses to complex stimuli such as those shown in Figure 1 and quantify to what degree the nonlinear model improves on the predictions of the linear model. Determining the role of visual nonlinearities under more natural stimulation conditions is also critical to understanding their function. The nonlinear model synthesizes more than 30 years of research. It is robust, tractable and generalizes to arbitrary stimuli. As a result it might serve as the new standard model of LGN responses. Because the nonlinearities we discussed are already present in the retina (Shapley and Victor, 1978), and tend to get stronger as one ascends the visual hierarchy (Sclar et al., 1990), it may also be used to study how responses take shape from one stage to another in the visual system.

<p>Author: Adria Bofill-i-petit, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: We present test results from spike-timing correlation learning experiments carried out with silicon neurons with STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) synapses. The weight change scheme of the STDP synapses can be set to either weight-independent or weight-dependent mode. We present results that characterise the learning window implemented for both modes of operation. When presented with spike trains with diﬀerent types of synchronisation the neurons develop bimodal weight distributions. We also show that a 2-layered network of silicon spiking neurons with STDP synapses can perform hierarchical synchrony detection. 1</p><p>6 0.53119135 <a title="127-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Decoding_V1_Neuronal_Activity_using_Particle_Filtering_with_Volterra_Kernels.html">49 nips-2003-Decoding V1 Neuronal Activity using Particle Filtering with Volterra Kernels</a></p>

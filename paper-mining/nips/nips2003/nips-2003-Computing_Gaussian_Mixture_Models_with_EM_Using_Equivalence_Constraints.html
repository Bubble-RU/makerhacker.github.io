<p>Author: Ben Taskar, Carlos Guestrin, Daphne Koller</p><p>Abstract: In typical classiﬁcation tasks, we seek a function which assigns a label to a single object. Kernel-based approaches, such as support vector machines (SVMs), which maximize the margin of conﬁdence of the classiﬁer, are the method of choice for many such tasks. Their popularity stems both from the ability to use high-dimensional feature spaces, and from their strong theoretical guarantees. However, many real-world tasks involve sequential, spatial, or structured data, where multiple labels must be assigned. Existing kernel-based methods ignore structure in the problem, assigning labels independently to each object, losing much useful information. Conversely, probabilistic graphical models, such as Markov networks, can represent correlations between labels, by exploiting problem structure, but cannot handle high-dimensional feature spaces, and lack strong theoretical generalization guarantees. In this paper, we present a new framework that combines the advantages of both approaches: Maximum margin Markov (M3 ) networks incorporate both kernels, which efﬁciently deal with high-dimensional features, and the ability to capture correlations in structured data. We present an efﬁcient algorithm for learning M3 networks based on a compact quadratic program formulation. We provide a new theoretical bound for generalization in structured domains. Experiments on the task of handwritten character recognition and collective hypertext classiﬁcation demonstrate very signiﬁcant gains over previous approaches. 1</p><p>3 0.14380108 <a title="47-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Response_for_Approximate_Inference.html">117 nips-2003-Linear Response for Approximate Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Max Welling, Yee W. Teh</p><p>Abstract: Belief propagation on cyclic graphs is an efﬁcient algorithm for computing approximate marginal probability distributions over single nodes and neighboring nodes in the graph. In this paper we propose two new algorithms for approximating joint probabilities of arbitrary pairs of nodes and prove a number of desirable properties that these estimates fulﬁll. The ﬁrst algorithm is a propagation algorithm which is shown to converge if belief propagation converges to a stable ﬁxed point. The second algorithm is based on matrix inversion.

<p>Author: Volker Roth, Tilman Lange</p><p>Abstract: A novel approach to combining clustering and feature selection is presented. It implements a wrapper strategy for feature selection, in the sense that the features are directly selected by optimizing the discriminative power of the used partitioning algorithm. On the technical side, we present an efﬁcient optimization algorithm with guaranteed local convergence property. The only free parameter of this method is selected by a resampling-based stability analysis. Experiments with real-world datasets demonstrate that our method is able to infer both meaningful partitions and meaningful subsets of features. 1</p><p>5 0.11768895 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Learning_with_Local_and_Global_Consistency.html">113 nips-2003-Learning with Local and Global Consistency</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Olivier Bousquet, Thomas N. Lal, Jason Weston, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufﬁciently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classiﬁcation problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data. 1</p><p>6 0.11595181 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Linear_Dependent_Dimensionality_Reduction.html">115 nips-2003-Linear Dependent Dimensionality Reduction</a></p>

<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge about local invariances with respect to given pattern transformations can greatly improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation. Previous approaches are either based on regularisation or on the generation of virtual (transformed) examples. We develop a new framework for learning linear classiﬁers under known transformations based on semideﬁnite programming. We present a new learning algorithm— the Semideﬁnite Programming Machine (SDPM)—which is able to ﬁnd a maximum margin hyperplane when the training examples are polynomial trajectories instead of single points. The solution is found to be sparse in dual variables and allows to identify those points on the trajectory with minimal real-valued output as virtual support vectors. Extensions to segments of trajectories, to more than one transformation parameter, and to learning with kernels are discussed. In experiments we use a Taylor expansion to locally approximate rotational invariance in pixel images from USPS and ﬁnd improvements over known methods. 1</p><p>6 0.48513886 <a title="47-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Semi-Supervised_Learning_with_Trees.html">172 nips-2003-Semi-Supervised Learning with Trees</a></p>

<p>Author: Masakazu Yagi, Hideo Yamasaki, Tadashi Shibata</p><p>Abstract: A mixed-signal image filtering VLSI has been developed aiming at real-time generation of edge-based image vectors for robust image recognition. A four-stage asynchronous median detection architecture based on analog digital mixed-signal circuits has been introduced to determine the threshold value of edge detection, the key processing parameter in vector generation. As a result, a fully seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge feature map generation has been established. A prototype chip was designed in a 0.35-µm double-polysilicon three-metal-layer CMOS technology and the concept was verified by the fabricated chip. The chip generates a 64-dimension feature vector from a 64x64-pixel gray scale image every 80µsec. This is about 104 times faster than the software computation, making a real-time image recognition system feasible. 1 In tro du c ti o n The development of human-like image recognition systems is a key issue in information technology. However, a number of algorithms developed for robust image recognition so far [1]-[3] are mostly implemented as software systems running on general-purpose computers. Since the algorithms are generally complex and include a lot of floating point operations, they are computationally too expensive to build real-time systems. Development of hardware-friendly algorithms and their direct VLSI implementation would be a promising solution for real-time response systems. Being inspired by the biological principle that edge information is firstly detected in the visual cortex, we have developed an edge-based image representation algorithm compatible to hardware processing. In this algorithm, multiple-direction edges extracted from an original gray scale image is utilized to form a feature vector. Since the spatial distribution of principal edges is represented by a vector, it was named Projected Principal-Edge Distribution (PPED) [4],[5], or formerly called Principal Axis Projection (PAP) [6],[7]. (The algorithm is explained later.) Since the PPED vectors very well represent the human perception of similarity among images, robust image recognition systems have been developed using PPED vectors in conjunction with the analog soft pattern classifier [4],[8], the digital VQ (Vector Quantization) processor [9], and support vector machines [10] . The robust nature of PPED representation is demonstrated in Fig. 1, where the system was applied to cephalometric landmark identification (identifying specific anatomical landmarks on medical radiographs) as an example, one of the most important clinical practices of expert dentists in orthodontics [6],[7]. Typical X-ray images to be experienced by apprentice doctors were converted to PPED vectors and utilized as templates for vector matching. The system performance has been proven for 250 head film samples regarding the fundamental 26 landmarks [11]. Important to note is the successful detection of the landmark on the soft tissue boundary (the tip of the lower lip) shown in Fig. 1(c). Landmarks on soft tissues are very difficult to detect as compared to landmarks on hard tissues (solid bones) because only faint images are captured on radiographs. The successful detection is due to the median algorithm that determines the threshold value for edge detection. Sella Nasion Orbitale By our system (a) By expert dentists Landmark on soft tissue (b) (c) Fig. 1: Image recognition using PPED vectors: (a,b) cephalometric landmark identification; (c) successful landmark detection on soft tissue. We have adopted the median value of spatial variance of luminance within the filtering kernel (5x5 pixels), which allows us to extract all essential features in a delicate gray scale image. However, the problem is the high computational cost in determining the median value. It takes about 0.6 sec to generate one PPED vector from a 64x64-pixel image (a standard image size for recognition in our system) on a SUN workstation, making real time processing unrealistic. About 90% of the computation time is for edge detection from an input image, in which most of the time is spent for median detection. Then the purpose of this work is to develop a new architecture median-filter VLSI subsystem for real-time PPED-vector generation. Special attention has been paid to realize a fully seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge feature map generation by employing the four-stage asynchronous median detection architecture. 2 P r o je c t e d P r i n c i pa l E dg e Dis tribution (PPED ) Projected Principal Edge Distribution (PPED) algorithm [5],[6] is briefly explained using Fig. 2(a). A 5x5-pixel block taken from a 64x64-pixel target image is subjected to edge detection filtering in four principal directions, i.e. horizontal, vertical, and ±45-degree directions. In the figure, horizontal edge filtering is shown as an example. (The filtering kernels used for edge detection are given in Fig. 2(b).) In order to determine the threshold value for edge detection, all the absolute-value differences between two neighboring pixels are calculated in both vertical and horizontal directions and the median value is taken as the threshold. By scanning the 5x5-pixel filtering kernels in the target image, four 64x64 edge-flag maps are generated, which are called feature maps. In the horizontal feature map, for example, edge flags in every four rows are accumulated and spatial distribution of edge flags are represented by a histogram having 16 elements. Similar procedures are applied to other three directions to form respective histograms each having 16 elements. Finally, a 64-dimension vector is formed by series-connecting the four histograms in the order of horizontal, +45-degree, vertical, and –45-degree.

The system receives one column of data (8-b x 5 pixels) at each clock and stores the data in the last column of the 5x6 image buffer. The image buffer shifts all the stored data to the right at every clock. Before the edge filtering circuit (EFC) starts detecting four direction edges with respect to the center pixel in the 5x5 block, the threshold value calculated from all the pixel data in the 5x5 block must be ready in time for the processing. In order to keep the coherence of the threshold detection and the edge filtering processing, the two last-in data locating at column 5 and 6 are given to median filter circuit (MFC) in advance via absolute value circuit (AVC). AVC calculates all luminance differences between two neighboring pixels in columns 5 and 6. In this manner, a fully seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge feature map generation has been established. The key requirement here is that MFC must determine the median value of the 40 luminance difference data from the 5x5-pixel block fast enough to carry out the seamless pipeline processing. For this purpose, a four-stage asynchronous median detection architecture has been developed which is explained in the following.

The well-known binary search algorithm was adopted for fast execution of median detection. The median search processing for five 4-b data is illustrated in Fig. 4 for the purpose of explanation. In the beginning, majority voting is carried out for the MSB’s of all data. Namely, the number of 1’s is compared with the number of 0’s and the majority group wins. The majority group flag (“0” in this example) is stored as the MSB of the median value. In addition, the loser group is withdrawn in the following voting by changing all remaining bits to the loser MSB (“1” in this example). By repeating the processing, the median value is finally stored in the median value register.

How the median value is detected from all the 40 8-b data (20 horizontal luminance difference data and 20 vertical luminance difference data) is illustrated in Fig. 5. All the data are stored in the array of median detection units (MDU’s). At each clock, the array receives four vertical luminance difference data and five horizontal luminance difference data calculated from the data in column 5 and 6 in Fig. 3. The entire data are shifted downward at each clock. The median search is carried out for the upper four bits and the lower four bits separately in order to enhance the throughput by pipelining. For this purpose, the chip is equipped with eight majority voting circuits (MVC 0~7). The upper four bits from all the data are processed by MVC 4~7 in a single clock cycle to yield the median value. In the next clock cycle, the loser information is transferred to the lower four bits within each MDU and MVC0~3 carry out the median search for the lower four bits from all the data in the array.

The majority voting circuit (MVC) is shown in Fig. 6. Output connected CMOS inverters are employed as preamplifiers for majority detection which was first proposed in Ref. [12]. In the present implementation, however, two preamps receiving input data and inverted input data are connected to a 2-stage differential amplifier. Although this doubles the area penalty, the instability in the threshold for majority detection due to process and temperature variations has been remarkably improved as compared to the single inverter thresholding in Ref. [12]. The MVC in Fig. 6 has 41 input terminals although 40 bits of data are inputted to the circuit at one time. Bit “0” is always given to the terminal IN40 to yield “0” as the majority when there is a tie in the majority voting.

The edge filtering circuit (EFC) in Fig. 3 is composed as a four-stage pipeline of regular CMOS digital logic. In the first two stages, four-direction edge gradients are computed, and in the succeeding two stages, the detection of the largest gradient and the thresholding is carried out to generate four edge flags. 4 E x p e r i m e n t a l R es u l t s The feature map generation VLSI was fabricated in a 0.35-µm double-poly three-metal-layer CMOS technology. A photomicrograph of the proof-of-concept chip is shown in Fig. 7. The measured waveforms of the MVC at operating frequencies of 10MHz and 90MHz are demonstrated in Fig. 8. The input condition is in the worst case. Namely, 21 “1” bits and 20 “0” bits were fed to the inputs. The observed computation time is about 12 nsec which is larger than the simulation result of 2.5 nsec. This was caused by the capacitance loading due to the probing of the test circuit. In the real circuit without external probing, we confirmed the average computation time of 4~5 nsec.

The feature maps generated by the chip at the operation frequency of 25 MHz are demonstrated in Fig. 9. The power dissipation was 224 mW. The difference between the flag bits detected by the chip and those obtained by computer simulation are also shown in the figure. The number of error flags was from 80 to 120 out of 16,384 flags, only a 0.6% of the total. The occurrence of such error bits is anticipated since we employed analog circuits for median detection. However, such error does not cause any serious problems in the PPED algorithm as demonstrated in Figs. 10 and 11. The template matching results with the top five PPED vector candidates in Sella identification are demonstrated in Fig. 11, where Manhattan distance was adopted as the dissimilarity measure. The error in the feature map generation processing yields a constant bias to the dissimilarity and does not affect the result of the maximum likelihood search.

A four-stage asynchronous median detection architecture based on analog digital mixed-signal circuits has been introduced. As a result, a fully seamless pipeline processing from threshold detection to edge feature map generation has been established. A prototype chip was designed in a 0.35-µm CMOS technology and the fab- ricated chip generates an edge based image vector every 80 µsec, which is about 10 4 times faster than the software computation.

<p>Author: Noam Shental, Aharon Bar-hillel, Tomer Hertz, Daphna Weinshall</p><p>Abstract: Density estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models is a popular generative technique used also for clustering. We develop a framework to incorporate side information in the form of equivalence constraints into the model estimation procedure. Equivalence constraints are deﬁned on pairs of data points, indicating whether the points arise from the same source (positive constraints) or from different sources (negative constraints). Such constraints can be gathered automatically in some learning problems, and are a natural form of supervision in others. For the estimation of model parameters we present a closed form EM procedure which handles positive constraints, and a Generalized EM procedure using a Markov net which handles negative constraints. Using publicly available data sets we demonstrate that such side information can lead to considerable improvement in clustering tasks, and that our algorithm is preferable to two other suggested methods using the same type of side information.</p><p>3 0.68760312 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Process_Latent_Variable_Models_for_Visualisation_of_High_Dimensional_Data.html">77 nips-2003-Gaussian Process Latent Variable Models for Visualisation of High Dimensional Data</a></p>
<p>Author: Neil D. Lawrence</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce a new underlying probabilistic model for principal component analysis (PCA). Our formulation interprets PCA as a particular Gaussian process prior on a mapping from a latent space to the observed data-space. We show that if the prior’s covariance function constrains the mappings to be linear the model is equivalent to PCA, we then extend the model by considering less restrictive covariance functions which allow non-linear mappings. This more general Gaussian process latent variable model (GPLVM) is then evaluated as an approach to the visualisation of high dimensional data for three different data-sets. Additionally our non-linear algorithm can be further kernelised leading to ‘twin kernel PCA’ in which a mapping between feature spaces occurs.</p><p>4 0.67233312 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Learning_with_Local_and_Global_Consistency.html">113 nips-2003-Learning with Local and Global Consistency</a></p>
<p>Author: Dengyong Zhou, Olivier Bousquet, Thomas N. Lal, Jason Weston, Bernhard Schölkopf</p><p>Abstract: We consider the general problem of learning from labeled and unlabeled data, which is often called semi-supervised learning or transductive inference. A principled approach to semi-supervised learning is to design a classifying function which is sufﬁciently smooth with respect to the intrinsic structure collectively revealed by known labeled and unlabeled points. We present a simple algorithm to obtain such a smooth solution. Our method yields encouraging experimental results on a number of classiﬁcation problems and demonstrates effective use of unlabeled data. 1</p><p>5 0.67141569 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Invariant_Pattern_Recognition_by_Semi-Definite_Programming_Machines.html">96 nips-2003-Invariant Pattern Recognition by Semi-Definite Programming Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge about local invariances with respect to given pattern transformations can greatly improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation. Previous approaches are either based on regularisation or on the generation of virtual (transformed) examples. We develop a new framework for learning linear classiﬁers under known transformations based on semideﬁnite programming. We present a new learning algorithm— the Semideﬁnite Programming Machine (SDPM)—which is able to ﬁnd a maximum margin hyperplane when the training examples are polynomial trajectories instead of single points. The solution is found to be sparse in dual variables and allows to identify those points on the trajectory with minimal real-valued output as virtual support vectors. Extensions to segments of trajectories, to more than one transformation parameter, and to learning with kernels are discussed. In experiments we use a Taylor expansion to locally approximate rotational invariance in pixel images from USPS and ﬁnd improvements over known methods. 1</p><p>6 0.67083317 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Applying_Metric-Trees_to_Belief-Point_POMDPs.html">29 nips-2003-Applying Metric-Trees to Belief-Point POMDPs</a></p>

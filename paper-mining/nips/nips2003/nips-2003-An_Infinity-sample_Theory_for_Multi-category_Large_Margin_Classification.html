These methods can be considered as natural extensions to binary large margin classiﬁcation. We establish conditions that guarantee the inﬁnity-sample consistency of classiﬁers obtained in the risk minimization framework. Examples are provided for two speciﬁc forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to obtain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information will be useful for statistical inferencing tasks beyond classiﬁcation. 1 Motivation Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem where we want to predict label y ∈ {±1} based on observation x. One of the most signiﬁcant achievements for binary classiﬁcation in machine learning is the invention of large margin methods, which include support vector machines and boosting algorithms. Based on a set of observations (X1 , Y1 ), . . . , (Xn , Yn ), ˆ a large margin classiﬁcation algorithm produces a decision function fn by empirically minimizing a loss function that is often a convex upper bound of the binary classiﬁcation error ˆ ˆ function. Given fn , the binary decision rule is to predict y = 1 if fn (x) ≥ 0, and to predict ˆ y = −1 otherwise (the decision rule at fn (x) = 0 is not important). In the literature, the following form of large margin binary classiﬁcation is often encountered: we minimize the empirical risk associated with a convex function φ in a pre-chosen function class Cn : 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n φ(f (Xi )Yi ). (1) i=1 Originally such a scheme was regarded as a compromise to avoid computational difﬁculties associated with direct classiﬁcation error minimization, which often leads to an NP-hard problem. The current view in the statistical literature interprets such methods as algorithms to obtain conditional probability estimates. For example, see [3, 6, 9, 11] for some related studies. This point of view allows people to show the consistency of various large margin methods: that is, in the large sample limit, the obtained classiﬁers achieve the optimal Bayes error rate. For example, see [1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11]. The consistency of a learning method is certainly a very desirable property, and one may argue that a good classiﬁcation method should be consistent in the large sample limit. Although statistical properties of binary classiﬁcation algorithms based on the risk minimization formulation (1) are quite well-understood due to many recent works such as those mentioned above, there are much fewer studies on risk minimization based multicategory problems which generalizes the binary large margin method (1). The complexity of possible generalizations may be one reason. Another reason may be that one can always estimate the conditional probability for a multi-category problem using the binary classiﬁcation formulation (1) for each category, and then pick the category with the highest estimated conditional probability (or score).1 However, it is still useful to understand whether there are more natural alternatives, and what kind of risk minimization formulation which generalizes (1) can be used to yield consistent classiﬁers in the large sample limit. An important step toward this direction has recently been taken in [5], where the authors proposed a multi-category extension of the support vector machine that is Bayes consistent (note that there were a number of earlier proposals that were not consistent). The purpose of this paper is to generalize their investigation so as to include a much wider class of risk minimization formulations that can lead to consistent classiﬁers in the inﬁnity-sample limit. We shall see that there is a rich structure in risk minimization based multi-category classiﬁcation formulations. Multi-category large margin methods have started to draw more attention recently. For example, in [2], learning bounds for some multi-category convex risk minimization methods were obtained, although the authors did not study possible choices of Bayes consistent formulations. 2 Multi-category classiﬁcation We consider the following K-class classiﬁcation problem: we would like to predict the label y ∈ {1, . . . , K} of an input vector x. In this paper, we only consider the simplest scenario with 0 − 1 classiﬁcation loss: we have a loss of 0 for correct prediction, and loss of 1 for incorrect prediction. In binary classiﬁcation, the class label can be determined using the sign of a decision function. This can be generalized to K class classiﬁcation problem as follows: we consider K decision functions fc (x) where c = 1, . . . , K and we predict the label y of x as: T (f (x)) = arg max c∈{1,...,K} fc (x), (2) where we denote by f (x) the vector function f (x) = [f1 (x), . . . , fK (x)]. Note that if two or more components of f achieve the same maximum value, then we may choose any of them as T (f ). In this framework, fc (x) is often regarded as a scoring function for category c that is correlated with how likely x belongs to category c (compared with the remaining k − 1 categories). The classiﬁcation error is given by: (f ) = 1 − EX P (Y = T (X)|X). Note that only the relative strength of fc compared with the alternatives is important. In particular, the decision rule given in (2) does not change when we add the same numerical quantity to each component of f (x). This allows us to impose one constraint on the vector f (x) which decreases the degree of freedom K of the K-component vector f (x) to K − 1. 1 This approach is often called one-versus-all or ranking in machine learning. Another main approach is to encode a multi-category classiﬁcation problem into binary classiﬁcation sub-problems. The consistency of such encoding schemes can be difﬁcult to analyze, and we shall not discuss them. For example, in the binary classiﬁcation case, we can enforce f1 (x)+f2 (x) = 0, and hence f (x) can be represented as [f1 (x), −f1 (x)]. The decision rule in (2), which compares f1 (x) ≥ f2 (x), is equivalent to f1 (x) ≥ 0. This leads to the binary classiﬁcation rule mentioned in the introduction. In the multi-category case, one may also interpret the possible constraint on the vector function f , which reduces its degree of freedom from K to K − 1 based on the following reasoning. In many cases, we seek fc (x) as a function of p(Y = c|x). Since we have a K constraint c=1 p(Y = c|x) = 1 (implying that the degree of freedom for p(Y = c|x) is K − 1), the degree of freedom for f is also K − 1 (instead of K). However, we shall point out that in the algorithms we formulate below, we may either enforce such a constraint that reduces the degree of freedom of f , or we do not impose any constraint, which keeps the degree of freedom of f to be K. The advantage of the latter is that it allows the computation of each fc to be decoupled. It is thus much simpler both conceptually and numerically. Moreover, it directly handles multiple-label problems where we may assign each x to multiple labels of y ∈ {1, . . . , K}. In this scenario, we do not have a constraint. In this paper, we consider an empirical risk minimization method to solve a multi-category problem, which is of the following general form: 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n ΨYi (f (Xi )). (3) i=1 As we shall see later, this method is a natural generalization of the binary classiﬁcation method (1). Note that one may consider an even more general form with ΨY (f (X)) replaced by ΨY (f (X), X), which we don’t study in this paper. From the standard learning theory, one can expect that with appropriately chosen Cn , the ˆ ˆ solution fn of (3) approximately minimizes the true risk R(f ) with respect to the unknown underlying distribution within the function class Cn , R(f ) = EX,Y ΨY (f (X)) = EX L(P (·|X), f (X)), (4) where P (·|X) = [P (Y = 1|X), . . . , P (Y = K|X)] is the conditional probability, and K L(q, f ) = qc Ψc (f ). (5) c=1 In order to understand the large sample behavior of the algorithm based on solving (3), we ﬁrst need to understand the behavior of a function f that approximately minimizes R(f ). We introduce the following deﬁnition (also referred to as classiﬁcation calibrated in [1]): Deﬁnition 2.1 Consider Ψc (f ) in (4). We say that the formulation is admissible (classiﬁcation calibrated) on a closed set Ω ⊆ [−∞, ∞]K if the following conditions hold: ∀c, Ψc (·) : Ω → (−∞, ∞] is bounded below and continuous; ∩c {f : Ψc (f ) < ∞} is ∗ ∗ non-empty and dense in Ω; ∀q, if L(q, f ∗ ) = inf f L(q, f ), then fc = supk fk implies qc = supk qk . Since we allow Ψc (f ) = ∞, we use the convention that qc Ψc (f ) = 0 when qc = 0 and Ψc (f ) = ∞. The following result relates the approximate minimization of the Ψ risk to the approximate minimization of classiﬁcation error: Theorem 2.1 Let B be the set of all Borel measurable functions. For a closed set Ω ⊂ [−∞, ∞]K , let BΩ = {f ∈ B : ∀x, f (x) ∈ Ω}. If Ψc (·) is admissible on Ω, then for a Borel measurable distribution, R(f ) → inf g∈BΩ R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). Proof Sketch. First we show that the admissibility implies that ∀ > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that ∀q and x: inf {L(q, f ) : fc = sup fk } ≥ inf L(q, g) + δ. (6) qc ≤supk qk − g∈Ω k m If (6) does not hold, then ∃ > 0, and a sequence of (c , f m , q m ) with f m ∈ Ω such that m m m m fcm = supk fk , qcm ≤ supk qk − , and L(q m , f m ) − inf g∈Ω L(q m , g) → 0. Taking a limit point of (cm , f m , q m ), and using the continuity of Ψc (·), we obtain a contradiction (technical details handling the inﬁnity case are skipped). Therefore (6) must be valid. Now we consider a vector function f (x) ∈ ΩB . Let q(x) = P (·|x). Given X, if P (Y = T (f (X))|X) ≥ P (Y = T (q(X))|X)+ , then equation (6) implies that L(q(X), f (X)) ≥ inf g∈Ω L(q(X), g) + δ. Therefore (f ) − inf (g) =EX [P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X)] g∈B ≤ + EX I(P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X) > ) LX (q(X), f (X)) − inf g∈BΩ LX (q(X), g) ≤ + EX δ R(f ) − inf g∈BΩ R(g) = + . δ In the above derivation we use I to denote the indicator function. Since and δ are arbitrary, we obtain the theorem by letting → 0. 2 Clearly, based on the above theorem, an admissible risk minimization formulation is suitable for multi-category classiﬁcation problems. The classiﬁer obtained from minimizing (3) can approach the Bayes error rate if we can show that with appropriately chosen function class Cn , approximate minimization of (3) implies approximate minimization of (4). Learning bounds of this forms have been very well-studied in statistics and machine learning. For example, for large margin binary classiﬁcation, such bounds can be found in [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 1], where they were used to prove the consistency of various large margin methods. In order to achieve consistency, it is also necessary to take a sequence of function classes Cn (C1 ⊂ C2 ⊂ · · · ) such that ∪n Cn is dense in the set of Borel measurable functions. The set Cn has the effect of regularization, which ensures that ˆ ˆ P R(fn ) ≈ inf f ∈Cn R(f ). It follows that as n → ∞, R(fn ) → inf f ∈B R(f ). Theorem 2.1 ˆ P then implies that (fn ) → inf f ∈B (f ). The purpose of this paper is not to study similar learning bounds that relate approximate minimization of (3) to the approximate minimization of (4). See [2] for a recent investigation. We shall focus on the choices of Ψ that lead to admissible formulations. We pay special attention to the case that each Ψc (f ) is a convex function of f , so that the resulting formulation becomes computational more tractable. Instead of working with the general form of Ψc in (4), we focus on two speciﬁc choices listed in the next two sections. 3 Unconstrained formulations We consider unconstrained formulation with the following choice of Ψ: K Ψc (f ) = φ(fc ) + s t(fk ) , (7) k=1 where φ, s and t are appropriately chosen functions that are continuously differentiable. The ﬁrst term, which has a relatively simple form, depends on the label c. The second term is independent of the label, and can be regarded as a normalization term. Note that this function is symmetric with respect to components of f . This choice treats all potential classes equally. It is also possible to treat different classes differently (e.g. replacing φ(fc ) by φc (fc )), which can be useful if we associate different classiﬁcation loss to different kinds of errors. 3.1 Optimality equation and probability model Using (7), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K L(q, f ) = K qc φ(fc ) + s t(fc ) . c=1 c=1 In the following, we study the property of the optimal vector f ∗ that minimizes L(q, f ) for a ﬁxed q. Given q, the optimal solution f ∗ of L(q, f ) satisﬁes the following ﬁrst order condition: ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + µf ∗ t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (8) where quantity µf ∗ = s ( K k=1 ∗ t(fk )) is independent of k. ∗ Clearly this equation relates qc to fc for each component c. The relationship of q and f ∗ deﬁned by (8) can be regarded as the (inﬁnite sample-size) probability model associated with the learning method (3) with Ψ given by (7). The following result presents a simple criterion to check admissibility. We skip the proof for simplicity. Most of our examples satisfy the condition. Proposition 3.1 Consider (7). Assume Φc (f ) is continuous on [−∞, ∞]K and bounded below. If s (u) ≥ 0 and ∀p > 0, pφ (f ) + t (f ) = 0 has a unique solution fp that is an increasing function of p, then the formulation is admissible. If s(u) = u, the condition ∀p > 0 in Proposition 3.1 can be replaced by ∀p ∈ (0, 1). 3.2 Decoupled formulations We let s(u) = u in (7). The optimality condition (8) becomes ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (9) This means that we have K decoupled equalities, one for each fc . This is the simplest and in the author’s opinion, the most interesting formulation. Since the estimation problem in ˆ (3) is also decoupled into K separate equations, one for each component of fn , this class of methods are computationally relatively simple and easy to parallelize. Although this method seems to be preferable for multi-category problems, it is not the most efﬁcient way for two-class problem (if we want to treat the two classes in a symmetric manner) since we have to solve two separate equations. We only need to deal with one equation in (1) due to the fact that an effective constraint f1 + f2 = 0 can be used to reduce the number of equations. This variable elimination has little impact if there are many categories. In the following, we list some examples of multi-category risk minimization formulations. They all satisfy the admissibility condition in Proposition 3.1. We focus on the relationship of the optimal optimizer function f∗ (q) and the conditional probability q. For simplicity, we focus on the choice φ(u) = −u. 3.2.1 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = eu ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = efc . This formulation is closely related K to the maximum-likelihood estimate with conditional model qc = efc / k=1 efk (logistic regression). In particular, if we choose a function class such that the normalization condiK tion k=1 efk = 1 holds, then the two formulations are identical. However, they become different when we do not impose such a normalization condition. Another very important and closely related formulation is the choice of φ(u) = − ln u and t(u) = u. This is an extension of maximum-likelihood estimate with probability model qc = fc . The resulting method is identical to maximum-likelihood if we choose our function class such that k fk = 1. However, the formulation also allows us to use function classes that do not satisfy the normalization constraint k fk = 1. Therefore this method is more ﬂexible. 3.2.2 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = ln(1 + eu ) This version uses binary logistic regression loss, and we have the following probability ∗ model: qc = (1 + e−fc )−1 . Again this is an unnormalized model. 1 3.2.3 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = p |u|p (p > 1) ∗ ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = sign(fc )|fc |p−1 . This means that at the ∗ ∗ solution, fc ≥ 0. One may modify it such that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the condition probability qc = 0. 3.2.4 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p max(u, 0)p (p > 1) ∗ In this probability model, we have the following relationship: qc = max(fc , 0)p−1 . The ∗ equation implies that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the conditional probability qc = 0. Therefore, with a ﬁxed function class, this model is more powerful than the previous one. How∗ ever, at the optimal solution, fc ≤ 1. This requirement can be further alleviated with the following modiﬁcation. 3.2.5 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p min(max(u, 0)p , p(u − 1) + 1) (p > 1) In this probability model, we have the following relationship at the exact solution: qc = c min(max(f∗ , 0), 1)p−1 . Clearly this model is more powerful than the previous model since ∗ the function value fc ≥ 1 can be used to model qc = 1. 3.3 Coupled formulations In the coupled formulation with s(u) = u, the probability model can be normalized in a certain way. We list a few examples. 3.3.1 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = eu , and s(u) = ln(u) This is the standard logistic regression model. The probability model is: K ∗ qc (x) = exp(fc (x))( ∗ exp(fc (x)))−1 . c=1 The right hand side is always normalized (sum up to 1). Note that the model is not continuous at inﬁnities, and thus not admissible in our deﬁnition. However, we may consider the region Ω = {f : supk fk = 0}, and it is easy to check that this model is admissible in Ω. Ω Let fc = fc − supk fk ∈ Ω, then f Ω has the same decision rule as f and R(f ) = R(f Ω ). Therefore Theorem 2.1 implies that R(f ) → inf g∈B R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). 1 3.3.2 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = |u|p , and s(u) = p |u|p/p (p, p > 1) The probability model is: K ∗ ∗ ∗ |fk (x)|p )(p−p )/p sign(fc (x))|fc (x)|p −1 . qc (x) = ( k=1 We may replace t(u) by t(u) = max(0, u)p , and the probability model becomes: K qc (x) = ( ∗ ∗ max(fk (x), 0)p )(p−p )/p max(fc (x), 0)p −1 . k=1 These formulations do not seem to have advantages over the decoupled counterparts. Note that if we let p → 1, then the sum of the p p -th power of the right hand side → 1. In a −1 way, this means that the model is normalized in the limit of p → 1. 4 Constrained formulations As pointed out, one may impose constraints on possible choices of f . We may impose such a condition when we specify the function class Cn . However, for clarity, we shall directly impose a condition into our formulation. If we impose a constraint into (7), then its effect is rather similar to that of the second term in (7). In this section, we consider a direct extension of binary large-margin method (1) to multi-category case. The choice given below is motivated by [5], where an extension of SVM was proposed. We use a risk formulation that is different from (7), and for simplicity, we will consider linear equality constraint only: K Ψc (f ) = φ(−fk ), s.t. f ∈ Ω, (10) k=1,k=c where we deﬁne Ω as: K Ω = {f : fk = 0} ∪ {f : sup fk = ∞}. k k=1 We may interpret the added constraint as a restriction on the function class Cn in (3) such that every f ∈ Cn satisﬁes the constraint. Note that with K = 2, this leads to the usually binary large margin method. Using (10), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K (1 − qc )φ(−fc ), L(q, f ) = s.t. f ∈ Ω. (11) c=1 The following result provides a simple way to check the admissibility of (10). Proposition 4.1 If φ is a convex function which is bounded below and φ (0) < 0, then (10) is admissible on Ω. Proof Sketch. The continuity condition is straight-forward to verify. We may also assume that φ(·) ≥ 0 without loss of generality. Now let f achieves the minimum of L(q, ·). If fc = ∞, then it is clear that qc = 1 and thus qk = 0 for k = c. This implies that for k = c, φ(−fk ) = inf f φ(−f ), and thus fk < 0. If fc = supk fk < ∞, then the constraint implies fc ≥ 0. It is easy to see that ∀k, qc ≥ qk since otherwise, we must have φ(−fk ) > φ(−fc ), and thus φ (−fk ) > 0 and φ (−fc ) < 0, implying that with sufﬁcient small δ > 0, φ(−(fk + δ)) < φ(−fk ) and φ(−(fc − δ)) < φ(−fc ). A contradiction. 2 Using the above criterion, we can convert any admissible convex φ for the binary formulation (1) into an admissible multi-category classiﬁcation formulation (10). In [5] the special case of SVM (with loss function φ(u) = max(0, 1 − u)) was studied. The authors demonstrated the admissibility by direct calculation, although no results similar to Theorem 2.1 were established. Such a result is needed to prove consistency. The treatment presented here generalizes their study. Note that for the constrained formulation, it is more difﬁcult to relate fc at the optimal solution to a probability model, since such a model will have a much more complicated form compared with the unconstrained counterpart. 5 Conclusion In this paper we proposed a family of risk minimization methods for multi-category classiﬁcation problems, which are natural extensions of binary large margin classiﬁcation methods. We established admissibility conditions that ensure the consistency of the obtained classiﬁers in the large sample limit. Two speciﬁc forms of risk minimization were proposed and examples were given to study the induced probability models. As an implication of this work, we see that it is possible to obtain consistent (conditional) density estimation using various non-maximum likelihood estimation methods. One advantage of some of the newly proposed methods is that they allow us to model zero density directly. Note that for the maximum-likelihood method, near zero density may cause serious robustness problems at least in theory. References [1] P.L. Bartlett, M.I. Jordan, and J.D. McAuliffe.

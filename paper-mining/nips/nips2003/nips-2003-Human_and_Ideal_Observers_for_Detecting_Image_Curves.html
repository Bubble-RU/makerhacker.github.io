<p>Author: Anuj Srivastava, Washington Mio, Xiuwen Liu, Eric Klassen</p><p>Abstract: We present a geometric approach to statistical shape analysis of closed curves in images. The basic idea is to specify a space of closed curves satisfying given constraints, and exploit the differential geometry of this space to solve optimization and inference problems. We demonstrate this approach by: (i) deﬁning and computing statistics of observed shapes, (ii) deﬁning and learning a parametric probability model on shape space, and (iii) designing a binary hypothesis test on this space. 1</p><p>3 0.11881315 <a title="85-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Salient_Boundary_Detection_using_Ratio_Contour.html">168 nips-2003-Salient Boundary Detection using Ratio Contour</a></p>
<p>Author: Song Wang, Toshiro Kubota, Jeffrey M. Siskind</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel graph-theoretic approach, named ratio contour, to extract perceptually salient boundaries from a set of noisy boundary fragments detected in real images. The boundary saliency is deﬁned using the Gestalt laws of closure, proximity, and continuity. This paper ﬁrst constructs an undirected graph with two different sets of edges: solid edges and dashed edges. The weights of solid and dashed edges measure the local saliency in and between boundary fragments, respectively. Then the most salient boundary is detected by searching for an optimal cycle in this graph with minimum average weight. The proposed approach guarantees the global optimality without introducing any biases related to region area or boundary length. We collect a variety of images for testing the proposed approach with encouraging results. 1</p><p>4 0.11770156 <a title="85-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Gene_Expression_Clustering_with_Functional_Mixture_Models.html">79 nips-2003-Gene Expression Clustering with Functional Mixture Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Darya Chudova, Christopher Hart, Eric Mjolsness, Padhraic Smyth</p><p>Abstract: We propose a functional mixture model for simultaneous clustering and alignment of sets of curves measured on a discrete time grid. The model is speciﬁcally tailored to gene expression time course data. Each functional cluster center is a nonlinear combination of solutions of a simple linear differential equation that describes the change of individual mRNA levels when the synthesis and decay rates are constant. The mixture of continuous time parametric functional forms allows one to (a) account for the heterogeneity in the observed proﬁles, (b) align the proﬁles in time by estimating real-valued time shifts, (c) capture the synthesis and decay of mRNA in the course of an experiment, and (d) regularize noisy proﬁles by enforcing smoothness in the mean curves. We derive an EM algorithm for estimating the parameters of the model, and apply the proposed approach to the set of cycling genes in yeast. The experiments show consistent improvement in predictive power and within cluster variance compared to regular Gaussian mixtures. 1</p><p>5 0.099179626 <a title="85-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Using_the_Forest_to_See_the_Trees%3A_A_Graphical_Model_Relating_Features%2C_Objects%2C_and_Scenes.html">192 nips-2003-Using the Forest to See the Trees: A Graphical Model Relating Features, Objects, and Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Salvador Ruiz-correa, Linda G. Shapiro, Marina Meila, Gabriel Berson</p><p>Abstract: We present and empirically test a novel approach for categorizing 3-D free form object shapes represented by range data . In contrast to traditional surface-signature based systems that use alignment to match speciﬁc objects, we adapted the newly introduced symbolic-signature representation to classify deformable shapes [10]. Our approach constructs an abstract description of shape classes using an ensemble of classiﬁers that learn object class parts and their corresponding geometrical relationships from a set of numeric and symbolic descriptors. We used our classiﬁcation engine in a series of large scale discrimination experiments on two well-deﬁned classes that share many common distinctive features. The experimental results suggest that our method outperforms traditional numeric signature-based methodologies. 1 1</p><p>5 0.43274632 <a title="85-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Using_the_Forest_to_See_the_Trees%3A_A_Graphical_Model_Relating_Features%2C_Objects%2C_and_Scenes.html">192 nips-2003-Using the Forest to See the Trees: A Graphical Model Relating Features, Objects, and Scenes</a></p>

<p>Author: Tomohiro Nakatani, Masato Miyoshi, Keisuke Kinoshita</p><p>Abstract: Speech dereverberation is desirable with a view to achieving, for example, robust speech recognition in the real world. However, it is still a challenging problem, especially when using a single microphone. Although blind equalization techniques have been exploited, they cannot deal with speech signals appropriately because their assumptions are not satisﬁed by speech signals. We propose a new dereverberation principle based on an inherent property of speech signals, namely quasi-periodicity. The present methods learn the dereverberation ﬁlter from a lot of speech data with no prior knowledge of the data, and can achieve high quality speech dereverberation especially when the reverberation time is long. 1</p><p>3 0.64349377 <a title="85-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Log-Linear_Models_for_Label_Ranking.html">121 nips-2003-Log-Linear Models for Label Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Ofer Dekel, Yoram Singer, Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Label ranking is the task of inferring a total order over a predeﬁned set of labels for each given instance. We present a general framework for batch learning of label ranking functions from supervised data. We assume that each instance in the training data is associated with a list of preferences over the label-set, however we do not assume that this list is either complete or consistent. This enables us to accommodate a variety of ranking problems. In contrast to the general form of the supervision, our goal is to learn a ranking function that induces a total order over the entire set of labels. Special cases of our setting are multilabel categorization and hierarchical classiﬁcation. We present a general boosting-based learning algorithm for the label ranking problem and prove a lower bound on the progress of each boosting iteration. The applicability of our approach is demonstrated with a set of experiments on a large-scale text corpus. 1</p><p>4 0.62870407 <a title="85-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Margin_Maximizing_Loss_Functions.html">122 nips-2003-Margin Maximizing Loss Functions</a></p>
<p>Author: Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Margin maximizing properties play an important role in the analysis of classi£cation models, such as boosting and support vector machines. Margin maximization is theoretically interesting because it facilitates generalization error analysis, and practically interesting because it presents a clear geometric interpretation of the models being built. We formulate and prove a suf£cient condition for the solutions of regularized loss functions to converge to margin maximizing separators, as the regularization vanishes. This condition covers the hinge loss of SVM, the exponential loss of AdaBoost and logistic regression loss. We also generalize it to multi-class classi£cation problems, and present margin maximizing multiclass versions of logistic regression and support vector machines. 1</p><p>5 0.4878934 <a title="85-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Dynamics_of_Boosting.html">143 nips-2003-On the Dynamics of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Ingrid Daubechies, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: In order to understand AdaBoost’s dynamics, especially its ability to maximize margins, we derive an associated simpliﬁed nonlinear iterated map and analyze its behavior in low-dimensional cases. We ﬁnd stable cycles for these cases, which can explicitly be used to solve for AdaBoost’s output. By considering AdaBoost as a dynamical system, we are able to prove R¨ tsch and Warmuth’s conjecture that AdaBoost may fail a to converge to a maximal-margin combined classiﬁer when given a ‘nonoptimal’ weak learning algorithm. AdaBoost is known to be a coordinate descent method, but other known algorithms that explicitly aim to maximize the margin (such as AdaBoost∗ and arc-gv) are not. We consider a differentiable function for which coordinate ascent will yield a maximum margin solution. We then make a simple approximation to derive a new boosting algorithm whose updates are slightly more aggressive than those of arc-gv. 1</p><p>6 0.4869397 <a title="85-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Image_Reconstruction_by_Linear_Programming.html">88 nips-2003-Image Reconstruction by Linear Programming</a></p>

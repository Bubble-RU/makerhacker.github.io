<p>Author: Harald Steck, Tommi S. Jaakkola</p><p>Abstract: The bootstrap has become a popular method for exploring model (structure) uncertainty. Our experiments with artiﬁcial and realworld data demonstrate that the graphs learned from bootstrap samples can be severely biased towards too complex graphical models. Accounting for this bias is hence essential, e.g., when exploring model uncertainty. We ﬁnd that this bias is intimately tied to (well-known) spurious dependences induced by the bootstrap. The leading-order bias-correction equals one half of Akaike’s penalty for model complexity. We demonstrate the eﬀect of this simple bias-correction in our experiments. We also relate this bias to the bias of the plug-in estimator for entropy, as well as to the diﬀerence between the expected test and training errors of a graphical model, which asymptotically equals Akaike’s penalty (rather than one half). 1</p><p>3 0.12430632 <a title="31-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-1-norm_Support_Vector_Machines.html">1 nips-2003-1-norm Support Vector Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Margin maximizing properties play an important role in the analysis of classi£cation models, such as boosting and support vector machines. Margin maximization is theoretically interesting because it facilitates generalization error analysis, and practically interesting because it presents a clear geometric interpretation of the models being built. We formulate and prove a suf£cient condition for the solutions of regularized loss functions to converge to margin maximizing separators, as the regularization vanishes. This condition covers the hinge loss of SVM, the exponential loss of AdaBoost and logistic regression loss. We also generalize it to multi-class classi£cation problems, and present margin maximizing multiclass versions of logistic regression and support vector machines. 1</p><p>6 0.10591004 <a title="31-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Laplace_Propagation.html">100 nips-2003-Laplace Propagation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yoshua Bengio, Yves Grandvalet</p><p>Abstract: Most machine learning researchers perform quantitative experiments to estimate generalization error and compare algorithm performances. In order to draw statistically convincing conclusions, it is important to estimate the uncertainty of such estimates. This paper studies the estimation of uncertainty around the K-fold cross-validation estimator. The main theorem shows that there exists no universal unbiased estimator of the variance of K-fold cross-validation. An analysis based on the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix of errors helps to better understand the nature of the problem and shows that naive estimators may grossly underestimate variance, as con£rmed by numerical experiments. 1</p><p>4 0.3427138 <a title="31-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-1-norm_Support_Vector_Machines.html">1 nips-2003-1-norm Support Vector Machines</a></p>

It is based on the propagation of mean and variance derived from the Laplace approximation of conditional probabilities in factorizing distributions, much akin to Minka’s Expectation Propagation. In the jointly normal case, it coincides with the latter and belief propagation, whereas in the general case, it provides an optimization strategy containing Support Vector chunking, the Bayes Committee Machine, and Gaussian Process chunking as special cases. 1</p><p>6 0.28201148 <a title="31-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Invariant_Pattern_Recognition_by_Semi-Definite_Programming_Machines.html">96 nips-2003-Invariant Pattern Recognition by Semi-Definite Programming Machines</a></p>

<p>Author: J. A. Bagnell, Sham M. Kakade, Jeff G. Schneider, Andrew Y. Ng</p><p>Abstract: We consider the policy search approach to reinforcement learning. We show that if a “baseline distribution” is given (indicating roughly how often we expect a good policy to visit each state), then we can derive a policy search algorithm that terminates in a ﬁnite number of steps, and for which we can provide non-trivial performance guarantees. We also demonstrate this algorithm on several grid-world POMDPs, a planar biped walking robot, and a double-pole balancing problem. 1</p><p>3 0.5973891 <a title="31-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Eye_Movements_for_Reward_Maximization.html">68 nips-2003-Eye Movements for Reward Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Sprague, Dana Ballard</p><p>Abstract: Recent eye tracking studies in natural tasks suggest that there is a tight link between eye movements and goal directed motor actions. However, most existing models of human eye movements provide a bottom up account that relates visual attention to attributes of the visual scene. The purpose of this paper is to introduce a new model of human eye movements that directly ties eye movements to the ongoing demands of behavior. The basic idea is that eye movements serve to reduce uncertainty about environmental variables that are task relevant. A value is assigned to an eye movement by estimating the expected cost of the uncertainty that will result if the movement is not made. If there are several candidate eye movements, the one with the highest expected value is chosen. The model is illustrated using a humanoid graphic ﬁgure that navigates on a sidewalk in a virtual urban environment. Simulations show our protocol is superior to a simple round robin scheduling mechanism. 1</p><p>4 0.50522393 <a title="31-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-A_Kullback-Leibler_Divergence_Based_Kernel_for_SVM_Classification_in_Multimedia_Applications.html">9 nips-2003-A Kullback-Leibler Divergence Based Kernel for SVM Classification in Multimedia Applications</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro J. Moreno, Purdy P. Ho, Nuno Vasconcelos</p><p>Abstract: Over the last years signiﬁcant efforts have been made to develop kernels that can be applied to sequence data such as DNA, text, speech, video and images. The Fisher Kernel and similar variants have been suggested as good ways to combine an underlying generative model in the feature space and discriminant classiﬁers such as SVM’s. In this paper we suggest an alternative procedure to the Fisher kernel for systematically ﬁnding kernel functions that naturally handle variable length sequence data in multimedia domains. In particular for domains such as speech and images we explore the use of kernel functions that take full advantage of well known probabilistic models such as Gaussian Mixtures and single full covariance Gaussian models. We derive a kernel distance based on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between generative models. In effect our approach combines the best of both generative and discriminative methods and replaces the standard SVM kernels. We perform experiments on speaker identiﬁcation/veriﬁcation and image classiﬁcation tasks and show that these new kernels have the best performance in speaker veriﬁcation and mostly outperform the Fisher kernel based SVM’s and the generative classiﬁers in speaker identiﬁcation and image classiﬁcation. 1</p><p>5 0.50401545 <a title="31-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Invariant_Pattern_Recognition_by_Semi-Definite_Programming_Machines.html">96 nips-2003-Invariant Pattern Recognition by Semi-Definite Programming Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Thore Graepel, Ralf Herbrich</p><p>Abstract: Knowledge about local invariances with respect to given pattern transformations can greatly improve the accuracy of classiﬁcation. Previous approaches are either based on regularisation or on the generation of virtual (transformed) examples. We develop a new framework for learning linear classiﬁers under known transformations based on semideﬁnite programming. We present a new learning algorithm— the Semideﬁnite Programming Machine (SDPM)—which is able to ﬁnd a maximum margin hyperplane when the training examples are polynomial trajectories instead of single points. The solution is found to be sparse in dual variables and allows to identify those points on the trajectory with minimal real-valued output as virtual support vectors. Extensions to segments of trajectories, to more than one transformation parameter, and to learning with kernels are discussed. In experiments we use a Taylor expansion to locally approximate rotational invariance in pixel images from USPS and ﬁnd improvements over known methods. 1</p><p>6 0.50301534 <a title="31-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Dynamical_Modeling_with_Kernels_for_Nonlinear_Time_Series_Prediction.html">57 nips-2003-Dynamical Modeling with Kernels for Nonlinear Time Series Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Anuj Srivastava, Washington Mio, Xiuwen Liu, Eric Klassen</p><p>Abstract: We present a geometric approach to statistical shape analysis of closed curves in images. The basic idea is to specify a space of closed curves satisfying given constraints, and exploit the differential geometry of this space to solve optimization and inference problems. We demonstrate this approach by: (i) deﬁning and computing statistics of observed shapes, (ii) deﬁning and learning a parametric probability model on shape space, and (iii) designing a binary hypothesis test on this space. 1</p><p>3 0.17739043 <a title="106-tfidf-3" href="./nips-2003-Factorization_with_Uncertainty_and_Missing_Data%3A_Exploiting_Temporal_Coherence.html">69 nips-2003-Factorization with Uncertainty and Missing Data: Exploiting Temporal Coherence</a></p>
<p>Author: Amit Gruber, Yair Weiss</p><p>Abstract: The problem of “Structure From Motion” is a central problem in vision: given the 2D locations of certain points we wish to recover the camera motion and the 3D coordinates of the points. Under simpliﬁed camera models, the problem reduces to factorizing a measurement matrix into the product of two low rank matrices. Each element of the measurement matrix contains the position of a point in a particular image. When all elements are observed, the problem can be solved trivially using SVD, but in any realistic situation many elements of the matrix are missing and the ones that are observed have a diﬀerent directional uncertainty. Under these conditions, most existing factorization algorithms fail while human perception is relatively unchanged. In this paper we use the well known EM algorithm for factor analysis to perform factorization. This allows us to easily handle missing data and measurement uncertainty and more importantly allows us to place a prior on the temporal trajectory of the latent variables (the camera position). We show that incorporating this prior gives a signiﬁcant improvement in performance in challenging image sequences. 1</p><p>4 0.14656563 <a title="106-tfidf-4" href="./nips-2003-Discriminating_Deformable_Shape_Classes.html">53 nips-2003-Discriminating Deformable Shape Classes</a></p>
<p>Author: Salvador Ruiz-correa, Linda G. Shapiro, Marina Meila, Gabriel Berson</p><p>Abstract: We present and empirically test a novel approach for categorizing 3-D free form object shapes represented by range data . In contrast to traditional surface-signature based systems that use alignment to match speciﬁc objects, we adapted the newly introduced symbolic-signature representation to classify deformable shapes [10]. Our approach constructs an abstract description of shape classes using an ensemble of classiﬁers that learn object class parts and their corresponding geometrical relationships from a set of numeric and symbolic descriptors. We used our classiﬁcation engine in a series of large scale discrimination experiments on two well-deﬁned classes that share many common distinctive features. The experimental results suggest that our method outperforms traditional numeric signature-based methodologies. 1 1</p><p>5 0.13253647 <a title="106-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Estimating_Internal_Variables_and_Paramters_of_a_Learning_Agent_by_a_Particle_Filter.html">64 nips-2003-Estimating Internal Variables and Paramters of a Learning Agent by a Particle Filter</a></p>
<p>Author: Kazuyuki Samejima, Kenji Doya, Yasumasa Ueda, Minoru Kimura</p><p>Abstract: When we model a higher order functions, such as learning and memory, we face a difﬁculty of comparing neural activities with hidden variables that depend on the history of sensory and motor signals and the dynamics of the network. Here, we propose novel method for estimating hidden variables of a learning agent, such as connection weights from sequences of observable variables. Bayesian estimation is a method to estimate the posterior probability of hidden variables from observable data sequence using a dynamic model of hidden and observable variables. In this paper, we apply particle ﬁlter for estimating internal parameters and metaparameters of a reinforcement learning model. We veriﬁed the effectiveness of the method using both artiﬁcial data and real animal behavioral data. 1</p><p>6 0.13048568 <a title="106-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Insights_from_Machine_Learning_Applied_to_Human_Visual_Classification.html">95 nips-2003-Insights from Machine Learning Applied to Human Visual Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Ingrid Daubechies, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: In order to understand AdaBoost’s dynamics, especially its ability to maximize margins, we derive an associated simpliﬁed nonlinear iterated map and analyze its behavior in low-dimensional cases. We ﬁnd stable cycles for these cases, which can explicitly be used to solve for AdaBoost’s output. By considering AdaBoost as a dynamical system, we are able to prove R¨ tsch and Warmuth’s conjecture that AdaBoost may fail a to converge to a maximal-margin combined classiﬁer when given a ‘nonoptimal’ weak learning algorithm. AdaBoost is known to be a coordinate descent method, but other known algorithms that explicitly aim to maximize the margin (such as AdaBoost∗ and arc-gv) are not. We consider a differentiable function for which coordinate ascent will yield a maximum margin solution. We then make a simple approximation to derive a new boosting algorithm whose updates are slightly more aggressive than those of arc-gv. 1</p><p>6 0.31051677 <a title="106-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Boosting_versus_Covering.html">41 nips-2003-Boosting versus Covering</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaofei He, Partha Niyogi</p><p>Abstract: Many problems in information processing involve some form of dimensionality reduction. In this paper, we introduce Locality Preserving Projections (LPP). These are linear projective maps that arise by solving a variational problem that optimally preserves the neighborhood structure of the data set. LPP should be seen as an alternative to Principal Component Analysis (PCA) – a classical linear technique that projects the data along the directions of maximal variance. When the high dimensional data lies on a low dimensional manifold embedded in the ambient space, the Locality Preserving Projections are obtained by ﬁnding the optimal linear approximations to the eigenfunctions of the Laplace Beltrami operator on the manifold. As a result, LPP shares many of the data representation properties of nonlinear techniques such as Laplacian Eigenmaps or Locally Linear Embedding. Yet LPP is linear and more crucially is deﬁned everywhere in ambient space rather than just on the training data points. This is borne out by illustrative examples on some high dimensional data sets.</p><p>3 0.41062099 <a title="106-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Factorization_with_Uncertainty_and_Missing_Data%3A_Exploiting_Temporal_Coherence.html">69 nips-2003-Factorization with Uncertainty and Missing Data: Exploiting Temporal Coherence</a></p>

We do this using a formalism that models the generation of annotated images. We assume that every image is divided into regions, each described by a continuous-valued feature vector. Given a training set of images with annotations, we compute a joint probabilistic model of image features and words which allow us to predict the probability of generating a word given the image regions. This may be used to automatically annotate and retrieve images given a word as a query. Experiments show that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms the best of the previously reported results on the tasks of automatic image annotation and retrieval. 1</p><p>5 0.40023685 <a title="106-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-On_the_Dynamics_of_Boosting.html">143 nips-2003-On the Dynamics of Boosting</a></p>
<p>Author: Cynthia Rudin, Ingrid Daubechies, Robert E. Schapire</p><p>Abstract: In order to understand AdaBoost’s dynamics, especially its ability to maximize margins, we derive an associated simpliﬁed nonlinear iterated map and analyze its behavior in low-dimensional cases. We ﬁnd stable cycles for these cases, which can explicitly be used to solve for AdaBoost’s output. By considering AdaBoost as a dynamical system, we are able to prove R¨ tsch and Warmuth’s conjecture that AdaBoost may fail a to converge to a maximal-margin combined classiﬁer when given a ‘nonoptimal’ weak learning algorithm. AdaBoost is known to be a coordinate descent method, but other known algorithms that explicitly aim to maximize the margin (such as AdaBoost∗ and arc-gv) are not. We consider a differentiable function for which coordinate ascent will yield a maximum margin solution. We then make a simple approximation to derive a new boosting algorithm whose updates are slightly more aggressive than those of arc-gv. 1</p><p>6 0.3951689 <a title="106-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Simplicial_Mixtures_of_Markov_Chains%3A_Distributed_Modelling_of_Dynamic_User_Profiles.html">177 nips-2003-Simplicial Mixtures of Markov Chains: Distributed Modelling of Dynamic User Profiles</a></p>

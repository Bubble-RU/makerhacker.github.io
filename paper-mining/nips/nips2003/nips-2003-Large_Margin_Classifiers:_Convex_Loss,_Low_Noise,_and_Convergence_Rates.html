</p><p>2 edu  Abstract Many classiﬁcation algorithms, including the support vector machine, boosting and logistic regression, can be viewed as minimum contrast methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the 0-1 loss function. [sent-6, score-0.704]
</p><p>3 We characterize the statistical consequences of using such a surrogate by providing a general quantitative relationship between the risk as assessed using the 0-1 loss and the risk as assessed using any nonnegative surrogate loss function. [sent-7, score-1.752]
</p><p>4 We show that this relationship gives nontrivial bounds under the weakest possible condition on the loss function—that it satisfy a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classiﬁcation. [sent-8, score-0.752]
</p><p>5 The relationship is based on a variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications. [sent-9, score-0.449]
</p><p>6 Finally, we present applications of our results to the estimation of convergence rates in the general setting of function classes that are scaled hulls of a ﬁnite-dimensional base class. [sent-11, score-0.168]
</p><p>7 In particular, a wide variety of two-class classiﬁcation methods choose a real-valued classiﬁer f based on the minimization of a convex surrogate φ(yf (x)) in the place of an intractable loss function 1(sign(f (x)) = y). [sent-13, score-0.729]
</p><p>8 Examples of this tactic include the support vector machine, AdaBoost, and logistic regression, which are based on the exponential loss, the hinge loss and the logistic loss, respectively. [sent-14, score-0.464]
</p><p>9 What are the statistical consequences of choosing models and estimation procedures so as to exploit the computational advantages of convexity? [sent-15, score-0.099]
</p><p>10 In particular, it is possible to demonstrate the Bayes-risk consistency of methods based on minimizing convex surrogates for 0-1 loss, with appropriate regularization. [sent-17, score-0.305]
</p><p>11 Lugosi and Vayatis (2003) have provided such a result for any differentiable, monotone, strictly convex loss function φ that satisﬁes φ(0) = 1. [sent-18, score-0.585]
</p><p>12 Steinwart (2002) has demonstrated consistency for the SVM as well, where F is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space and φ is continuous. [sent-20, score-0.134]
</p><p>13 Other results on Bayes-risk consistency have been presented by Jiang (2003), Zhang (2003), and Mannor et al. [sent-21, score-0.134]
</p><p>14 To carry this agenda further, it is necessary to ﬁnd general quantitative relationships between the approximation and estimation errors associated with φ, and those associated with 0-1 loss. [sent-23, score-0.117]
</p><p>15 We simplify and extend Zhang’s results, developing a general methodology for ﬁnding quantitative relationships between the risk associated with φ and the risk associated with 0-1 loss. [sent-25, score-0.645]
</p><p>16 In particular, let R(f ) denote the risk based on 0-1 loss and let R∗ = inf f R(f ) denote the Bayes risk. [sent-26, score-0.807]
</p><p>17 Similarly, let us refer to Rφ (f ) = Eφ(Y f (X)) ∗ as the “φ-risk,” and let Rφ = inf f Rφ (f ) denote the “optimal φ-risk. [sent-27, score-0.19]
</p><p>18 ” We show that, for all measurable f , ∗ ψ(R(f ) − R∗ ) ≤ Rφ (f ) − Rφ , (1) for a nondecreasing function ψ : [0, 1] → [0, ∞), and that no better bound is possible. [sent-28, score-0.209]
</p><p>19 This result suggests that if ψ is well-behaved then minimization of Rφ (f ) may provide a reasonable surrogate for minimization of R(f ). [sent-30, score-0.252]
</p><p>20 Moreover, the result provides a quantitative ∗ way to transfer assessments of statistical error in terms of “excess φ-risk” R φ (f ) − Rφ into ∗ assessments of error in terms of “excess risk” R(f ) − R . [sent-31, score-0.249]
</p><p>21 Although our principal goal is to understand the implications of convexity in classiﬁcation, we do not impose a convexity assumption on φ at the outset. [sent-32, score-0.652]
</p><p>22 Indeed, while conditions such as convexity, continuity, and differentiability of φ are easy to verify and have natural relationships to optimization procedures, it is not immediately obvious how to relate such conditions to their statistical consequences. [sent-33, score-0.226]
</p><p>23 Thus, in Section 2 we consider the weakest possible condition on φ—that it is “classiﬁcation-calibrated,” which is essentially a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classiﬁcation. [sent-34, score-0.318]
</p><p>24 We show that minimizing φ-risk leads to minimal risk precisely when φ is classiﬁcation-calibrated. [sent-35, score-0.283]
</p><p>25 We show that in this setting we are able to obtain an improvement in the relationship between excess φ-risk and excess risk. [sent-37, score-0.573]
</p><p>26 Section 4 turns to the estimation of convergence rates for empirical φ-risk minimization in the low noise setting. [sent-38, score-0.285]
</p><p>27 We ﬁnd that for convex φ satisfying a certain uniform convexity condition, empirical φ-risk minimization yields convergence of misclassiﬁcation risk to that of the best-performing classiﬁer in F, and the rate of convergence can be strictly faster than the classical parametric rate of n−1/2 . [sent-39, score-1.277]
</p><p>28 We give estimates for this error that are valid for any measurable function. [sent-42, score-0.187]
</p><p>29 Deﬁne the Bayes risk R∗ = inf f R(f ), where the inﬁmum is over all measurable f . [sent-57, score-0.625]
</p><p>30 For η ∈ [0, 1], deﬁne the optimal conditional φ-risk  H(η) = inf Cη (α) = inf (ηφ(α) + (1 − η)φ(−α)). [sent-67, score-0.38]
</p><p>31 α∈  ¡  ¡  α∈  ∗ Then the optimal φ-risk satisﬁes Rφ := inf f Rφ (f ) = EH(η(X)), where the inﬁmum is over measurable functions. [sent-68, score-0.342]
</p><p>32 For η ∈ [0, 1], deﬁne  H − (η) =  inf  α:α(2η−1)≤0  Cη (α) =  inf  α:α(2η−1)≤0  (ηφ(α) + (1 − η)φ(−α)). [sent-69, score-0.38]
</p><p>33 This is the optimal value of the conditional φ-risk, under the constraint that the sign of the argument α disagrees with that of 2η − 1. [sent-70, score-0.241]
</p><p>34 We now turn to the basic condition we impose on φ. [sent-71, score-0.085]
</p><p>35 This condition generalizes the requirement that the minimizer of Cη (α) (if it exists) has the correct sign. [sent-72, score-0.171]
</p><p>36 This is a minimal condition that can be viewed as a form of Fisher consistency for classiﬁcation (Lin, 2001). [sent-73, score-0.219]
</p><p>37 The following functional transform of the loss function will be useful in our main result. [sent-76, score-0.334]
</p><p>38 We deﬁne the ψ-transform of a loss function as follows. [sent-78, score-0.334]
</p><p>39 Equivalently, the epigraph of g ∗∗ is the closure of the convex hull of the epigraph of g. [sent-80, score-0.327]
</p><p>40 We calculate the ψ-transform for exponential loss, logistic loss, quadratic loss and truncated quadratic loss, tabulating the results in Table 1. [sent-83, score-0.634]
</p><p>41 All of these loss functions can be veriﬁed to be classiﬁcation-calibrated. [sent-84, score-0.367]
</p><p>42 φ(α) exponential logistic quadratic truncated quadratic  ψ(θ)  e−α ln(1 + e  −2α  )  (1 − α)2 (max{0, 1 − α})2  1−  LB  δ( )  √  eB  e−B 2 /8  θ  2  e−2B 2 /4  θ2 θ2  2(B + 1) 2(B + 1)  1 − θ2  2 2  /4 /4  Table 1: Four convex loss functions and the corresponding ψ-transform. [sent-87, score-0.838]
</p><p>43 On the interval [−B, B], each loss function has the indicated Lipschitz constant LB and modulus of convexity δ( ) with respect to dφ . [sent-88, score-0.894]
</p><p>44 For any nonnegative loss function φ, any measurable f : X → and any probability distribution on X × {±1}, ∗ ψ(R(f ) − R∗ ) ≤ Rφ (f ) − Rφ . [sent-92, score-0.564]
</p><p>45 For any nonnegative loss function φ, any > 0 and any θ ∈ [0, 1], there is a probability distribution on X × {±1} and a function f : X → ∗ such that R(f ) − R∗ = θ and ψ(θ) ≤ Rφ (f ) − Rφ ≤ ψ(θ) + . [sent-95, score-0.412]
</p><p>46 (c) For every sequence of measurable functions fi : X → and every proba∗ bility distribution on X × {±1}, Rφ (fi ) → Rφ implies R(fi ) → R∗ . [sent-100, score-0.269]
</p><p>47 Remark: It can be shown that classiﬁcation-calibration implies ψ is invertible on [0, 1], in ∗ which case it is meaningful to write the upper bound on excess risk as ψ −1 (Rφ (f ) − Rφ ). [sent-101, score-0.695]
</p><p>48 Remark: Zhang (2003) has given a comparison theorem like Part 1, for convex φ that satisfy certain conditions. [sent-102, score-0.252]
</p><p>49 Then it is ∗ ˜ ˜ easy to verify that Rφ (f ) − Rφ ≤ γ ψ(α1 ) + (1 − γ)ψ(α2 ) + /2 ≤ ψ(θ) + . [sent-130, score-0.1]
</p><p>50 For Part 3, ﬁrst note that, for any φ, ψ is continuous on [0, 1] and ψ(0) = 0 by Lemma 4, part 6, and hence θi → 0 implies ψ(θi ) → 0. [sent-132, score-0.092]
</p><p>51 Thus, we can replace condition (3b) by    (3b’) For any sequence (θi ) in [0, 1], ψ(θi ) → 0 implies θi → 0 . [sent-133, score-0.137]
</p><p>52 Deﬁne c = lim sup θi > 0, and pass to a subsequence with lim θi = c. [sent-135, score-0.102]
</p><p>53 Then lim ψ(θi ) = ψ(c) by continuity, and ψ(c) > 0 by classiﬁcation-calibration (Lemma 4, part 7). [sent-136, score-0.091]
</p><p>54 It shows that if φ is convex, the classiﬁcationcalibration condition is easy to verify and the ψ transform is a little easier to compute. [sent-142, score-0.185]
</p><p>55 All of the classiﬁcation procedures mentioned in earlier sections utilize surrogate loss functions which are either upper bounds on 0-1 loss or can be transformed into upper bounds via a positive scaling factor. [sent-149, score-0.935]
</p><p>56 3 Tighter bounds under low noise conditions In a study of the convergence rate of empirical risk minimization, Tsybakov (2001) provided a useful condition on the behavior of the posterior probability near the optimal decision boundary {x : η(x) = 1/2}. [sent-153, score-0.583]
</p><p>57 Tsybakov’s condition is useful in our setting as well; as we show in this section, it allows us to obtain a reﬁnement of Theorem 3. [sent-154, score-0.085]
</p><p>58 We say that P has noise exponent α ≥ 0 if there is a c > 0 such that every measurable f : X → has α PX (sign(f (X)) = sign(η(X) − 1/2)) ≤ c (R(f ) − R∗ ) . [sent-156, score-0.291]
</p><p>59 On the other hand, it is easy to verify that α = 1 if and only if |2η(X) − 1| ≥ 1/c a. [sent-159, score-0.1]
</p><p>60 Suppose P has noise exponent 0 < α ≤ 1, and φ is classiﬁcation-calibrated. [sent-163, score-0.105]
</p><p>61 4 Estimation rates ˆ Large margin algorithms choose f from a class F to minimize empirical φ-risk, 1 ˆ ˆ Rφ (f ) = Eφ(Y f (X)) = n  n  φ(Yi f (Xi )). [sent-167, score-0.151]
</p><p>62 i=1  We have seen how the excess risk depends on the excess φ-risk. [sent-168, score-0.819]
</p><p>63 In this section, we examine ∗ ˆ ˆ the convergence of f ’s excess φ-risk, Rφ (f ) − Rφ . [sent-169, score-0.336]
</p><p>64 We can split this excess risk into an estimation error term and an approximation error term: ∗ ∗ ˆ ˆ Rφ (f ) − Rφ = (Rφ (f ) − inf Rφ (f )) + ( inf Rφ (f ) − Rφ ). [sent-170, score-1.039]
</p><p>65 For simplicity, we assume throughout that some f ∗ ∈ F achieves the inﬁmum, Rφ (f ∗ ) = inf f ∈F Rφ (f ). [sent-172, score-0.19]
</p><p>66 For example,√ a nontrivial for class F, the resulting estimation error bound can decrease no faster than 1/ n. [sent-175, score-0.242]
</p><p>67 (1996) showed that fast rates are also possible for the quadratic loss φ(α) = (1 − α)2 if F is convex, even if Rφ (f ∗ ) > 0. [sent-178, score-0.452]
</p><p>68 In particular, because the quadratic loss function is strictly convex, it is possible to bound the variance of the excess loss (difference between the loss of a function f and that of the optimal f ∗ ) in terms of its expectation. [sent-179, score-1.492]
</p><p>69 Since the variance decreases as we approach the optimal f ∗ , the risk of the empirical minimizer converges more quickly to the optimal risk than the simple uniform convergence results would suggest. [sent-180, score-0.76]
</p><p>70 The proof used the idea of the modulus of convexity of a norm. [sent-182, score-0.591]
</p><p>71 This idea can be used to give a simpler proof of a more general bound when the loss function satisﬁes a strict convexity condition, and we obtain risk bounds. [sent-183, score-1.031]
</p><p>72 The modulus of convexity of an arbitrary strictly convex function (rather than a norm) is a key notion in formulating our results. [sent-184, score-0.811]
</p><p>73 We consider loss functions φ that also satisfy a Lipschitz condition with respect to a pseudometric d on : we say that φ : → is Lipschitz with respect to d, with constant L, if for all a, b ∈ , |φ(a) − φ(b)| ≤ L · d(a, b). [sent-188, score-0.624]
</p><p>74 ) We consider four loss functions that satisfy these conditions: the exponential loss function used in AdaBoost, the deviance function for logistic regression, the quadratic loss function, and the truncated quadratic loss function; see Table 1. [sent-190, score-1.703]
</p><p>75 We use the pseudometric dφ (a, b) = inf {|a − α| + |β − b| : φ constant on (min{α, β}, max{α, β})} . [sent-191, score-0.294]
</p><p>76 For all except the truncated quadratic loss function, this corresponds to the standard metric on , dφ (a, b) = |a − b|. [sent-192, score-0.484]
</p><p>77 It is easy to calculate the Lipschitz constant and modulus of convexity for each of these loss functions. [sent-194, score-0.941]
</p><p>78 In the following result, we consider the function class used by algorithms such as AdaBoost: the class of linear combinations of classiﬁers from a ﬁxed base class. [sent-196, score-0.123]
</p><p>79 We assume that this base class has ﬁnite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension, and we constrain the size of the class by restricting the 1 norm of the linear parameters. [sent-197, score-0.123]
</p><p>80 Suppose that, on the interval [−B, B], φ is Lipschitz with constant LB and has modulus of convexity δ( ) = aB 2 (both with respect to the pseudometric d). [sent-201, score-0.664]
</p><p>81 For any probability distribution P on X × Y that has noise exponent α = 1, there is a constant c for which the following is true. [sent-202, score-0.105]
</p><p>82 , (Xn , Yn ), let ˆ ˆ f ∈ F be the minimizer of the empirical φ-risk, Rφ (f ) = Eφ(Y f (X)). [sent-209, score-0.126]
</p><p>83 Suppose that X F = B absconv(G), where G ⊆ {±1} has dV C (G) = d, and       ∗  ≥ BLB max  LB a B B  1/(d+1)  , 1 n−(d+2)/(2d+2)  Then with probability at least 1 − e−x , LB (LB /aB + B)x ∗ ∗ ˆ + inf Rφ (f ) − Rφ . [sent-210, score-0.19]
</p><p>84 R(f ) ≤ R∗ + c + f ∈F n Notice that the rate obtained here is strictly faster than the classical n−1/2 parametric rate, even though the class is inﬁnite dimensional and the optimal element of F can have risk larger than the Bayes risk. [sent-211, score-0.52]
</p><p>85 Let f ∗ be the minimizer of φ-risk in a function class F. [sent-214, score-0.133]
</p><p>86 If the class F is convex and the loss function φ is strictly convex and Lipschitz, then the variance of the excess loss, gf (x, y) = φ(yf (x)) − φ(yf ∗ (x)), decreases with its expectation. [sent-215, score-1.071]
</p><p>87 More formally, suppose that φ is L-Lipschitz and has modulus of convexity δ( ) ≥ c r 2 with r ≤ 2. [sent-218, score-0.606]
</p><p>88 5 Conclusions We have studied the relationship between properties of a nonnegative margin-based loss function φ and the statistical performance of the classiﬁer which, based on an i. [sent-222, score-0.48]
</p><p>89 training  set, minimizes empirical φ-risk over a class of functions. [sent-225, score-0.087]
</p><p>90 We ﬁrst derived a universal upper bound on the population misclassiﬁcation risk of any thresholded measurable classiﬁer in terms of its corresponding population φ-risk. [sent-226, score-0.623]
</p><p>91 The bound is governed by the ψ-transform, a convexiﬁed variational transform of φ. [sent-227, score-0.088]
</p><p>92 It is the tightest possible upper bound uniform over all probability distributions and measurable functions in this setting. [sent-228, score-0.277]
</p><p>93 Using this upper bound, we characterized the class of loss functions which guarantee that every φ-risk consistent classiﬁer sequence is also Bayes-risk consistent, under any population distribution. [sent-229, score-0.497]
</p><p>94 Here φ-risk consistency denotes sequential convergence of population φ-risks to the smallest possible φ-risk of any measurable classiﬁer. [sent-230, score-0.402]
</p><p>95 The characteristic property of such a φ, which we term classiﬁcation-calibration, is a kind of pointwise Fisher consistency for the conditional φ-risk at each x ∈ X . [sent-231, score-0.192]
</p><p>96 Under the low noise assumption of Tsybakov (2001), we sharpened our original upper ˆ bound and studied the Bayes-risk consistency of f , the minimizer of empirical φ-risk over a convex, bounded class of functions F which is not too complex. [sent-233, score-0.479]
</p><p>97 We found that, for convex φ satisfying a certain uniform strict convexity condition, empirical φ-risk minimization yields convergence of misclassiﬁcation risk to that of the best-performing classiﬁer in F, as the sample size grows. [sent-234, score-0.989]
</p><p>98 Furthermore, the rate of convergence can be strictly faster than the classical n−1/2 , depending on the strictness of convexity of φ and the complexity of F. [sent-235, score-0.584]

<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate inﬁnity-sample properties of risk minimization based multi-category classiﬁcation methods. These methods can be considered as natural extensions to binary large margin classiﬁcation. We establish conditions that guarantee the inﬁnity-sample consistency of classiﬁers obtained in the risk minimization framework. Examples are provided for two speciﬁc forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to obtain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information will be useful for statistical inferencing tasks beyond classiﬁcation. 1 Motivation Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem where we want to predict label y ∈ {±1} based on observation x. One of the most signiﬁcant achievements for binary classiﬁcation in machine learning is the invention of large margin methods, which include support vector machines and boosting algorithms. Based on a set of observations (X1 , Y1 ), . . . , (Xn , Yn ), ˆ a large margin classiﬁcation algorithm produces a decision function fn by empirically minimizing a loss function that is often a convex upper bound of the binary classiﬁcation error ˆ ˆ function. Given fn , the binary decision rule is to predict y = 1 if fn (x) ≥ 0, and to predict ˆ y = −1 otherwise (the decision rule at fn (x) = 0 is not important). In the literature, the following form of large margin binary classiﬁcation is often encountered: we minimize the empirical risk associated with a convex function φ in a pre-chosen function class Cn : 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n φ(f (Xi )Yi ). (1) i=1 Originally such a scheme was regarded as a compromise to avoid computational difﬁculties associated with direct classiﬁcation error minimization, which often leads to an NP-hard problem. The current view in the statistical literature interprets such methods as algorithms to obtain conditional probability estimates. For example, see [3, 6, 9, 11] for some related studies. This point of view allows people to show the consistency of various large margin methods: that is, in the large sample limit, the obtained classiﬁers achieve the optimal Bayes error rate. For example, see [1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11]. The consistency of a learning method is certainly a very desirable property, and one may argue that a good classiﬁcation method should be consistent in the large sample limit. Although statistical properties of binary classiﬁcation algorithms based on the risk minimization formulation (1) are quite well-understood due to many recent works such as those mentioned above, there are much fewer studies on risk minimization based multicategory problems which generalizes the binary large margin method (1). The complexity of possible generalizations may be one reason. Another reason may be that one can always estimate the conditional probability for a multi-category problem using the binary classiﬁcation formulation (1) for each category, and then pick the category with the highest estimated conditional probability (or score).1 However, it is still useful to understand whether there are more natural alternatives, and what kind of risk minimization formulation which generalizes (1) can be used to yield consistent classiﬁers in the large sample limit. An important step toward this direction has recently been taken in [5], where the authors proposed a multi-category extension of the support vector machine that is Bayes consistent (note that there were a number of earlier proposals that were not consistent). The purpose of this paper is to generalize their investigation so as to include a much wider class of risk minimization formulations that can lead to consistent classiﬁers in the inﬁnity-sample limit. We shall see that there is a rich structure in risk minimization based multi-category classiﬁcation formulations. Multi-category large margin methods have started to draw more attention recently. For example, in [2], learning bounds for some multi-category convex risk minimization methods were obtained, although the authors did not study possible choices of Bayes consistent formulations. 2 Multi-category classiﬁcation We consider the following K-class classiﬁcation problem: we would like to predict the label y ∈ {1, . . . , K} of an input vector x. In this paper, we only consider the simplest scenario with 0 − 1 classiﬁcation loss: we have a loss of 0 for correct prediction, and loss of 1 for incorrect prediction. In binary classiﬁcation, the class label can be determined using the sign of a decision function. This can be generalized to K class classiﬁcation problem as follows: we consider K decision functions fc (x) where c = 1, . . . , K and we predict the label y of x as: T (f (x)) = arg max c∈{1,...,K} fc (x), (2) where we denote by f (x) the vector function f (x) = [f1 (x), . . . , fK (x)]. Note that if two or more components of f achieve the same maximum value, then we may choose any of them as T (f ). In this framework, fc (x) is often regarded as a scoring function for category c that is correlated with how likely x belongs to category c (compared with the remaining k − 1 categories). The classiﬁcation error is given by: (f ) = 1 − EX P (Y = T (X)|X). Note that only the relative strength of fc compared with the alternatives is important. In particular, the decision rule given in (2) does not change when we add the same numerical quantity to each component of f (x). This allows us to impose one constraint on the vector f (x) which decreases the degree of freedom K of the K-component vector f (x) to K − 1. 1 This approach is often called one-versus-all or ranking in machine learning. Another main approach is to encode a multi-category classiﬁcation problem into binary classiﬁcation sub-problems. The consistency of such encoding schemes can be difﬁcult to analyze, and we shall not discuss them. For example, in the binary classiﬁcation case, we can enforce f1 (x)+f2 (x) = 0, and hence f (x) can be represented as [f1 (x), −f1 (x)]. The decision rule in (2), which compares f1 (x) ≥ f2 (x), is equivalent to f1 (x) ≥ 0. This leads to the binary classiﬁcation rule mentioned in the introduction. In the multi-category case, one may also interpret the possible constraint on the vector function f , which reduces its degree of freedom from K to K − 1 based on the following reasoning. In many cases, we seek fc (x) as a function of p(Y = c|x). Since we have a K constraint c=1 p(Y = c|x) = 1 (implying that the degree of freedom for p(Y = c|x) is K − 1), the degree of freedom for f is also K − 1 (instead of K). However, we shall point out that in the algorithms we formulate below, we may either enforce such a constraint that reduces the degree of freedom of f , or we do not impose any constraint, which keeps the degree of freedom of f to be K. The advantage of the latter is that it allows the computation of each fc to be decoupled. It is thus much simpler both conceptually and numerically. Moreover, it directly handles multiple-label problems where we may assign each x to multiple labels of y ∈ {1, . . . , K}. In this scenario, we do not have a constraint. In this paper, we consider an empirical risk minimization method to solve a multi-category problem, which is of the following general form: 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n ΨYi (f (Xi )). (3) i=1 As we shall see later, this method is a natural generalization of the binary classiﬁcation method (1). Note that one may consider an even more general form with ΨY (f (X)) replaced by ΨY (f (X), X), which we don’t study in this paper. From the standard learning theory, one can expect that with appropriately chosen Cn , the ˆ ˆ solution fn of (3) approximately minimizes the true risk R(f ) with respect to the unknown underlying distribution within the function class Cn , R(f ) = EX,Y ΨY (f (X)) = EX L(P (·|X), f (X)), (4) where P (·|X) = [P (Y = 1|X), . . . , P (Y = K|X)] is the conditional probability, and K L(q, f ) = qc Ψc (f ). (5) c=1 In order to understand the large sample behavior of the algorithm based on solving (3), we ﬁrst need to understand the behavior of a function f that approximately minimizes R(f ). We introduce the following deﬁnition (also referred to as classiﬁcation calibrated in [1]): Deﬁnition 2.1 Consider Ψc (f ) in (4). We say that the formulation is admissible (classiﬁcation calibrated) on a closed set Ω ⊆ [−∞, ∞]K if the following conditions hold: ∀c, Ψc (·) : Ω → (−∞, ∞] is bounded below and continuous; ∩c {f : Ψc (f ) < ∞} is ∗ ∗ non-empty and dense in Ω; ∀q, if L(q, f ∗ ) = inf f L(q, f ), then fc = supk fk implies qc = supk qk . Since we allow Ψc (f ) = ∞, we use the convention that qc Ψc (f ) = 0 when qc = 0 and Ψc (f ) = ∞. The following result relates the approximate minimization of the Ψ risk to the approximate minimization of classiﬁcation error: Theorem 2.1 Let B be the set of all Borel measurable functions. For a closed set Ω ⊂ [−∞, ∞]K , let BΩ = {f ∈ B : ∀x, f (x) ∈ Ω}. If Ψc (·) is admissible on Ω, then for a Borel measurable distribution, R(f ) → inf g∈BΩ R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). Proof Sketch. First we show that the admissibility implies that ∀ > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that ∀q and x: inf {L(q, f ) : fc = sup fk } ≥ inf L(q, g) + δ. (6) qc ≤supk qk − g∈Ω k m If (6) does not hold, then ∃ > 0, and a sequence of (c , f m , q m ) with f m ∈ Ω such that m m m m fcm = supk fk , qcm ≤ supk qk − , and L(q m , f m ) − inf g∈Ω L(q m , g) → 0. Taking a limit point of (cm , f m , q m ), and using the continuity of Ψc (·), we obtain a contradiction (technical details handling the inﬁnity case are skipped). Therefore (6) must be valid. Now we consider a vector function f (x) ∈ ΩB . Let q(x) = P (·|x). Given X, if P (Y = T (f (X))|X) ≥ P (Y = T (q(X))|X)+ , then equation (6) implies that L(q(X), f (X)) ≥ inf g∈Ω L(q(X), g) + δ. Therefore (f ) − inf (g) =EX [P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X)] g∈B ≤ + EX I(P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X) > ) LX (q(X), f (X)) − inf g∈BΩ LX (q(X), g) ≤ + EX δ R(f ) − inf g∈BΩ R(g) = + . δ In the above derivation we use I to denote the indicator function. Since and δ are arbitrary, we obtain the theorem by letting → 0. 2 Clearly, based on the above theorem, an admissible risk minimization formulation is suitable for multi-category classiﬁcation problems. The classiﬁer obtained from minimizing (3) can approach the Bayes error rate if we can show that with appropriately chosen function class Cn , approximate minimization of (3) implies approximate minimization of (4). Learning bounds of this forms have been very well-studied in statistics and machine learning. For example, for large margin binary classiﬁcation, such bounds can be found in [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 1], where they were used to prove the consistency of various large margin methods. In order to achieve consistency, it is also necessary to take a sequence of function classes Cn (C1 ⊂ C2 ⊂ · · · ) such that ∪n Cn is dense in the set of Borel measurable functions. The set Cn has the effect of regularization, which ensures that ˆ ˆ P R(fn ) ≈ inf f ∈Cn R(f ). It follows that as n → ∞, R(fn ) → inf f ∈B R(f ). Theorem 2.1 ˆ P then implies that (fn ) → inf f ∈B (f ). The purpose of this paper is not to study similar learning bounds that relate approximate minimization of (3) to the approximate minimization of (4). See [2] for a recent investigation. We shall focus on the choices of Ψ that lead to admissible formulations. We pay special attention to the case that each Ψc (f ) is a convex function of f , so that the resulting formulation becomes computational more tractable. Instead of working with the general form of Ψc in (4), we focus on two speciﬁc choices listed in the next two sections. 3 Unconstrained formulations We consider unconstrained formulation with the following choice of Ψ: K Ψc (f ) = φ(fc ) + s t(fk ) , (7) k=1 where φ, s and t are appropriately chosen functions that are continuously differentiable. The ﬁrst term, which has a relatively simple form, depends on the label c. The second term is independent of the label, and can be regarded as a normalization term. Note that this function is symmetric with respect to components of f . This choice treats all potential classes equally. It is also possible to treat different classes differently (e.g. replacing φ(fc ) by φc (fc )), which can be useful if we associate different classiﬁcation loss to different kinds of errors. 3.1 Optimality equation and probability model Using (7), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K L(q, f ) = K qc φ(fc ) + s t(fc ) . c=1 c=1 In the following, we study the property of the optimal vector f ∗ that minimizes L(q, f ) for a ﬁxed q. Given q, the optimal solution f ∗ of L(q, f ) satisﬁes the following ﬁrst order condition: ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + µf ∗ t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (8) where quantity µf ∗ = s ( K k=1 ∗ t(fk )) is independent of k. ∗ Clearly this equation relates qc to fc for each component c. The relationship of q and f ∗ deﬁned by (8) can be regarded as the (inﬁnite sample-size) probability model associated with the learning method (3) with Ψ given by (7). The following result presents a simple criterion to check admissibility. We skip the proof for simplicity. Most of our examples satisfy the condition. Proposition 3.1 Consider (7). Assume Φc (f ) is continuous on [−∞, ∞]K and bounded below. If s (u) ≥ 0 and ∀p > 0, pφ (f ) + t (f ) = 0 has a unique solution fp that is an increasing function of p, then the formulation is admissible. If s(u) = u, the condition ∀p > 0 in Proposition 3.1 can be replaced by ∀p ∈ (0, 1). 3.2 Decoupled formulations We let s(u) = u in (7). The optimality condition (8) becomes ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (9) This means that we have K decoupled equalities, one for each fc . This is the simplest and in the author’s opinion, the most interesting formulation. Since the estimation problem in ˆ (3) is also decoupled into K separate equations, one for each component of fn , this class of methods are computationally relatively simple and easy to parallelize. Although this method seems to be preferable for multi-category problems, it is not the most efﬁcient way for two-class problem (if we want to treat the two classes in a symmetric manner) since we have to solve two separate equations. We only need to deal with one equation in (1) due to the fact that an effective constraint f1 + f2 = 0 can be used to reduce the number of equations. This variable elimination has little impact if there are many categories. In the following, we list some examples of multi-category risk minimization formulations. They all satisfy the admissibility condition in Proposition 3.1. We focus on the relationship of the optimal optimizer function f∗ (q) and the conditional probability q. For simplicity, we focus on the choice φ(u) = −u. 3.2.1 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = eu ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = efc . This formulation is closely related K to the maximum-likelihood estimate with conditional model qc = efc / k=1 efk (logistic regression). In particular, if we choose a function class such that the normalization condiK tion k=1 efk = 1 holds, then the two formulations are identical. However, they become different when we do not impose such a normalization condition. Another very important and closely related formulation is the choice of φ(u) = − ln u and t(u) = u. This is an extension of maximum-likelihood estimate with probability model qc = fc . The resulting method is identical to maximum-likelihood if we choose our function class such that k fk = 1. However, the formulation also allows us to use function classes that do not satisfy the normalization constraint k fk = 1. Therefore this method is more ﬂexible. 3.2.2 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = ln(1 + eu ) This version uses binary logistic regression loss, and we have the following probability ∗ model: qc = (1 + e−fc )−1 . Again this is an unnormalized model. 1 3.2.3 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = p |u|p (p > 1) ∗ ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = sign(fc )|fc |p−1 . This means that at the ∗ ∗ solution, fc ≥ 0. One may modify it such that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the condition probability qc = 0. 3.2.4 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p max(u, 0)p (p > 1) ∗ In this probability model, we have the following relationship: qc = max(fc , 0)p−1 . The ∗ equation implies that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the conditional probability qc = 0. Therefore, with a ﬁxed function class, this model is more powerful than the previous one. How∗ ever, at the optimal solution, fc ≤ 1. This requirement can be further alleviated with the following modiﬁcation. 3.2.5 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p min(max(u, 0)p , p(u − 1) + 1) (p > 1) In this probability model, we have the following relationship at the exact solution: qc = c min(max(f∗ , 0), 1)p−1 . Clearly this model is more powerful than the previous model since ∗ the function value fc ≥ 1 can be used to model qc = 1. 3.3 Coupled formulations In the coupled formulation with s(u) = u, the probability model can be normalized in a certain way. We list a few examples. 3.3.1 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = eu , and s(u) = ln(u) This is the standard logistic regression model. The probability model is: K ∗ qc (x) = exp(fc (x))( ∗ exp(fc (x)))−1 . c=1 The right hand side is always normalized (sum up to 1). Note that the model is not continuous at inﬁnities, and thus not admissible in our deﬁnition. However, we may consider the region Ω = {f : supk fk = 0}, and it is easy to check that this model is admissible in Ω. Ω Let fc = fc − supk fk ∈ Ω, then f Ω has the same decision rule as f and R(f ) = R(f Ω ). Therefore Theorem 2.1 implies that R(f ) → inf g∈B R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). 1 3.3.2 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = |u|p , and s(u) = p |u|p/p (p, p > 1) The probability model is: K ∗ ∗ ∗ |fk (x)|p )(p−p )/p sign(fc (x))|fc (x)|p −1 . qc (x) = ( k=1 We may replace t(u) by t(u) = max(0, u)p , and the probability model becomes: K qc (x) = ( ∗ ∗ max(fk (x), 0)p )(p−p )/p max(fc (x), 0)p −1 . k=1 These formulations do not seem to have advantages over the decoupled counterparts. Note that if we let p → 1, then the sum of the p p -th power of the right hand side → 1. In a −1 way, this means that the model is normalized in the limit of p → 1. 4 Constrained formulations As pointed out, one may impose constraints on possible choices of f . We may impose such a condition when we specify the function class Cn . However, for clarity, we shall directly impose a condition into our formulation. If we impose a constraint into (7), then its effect is rather similar to that of the second term in (7). In this section, we consider a direct extension of binary large-margin method (1) to multi-category case. The choice given below is motivated by [5], where an extension of SVM was proposed. We use a risk formulation that is different from (7), and for simplicity, we will consider linear equality constraint only: K Ψc (f ) = φ(−fk ), s.t. f ∈ Ω, (10) k=1,k=c where we deﬁne Ω as: K Ω = {f : fk = 0} ∪ {f : sup fk = ∞}. k k=1 We may interpret the added constraint as a restriction on the function class Cn in (3) such that every f ∈ Cn satisﬁes the constraint. Note that with K = 2, this leads to the usually binary large margin method. Using (10), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K (1 − qc )φ(−fc ), L(q, f ) = s.t. f ∈ Ω. (11) c=1 The following result provides a simple way to check the admissibility of (10). Proposition 4.1 If φ is a convex function which is bounded below and φ (0) < 0, then (10) is admissible on Ω. Proof Sketch. The continuity condition is straight-forward to verify. We may also assume that φ(·) ≥ 0 without loss of generality. Now let f achieves the minimum of L(q, ·). If fc = ∞, then it is clear that qc = 1 and thus qk = 0 for k = c. This implies that for k = c, φ(−fk ) = inf f φ(−f ), and thus fk < 0. If fc = supk fk < ∞, then the constraint implies fc ≥ 0. It is easy to see that ∀k, qc ≥ qk since otherwise, we must have φ(−fk ) > φ(−fc ), and thus φ (−fk ) > 0 and φ (−fc ) < 0, implying that with sufﬁcient small δ > 0, φ(−(fk + δ)) < φ(−fk ) and φ(−(fc − δ)) < φ(−fc ). A contradiction. 2 Using the above criterion, we can convert any admissible convex φ for the binary formulation (1) into an admissible multi-category classiﬁcation formulation (10). In [5] the special case of SVM (with loss function φ(u) = max(0, 1 − u)) was studied. The authors demonstrated the admissibility by direct calculation, although no results similar to Theorem 2.1 were established. Such a result is needed to prove consistency. The treatment presented here generalizes their study. Note that for the constrained formulation, it is more difﬁcult to relate fc at the optimal solution to a probability model, since such a model will have a much more complicated form compared with the unconstrained counterpart. 5 Conclusion In this paper we proposed a family of risk minimization methods for multi-category classiﬁcation problems, which are natural extensions of binary large margin classiﬁcation methods. We established admissibility conditions that ensure the consistency of the obtained classiﬁers in the large sample limit. Two speciﬁc forms of risk minimization were proposed and examples were given to study the induced probability models. As an implication of this work, we see that it is possible to obtain consistent (conditional) density estimation using various non-maximum likelihood estimation methods. One advantage of some of the newly proposed methods is that they allow us to model zero density directly. Note that for the maximum-likelihood method, near zero density may cause serious robustness problems at least in theory. References [1] P.L. Bartlett, M.I. Jordan, and J.D. McAuliffe.

<p>Author: Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: The decision functions constructed by support vector machines (SVM’s) usually depend only on a subset of the training set—the so-called support vectors. We derive asymptotically sharp lower and upper bounds on the number of support vectors for several standard types of SVM’s. In particular, we show for the Gaussian RBF kernel that the fraction of support vectors tends to twice the Bayes risk for the L1-SVM, to the probability of noise for the L2-SVM, and to 1 for the LS-SVM. 1</p><p>5 0.14192045 <a title="101-tfidf-5" href="./nips-2003-Design_of_Experiments_via_Information_Theory.html">51 nips-2003-Design of Experiments via Information Theory</a></p>
<p>Author: Liam Paninski</p><p>Abstract: We discuss an idea for collecting data in a relatively efﬁcient manner. Our point of view is Bayesian and information-theoretic: on any given trial, we want to adaptively choose the input in such a way that the mutual information between the (unknown) state of the system and the (stochastic) output is maximal, given any prior information (including data collected on any previous trials). We prove a theorem that quantiﬁes the effectiveness of this strategy and give a few illustrative examples comparing the performance of this adaptive technique to that of the more usual nonadaptive experimental design. For example, we are able to explicitly calculate the asymptotic relative efﬁciency of the “staircase method” widely employed in psychophysics research, and to demonstrate the dependence of this efﬁciency on the form of the “psychometric function” underlying the output responses. 1</p><p>6 0.12085062 <a title="101-tfidf-6" href="./nips-2003-Online_Learning_of_Non-stationary_Sequences.html">146 nips-2003-Online Learning of Non-stationary Sequences</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael I. Jordan, Jon D. Mcauliffe</p><p>Abstract: Many classiﬁcation algorithms, including the support vector machine, boosting and logistic regression, can be viewed as minimum contrast methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the 0-1 loss function. We characterize the statistical consequences of using such a surrogate by providing a general quantitative relationship between the risk as assessed using the 0-1 loss and the risk as assessed using any nonnegative surrogate loss function. We show that this relationship gives nontrivial bounds under the weakest possible condition on the loss function—that it satisfy a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classiﬁcation. The relationship is based on a variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications. We also present a reﬁned version of this result in the case of low noise. Finally, we present applications of our results to the estimation of convergence rates in the general setting of function classes that are scaled hulls of a ﬁnite-dimensional base class.</p><p>2 0.87167585 <a title="101-lsi-2" href="./nips-2003-An_Infinity-sample_Theory_for_Multi-category_Large_Margin_Classification.html">23 nips-2003-An Infinity-sample Theory for Multi-category Large Margin Classification</a></p>
<p>Author: Tong Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to investigate inﬁnity-sample properties of risk minimization based multi-category classiﬁcation methods. These methods can be considered as natural extensions to binary large margin classiﬁcation. We establish conditions that guarantee the inﬁnity-sample consistency of classiﬁers obtained in the risk minimization framework. Examples are provided for two speciﬁc forms of the general formulation, which extend a number of known methods. Using these examples, we show that some risk minimization formulations can also be used to obtain conditional probability estimates for the underlying problem. Such conditional probability information will be useful for statistical inferencing tasks beyond classiﬁcation. 1 Motivation Consider a binary classiﬁcation problem where we want to predict label y ∈ {±1} based on observation x. One of the most signiﬁcant achievements for binary classiﬁcation in machine learning is the invention of large margin methods, which include support vector machines and boosting algorithms. Based on a set of observations (X1 , Y1 ), . . . , (Xn , Yn ), ˆ a large margin classiﬁcation algorithm produces a decision function fn by empirically minimizing a loss function that is often a convex upper bound of the binary classiﬁcation error ˆ ˆ function. Given fn , the binary decision rule is to predict y = 1 if fn (x) ≥ 0, and to predict ˆ y = −1 otherwise (the decision rule at fn (x) = 0 is not important). In the literature, the following form of large margin binary classiﬁcation is often encountered: we minimize the empirical risk associated with a convex function φ in a pre-chosen function class Cn : 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n φ(f (Xi )Yi ). (1) i=1 Originally such a scheme was regarded as a compromise to avoid computational difﬁculties associated with direct classiﬁcation error minimization, which often leads to an NP-hard problem. The current view in the statistical literature interprets such methods as algorithms to obtain conditional probability estimates. For example, see [3, 6, 9, 11] for some related studies. This point of view allows people to show the consistency of various large margin methods: that is, in the large sample limit, the obtained classiﬁers achieve the optimal Bayes error rate. For example, see [1, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11]. The consistency of a learning method is certainly a very desirable property, and one may argue that a good classiﬁcation method should be consistent in the large sample limit. Although statistical properties of binary classiﬁcation algorithms based on the risk minimization formulation (1) are quite well-understood due to many recent works such as those mentioned above, there are much fewer studies on risk minimization based multicategory problems which generalizes the binary large margin method (1). The complexity of possible generalizations may be one reason. Another reason may be that one can always estimate the conditional probability for a multi-category problem using the binary classiﬁcation formulation (1) for each category, and then pick the category with the highest estimated conditional probability (or score).1 However, it is still useful to understand whether there are more natural alternatives, and what kind of risk minimization formulation which generalizes (1) can be used to yield consistent classiﬁers in the large sample limit. An important step toward this direction has recently been taken in [5], where the authors proposed a multi-category extension of the support vector machine that is Bayes consistent (note that there were a number of earlier proposals that were not consistent). The purpose of this paper is to generalize their investigation so as to include a much wider class of risk minimization formulations that can lead to consistent classiﬁers in the inﬁnity-sample limit. We shall see that there is a rich structure in risk minimization based multi-category classiﬁcation formulations. Multi-category large margin methods have started to draw more attention recently. For example, in [2], learning bounds for some multi-category convex risk minimization methods were obtained, although the authors did not study possible choices of Bayes consistent formulations. 2 Multi-category classiﬁcation We consider the following K-class classiﬁcation problem: we would like to predict the label y ∈ {1, . . . , K} of an input vector x. In this paper, we only consider the simplest scenario with 0 − 1 classiﬁcation loss: we have a loss of 0 for correct prediction, and loss of 1 for incorrect prediction. In binary classiﬁcation, the class label can be determined using the sign of a decision function. This can be generalized to K class classiﬁcation problem as follows: we consider K decision functions fc (x) where c = 1, . . . , K and we predict the label y of x as: T (f (x)) = arg max c∈{1,...,K} fc (x), (2) where we denote by f (x) the vector function f (x) = [f1 (x), . . . , fK (x)]. Note that if two or more components of f achieve the same maximum value, then we may choose any of them as T (f ). In this framework, fc (x) is often regarded as a scoring function for category c that is correlated with how likely x belongs to category c (compared with the remaining k − 1 categories). The classiﬁcation error is given by: (f ) = 1 − EX P (Y = T (X)|X). Note that only the relative strength of fc compared with the alternatives is important. In particular, the decision rule given in (2) does not change when we add the same numerical quantity to each component of f (x). This allows us to impose one constraint on the vector f (x) which decreases the degree of freedom K of the K-component vector f (x) to K − 1. 1 This approach is often called one-versus-all or ranking in machine learning. Another main approach is to encode a multi-category classiﬁcation problem into binary classiﬁcation sub-problems. The consistency of such encoding schemes can be difﬁcult to analyze, and we shall not discuss them. For example, in the binary classiﬁcation case, we can enforce f1 (x)+f2 (x) = 0, and hence f (x) can be represented as [f1 (x), −f1 (x)]. The decision rule in (2), which compares f1 (x) ≥ f2 (x), is equivalent to f1 (x) ≥ 0. This leads to the binary classiﬁcation rule mentioned in the introduction. In the multi-category case, one may also interpret the possible constraint on the vector function f , which reduces its degree of freedom from K to K − 1 based on the following reasoning. In many cases, we seek fc (x) as a function of p(Y = c|x). Since we have a K constraint c=1 p(Y = c|x) = 1 (implying that the degree of freedom for p(Y = c|x) is K − 1), the degree of freedom for f is also K − 1 (instead of K). However, we shall point out that in the algorithms we formulate below, we may either enforce such a constraint that reduces the degree of freedom of f , or we do not impose any constraint, which keeps the degree of freedom of f to be K. The advantage of the latter is that it allows the computation of each fc to be decoupled. It is thus much simpler both conceptually and numerically. Moreover, it directly handles multiple-label problems where we may assign each x to multiple labels of y ∈ {1, . . . , K}. In this scenario, we do not have a constraint. In this paper, we consider an empirical risk minimization method to solve a multi-category problem, which is of the following general form: 1 ˆ fn = arg min f ∈Cn n n ΨYi (f (Xi )). (3) i=1 As we shall see later, this method is a natural generalization of the binary classiﬁcation method (1). Note that one may consider an even more general form with ΨY (f (X)) replaced by ΨY (f (X), X), which we don’t study in this paper. From the standard learning theory, one can expect that with appropriately chosen Cn , the ˆ ˆ solution fn of (3) approximately minimizes the true risk R(f ) with respect to the unknown underlying distribution within the function class Cn , R(f ) = EX,Y ΨY (f (X)) = EX L(P (·|X), f (X)), (4) where P (·|X) = [P (Y = 1|X), . . . , P (Y = K|X)] is the conditional probability, and K L(q, f ) = qc Ψc (f ). (5) c=1 In order to understand the large sample behavior of the algorithm based on solving (3), we ﬁrst need to understand the behavior of a function f that approximately minimizes R(f ). We introduce the following deﬁnition (also referred to as classiﬁcation calibrated in [1]): Deﬁnition 2.1 Consider Ψc (f ) in (4). We say that the formulation is admissible (classiﬁcation calibrated) on a closed set Ω ⊆ [−∞, ∞]K if the following conditions hold: ∀c, Ψc (·) : Ω → (−∞, ∞] is bounded below and continuous; ∩c {f : Ψc (f ) < ∞} is ∗ ∗ non-empty and dense in Ω; ∀q, if L(q, f ∗ ) = inf f L(q, f ), then fc = supk fk implies qc = supk qk . Since we allow Ψc (f ) = ∞, we use the convention that qc Ψc (f ) = 0 when qc = 0 and Ψc (f ) = ∞. The following result relates the approximate minimization of the Ψ risk to the approximate minimization of classiﬁcation error: Theorem 2.1 Let B be the set of all Borel measurable functions. For a closed set Ω ⊂ [−∞, ∞]K , let BΩ = {f ∈ B : ∀x, f (x) ∈ Ω}. If Ψc (·) is admissible on Ω, then for a Borel measurable distribution, R(f ) → inf g∈BΩ R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). Proof Sketch. First we show that the admissibility implies that ∀ > 0, ∃δ > 0 such that ∀q and x: inf {L(q, f ) : fc = sup fk } ≥ inf L(q, g) + δ. (6) qc ≤supk qk − g∈Ω k m If (6) does not hold, then ∃ > 0, and a sequence of (c , f m , q m ) with f m ∈ Ω such that m m m m fcm = supk fk , qcm ≤ supk qk − , and L(q m , f m ) − inf g∈Ω L(q m , g) → 0. Taking a limit point of (cm , f m , q m ), and using the continuity of Ψc (·), we obtain a contradiction (technical details handling the inﬁnity case are skipped). Therefore (6) must be valid. Now we consider a vector function f (x) ∈ ΩB . Let q(x) = P (·|x). Given X, if P (Y = T (f (X))|X) ≥ P (Y = T (q(X))|X)+ , then equation (6) implies that L(q(X), f (X)) ≥ inf g∈Ω L(q(X), g) + δ. Therefore (f ) − inf (g) =EX [P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X)] g∈B ≤ + EX I(P (Y = T (q(X))|X) − P (Y = T (f (X))|X) > ) LX (q(X), f (X)) − inf g∈BΩ LX (q(X), g) ≤ + EX δ R(f ) − inf g∈BΩ R(g) = + . δ In the above derivation we use I to denote the indicator function. Since and δ are arbitrary, we obtain the theorem by letting → 0. 2 Clearly, based on the above theorem, an admissible risk minimization formulation is suitable for multi-category classiﬁcation problems. The classiﬁer obtained from minimizing (3) can approach the Bayes error rate if we can show that with appropriately chosen function class Cn , approximate minimization of (3) implies approximate minimization of (4). Learning bounds of this forms have been very well-studied in statistics and machine learning. For example, for large margin binary classiﬁcation, such bounds can be found in [4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 1], where they were used to prove the consistency of various large margin methods. In order to achieve consistency, it is also necessary to take a sequence of function classes Cn (C1 ⊂ C2 ⊂ · · · ) such that ∪n Cn is dense in the set of Borel measurable functions. The set Cn has the effect of regularization, which ensures that ˆ ˆ P R(fn ) ≈ inf f ∈Cn R(f ). It follows that as n → ∞, R(fn ) → inf f ∈B R(f ). Theorem 2.1 ˆ P then implies that (fn ) → inf f ∈B (f ). The purpose of this paper is not to study similar learning bounds that relate approximate minimization of (3) to the approximate minimization of (4). See [2] for a recent investigation. We shall focus on the choices of Ψ that lead to admissible formulations. We pay special attention to the case that each Ψc (f ) is a convex function of f , so that the resulting formulation becomes computational more tractable. Instead of working with the general form of Ψc in (4), we focus on two speciﬁc choices listed in the next two sections. 3 Unconstrained formulations We consider unconstrained formulation with the following choice of Ψ: K Ψc (f ) = φ(fc ) + s t(fk ) , (7) k=1 where φ, s and t are appropriately chosen functions that are continuously differentiable. The ﬁrst term, which has a relatively simple form, depends on the label c. The second term is independent of the label, and can be regarded as a normalization term. Note that this function is symmetric with respect to components of f . This choice treats all potential classes equally. It is also possible to treat different classes differently (e.g. replacing φ(fc ) by φc (fc )), which can be useful if we associate different classiﬁcation loss to different kinds of errors. 3.1 Optimality equation and probability model Using (7), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K L(q, f ) = K qc φ(fc ) + s t(fc ) . c=1 c=1 In the following, we study the property of the optimal vector f ∗ that minimizes L(q, f ) for a ﬁxed q. Given q, the optimal solution f ∗ of L(q, f ) satisﬁes the following ﬁrst order condition: ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + µf ∗ t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (8) where quantity µf ∗ = s ( K k=1 ∗ t(fk )) is independent of k. ∗ Clearly this equation relates qc to fc for each component c. The relationship of q and f ∗ deﬁned by (8) can be regarded as the (inﬁnite sample-size) probability model associated with the learning method (3) with Ψ given by (7). The following result presents a simple criterion to check admissibility. We skip the proof for simplicity. Most of our examples satisfy the condition. Proposition 3.1 Consider (7). Assume Φc (f ) is continuous on [−∞, ∞]K and bounded below. If s (u) ≥ 0 and ∀p > 0, pφ (f ) + t (f ) = 0 has a unique solution fp that is an increasing function of p, then the formulation is admissible. If s(u) = u, the condition ∀p > 0 in Proposition 3.1 can be replaced by ∀p ∈ (0, 1). 3.2 Decoupled formulations We let s(u) = u in (7). The optimality condition (8) becomes ∗ ∗ qc φ (fc ) + t (fc ) = 0 (c = 1, . . . , K). (9) This means that we have K decoupled equalities, one for each fc . This is the simplest and in the author’s opinion, the most interesting formulation. Since the estimation problem in ˆ (3) is also decoupled into K separate equations, one for each component of fn , this class of methods are computationally relatively simple and easy to parallelize. Although this method seems to be preferable for multi-category problems, it is not the most efﬁcient way for two-class problem (if we want to treat the two classes in a symmetric manner) since we have to solve two separate equations. We only need to deal with one equation in (1) due to the fact that an effective constraint f1 + f2 = 0 can be used to reduce the number of equations. This variable elimination has little impact if there are many categories. In the following, we list some examples of multi-category risk minimization formulations. They all satisfy the admissibility condition in Proposition 3.1. We focus on the relationship of the optimal optimizer function f∗ (q) and the conditional probability q. For simplicity, we focus on the choice φ(u) = −u. 3.2.1 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = eu ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = efc . This formulation is closely related K to the maximum-likelihood estimate with conditional model qc = efc / k=1 efk (logistic regression). In particular, if we choose a function class such that the normalization condiK tion k=1 efk = 1 holds, then the two formulations are identical. However, they become different when we do not impose such a normalization condition. Another very important and closely related formulation is the choice of φ(u) = − ln u and t(u) = u. This is an extension of maximum-likelihood estimate with probability model qc = fc . The resulting method is identical to maximum-likelihood if we choose our function class such that k fk = 1. However, the formulation also allows us to use function classes that do not satisfy the normalization constraint k fk = 1. Therefore this method is more ﬂexible. 3.2.2 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = ln(1 + eu ) This version uses binary logistic regression loss, and we have the following probability ∗ model: qc = (1 + e−fc )−1 . Again this is an unnormalized model. 1 3.2.3 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = p |u|p (p > 1) ∗ ∗ We obtain the following probability model: qc = sign(fc )|fc |p−1 . This means that at the ∗ ∗ solution, fc ≥ 0. One may modify it such that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the condition probability qc = 0. 3.2.4 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p max(u, 0)p (p > 1) ∗ In this probability model, we have the following relationship: qc = max(fc , 0)p−1 . The ∗ equation implies that we allow fc ≤ 0 to model the conditional probability qc = 0. Therefore, with a ﬁxed function class, this model is more powerful than the previous one. How∗ ever, at the optimal solution, fc ≤ 1. This requirement can be further alleviated with the following modiﬁcation. 3.2.5 φ(u) = −u and t(u) = 1 p min(max(u, 0)p , p(u − 1) + 1) (p > 1) In this probability model, we have the following relationship at the exact solution: qc = c min(max(f∗ , 0), 1)p−1 . Clearly this model is more powerful than the previous model since ∗ the function value fc ≥ 1 can be used to model qc = 1. 3.3 Coupled formulations In the coupled formulation with s(u) = u, the probability model can be normalized in a certain way. We list a few examples. 3.3.1 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = eu , and s(u) = ln(u) This is the standard logistic regression model. The probability model is: K ∗ qc (x) = exp(fc (x))( ∗ exp(fc (x)))−1 . c=1 The right hand side is always normalized (sum up to 1). Note that the model is not continuous at inﬁnities, and thus not admissible in our deﬁnition. However, we may consider the region Ω = {f : supk fk = 0}, and it is easy to check that this model is admissible in Ω. Ω Let fc = fc − supk fk ∈ Ω, then f Ω has the same decision rule as f and R(f ) = R(f Ω ). Therefore Theorem 2.1 implies that R(f ) → inf g∈B R(g) implies (f ) → inf g∈B (g). 1 3.3.2 φ(u) = −u, and t(u) = |u|p , and s(u) = p |u|p/p (p, p > 1) The probability model is: K ∗ ∗ ∗ |fk (x)|p )(p−p )/p sign(fc (x))|fc (x)|p −1 . qc (x) = ( k=1 We may replace t(u) by t(u) = max(0, u)p , and the probability model becomes: K qc (x) = ( ∗ ∗ max(fk (x), 0)p )(p−p )/p max(fc (x), 0)p −1 . k=1 These formulations do not seem to have advantages over the decoupled counterparts. Note that if we let p → 1, then the sum of the p p -th power of the right hand side → 1. In a −1 way, this means that the model is normalized in the limit of p → 1. 4 Constrained formulations As pointed out, one may impose constraints on possible choices of f . We may impose such a condition when we specify the function class Cn . However, for clarity, we shall directly impose a condition into our formulation. If we impose a constraint into (7), then its effect is rather similar to that of the second term in (7). In this section, we consider a direct extension of binary large-margin method (1) to multi-category case. The choice given below is motivated by [5], where an extension of SVM was proposed. We use a risk formulation that is different from (7), and for simplicity, we will consider linear equality constraint only: K Ψc (f ) = φ(−fk ), s.t. f ∈ Ω, (10) k=1,k=c where we deﬁne Ω as: K Ω = {f : fk = 0} ∪ {f : sup fk = ∞}. k k=1 We may interpret the added constraint as a restriction on the function class Cn in (3) such that every f ∈ Cn satisﬁes the constraint. Note that with K = 2, this leads to the usually binary large margin method. Using (10), the conditional true risk (5) can be written as: K (1 − qc )φ(−fc ), L(q, f ) = s.t. f ∈ Ω. (11) c=1 The following result provides a simple way to check the admissibility of (10). Proposition 4.1 If φ is a convex function which is bounded below and φ (0) < 0, then (10) is admissible on Ω. Proof Sketch. The continuity condition is straight-forward to verify. We may also assume that φ(·) ≥ 0 without loss of generality. Now let f achieves the minimum of L(q, ·). If fc = ∞, then it is clear that qc = 1 and thus qk = 0 for k = c. This implies that for k = c, φ(−fk ) = inf f φ(−f ), and thus fk < 0. If fc = supk fk < ∞, then the constraint implies fc ≥ 0. It is easy to see that ∀k, qc ≥ qk since otherwise, we must have φ(−fk ) > φ(−fc ), and thus φ (−fk ) > 0 and φ (−fc ) < 0, implying that with sufﬁcient small δ > 0, φ(−(fk + δ)) < φ(−fk ) and φ(−(fc − δ)) < φ(−fc ). A contradiction. 2 Using the above criterion, we can convert any admissible convex φ for the binary formulation (1) into an admissible multi-category classiﬁcation formulation (10). In [5] the special case of SVM (with loss function φ(u) = max(0, 1 − u)) was studied. The authors demonstrated the admissibility by direct calculation, although no results similar to Theorem 2.1 were established. Such a result is needed to prove consistency. The treatment presented here generalizes their study. Note that for the constrained formulation, it is more difﬁcult to relate fc at the optimal solution to a probability model, since such a model will have a much more complicated form compared with the unconstrained counterpart. 5 Conclusion In this paper we proposed a family of risk minimization methods for multi-category classiﬁcation problems, which are natural extensions of binary large margin classiﬁcation methods. We established admissibility conditions that ensure the consistency of the obtained classiﬁers in the large sample limit. Two speciﬁc forms of risk minimization were proposed and examples were given to study the induced probability models. As an implication of this work, we see that it is possible to obtain consistent (conditional) density estimation using various non-maximum likelihood estimation methods. One advantage of some of the newly proposed methods is that they allow us to model zero density directly. Note that for the maximum-likelihood method, near zero density may cause serious robustness problems at least in theory. References [1] P.L. Bartlett, M.I. Jordan, and J.D. McAuliffe.

<p>Author: Saharon Rosset, Ji Zhu, Trevor J. Hastie</p><p>Abstract: Margin maximizing properties play an important role in the analysis of classi£cation models, such as boosting and support vector machines. Margin maximization is theoretically interesting because it facilitates generalization error analysis, and practically interesting because it presents a clear geometric interpretation of the models being built. We formulate and prove a suf£cient condition for the solutions of regularized loss functions to converge to margin maximizing separators, as the regularization vanishes. This condition covers the hinge loss of SVM, the exponential loss of AdaBoost and logistic regression loss. We also generalize it to multi-class classi£cation problems, and present margin maximizing multiclass versions of logistic regression and support vector machines. 1</p><p>4 0.62282854 <a title="101-lsi-4" href="./nips-2003-Sparseness_of_Support_Vector_Machines---Some_Asymptotically_Sharp_Bounds.html">180 nips-2003-Sparseness of Support Vector Machines---Some Asymptotically Sharp Bounds</a></p>
<p>Author: Ingo Steinwart</p><p>Abstract: The decision functions constructed by support vector machines (SVM’s) usually depend only on a subset of the training set—the so-called support vectors. We derive asymptotically sharp lower and upper bounds on the number of support vectors for several standard types of SVM’s. In particular, we show for the Gaussian RBF kernel that the fraction of support vectors tends to twice the Bayes risk for the L1-SVM, to the probability of noise for the L2-SVM, and to 1 for the LS-SVM. 1</p><p>5 0.55892044 <a title="101-lsi-5" href="./nips-2003-Near-Minimax_Optimal_Classification_with_Dyadic_Classification_Trees.html">134 nips-2003-Near-Minimax Optimal Classification with Dyadic Classification Trees</a></p>
<p>Author: Clayton Scott, Robert Nowak</p><p>Abstract: This paper reports on a family of computationally practical classiﬁers that converge to the Bayes error at near-minimax optimal rates for a variety of distributions. The classiﬁers are based on dyadic classiﬁcation trees (DCTs), which involve adaptively pruned partitions of the feature space. A key aspect of DCTs is their spatial adaptivity, which enables local (rather than global) ﬁtting of the decision boundary. Our risk analysis involves a spatial decomposition of the usual concentration inequalities, leading to a spatially adaptive, data-dependent pruning criterion. For any distribution on (X, Y ) whose Bayes decision boundary behaves locally like a Lipschitz smooth function, we show that the DCT error converges to the Bayes error at a rate within a logarithmic factor of the minimax optimal rate. We also study DCTs equipped with polynomial classiﬁcation rules at each leaf, and show that as the smoothness of the boundary increases their errors converge to the Bayes error at a rate approaching n−1/2 , the parametric rate. We are not aware of any other practical classiﬁers that provide similar rate of convergence guarantees. Fast algorithms for tree pruning are discussed. 1</p><p>6 0.53596127 <a title="101-lsi-6" href="./nips-2003-Online_Learning_of_Non-stationary_Sequences.html">146 nips-2003-Online Learning of Non-stationary Sequences</a></p>

<p>Author: Bertram E. Shi, Eric K. Tsang</p><p>Abstract: The relative depth of objects causes small shifts in the left and right retinal positions of these objects, called binocular disparity. Here, we describe a neuromorphic implementation of a disparity selective complex cell using the binocular energy model, which has been proposed to model the response of disparity selective cells in the visual cortex. Our system consists of two silicon chips containing spiking neurons with monocular Gabor-type spatial receptive fields (RF) and circuits that combine the spike outputs to compute a disparity selective complex cell response. The disparity selectivity of the cell can be adjusted by both position and phase shifts between the monocular RF profiles, which are both used in biology. Our neuromorphic system performs better with phase encoding, because the relative responses of neurons tuned to different disparities by phase shifts are better matched than the responses of neurons tuned by position shifts.</p><p>2 0.90623003 <a title="101-lda-2" href="./nips-2003-Simplicial_Mixtures_of_Markov_Chains%3A_Distributed_Modelling_of_Dynamic_User_Profiles.html">177 nips-2003-Simplicial Mixtures of Markov Chains: Distributed Modelling of Dynamic User Profiles</a></p>
<p>Author: Mark Girolami, Ata Kabán</p><p>Abstract: To provide a compact generative representation of the sequential activity of a number of individuals within a group there is a tradeoff between the deﬁnition of individual speciﬁc and global models. This paper proposes a linear-time distributed model for ﬁnite state symbolic sequences representing traces of individual user activity by making the assumption that heterogeneous user behavior may be ‘explained’ by a relatively small number of common structurally simple behavioral patterns which may interleave randomly in a user-speciﬁc proportion. The results of an empirical study on three different sources of user traces indicates that this modelling approach provides an efﬁcient representation scheme, reﬂected by improved prediction performance as well as providing lowcomplexity and intuitively interpretable representations.</p><p>3 0.89410686 <a title="101-lda-3" href="./nips-2003-Synchrony_Detection_by_Analogue_VLSI_Neurons_with_Bimodal_STDP_Synapses.html">183 nips-2003-Synchrony Detection by Analogue VLSI Neurons with Bimodal STDP Synapses</a></p>
<p>Author: Adria Bofill-i-petit, Alan F. Murray</p><p>Abstract: We present test results from spike-timing correlation learning experiments carried out with silicon neurons with STDP (Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity) synapses. The weight change scheme of the STDP synapses can be set to either weight-independent or weight-dependent mode. We present results that characterise the learning window implemented for both modes of operation. When presented with spike trains with diﬀerent types of synchronisation the neurons develop bimodal weight distributions. We also show that a 2-layered network of silicon spiking neurons with STDP synapses can perform hierarchical synchrony detection. 1</p><p>same-paper 4 0.86849105 <a title="101-lda-4" href="./nips-2003-Large_Margin_Classifiers%3A_Convex_Loss%2C_Low_Noise%2C_and_Convergence_Rates.html">101 nips-2003-Large Margin Classifiers: Convex Loss, Low Noise, and Convergence Rates</a></p>
<p>Author: Peter L. Bartlett, Michael I. Jordan, Jon D. Mcauliffe</p><p>Abstract: Many classiﬁcation algorithms, including the support vector machine, boosting and logistic regression, can be viewed as minimum contrast methods that minimize a convex surrogate of the 0-1 loss function. We characterize the statistical consequences of using such a surrogate by providing a general quantitative relationship between the risk as assessed using the 0-1 loss and the risk as assessed using any nonnegative surrogate loss function. We show that this relationship gives nontrivial bounds under the weakest possible condition on the loss function—that it satisfy a pointwise form of Fisher consistency for classiﬁcation. The relationship is based on a variational transformation of the loss function that is easy to compute in many applications. We also present a reﬁned version of this result in the case of low noise. Finally, we present applications of our results to the estimation of convergence rates in the general setting of function classes that are scaled hulls of a ﬁnite-dimensional base class.</p><p>5 0.73157549 <a title="101-lda-5" href="./nips-2003-Inferring_State_Sequences_for_Non-linear_Systems_with_Embedded_Hidden_Markov_Models.html">91 nips-2003-Inferring State Sequences for Non-linear Systems with Embedded Hidden Markov Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Radford M. Neal, Matthew J. Beal, Sam T. Roweis</p><p>Abstract: We describe a Markov chain method for sampling from the distribution of the hidden state sequence in a non-linear dynamical system, given a sequence of observations. This method updates all states in the sequence simultaneously using an embedded Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An update begins with the creation of “pools” of candidate states at each time. We then deﬁne an embedded HMM whose states are indexes within these pools. Using a forward-backward dynamic programming algorithm, we can efﬁciently choose a state sequence with the appropriate probabilities from the exponentially large number of state sequences that pass through states in these pools. We illustrate the method in a simple one-dimensional example, and in an example showing how an embedded HMM can be used to in effect discretize the state space without any discretization error. We also compare the embedded HMM to a particle smoother on a more substantial problem of inferring human motion from 2D traces of markers. 1</p><p>6 0.7248584 <a title="101-lda-6" href="./nips-2003-Gaussian_Processes_in_Reinforcement_Learning.html">78 nips-2003-Gaussian Processes in Reinforcement Learning</a></p>

<h1>44 nips-2002-Binary Tuning is Optimal for Neural Rate Coding with High Temporal Resolution</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2002-44-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2201-binary-tuning-is-optimal-for-neural-rate-coding-with-high-temporal-resolution.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Matthias Bethge, David Rotermund, Klaus Pawelzik</p><p>Abstract: Here we derive optimal gain functions for minimum mean square reconstruction from neural rate responses subjected to Poisson noise. The shape of these functions strongly depends on the length T of the time window within which spikes are counted in order to estimate the underlying firing rate. A phase transition towards pure binary encoding occurs if the maximum mean spike count becomes smaller than approximately three provided the minimum firing rate is zero. For a particular function class, we were able to prove the existence of a second-order phase transition analytically. The critical decoding time window length obtained from the analytical derivation is in precise agreement with the numerical results. We conclude that under most circumstances relevant to information processing in the brain, rate coding can be better ascribed to a binary (low-entropy) code than to the other extreme of rich analog coding. 1 Optimal neuronal gain functions for short decoding time windows The use of action potentials (spikes) as a means of communication is the striking feature of neurons in the central nervous system. Since the discovery by Adrian [1] that action potentials are generated by sensory neurons with a frequency that is substantially determined by the stimulus, the idea of rate coding has become a prevalent paradigm in neuroscience [2]. In particular, today the coding properties of many neurons from various areas in the cortex have been characterized by tuning curves, which describe the average firing rate response as a function of certain stimulus parameters. This way of description is closely related to the idea of analog coding, which constitutes the basis for many neural network models. Reliabl v inference from the observed number of spikes about the underlying firing rate of a neuronal response, however, requires a sufficiently long time interval, while integration times of neurons in vivo [3] as well as reaction times of humans or animals when performing classification tasks [4, 5] are known to be rather short. Therefore, it is important to understand, how neural rate coding is affected by a limited time window available for decoding. While rate codes are usually characterized by tuning functions relating the intensity of the ,f * http://www.neuro.urn-bremen.dermbethge neuronal response to a particular stimulus parameter, the question, how relevant the idea of analog coding actually is does not depend on the particular entity represented by a neuron. Instead it suffices to determine the shape of the gain function, which displays the mean firing rate as a function of the actual analog signal to be sent to subsequent neurons. Here we seek for optimal gain functions that minimize the minimum average squared reconstruction error for a uniform source signal transmitted through a Poisson channel as a function of the maximum mean number of spikes. In formal terms, the issue is to optimally encode a real random variable x in the number of pulses emitted by a neuron within a certain time window. Thereby, x stands for the intended analog output of the neuron that shall be signaled to subsequent neurons. The latter, however, can only observe a number of spikes k integrated within a time interval of length T. The statistical dependency between x and k is specified by the assumption of Poisson noise p(kIJL(x)) = (JL~))k exp{ -JL(X)} , (1) and the choice of the gain function f(x), which together with T determines the mean spike count J.L(x) == T f(x) . An important additional constraint is the limited output range of the neuronal firing rate, which can be included by the requirement of a bounded gain function (fmin :::; f (x) :::; f max, VX). Since inhibition can reliably prevent a neuron from firing, we will here consider the case f min == 0 only. Instead of specifying f max, we impose a bound directly on the mean spike count (i.e. J.L(x) :::; /l), because f max constitutes a meaningful constraint only in conjunction with a fixed time window length T. As objective function we consider the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) with respect to Lebesgue measure for x E [0, 1], ~ 2 X _ E x2 _ E (i2 _ _ [jt( )] - [] [] - 3 X ~ (Xl (J01 xp(kIJL(x)) dx r J01p(kIJL(x)) dx' (2) where x(k) == E[xlk] denotes the mean square estimator, which is the conditional expectation (see e.g. [6]). 1.1 Tunings and errors As derived in [7] on the basis of Fisher information the optimal gain function for a single neuron in the asymptotic limit T -+ 00 has a parabolic shape: fasymp(x) == fmaxx2 . (3) For any finite /l, however, this gain function is not necessarily optimal, and in the limit T -+ 0, it is straight forward to show that the optimal tuning curve is a step function f step (xl'19) == fmax 8 (x - {)) , (4) where 8(z) denotes the Heaviside function that equals one, if z > 0 and zero if z < O. The optimal threshold 'l9(p,) of the step tuning curve depends on /l and can be determined analytically 11(-) =1_ It 3 - V8e-J.' +1 4(1 - e- il ) (5) as well as the corresponding MMSE [8]: 2 2[fste p] _ 1 ( 3'19 (p,) ) X - 12 1 - [(1 -11(p))(l - e-iL)]-1 - 1 .

The dotted line separates the regions before and after the phase transition in all three panels. Left from this line (i.e. for Jt < Jt C) the step function given by Eq. 4+5 is optimal. The middle panel shows the MMSE of this step function (dashed) and of the optimal gain function in 52 (solid), which becomes smaller than the first one after the phase transition. The relative deviation between the minimal errors of 51 and 52 (i.e. (X~l - X~2)/X~2) is displayed in the lower panel and has a maximum below 0.035. The binary shape for small {t and the continuous parabolic shape for large {t implies that there has to be a transition from discrete to analog encoding with increasing {to Unfortunately it is not possible to determine the optimal gain function within the set of all bounded functions B :== {fli : [0, 1] -+ [0, fmax]} and hence, one has to choose a certain parameterized function space 5 c B in advance that is feasible for the optimization. In [8], we investigated various such function-'spaces and for {t < 2.9, we did not find any gain function with an error smaller than the MMSE of the step function. Furthermore, we always observed a phase transition from binary to analog encoding at a critical {t C that depends only slightly on the function space. As one can see in Fig. 1 (upper) pc is approximately three. In this paper, we consider two function classes 51, 52, which both contain the binary gain function as well as the asymptotic optimal parabolic function as special cases. Furthermore 51 is a proper subset of 52. Our interest in 51 results from the fact that we can analyze the phase transition in this subset analytically, while 52 is the most general parameterization for which we have. determined the optimal encoding numerically. The latter has six free parameters a :::; b :::; c E [0, 1], fmid E (0, fmax), a, f3 E [0,00) and the parameterization of the gain functions is given by o fS2 (xla, b, c, fmid, a, (3) fmid ( ~=: == , O</p><br/>

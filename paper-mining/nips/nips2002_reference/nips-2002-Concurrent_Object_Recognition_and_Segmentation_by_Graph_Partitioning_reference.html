<h1>57 nips-2002-Concurrent Object Recognition and Segmentation by Graph Partitioning</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2002-57-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2338-concurrent-object-recognition-and-segmentation-by-graph-partitioning.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Stella X. Yu, Ralph Gross, Jianbo Shi</p><p>Abstract: Segmentation and recognition have long been treated as two separate processes. We propose a mechanism based on spectral graph partitioning that readily combine the two processes into one. A part-based recognition system detects object patches, supplies their partial segmentations as well as knowledge about the spatial configurations of the object. The goal of patch grouping is to find a set of patches that conform best to the object configuration, while the goal of pixel grouping is to find a set of pixels that have the best low-level feature similarity. Through pixel-patch interactions and between-patch competition encoded in the solution space, these two processes are realized in one joint optimization problem. The globally optimal partition is obtained by solving a constrained eigenvalue problem. We demonstrate that the resulting object segmentation eliminates false positives for the part detection, while overcoming occlusion and weak contours for the low-level edge detection.</p><br/>

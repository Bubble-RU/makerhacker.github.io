<h1>16 nips-2002-A Prototype for Automatic Recognition of Spontaneous Facial Actions</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="nips-2002-16-pdf" href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/2277-a-prototype-for-automatic-recognition-of-spontaneous-facial-actions.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: M.S. Bartlett, G.C. Littlewort, T.J. Sejnowski, J.R. Movellan</p><p>Abstract: We present ongoing work on a project for automatic recognition of spontaneous facial actions. Spontaneous facial expressions differ substantially from posed expressions, similar to how continuous, spontaneous speech differs from isolated words produced on command. Previous methods for automatic facial expression recognition assumed images were collected in controlled environments in which the subjects deliberately faced the camera. Since people often nod or turn their heads, automatic recognition of spontaneous facial behavior requires methods for handling out-of-image-plane head rotations. Here we explore an approach based on 3-D warping of images into canonical views. We evaluated the performance of the approach as a front-end for a spontaneous expression recognition system using support vector machines and hidden Markov models. This system employed general purpose learning mechanisms that can be applied to recognition of any facial movement. The system was tested for recognition of a set of facial actions deﬁned by the Facial Action Coding System (FACS). We showed that 3D tracking and warping followed by machine learning techniques directly applied to the warped images, is a viable and promising technology for automatic facial expression recognition. One exciting aspect of the approach presented here is that information about movement dynamics emerged out of ﬁlters which were derived from the statistics of images.</p><br/>

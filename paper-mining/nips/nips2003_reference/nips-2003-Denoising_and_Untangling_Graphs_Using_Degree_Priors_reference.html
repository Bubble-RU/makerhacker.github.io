Frey</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of untangling hidden graphs from a set of noisy detections of undirected edges. We present a model of the generation of the observed graph that includes degree-based structure priors on the hidden graphs. Exact inference in the model is intractable; we present an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm to compute edge appearance posteriors. We evaluate our model and algorithm on a biological graph inference problem. 1 Introduction and motivation The inference of hidden graphs from noisy edge appearance data is an important problem with obvious practical application. For example, biologists are currently building networks of all the physical protein-protein interactions (PPI) that occur in particular organisms. The importance of this enterprise is commensurate with its scale: a completed network would be as valuable as a completed genome sequence, and because each organism contains thousands of diﬀerent types of proteins, there are millions of possible types of interactions. However, scalable experimental methods for detecting interactions are noisy, generating many false detections. Motivated by this application, we formulate the general problem of inferring hidden graphs as probabilistic inference in a graphical model, and we introduce an eﬃcient algorithm that approximates the posterior probability that an edge is present. In our model, a set of hidden, constituent graphs are combined to generate the observed graph. Each hidden graph is independently sampled from a prior on graph structure. The combination mechanism acts independently on each edge but can be either stochastic or deterministic. Figure 1 shows an example of our generative model. Typically one of the hidden graphs represents the graph of interest (the true graph), the others represent diﬀerent types of observation noise. Independent edge noise may also be added by the combination mechanism. We use probabilistic inference to compute a likely decomposition of the observed graph into its constituent parts. This process is deemed “untangling”. We use the term “denoising” to refer to the special case where the edge noise is independent. In denoising there is a single hidden graph, the true graph, and all edge noise in the observed graph is due E1 1 eij E2 i 2 eij j xij i j i j X Figure 1: Illustrative generative model example. Figure shows an example where an observed graph, X, is a noisy composition of two constituent graphs, E 1 and E 2 . All graphs share the same vertex set, so each can be represented by a symmetric matrix of random binary variables (i.e., an adjacency matrix). This generative model is designed to solve a toy counter-espionage problem. The vertices represent suspects and each edge in X represents an observed call between two suspects. The graph X reﬂects zero or more spy rings (represented by E 1 ), telemarketing calls (represented by E 2 ), social calls (independent edge noise), and lost call records (more independent edge noise). The task is to locate any spy rings hidden in X. We model the distribution of spy ring graphs using a prior, P (E 1 ), that has support only on graphs where all vertices have degree of either 2 (i.e., are in the ring) or 0 (i.e., are not). Graphs of telemarketing call patterns are represented using a prior, P (E 2 ), under which all nodes have degrees of > 3 (i.e., are telemarketers), 1 (i.e., are telemarketees), or 0 (i.e., are neither). The displayed hidden graphs are one likely untangling of X. to the combination mechanism. Prior distributions over graphs can be speciﬁed in various ways, but our choice is motivated by problems we want to solve, and by a view to deriving an eﬃcient inference algorithm. One compact representation of a distribution over graphs consists of specifying a distribution over vertex degrees, and assuming that graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable. Such a prior can model quite rich distributions over graphs. These degree-based structure priors are natural representions of graph structure; many classes of real-world networks have a characteristic functional form associated with their degree distributions [1], and sometimes this form can be predicted using knowledge about the domain (see, e.g., [2]) or detected empirically (see, e.g., [3, 4]). As such, our model incorporates degree-based structure priors. Though exact inference in our model is intractable in general, we present an eﬃcient algorithm for approximate inference for arbitrary degree distributions. We evaluate our model and algorithm using the real-world example of untangling yeast proteinprotein interaction networks. 2 A model of noisy and tangled graphs For degree-based structure priors, inference consists of searching over vertex degrees and edge instantiations, while comparing each edge with its noisy observation and enforcing the constraint that the number of edges connected to every vertex must equal the degree of the vertex. Our formulation of the problem in this way is inspired by the success of the sum-product algorithm (loopy belief propagation) for solving similar formulations of problems in error-correcting decoding [6, 7], phase unwrapping [8], and random satisﬁability [9]. For example, in error-correcting decoding, inference consists of searching over conﬁgurations of codeword bits, while comparing each bit with its noisy observation and enforcing parity-check constraints on subsets of bits [10]. For a graph on a set of N vertices, eij is a variable that indicates the presence of an edge connecting vertices i and j: eij = 1 if there is an edge, and eij = 0 otherwise. We assume the vertex set is ﬁxed, so each graph is speciﬁed by an adjacency matrix, E = {eij }N . The degree of vertex i is denoted by di and the i,j=1 degree set by D = {di }N . The observations are given by a noisy adjacency matrix, i=1 X = {xij }N . Generally, edges can be directed, but in this paper we focus on i,j=1 undirected graphs, so eij = eji and xij = xji . Assuming the observation noise is independent for diﬀerent edges, the joint distribution is P (X, E, D) = P (X|E)P (E, D) = P (xij |eij ) P (E, D). j≥i P (xij |eij ) models the edge observation noise. We use an undirected model for the joint distribution over edges and degrees, P (E, D), where the prior distribution over di is determined by a non-negative potential fi (di ). Assuming graphs that have the same vertex degrees are equiprobable, we have N eij ) , fi (di )I(di , P (E, D) ∝ i j=1 where I(a, b) = 1 if a = b, and I(a, b) = 0 if a = b. The term I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . It is straightforward to show that the marginal distribution over di is P (di ) ∝ fi (di ) D\di nD j=i fj (dj ) , where nD is the number of graphs with degrees D and the sum is over all degree variables except di . The potentials, fi , can be estimated from a given degree prior using Markov chain Monte Carlo; or, as an approximation, they can be set to an empirical degree distribution obtained from noise-free graphs. Fig 2a shows the factor graph [11] for the above model. Each ﬁlled square corresponds to a term in the factorization of the joint distribution and the square is connected to all variables on which the term depends. Factor graphs are graphical models that unify the properties of Bayesian networks and Markov random ﬁelds [12]. Many inference algorithms, including the sum-product algorithm (a.k.a. loopy belief propagation), are more easily derived using factor graphs than Bayesian networks or Markov random ﬁelds. We describe the sum-product algorithm for our model in section 3.

The indicator function I(di , j eij ) enforces the constraint that the sum of the binary edge indicator variables for vertex i must equal the degree of vertex i. (b) A factor graph that explains noisy observed edges as a combination of two constituent graphs, with edge indicator variables e 1 and e2 . ij ij (c) The constraint I(di , j eij ) can be implemented using a chain with state variables, which leads to an exponentially faster message-passing algorithm. 2.1 Combining multiple graphs The above model is suitable when we want to infer a graph that matches a degree prior, assuming the edge observation noise is independent. A more challenging goal, with practical application, is to infer multiple hidden graphs that combine to explain the observed edge data. In section 4, we show how priors over multiple hidden graphs can be be used to infer protein-protein interactions. When there are H hidden graphs, each constituent graph is speciﬁed by a set of edges on the same set of N common vertices. For the degree variables and edge variables, we use a superscript to indicate which hidden graph the variable is used to describe. Assuming the graphs are independent, the joint distribution over the observed edge data X, and the edge variables and degree variables for the hidden graphs, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH , is H P (X, E 1 , D1 , . . . , E H , DH ) = P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) ij ij j≥i P (E h , Dh ), (1) h=1 where for each hidden graph, P (E h , Dh ) is modeled as described above. Here, the likelihood P (xij |e1 , . . . , eH ) describes how the edges in the hidden graphs combine ij ij to model the observed edge. Figure 2b shows the factor graph for this model. 3 Probabilistic inference of constituent graphs Exact probabilistic inference in the above models is intractable, here we introduce an approximate inference algorithm that consists of applying the sum-product algorithm, while ignoring cycles in the factor graph. Although the sum-product algorithm has been used to obtain excellent results on several problems [6, 7, 13, 14, 8, 9], we have found that the algorithm works best when the model consists of uncertain observations of variables that are subject to a large number of hard constraints. Thus the formulation of the model described above. Conceptually, our inference algorithm is a straight-forward application of the sumproduct algorithm, c.f. [15], where messages are passed along edges in the factor graph iteratively, and then combined at variables to obtain estimates of posterior probabilities. However, direct implementation of the message-passing updates will lead to an intractable algorithm. In particular, direct implementation of the update for the message sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik takes a number of scalar operations that is exponential in the number of vertices. Fortunately there exists a more eﬃcient way to compute these messages. 3.1 Eﬃciently summing over edge conﬁgurations The function I(di , j eij ) ensures that the number of edges connected to vertex i is equal to di . Passing messages through this function requires summing over all edge conﬁgurations that correspond to each possible degree, di , and summing over di . Speciﬁcally, the message, µIi →eik (eik ), sent from function I(di , j eij ) to edge variable eik is given by I(di , di {eij | j=1,...,N, j=k} eij ) j µeij →Ii (eij ) , j=k where µeij →Ii (eij ) is the message sent from eij to function I(di , j eij ). The sum over {eij | j = 1, . . . , N, j = k} contains 2N −1 terms, so direct computation is intractable. However, for a maximum degree of dmax , all messages departing from the function I(di , j eij ) can be computed using order dmax N binary scalar operations, by introducing integer state variables sij . We deﬁne sij = n≤j ein and note that, by recursion, sij = sij−1 + eij , where si0 = 0 and 0 ≤ sij ≤ dmax . This recursive expression enables us to write the high-complexity constraint as the sum of a product of low-complexity constraints, N I(di , eij ) = j I(si1 , ei1 ) {sij | j=1,...,N } I(sij , sij−1 + eij ) I(di , siN ). j=2 This summation can be performed using the forward-backward algorithm. In the factor graph, the summation can be implemented by replacing the function I(di , j eij ) with a chain of lower-complexity functions, connected as shown in Fig. 2c. The function vertex (ﬁlled square) on the far left corresponds to I(si1 , ei1 ) and the function vertex in the upper right corresponds to I(di , siN ). So, messages can be passed through each constraint function I(di , j eij ) in an eﬃcient manner, by performing a single forward-backward pass in the corresponding chain. 4 Results We evaluate our model using yeast protein-protein interaction (PPI) data compiled by [16]. These data include eight sets of putative, but noisy, interactions derived from various sources, and one gold-standard set of interactions detected by reliable experiments. Using the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins as vertices, we represent the eight sets of putative m interactions using adjacency matrices {Y m }8 m=1 where yij = 1 if and only if putative interaction dataset m contains an interaction between proteins i and j. We similarly use Y gold to represent the gold-standard interactions. m We construct an observed graph, X, by setting xij = maxm yij for all i and j, thus the observed edge set is the union of all the putative edge sets. We test our model (a) (b) 40 0 untangling baseline random empirical potential posterior −2 30 log Pr true positives (%) 50 20 10 −4 −6 −8 0 0 5 10 −10 0 false positives (%) 10 20 30 degree (# of nodes) Figure 3: Protein-protein interaction network untangling results.

We formalize this problem as that of decomposing X into two constituent graphs E 1 and E 2 , the gold true and the noise graphs respectively, such that e1 = xij yij and e2 = xij − e1 . ij ij ij We use a training set to ﬁt our model parameters and then measure task performance on a test set. The training set contains a randomly selected half of the ∼ 6300 yeast proteins, and the subgraphs of E 1 , E 2 , and X restricted to those vertices. The test contains the other half of the proteins and the corresponding subgraphs. Note that interactions connecting test set proteins to training set proteins (and vice versa) are ignored. We ﬁt three sets of parameters: a set of Naive Bayes parameters that deﬁne a set of edge-speciﬁc likelihood functions, Pij (xij |e1 , e2 ), one degree potential, f 1 , which ij ij is the same for every vertex in E1 and deﬁnes the prior P (E 1 ), and a second, f 2 , that similarly deﬁnes the prior P (E 2 ). The likelihood functions, Pij , are used to both assign likelihoods and enforce problem constraints. Given our problem deﬁnition, if xij = 0 then e1 = e2 = 0, ij ij otherwise xij = 1 and e1 = 1 − e2 . We enforce the former constraint by setij ij ting Pij (xij = 0|e1 , e2 ) = (1 − e1 )(1 − e2 ), and the latter by setting Pij (xij = ij ij ij ij 1|e1 , e2 ) = 0 whenever e1 = e2 . This construction of Pij simpliﬁes the calculation ij ij ij ij of the µPij →eh messages and improves the computational eﬃciency of inference beij cause when xij = 0, we need never update messages to and from variables e1 and ij e2 . We complete the speciﬁcation of Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) as follows: ij ij ij ym Pij (xij = 1|e1 , e2 ) ij ij = m ij θm (1 − θm )1−yij , if e1 = 1 and e2 = 0, ij ij ym m ij ψm (1 − ψm )1−yij , if e1 = 0 and e2 = 1. ij ij where {θm } and {ψm } are naive Bayes parameters, θm = i,j m yij e1 / ij i,j e1 and ij ψm = i,j m yij e2 / ij i,j e2 , respectively. ij The degree potentials f 1 (d) and f 2 (d) are kernel density estimates ﬁt to the degree distribution of the training set subgraphs of E 1 and E 2 , respectively. We use Gaussian kernels and set the width parameter (standard deviation) σ using leaveone-out cross-validation to maximize the total log density of the held-out datapoints. Each datapoint is the degree of a single vertex. Both degree potentials closely followed the training set empirical degree distributions. Untangling was done on the test set subgraph of X. We initially set the µ Pij →e1 ij messages equal to the likelihood function Pij and we randomly initialized the 1 µIj →e1 messages with samples from a normal distribution with mean 0 and variij ance 0.01. We then performed 40 iterations of the following message update order: 2 2 1 1 µe1 →Ij , µIj →e1 , µe1 →Pij , µPij →e2 , µe2 →Ij , µIj →e2 , µe2 →Pij , µPij →e1 . ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij We evaluated our untangling algorithm using an ROC curve by comparing the actual ˆ test set subgraph of E 1 to posterior marginal probabilities,P (e1 = 1|X), estimated ij by our sum-product algorithm. Note that because the true interaction network is sparse (less than 0.2% of the 1.8 × 107 possible interactions are likely present [16]) and, in this case, true positive predictions are of greater biological interest than true negative predictions, we focus on low false positive rate portions of the ROC curve. Figure 3a compares the performance of a classiﬁer for e1 based on thresholding ij ˆ P (eij = 1|X) to a baseline method based on thresholding the likelihood functions, Pij (xij = 1|e1 = 1, e2 = 0). Note because e1 = 0 whenever xij = 0, we exclude ij ij ij the xij = 0 cases from our performance evaluation. The ROC curve shows that for the same low false positive rate, untangling produces 50% − 100% more true positives than the baseline method. Figure 3b shows that the degree potential, the true degree distribution, and the predicted degree distribution are all comparable. The slight overprediction of the true degree distribution may result because the degree potential f 1 that deﬁnes P (E 1 ) is not equal to the expected degree distribution of graphs sampled from the distribution P (E 1 ). 5 Summary and Related Work Related work includes other algorithms for structure-based graph denoising [17, 18]. These algorithms use structural properties of the observed graph to score edges and rely on the true graph having a surprisingly large number of three (or four) edge cycles compared to the noise graph. In contrast, we place graph generation in a probabilistic framework; our algorithm computes structural ﬁt in the hidden graph, where this computation is not aﬀected by the noise graph(s); and we allow for multiple sources of observation noise, each with its own structural properties. After submitting this paper to the NIPS conference, we discovered [19], in which a degree-based graph structure prior is used to denoise (but not untangle) observed graphs. This paper addresses denoising in directed graphs as well as undirected graphs, however, the prior that they use is not amenable to deriving an eﬃcient sumproduct algorithm. Instead, they use Markov Chain Monte Carlo to do approximate inference in a hidden graph containing 40 vertices. It is not clear how well this approach scales to the ∼ 3000 vertex graphs that we are using. In summary, the contributions of the work described in this paper include: a general formulation of the problem of graph untangling as inference in a factor graph; an eﬃcient approximate inference algorithm for a rich class of degree-based structure priors; and a set of reliability scores (i.e., edge posteriors) for interactions from a current version of the yeast protein-protein interaction network.

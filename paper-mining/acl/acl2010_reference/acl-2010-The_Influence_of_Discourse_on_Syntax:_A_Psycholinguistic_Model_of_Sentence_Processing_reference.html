<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-229-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1120.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Amit Dubey</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic models of sentence comprehension are increasingly relevant to questions concerning human language processing. However, such models are often limited to syntactic factors. This paper introduces a novel sentence processing model that consists of a parser augmented with a probabilistic logic-based model of coreference resolution, which allows us to simulate how context interacts with syntax in a reading task. Our simulations show that a Weakly Interactive cognitive architecture can explain data which had been provided as evidence for the Strongly Interactive hypothesis.</p><br/>

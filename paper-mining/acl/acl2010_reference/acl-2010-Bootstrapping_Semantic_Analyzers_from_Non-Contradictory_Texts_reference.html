<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-55-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1098.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Ivan Titov ; Mikhail Kozhevnikov</p><p>Abstract: We argue that groups of unannotated texts with overlapping and non-contradictory semantics represent a valuable source of information for learning semantic representations. A simple and efficient inference method recursively induces joint semantic representations for each group and discovers correspondence between lexical entries and latent semantic concepts. We consider the generative semantics-text correspondence model (Liang et al., 2009) and demonstrate that exploiting the noncontradiction relation between texts leads to substantial improvements over natural baselines on a problem of analyzing human-written weather forecasts.</p><br/>

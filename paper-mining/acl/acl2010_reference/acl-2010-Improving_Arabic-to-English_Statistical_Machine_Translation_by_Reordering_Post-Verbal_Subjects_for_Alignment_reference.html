<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-145-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-2033.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Yuval Marton ; Nizar Habash</p><p>Abstract: We study the challenges raised by Arabic verb and subject detection and reordering in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). We show that post-verbal subject (VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering patterns when translated to English. In addition, implementing reordering is difficult because the boundaries of VS constructions are hard to detect accurately, even with a state-of-the-art Arabic dependency parser. We therefore propose to reorder VS constructions into SV order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy significantly improves BLEU and TER scores, even on a strong large-scale baseline and despite noisy parses.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-187-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1103.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Verena Rieser ; Oliver Lemon ; Xingkun Liu</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to Information Presentation (IP) in Spoken Dialogue Systems (SDS) using a data-driven statistical optimisation framework for content planning and attribute selection. First we collect data in a Wizard-of-Oz (WoZ) experiment and use it to build a supervised model of human behaviour. This forms a baseline for measuring the performance of optimised policies, developed from this data using Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods. We show that the optimised policies significantly outperform the baselines in a variety of generation scenarios: while the supervised model is able to attain up to 87.6% of the possible reward on this task, the RL policies are significantly better in 5 out of 6 scenarios, gaining up to 91.5% of the total possible reward. The RL policies perform especially well in more complex scenarios. We are also the first to show that adding predictive “lower level” features (e.g. from the NLG realiser) is important for optimising IP strategies according to user preferences. This provides new insights into the nature of the IP problem for SDS.</p><br/>

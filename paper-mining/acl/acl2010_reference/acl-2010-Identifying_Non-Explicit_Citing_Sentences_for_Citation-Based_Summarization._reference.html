<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-140-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1057.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Vahed Qazvinian ; Dragomir R. Radev</p><p>Abstract: Identifying background (context) information in scientific articles can help scholars understand major contributions in their research area more easily. In this paper, we propose a general framework based on probabilistic inference to extract such context information from scientific papers. We model the sentences in an article and their lexical similarities as a Markov Random Field tuned to detect the patterns that context data create, and employ a Belief Propagation mechanism to detect likely context sentences. We also address the problem of generating surveys of scientific papers. Our experiments show greater pyramid scores for surveys generated using such context information rather than citation sentences alone.</p><br/>

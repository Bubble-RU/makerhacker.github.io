<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-119-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-2027.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Narges Sharif Razavian ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: Factored Statistical Machine Translation extends the Phrase Based SMT model by allowing each word to be a vector of factors. Experiments have shown effectiveness of many factors, including the Part of Speech tags in improving the grammaticality of the output. However, high quality part of speech taggers are not available in open domain for many languages. In this paper we used fixed length word suffix as a new factor in the Factored SMT, and were able to achieve significant improvements in three set of experiments: large NIST Arabic to English system, medium WMT Spanish to English system, and small TRANSTAC English to Iraqi system. 1</p><br/>

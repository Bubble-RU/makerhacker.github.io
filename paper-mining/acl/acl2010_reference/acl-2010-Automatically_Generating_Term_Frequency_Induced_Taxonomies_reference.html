<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-43-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-2023.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Karin Murthy ; Tanveer A Faruquie ; L Venkata Subramaniam ; Hima Prasad K ; Mukesh Mohania</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel method to automatically acquire a term-frequency-based taxonomy from a corpus using an unsupervised method. A term-frequency-based taxonomy is useful for application domains where the frequency with which terms occur on their own and in combination with other terms imposes a natural term hierarchy. We highlight an application for our approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and robustness in extracting knowledge from real-world data.</p><br/>

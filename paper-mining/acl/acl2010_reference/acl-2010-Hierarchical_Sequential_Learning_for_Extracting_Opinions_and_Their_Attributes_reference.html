<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-134-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-2050.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yejin Choi ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: Automatic opinion recognition involves a number of related tasks, such as identifying the boundaries of opinion expression, determining their polarity, and determining their intensity. Although much progress has been made in this area, existing research typically treats each of the above tasks in isolation. In this paper, we apply a hierarchical parameter sharing technique using Conditional Random Fields for fine-grained opinion analysis, jointly detecting the boundaries of opinion expressions as well as determining two of their key attributes polarity and intensity. Our experimental results show that our proposed approach improves the performance over a baseline that does not â€” exploit hierarchical structure among the classes. In addition, we find that the joint approach outperforms a baseline that is based on cascading two separate components.</p><br/>

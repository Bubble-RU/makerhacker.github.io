<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-63-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1067.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Shasha Li ; Chin-Yew Lin ; Young-In Song ; Zhoujun Li</p><p>Abstract: Comparing one thing with another is a typical part of human decision making process. However, it is not always easy to know what to compare and what are the alternatives. To address this difficulty, we present a novel way to automatically mine comparable entities from comparative questions that users posted online. To ensure high precision and high recall, we develop a weakly-supervised bootstrapping method for comparative question identification and comparable entity extraction by leveraging a large online question archive. The experimental results show our method achieves F1measure of 82.5% in comparative question identification and 83.3% in comparable entity extraction. Both significantly outperform an existing state-of-the-art method. 1</p><br/>

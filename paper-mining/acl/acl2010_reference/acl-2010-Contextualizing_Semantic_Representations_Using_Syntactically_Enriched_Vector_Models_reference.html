<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-70-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1097.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Stefan Thater ; Hagen Furstenau ; Manfred Pinkal</p><p>Abstract: We present a syntactically enriched vector model that supports the computation of contextualized semantic representations in a quasi compositional fashion. It employs a systematic combination of first- and second-order context vectors. We apply our model to two different tasks and show that (i) it substantially outperforms previous work on a paraphrase ranking task, and (ii) achieves promising results on a wordsense similarity task; to our knowledge, it is the first time that an unsupervised method has been applied to this task.</p><br/>

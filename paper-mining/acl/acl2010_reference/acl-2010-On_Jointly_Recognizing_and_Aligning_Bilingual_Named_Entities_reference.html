<h1>180 acl-2010-On Jointly Recognizing and Aligning Bilingual Named Entities</h1>
<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-180-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1065.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Yufeng Chen ; Chengqing Zong ; Keh-Yih Su</p><p>Abstract: We observe that (1) how a given named entity (NE) is translated (i.e., either semantically or phonetically) depends greatly on its associated entity type, and (2) entities within an aligned pair should share the same type. Also, (3) those initially detected NEs are anchors, whose information should be used to give certainty scores when selecting candidates. From this basis, an integrated model is thus proposed in this paper to jointly identify and align bilingual named entities between Chinese and English. It adopts a new mapping type ratio feature (which is the proportion of NE internal tokens that are semantically translated), enforces an entity type consistency constraint, and utilizes additional monolingual candidate certainty factors (based on those NE anchors). The experi- ments show that this novel approach has substantially raised the type-sensitive F-score of identified NE-pairs from 68.4% to 81.7% (42.1% F-score imperfection reduction) in our Chinese-English NE alignment task.</p><br/>

<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-160-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1150.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: A challenging problem in open information extraction and text mining is the learning of the selectional restrictions of semantic relations. We propose a minimally supervised bootstrapping algorithm that uses a single seed and a recursive lexico-syntactic pattern to learn the arguments and the supertypes of a diverse set of semantic relations from the Web. We evaluate the performance of our algorithm on multiple semantic relations expressed using “verb”, “noun”, and “verb prep” lexico-syntactic patterns. Humanbased evaluation shows that the accuracy of the harvested information is about 90%. We also compare our results with existing knowledge base to outline the similarities and differences of the granularity and diversity of the harvested knowledge.</p><br/>

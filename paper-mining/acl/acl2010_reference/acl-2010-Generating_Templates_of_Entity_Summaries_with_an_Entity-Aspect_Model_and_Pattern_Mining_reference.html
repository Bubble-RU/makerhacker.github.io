<br/><p>Source: <a title="acl-2010-125-pdf" href="http://aclweb.org/anthology//P/P10/P10-1066.pdf">pdf</a></p><p>Author: Peng Li ; Jing Jiang ; Yinglin Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel approach to automatic generation of summary templates from given collections of summary articles. This kind of summary templates can be useful in various applications. We first develop an entity-aspect LDA model to simultaneously cluster both sentences and words into aspects. We then apply frequent subtree pattern mining on the dependency parse trees of the clustered and labeled sentences to discover sentence patterns that well represent the aspects. Key features of our method include automatic grouping of semantically related sentence patterns and automatic identification of template slots that need to be filled in. We apply our method on five Wikipedia entity categories and compare our method with two baseline methods. Both quantitative evaluation based on human judgment and qualitative comparison demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our method.</p><br/>

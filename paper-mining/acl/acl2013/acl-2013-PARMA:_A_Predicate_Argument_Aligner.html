</p><p>2 We suggest that previous efforts have focussed on data that is biased and too easy, and we provide a more difficult dataset based on translation data with a low baseline which we beat by 17% F1. [sent-4, score-0.049]
</p><p>3 1 Introduction  A key step of the information extraction pipeline is entity disambiguation, in which discovered entities across many sentences and documents must be organized to represent real world entities. [sent-5, score-0.143]
</p><p>4 The NLP community has a long history of entity disambiguation both within and across documents. [sent-6, score-0.107]
</p><p>5 Commonly a situational predicate is taken to correspond to either an event or a state, lexically realized in verbs such as “elect” or nominalizations such as “election”. [sent-8, score-0.337]
</p><p>6 Similar to entity coreference resolution, almost all of this work assumes unanchored mentions: predicate argument tuples are grouped together based on coreferent events. [sent-9, score-0.567]
</p><p>7 The first work on event coreference dates back to Bagga and Baldwin (1999). [sent-10, score-0.232]
</p><p>8 As with unanchored entity disambiguation, these methods rely on clustering methods and evaluation metrics. [sent-13, score-0.118]
</p><p>9 Another view ofpredicate disambiguation seeks  to link or align predicate argument tuples to an existing anchored resource containing references to events or actions, similar to anchored entity disambiguation (entity linking) (Dredze et al. [sent-14, score-0.603]
</p><p>10 The most relevant, and perhaps only, work in this area is that of Roth and Frank (2012) who linked predicates across document pairs, measuring the F1 of aligned pairs. [sent-16, score-0.309]
</p><p>11 Here we present PARMA, a new system for predicate argument alignment. [sent-17, score-0.303]
</p><p>12 As opposed to Roth and Frank, PARMA is designed as a a trainable platform for the incorporation of the sort of lexical semantic resources used in the related areas of Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) and Question Answering (QA). [sent-18, score-0.086]
</p><p>13 We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by achieving state of the art performance on the data of Roth and Frank despite having little relevant training data. [sent-19, score-0.039]
</p><p>14 In response, we evaluate on a new and more challenging dataset for  predicate argument alignment derived from multiple translation data. [sent-21, score-0.478]
</p><p>15 We release PARMA as a new framework for the incorporation and evaluation of new resources for predicate argument alignment. [sent-22, score-0.34]
</p><p>16 1 2  PARMA  PARMA (Predicate ARguMent Aligner) is a pipelined system with a wide variety of features used to align predicates and arguments in two documents. [sent-23, score-0.289]
</p><p>17 Predicates are represented as mention spans and arguments are represented as coreference chains (sets of mention spans) provided by in-document coreference resolution systems such as included in the Stanford NLP toolkit. [sent-24, score-0.708]
</p><p>18 Results indicated that the chains are of sufficient quality so as not to limit performance, though future work 1https : / / github . [sent-25, score-0.085]
</p><p>19 Figure 1: Example of gold-standard  alignment pairs from Roth and Frank’s data set and our data set  created from the LDC’s Multiple Translation Corpora. [sent-29, score-0.13]
</p><p>20 where most of the alignments  The RF data set exhibits high lexical overlap,  are between identical words like police-police  and said-said. [sent-30, score-0.087]
</p><p>21 The LDC  MTC was constructed to increase lexical diversity, leading to more challenging alignments like veranda-  balcony and tent-camp may relax this assumption. [sent-31, score-0.183]
</p><p>22 We refer to a predicate or an argument as an “item” with type predicate or argument. [sent-32, score-0.482]
</p><p>23 An alignment between two documents is a subset of all pairs of items in either documents with the same type. [sent-33, score-0.234]
</p><p>24 2 We call the two documents being aligned the source document S and the target document T. [sent-34, score-0.324]
</p><p>25 Items are referred to by their index, and ai,j is a binary variable representing an alignment between item iin S and item j in T. [sent-35, score-0.176]
</p><p>26 A full alignment is an assignment = {aij : i ∈ NS, j ∈ NT}, where NS ganndm NT are th {ea set :o fi i ∈tem N in,djic ∈es Nfor }S, awnhde rTe respectively. [sent-36, score-0.09]
</p><p>27 We train a logistic regression model on example alignmentsand maximize the likelihood of a document alignment under the assumption that the item alignments are independent. [sent-37, score-0.28]
</p><p>28 Our objective is to maximize the log-likelihood of all p(S, T) with an L1 regularizer (with parameter λ). [sent-38, score-0.038]
</p><p>29 After learning model parameters w by regularized max-  a  imum likelihood on training data, we introducing a threshold τ on alignment probabilities to get a classifier. [sent-39, score-0.09]
</p><p>30 We perform line search on τ and choose the value that maximizes F1 on dev data. [sent-40, score-0.041]
</p><p>31 1 Features The focus of PARMA is the integration of a diverse range of features based on existing lexical semantic resources. [sent-43, score-0.049]
</p><p>32 The following features cover the spectrum from high-precision 2Note that type is not the same thing as part of speech: we allow nominal predicates like “death”. [sent-45, score-0.146]
</p><p>33 Each feature has access to the proposed argument or predicate spans to be linked and the containing sentences as context. [sent-47, score-0.374]
</p><p>34 For extra training data, we pool material from different datasets and use the multi-domain split feature space approach to learn dataset specific behaviors (Daum ´e, 2007). [sent-49, score-0.086]
</p><p>35 Features in general are defined over mention spans or head tokens, but we split these features to create separate feature-spaces for predicates and arguments. [sent-50, score-0.3]
</p><p>36 3 For argument coref chains we heuristically choose a canonical mention to represent each chain, and some features only look at this canonical mention. [sent-51, score-0.436]
</p><p>37 The canonical mention is chosen based on length,4 information about the head word,5 and position in the document. [sent-52, score-0.143]
</p><p>38 6 In most cases, coref chains that are longer than one are proper nouns and the canonical mention is the first and longest mention (outranking pronominal references and other name shortenings). [sent-53, score-0.335]
</p><p>39 PPDB We use lexical features from the Paraphrase Database (PPDB) (Ganitkevitch et al. [sent-54, score-0.049]
</p><p>40 We make use of the English lexical portion  which contains over 7 million rules for rewriting terms like “planet” and “earth”. [sent-57, score-0.049]

[sent-59, score-0.202]
</p><p>42 For each of these rule probabilities (experts), we find all rules that match the head tokens of a given alignment and have a feature for the max and harmonic mean of the log probabilities of the resulting rule set. [sent-60, score-0.09]
</p><p>43 FrameNet FrameNet is a lexical database based on Charles Fillmore’s Frame Semantics (Fillmore, 1976; Baker et al. [sent-61, score-0.089]
</p><p>44 The database (and the theory) is organized around semantic frames that can be thought of as descriptions of events. [sent-63, score-0.106]
</p><p>45 The Destroying frame, for instance, includes frame elements De st royer or Cau s e Undergoer. [sent-65, score-0.066]
</p><p>46 Frames are related to other frames through inheritance and perspectivization. [sent-66, score-0.066]
</p><p>47 For instance the frames Commerce buy and Commerce sel l(with respective lexical realizations “buy” and “sell”) are both perspectives of Comme rce goods -t rans fer (no lexical realizations) which inherits from Trans fer (with lexical realization “transfer”). [sent-67, score-0.288]
</p><p>48 We compute a shortest path between headwords given edges (hypernym, hyponym, perspectivized parent and child) in FrameNet and bucket by distance to get features. [sent-68, score-0.069]
</p><p>49 TED Alignments Given two predicates or arguments in two sentences, we attempt to align the two sentences they appear in using a Tree Edit Distance (TED) model that aligns two dependency trees, based on the work described by (Yao et al. [sent-70, score-0.289]
</p><p>50 The TED model aligns one tree with the other using the dynamic programming algorithm ofZhang and Shasha (1989) with three predefined edits: deletion, insertion and substitution, seeking a solution yielding the minimum edit cost. [sent-73, score-0.082]
</p><p>51 Once we have built a tree alignment, we extract features for 1) whether the heads of the two phrases are aligned and 2) the count of how many tokens are aligned in both trees. [sent-74, score-0.108]
</p><p>52 WordNet WordNet (Miller, 1995) is a database of information (synonyms, hypernyms, etc. [sent-75, score-0.04]
</p><p>53 For features, we find the shortest path linking the head words of two mentions using synonym, hypernym, hyponym, meronym, and holonym edges and bucket the length. [sent-80, score-0.108]
</p><p>54 String Transducer To represent similarity be-  tween arguments that are names, we use a stochastic edit distance model. [sent-81, score-0.209]
</p><p>55 This stochastic string-tostring transducer has latent “edit” and “no edit” regions where the latent regions allow the model to assign high probability to contiguous regions of edits (or no edits), which are typical between variations of person names. [sent-82, score-0.268]
</p><p>56 In an edit region, parameters govern the relative probability of insertion, deletion, substitution, and copy operations. [sent-83, score-0.082]
</p><p>57 Since in-domain name pairs were not available, we picked 10,000 entities at random from Wikipedia to estimate the transducer parameters. [sent-86, score-0.142]
</p><p>58 The entity labels were used as weak supervision during EM, as in Andrews et al. [sent-87, score-0.058]
</p><p>59 For a pair of mention spans, we compute the conditional log-likelihood of the two mentions going both ways, take the max, and then bucket to get binary features. [sent-89, score-0.191]
</p><p>60 We duplicate these features with copies that only fire if both mentions are tagged as PER, ORG or LOC. [sent-90, score-0.039]
</p><p>61 Extended Event Coreference Bank Based on the dataset of Bejan and Harabagiu (2010), Lee et al. [sent-94, score-0.049]
</p><p>62 (2012) introduced the Extended Event Coreference Bank (EECB) to evaluate cross-document event coreference. [sent-95, score-0.086]
</p><p>63 EECB provides document clusters, within which entities and events may corefer. [sent-96, score-0.142]
</p><p>64 To produce source and target document pairs, we select the first document within every cluster as the source and each of the remaining documents as target documents (i. [sent-99, score-0.322]
</p><p>65 Roth and Frank The only existing dataset for our task is from Roth and Frank (2012) (RF), who −  7https : / / github . [sent-103, score-0.085]
</p><p>66 com/ 65  cnap  / anno-pipe  ine  l  annotated documents from the English Gigaword Fifth Edition corpus (Parker et al. [sent-104, score-0.052]
</p><p>67 The data was generated by clustering similar news stories from Gigaword using TF-IDF cosine similarity of their headlines. [sent-106, score-0.071]
</p><p>68 This corpus is small, containing only 10 document pairs in the development set and 60 in the test set. [sent-107, score-0.149]
</p><p>69 To increase the training size, we train PARMA with 150 randomly selected document pairs from both EECB and MTC, and the entire dev set from Roth and Frank using multidomain feature splitting. [sent-108, score-0.19]
</p><p>70 We tuned the threshold τ on the Roth and Frank dev set, but choose the regularizer λ based on a grid search on a 5-fold version of the EECB dataset. [sent-109, score-0.079]
</p><p>71 Multiple Translation Corpora We constructed a new predicate argument alignment dataset based on the LDC Multiple Translation Corpora (MTC),8 which consist of multiple English translations for foreign news articles. [sent-110, score-0.475]
</p><p>72 Since these multiple translations are semantically equivalent, they provide a good resource for aligned predicate argument pairs. [sent-111, score-0.39]
</p><p>73 However, finding good pairs is a  challenge: we want pairs with significant overlap so that they have predicates and arguments that align, but not documents that are trivial rewrites of each other. [sent-112, score-0.485]
</p><p>74 Roth and Frank selected document pairs based on clustering, meaning that the pairs had high lexical overlap, often resulting in minimal rewrites of each other. [sent-113, score-0.281]
</p><p>75 To create a more challenging dataset, we selected document pairs from the multiple translations that minimize the lexical overlap (in English). [sent-115, score-0.34]
</p><p>76 Because these are translations, we know that there are equivalent predicates and arguments in each pair, and that any lexical variation preserves meaning. [sent-116, score-0.286]
</p><p>77 Therefore, we can select pairs with minimal lexical overlap in order to create a system that truly stresses lexically-based alignment systems. [sent-117, score-0.252]
</p><p>78 Each document pair has a correspondence between sentences, and we run GIZA++ on these sentences to produce token-level alignments. [sent-118, score-0.109]
</p><p>79 We take all aligned nouns as arguments and all aligned  verbs (excluding be-verbs, light verbs, and reporting verbs) as predicates. [sent-119, score-0.234]
</p><p>80 Red squares show the  F1 for individual document pairs drawn from Roth and Frank’s data set, and black circles show F1 for our Multiple Translation Corpora test set. [sent-121, score-0.149]
</p><p>81 The xaxis represents the cosine similarity between the document pairs. [sent-122, score-0.18]
</p><p>82 On the RF data set, performance is correlated with lexical similarity. [sent-123, score-0.082]
</p><p>83 This could be due to the fact that some of the documents in the RF sets are minor re-writes of the same newswire story, making them easy to align. [sent-125, score-0.052]
</p><p>84 The amount of substitutions we perform can vary the “relatedness” of the two documents in terms of the predicates and arguments that they talk about. [sent-127, score-0.289]
</p><p>85 This reflects our expectation of real world data, where we do not expect perfect overlap in predicates and arguments between a source and target document, as you would in translation data. [sent-128, score-0.31]
</p><p>86 Lastly, we prune any document pairs that have more than 80 predicates or arguments or have a Jaccard index on bags of lemmas greater than 0. [sent-129, score-0.386]
</p><p>87 Given an alignment to be scored A and a reference alignment B which contains SURE and POSSIBLE links, Bs and Bp respectively, precision and recall are:  P =|A| ∩A| Bp|  R =|A| ∩Bs B|s|  (1)  66  TableERM1FT:CBPARl MPeAmoRAtm hM oa AundtpFerafkom7645Fs3287149t. [sent-134, score-0.18]
</p><p>88 Lemma baseline Following Roth and Frank we include a lemma baseline, in which two predicates or arguments align if they have the same lemma. [sent-141, score-0.366]
</p><p>89 9 4  Results  On every dataset PARMA significantly improves over the lemma baselines (Table 1). [sent-142, score-0.126]
</p><p>90 On RF, compared to Roth and Frank, the best published method for this task, we also improve, making PARMA the state of the art system for this task. [sent-143, score-0.039]
</p><p>91 We also observe that MTC was more challenging than the other datasets, with a lower lemma baseline. [sent-146, score-0.113]
</p><p>92 Figure 2 shows the correlation between document similarity and document F1 score for RF and MTC. [sent-147, score-0.254]
</p><p>93 Additionally, there is more data in the MTC dataset which has low cosine similarity than in RF. [sent-149, score-0.12]
</p><p>94 5  Conclusion  PARMA achieves state of the art performance on three datasets for predicate argument alignment. [sent-150, score-0.379]
</p><p>95 It builds on the development of lexical semantic resources and provides a platform for learning to utilize these resources. [sent-151, score-0.049]
</p><p>96 Additionally, we show that 9We could not reproduce lemma from Roth and Frank (shown in Table 1) due to a difference in lemmatizers. [sent-152, score-0.077]
</p><p>97 task difficulty can be strongly tied to lexical similarity if the evaluation dataset is not chosen carefully, and this provides an artificially high baseline  in previous work. [sent-155, score-0.134]
</p><p>98 PARMA is robust to drops in lexical similarity and shows large improvements in those cases. [sent-156, score-0.085]

The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate.

In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.</p><p>5 0.15428641 <a title="267-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Lightweight_and_High_Performance_Monolingual_Word_Aligner.html">9 acl-2013-A Lightweight and High Performance Monolingual Word Aligner</a></p>

But in the setting of monolingual alignment, previous work has not been able to align more than one sentence pair per second. We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>6 0.14116241 <a title="267-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Specific_Coreference_Resolution_with_Lexicalized_Features.html">130 acl-2013-Domain-Specific Coreference Resolution with Lexicalized Features</a></p>

The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate. The algorithm solves the implicit arguments sequentially, exploiting not only explicit but also the implicit arguments previously solved. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.</p><p>3 0.66132617 <a title="267-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-SPred%3A_Large-scale_Harvesting_of_Semantic_Predicates.html">306 acl-2013-SPred: Large-scale Harvesting of Semantic Predicates</a></p>

Based on the measure of preferences between predicates and arguments, the model aggregates all the transitions from a given predicate to its nearby predicates, and propagates their argument preferences as the given predicate’s smoothed preferences. Experimental results show that this approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods on the pseudo-disambiguation task, and it better correlates with human plausibility judgements.</p><p>5 0.57090515 <a title="267-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Multigraph_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_Coreference_Resolution.html">252 acl-2013-Multigraph Clustering for Unsupervised Coreference Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria Yancheva ; Frank Rudzicz</p><p>Abstract: It is important that the testimony of children be admissible in court, especially given allegations of abuse. Unfortunately, children can be misled by interrogators or might offer false information, with dire consequences. In this work, we evaluate various parameterizations of five classifiers (including support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests) in deciphering truth from lies given transcripts of interviews with 198 victims of abuse between the ages of 4 and 7. These evaluations are performed using a novel set of syntactic features, including measures of complexity. Our results show that sentence length, the mean number of clauses per utterance, and the StajnerMitkov measure of complexity are highly informative syntactic features, that classification accuracy varies greatly by the age of the speaker, and that accuracy up to 91.7% can be achieved by support vector machines given a sufficient amount of data.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83239675 <a title="267-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-PARMA%3A_A_Predicate_Argument_Aligner.html">267 acl-2013-PARMA: A Predicate Argument Aligner</a></p>

<p>Author: Peter A. Rankel ; John M. Conroy ; Hoa Trang Dang ; Ani Nenkova</p><p>Abstract: How good are automatic content metrics for news summary evaluation? Here we provide a detailed answer to this question, with a particular focus on assessing the ability of automatic evaluations to identify statistically significant differences present in manual evaluation of content. Using four years of data from the Text Analysis Conference, we analyze the performance of eight ROUGE variants in terms of accuracy, precision and recall in finding significantly different systems. Our experiments show that some of the neglected variants of ROUGE, based on higher order n-grams and syntactic dependencies, are most accurate across the years; the commonly used ROUGE-1 scores find too many significant differences between systems which manual evaluation would deem comparable. We also test combinations ofROUGE variants and find that they considerably improve the accuracy of automatic prediction.</p><p>4 0.71149921 <a title="267-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Projections_between_Languages_from_Different_Families.html">97 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Projections between Languages from Different Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Mo Yu ; Tiejun Zhao ; Yalong Bai ; Hao Tian ; Dianhai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual projection methods can benefit from resource-rich languages to improve performances of NLP tasks in resources-scarce languages. However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>5 0.71099329 <a title="267-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Improving_pairwise_coreference_models_through_feature_space_hierarchy_learning.html">196 acl-2013-Improving pairwise coreference models through feature space hierarchy learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Emmanuel Lassalle ; Pascal Denis</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for significantly improving the performance of pairwise coreference models. Given a set of indicators, our method learns how to best separate types of mention pairs into equivalence classes for which we construct distinct classification models. In effect, our approach finds an optimal feature space (derived from a base feature set and indicator set) for discriminating coreferential mention pairs. Although our approach explores a very large space of possible feature spaces, it remains tractable by exploiting the structure of the hierarchies built from the indicators. Our exper- iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English datasets (gold mentions) indicate that our method is robust relative to different clustering strategies and evaluation metrics, showing large and consistent improvements over a single pairwise model using the same base features. Our best system obtains a competitive 67.2 of average F1 over MUC, and CEAF which, despite its simplicity, places it above the mean score of other systems on these datasets.

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>3 0.19307512 <a title="141-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Adapting_Discriminative_Reranking_to_Grounded_Language_Learning.html">36 acl-2013-Adapting Discriminative Reranking to Grounded Language Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Joohyun Kim ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: We adapt discriminative reranking to improve the performance of grounded language acquisition, specifically the task of learning to follow navigation instructions from observation. Unlike conventional reranking used in syntactic and semantic parsing, gold-standard reference trees are not naturally available in a grounded setting. Instead, we show how the weak supervision of response feedback (e.g. successful task completion) can be used as an alternative, experimentally demonstrating that its performance is comparable to training on gold-standard parse trees.</p><p>4 0.16379419 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_state_tracking_for_spoken_dialog_systems.html">124 acl-2013-Discriminative state tracking for spoken dialog systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Metallinou ; Dan Bohus ; Jason Williams</p><p>Abstract: In spoken dialog systems, statistical state tracking aims to improve robustness to speech recognition errors by tracking a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states. Current approaches based on generative or discriminative models have different but important shortcomings that limit their accuracy. In this paper we discuss these limitations and introduce a new approach for discriminative state tracking that overcomes them by leveraging the problem structure. An offline evaluation with dialog data collected from real users shows improvements in both state tracking accuracy and the quality of the posterior probabilities. Features that encode speech recognition error patterns are particularly helpful, and training requires rel- atively few dialogs.</p><p>5 0.15129086 <a title="141-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>6 0.1390055 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Recommendation_Dialogs_by_Extracting_Information_from_User_Reviews.html">168 acl-2013-Generating Recommendation Dialogs by Extracting Information from User Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Mo Yu ; Tiejun Zhao ; Yalong Bai ; Hao Tian ; Dianhai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual projection methods can benefit from resource-rich languages to improve performances of NLP tasks in resources-scarce languages. However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>3 0.63505775 <a title="141-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>

However, most of the currently Chinese NLP tools or components still have a wide range of issues need to be further improved and developed. FudanNLP is an open source toolkit for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) , which uses statistics-based and rule-based methods to deal with Chinese NLP tasks, such as word segmentation, part-ofspeech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, time phrase recognition, anaphora resolution and so on.</p><p>4 0.63415504 <a title="141-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts.html">363 acl-2013-Two-Neighbor Orientation Model with Cross-Boundary Global Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>5 0.63309014 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_with_Compositional_Vector_Grammars.html">275 acl-2013-Parsing with Compositional Vector Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; John Bauer ; Christopher D. Manning ; Ng Andrew Y.</p><p>Abstract: Natural language parsing has typically been done with small sets of discrete categories such as NP and VP, but this representation does not capture the full syntactic nor semantic richness of linguistic phrases, and attempts to improve on this by lexicalizing phrases or splitting categories only partly address the problem at the cost of huge feature spaces and sparseness. Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%. It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser. The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments.</p><p>6 0.63295007 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Approach_to_Fill-in-the-Blank_Quiz_Generation_for_Language_Learners.html">122 acl-2013-Discriminative Approach to Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generation for Language Learners</a></p>

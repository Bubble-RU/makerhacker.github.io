</p><p>3 We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to  be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. [sent-5, score-0.992]

</p><p>5 1 Introduction We present a mobile dialogue system (an Android app) called Spacebook that addresses the problem of pedestrian navigation and tourist information in urban environments. [sent-7, score-1.533]
</p><p>6 There has been little prior work that addresses these two problems - navigation and tourist information provision - in an integrated way. [sent-8, score-0.847]
</p><p>7 By navigation, we refer to the problem of finding appropriate destinations to go to and the task of wayfinding to reach them and by tourist information provision we refer to the problem of meeting the informational needs of a user about entities such as museums, statues and famous personalities. [sent-9, score-0.504]
</p><p>8 A dialogue system such as this could serve as a personal tour guide to pedestrian tourists as they walk around unknown cities. [sent-10, score-0.469]
</p><p>9 With the proliferation of smartphones, there has been a  number of mobile apps developed to address these problems. [sent-11, score-0.32]
</p><p>10 However these apps have the following problems: first, they demand the user’s visual attention because they predominantly present information on a mobile screen. [sent-12, score-0.32]
</p><p>11 Second, these apps address the problems of navigation and tourist information independently and therefore do not have a shared interaction context. [sent-14, score-1.05]
</p><p>12 This means that users cannot switch between information and navigation tasks in a natural and fluid manner. [sent-15, score-0.763]
</p><p>13 Table 1: An example interaction with the evaluated system In contrast to many existing mobile apps, Spacebook has a speech-only interface and addresses both problems in an integrated way. [sent-16, score-0.359]
</p><p>14 We conjecture that with a speech-only interface, users can immerse themselves in exploring the city, and that because of the shared context they can switch between navigation and tourist information  tasks more easily. [sent-17, score-1.082]
</p><p>15 Using the navigational context, Spacebook pushes point-of-interest information which can then initiate tourist information tasks using the QA module. [sent-18, score-0.429]

</p><p>17 Utterances System4-8 show the system’s capability to push information about nearby pointsof-interest (PoI) during a navigation task and answer followup questions using the QA system (in utterances User2 and User3). [sent-22, score-0.754]
</p><p>18 The final 3 utterances show a natural switch between navigation to an entity and QA about that entity. [sent-23, score-0.596]
</p><p>19 We investigate whether our system using a combination ofgeographical information system (GIS) and natural language processing (NLP) technologies would be a better companion to pedestrian city explorers than the current state-of-the-art mobile apps. [sent-24, score-0.584]
</p><p>20 address the problem of navigation while apps like Triposo, Guidepal, Wikihood, etc. [sent-30, score-0.683]
</p><p>21 address the problem of tourist information by presenting the user with descriptive information about various points of interest (PoI) in the city. [sent-31, score-0.448]
</p><p>22 While some exploratory apps present snippets of information about a precompiled list of PoIs, other apps dynamically generate a list of PoIs arranged based on their proximity to the users. [sent-32, score-0.326]
</p><p>23 Also, since these navigation and ex-  ploratory/search apps do not address both problems in an integrated way, users need to switch between them and therefore lose interaction context. [sent-34, score-0.978]
</p><p>24 While most apps address these two problems independently, some like Google Now, Google Field Trip, etc, mix navigation with exploration. [sent-35, score-0.683]

</p><p>32 Users communicate with the system using a smartphone-based client app (an Android app) that sends users’ position, pace rate, and spoken utterances to the system, and delivers synthesised system utterances to the user. [sent-56, score-0.431]
</p><p>33 1 Dialogue interface The dialogue interface consists of a speech recognition module, an utterance parser, an interaction manager, an utterance generator and a speech syn-  thesizer. [sent-58, score-0.513]
</p><p>34 The recognised speech is currently parsed using a rule-based parser into dialogue acts and semantic content. [sent-60, score-0.24]
</p><p>35 It receives the user’s input in the form of a dialogue act (DA), the user’s location (latitude and longitude) and pace rate. [sent-62, score-0.281]

</p><p>42 In addition to navigation instructions, the IM also answers users’ questions concerning the route, his/her location, and location of and distance to the various entities. [sent-85, score-0.655]
</p><p>43 Finally, the IM uses the city model’s Visibility Engine (VE) to determine whether the destination is visible to the user (see section 3. [sent-86, score-0.312]

</p><p>52 The model also includes a pedestrian network (streets, pavements, tracks, steps, open spaces) which is used by an embedded route planner to calculate minimal cost routes, such as the shortest path. [sent-110, score-0.323]
</p><p>53 5 Mobile client The mobile client app, installed on an Android smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S3), connects the user to the dialogue system using a 3G data connection. [sent-142, score-0.715]
</p><p>54 The client senses the user’s location using positioning technology using GNSS satellites (GPS and GLONASS) which is sent to the dialogue system at the rate of one update every two seconds. [sent-143, score-0.381]
</p><p>55 In parallel, the client also places a phone call using which the user communicates with the dialogue system. [sent-145, score-0.412]
</p><p>56 4  Baseline system  The baseline system chosen for evaluation was  Samsung S-Voice, a state-of-the-art commercial smartphone speech interface. [sent-146, score-0.22]
</p><p>57 S-Voice is a Samsung Android mobile phone app that allows a user to use the functionalities of device using a speech interface. [sent-147, score-0.499]
</p><p>58 It launches the Google Navigation app when users request directions and it activates Google Search for open ended touristic information questions. [sent-149, score-0.408]
</p><p>59 The Navigation app is capable of providing instructions in-situ using speech. [sent-150, score-0.265]
</p><p>60 We used the SVoice system for comparison because it provided an integrated state-of-the-art interface to use both a navigation app and also an information-seeking app using the same speech interface. [sent-151, score-0.997]
</p><p>61 Users were encouraged to use these apps using speech but were allowed to use the GUI interface when using speech wasn’t working (e. [sent-152, score-0.302]

</p><p>63 However, our system interacted with the user using the speech modality only. [sent-158, score-0.225]
</p><p>64 5h9e%y wofe rtehe m users were regular smartphone users and their mean overall time spent in the city was 76 months. [sent-163, score-0.537]
</p><p>65 These tasks included both navigation and tourist information tasks (see table 3). [sent-167, score-0.877]
</p><p>66 Our system performed better in  Figure 2: Task route tourist information tasks (4, 7) (see table 4). [sent-185, score-0.488]
</p><p>67 9152A61095 216458  Table 4: % Perceived Task success - task wise comparison (N - navigation task, TI - Tourist Information task) The system questionnaires that were filled out by users after each leg were analysed. [sent-189, score-0.853]
</p><p>68 Results show that although our system is not performing significantly better than the baseline system (SQ1-SQ10 except SQ7), users seem to find it more understanding (SQ7) and more interesting to interact with (SQ1 1) than the baseline. [sent-193, score-0.291]
</p><p>69 We found that the young subjects (age group 20-26), also felt that 1664  Table 3: Tasks for the user  they learned something new about the city using it (SQ12) (p < 0. [sent-195, score-0.374]
</p><p>70 We also found statistically significant differences in smartphone users rating for our system on their learning compared to the baseline (SQ12). [sent-197, score-0.307]
</p><p>71 Subjects were also asked to choose between the two systems given a number of requirements such as ease of use, use for navigation, tourist information, etc. [sent-198, score-0.289]
</p><p>72 Significant differences were found in users’ choice of system for navigation and tourist information requirements. [sent-206, score-0.864]
</p><p>73 Users preferred the baseline system for navigation (CQ2) and our system for touristic information (CQ3) on the city. [sent-207, score-0.715]
</p><p>74 Although the perceived task success shows that our system was able to get the users to their destination and there was no significant difference between the two systems based on their questionnaire response on navigation, they pointed out a number of issues and suggested a number of modifications. [sent-212, score-0.389]
</p><p>75 Many  Figure 3: Responses to comparative questions users noted that a visual map and the directional arrow in the baseline system was helpful for navigation. [sent-213, score-0.295]
</p><p>76 In addition, they noted that our system’s navigation instructions were sometimes not satisfactory. [sent-214, score-0.643]
</p><p>77 They observed that there weren’t enough instructions coming from the system at street junctions. [sent-215, score-0.219]
</p><p>78 Some users also wanted a route summary before the navigation instructions are given. [sent-218, score-0.934]
</p><p>79 The problem with Spacebook’s navigation policy was that it did not, for example, direct the user via easily visible landmarks (e. [sent-219, score-0.794]
</p><p>80 Some users also suggested that our system should have a map and that routes taken should be plotted on them for reference. [sent-227, score-0.271]
</p><p>81 Based on the ratings and observations made by the users, we conclude that our first hypothesis that Spacebook would be more efficient for navigation than the baseline because of its speech-only interface was inconclusive. [sent-228, score-0.615]
</p><p>82 We believe so because users’ poor ratings for Spacebook may be due to the current choice of dialogue policy for navigation. [sent-229, score-0.235]
</p><p>83 It may be possible to reassure the user with a better dialogue policy with just the speech interface. [sent-230, score-0.399]
</p><p>84 They also found that asking questions and finding answers was much easier with Spacebook compared to the baseline system, where sometimes users needed to type search keywords in. [sent-235, score-0.269]
</p><p>85 Some users felt that the system might lose context of the navigation task if presented with a PoI question. [sent-239, score-0.797]
</p><p>86 Evaluators who followed the subjects noted that the subjects felt difficulty using the baseline system as they sometimes struggled to see the screen  ±  1666  d5b43162i. [sent-255, score-0.292]

</p><p>90 Many studies have shown  that visible landmarks provide better cues for navigation than street names (Ashweeni and Steed, 2006; Hiley et al. [sent-278, score-0.704]

</p><p>92 9  Conclusion  We presented a mobile dialogue app called Spacebook to support pedestrian users in navigation and tourist information gathering in urban environments. [sent-283, score-1.801]
</p><p>93 The system is a speech-only interface and addresses navigation and tourist information  in an integrated way, using a shared dialogue context. [sent-284, score-1.194]
</p><p>94 For example, using the navigational context, Spacebook can push point-of-interest information which can then initiate touristic exploration tasks using the QA module. [sent-285, score-0.296]
</p><p>95 We evaluated the system against a state-of-theart baseline (Samsung S-Voice with Google Navigation and Search) with a group of 17 users in the streets of Edinburgh. [sent-286, score-0.279]
</p><p>96 We found that users found Spacebook interesting to interact with, and that it was their system of choice for touristic information exploration tasks. [sent-287, score-0.35]
</p><p>97 Based on observations and user ratings, we conclude that our speech-only system was less preferred for navigation and more preferred for tourist information tasks due to features such as PoI pushing and the integrated QA module, when compared to the baseline system.

<p>Author: Joohyun Kim ; Raymond Mooney</p><p>Abstract: We adapt discriminative reranking to improve the performance of grounded language acquisition, specifically the task of learning to follow navigation instructions from observation. Unlike conventional reranking used in syntactic and semantic parsing, gold-standard reference trees are not naturally available in a grounded setting. Instead, we show how the weak supervision of response feedback (e.g. successful task completion) can be used as an alternative, experimentally demonstrating that its performance is comparable to training on gold-standard parse trees.</p><p>3 0.13175569 <a title="141-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>4 0.095613658 <a title="141-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique.

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>6 0.081580505 <a title="141-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Minimum_Bayes_Risk_based_Answer_Re-ranking_for_Question_Answering.html">241 acl-2013-Minimum Bayes Risk based Answer Re-ranking for Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Srinivasan Janarthanam ; Oliver Lemon ; Phil Bartie ; Tiphaine Dalmas ; Anna Dickinson ; Xingkun Liu ; William Mackaness ; Bonnie Webber</p><p>Abstract: We present a city navigation and tourist information mobile dialogue app with integrated question-answering (QA) and geographic information system (GIS) modules that helps pedestrian users to navigate in and learn about urban environments. In contrast to existing mobile apps which treat these problems independently, our Android app addresses the problem of navigation and touristic questionanswering in an integrated fashion using a shared dialogue context. We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from. They also rated our system above Google search (with the Samsung S-Voice interface) for tourist information tasks.</p><p>2 0.70965511 <a title="141-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Meet_EDGAR%2C_a_tutoring_agent_at_MONSERRATE.html">239 acl-2013-Meet EDGAR, a tutoring agent at MONSERRATE</a></p>
<p>Author: Pedro Fialho ; Luisa Coheur ; Sergio Curto ; Pedro Claudio ; Angela Costa ; Alberto Abad ; Hugo Meinedo ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a platform for embodied conversational agents with tutoring goals, which takes as input written and spoken questions and outputs answers in both forms. The platform is developed within a game environment, and currently allows speech recognition and synthesis in Portuguese, English and Spanish. In this paper we focus on its understanding component that supports in-domain interactions, and also small talk. Most indomain interactions are answered using different similarity metrics, which compare the perceived utterances with questions/sentences in the agent’s knowledge base; small-talk capabilities are mainly due to AIML, a language largely used by the chatbots’ community. In this paper we also introduce EDGAR, the butler of MONSERRATE, which was developed in the aforementioned platform, and that answers tourists’ questions about MONSERRATE.</p><p>3 0.6750952 <a title="141-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>4 0.64100099 <a title="141-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-PAL%3A_A_Chatterbot_System_for_Answering_Domain-specific_Questions.html">266 acl-2013-PAL: A Chatterbot System for Answering Domain-specific Questions</a></p>

This system focuses on providing primary suggestions or helping people relieve pressure by extracting knowledge from online forums, based on which the chatterbot system is constructed. The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed. We also conduct a primary test for the feasibility of our system.</p><p>5 0.57831895 <a title="141-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>6 0.56172824 <a title="141-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Lightly_Supervised_Learning_of_Procedural_Dialog_Systems.html">230 acl-2013-Lightly Supervised Learning of Procedural Dialog Systems</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Efficiently incorporating entity-level information is a challenge for coreference resolution systems due to the difficulty of exact inference over partitions. We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propagation. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.90860885 <a title="141-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Evaluating_a_City_Exploration_Dialogue_System_with_Integrated_Question-Answering_and_Pedestrian_Navigation.html">141 acl-2013-Evaluating a City Exploration Dialogue System with Integrated Question-Answering and Pedestrian Navigation</a></p>

<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker</p><p>Abstract: Mother tongue interference is the phenomenon where linguistic systems of a mother tongue are transferred to another language. Although there has been plenty of work on mother tongue interference, very little is known about how strongly it is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues. To address these questions, this paper explores and visualizes mother tongue interference preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers. This paper further explores linguistic features that explain why certain relations are preserved in English writing, and which contribute to related tasks such as native language identification.</p><p>5 0.76764131 <a title="141-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>6 0.74660373 <a title="141-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Aggregated_Word_Pair_Features_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Disambiguation.html">41 acl-2013-Aggregated Word Pair Features for Implicit Discourse Relation Disambiguation</a></p>

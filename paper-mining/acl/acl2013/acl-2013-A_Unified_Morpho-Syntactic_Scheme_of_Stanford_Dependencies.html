<p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><p>4 0.12630238 <a title="28-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Transition-based_Dependency_Parsing_with_Selectional_Branching.html">358 acl-2013-Transition-based Dependency Parsing with Selectional Branching</a></p>
<p>Author: Jinho D. Choi ; Andrew McCallum</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach, called selectional branching, which uses confidence estimates to decide when to employ a beam, providing the accuracy of beam search at speeds close to a greedy transition-based dependency parsing approach. Selectional branching is guaranteed to perform a fewer number of transitions than beam search yet performs as accurately. We also present a new transition-based dependency parsing algorithm that gives a complexity of O(n) for projective parsing and an expected linear time speed for non-projective parsing. With the standard setup, our parser shows an unlabeled attachment score of 92.96% and a parsing speed of 9 milliseconds per sentence, which is faster and more accurate than the current state-of-the-art transitionbased parser that uses beam search.</p><p>5 0.12027109 <a title="28-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Robust_multilingual_statistical_morphological_generation_models.html">303 acl-2013-Robust multilingual statistical morphological generation models</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Popel ; David Marecek ; Jan StÄłpanek ; Daniel Zeman ; ZdÄłnÄłk Zabokrtsky</p><p>Abstract: Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.</p><p>3 0.69421011 <a title="28-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_lemmatise_Polish_noun_phrases.html">227 acl-2013-Learning to lemmatise Polish noun phrases</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Radziszewski</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel approach to noun phrase lemmatisation where the main phase is cast as a tagging problem. The idea draws on the observation that the lemmatisation of almost all Polish noun phrases may be decomposed into transformation of singular words (tokens) that make up each phrase. We perform evaluation, which shows results similar to those obtained earlier by a rule-based system, while our approach allows to separate chunking from lemmatisation.</p><p>4 0.693178 <a title="28-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Robust_multilingual_statistical_morphological_generation_models.html">303 acl-2013-Robust multilingual statistical morphological generation models</a></p>

<p>Author: Vidhya Govindaraju ; Ce Zhang ; Christopher Re</p><p>Abstract: Tabular information in text documents contains a wealth of information, and so tables are a natural candidate for information extraction. There are many cues buried in both a table and its surrounding text that allow us to understand the meaning of the data in a table. We study how natural-language tools, such as part-of-speech tagging, dependency paths, and named-entity recognition, can be used to improve the quality of relation extraction from tables. In three domains we show that (1) a model that performs joint probabilistic inference across tabular and natural language features achieves an F1 score that is twice as high as either a puretable or pure-text system, and (2) using only shallower features or non-joint inference results in lower quality.</p><p>4 0.65951645 <a title="28-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Sentiment_Words_Using_an_Optimization-based_Model_without_Seed_Words.html">188 acl-2013-Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Hongliang Yu ; Zhi-Hong Deng ; Shiyingxue Li</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Word Identification (SWI) is a basic technique in many sentiment analysis applications. Most existing researches exploit seed words, and lead to low robustness. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization-based model for SWI. Unlike previous approaches, our model exploits the sentiment labels of documents instead of seed words. Several experiments on real datasets show that WEED is effective and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with seed words.</p><p>5 0.62596804 <a title="28-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Adaptive_Parser-Centric_Text_Normalization.html">37 acl-2013-Adaptive Parser-Centric Text Normalization</a></p>
<p>Author: Congle Zhang ; Tyler Baldwin ; Howard Ho ; Benny Kimelfeld ; Yunyao Li</p><p>Abstract: Text normalization is an important first step towards enabling many Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks over informal text. While many of these tasks, such as parsing, perform the best over fully grammatically correct text, most existing text normalization approaches narrowly define the task in the word-to-word sense; that is, the task is seen as that of mapping all out-of-vocabulary non-standard words to their in-vocabulary standard forms. In this paper, we take a parser-centric view of normalization that aims to convert raw informal text into grammatically correct text. To understand the real effect of normalization on the parser, we tie normal- ization performance directly to parser performance. Additionally, we design a customizable framework to address the often overlooked concept of domain adaptability, and illustrate that the system allows for transfer to new domains with a minimal amount of data and effort. Our experimental study over datasets from three domains demonstrates that our approach outperforms not only the state-of-the-art wordto-word normalization techniques, but also manual word-to-word annotations.</p><p>6 0.60215926 <a title="28-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>

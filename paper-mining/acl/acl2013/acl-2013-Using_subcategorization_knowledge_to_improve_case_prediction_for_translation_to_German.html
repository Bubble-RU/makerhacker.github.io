</p><p>2 uni -stutt  gart  Abstract This paper demonstrates the need and impact of subcategorization information for SMT. [sent-2, score-0.329]
</p><p>3 We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. [sent-3, score-0.71]
</p><p>4 A manual evaluation of an English-toGerman translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of case. [sent-4, score-0.681]
</p><p>5 In the second step, the stemmed output of the translation is then inflected: the morphological features are predicted, and the inflected forms are generated using the stem and predicted morphological features. [sent-9, score-0.978]
</p><p>6 de can be derived from the source-side input, respectively, the prediction of case requires information about the subcategorization of the entire clause. [sent-12, score-0.528]
</p><p>7 This is due to German being a less configurational language than English, which encodes grammatical relations (e. [sent-13, score-0.048]
</p><p>8 German sentences exhibit a freer constituent order, and thus case is an important indicator of the grammatical functions of noun phrases. [sent-17, score-0.238]
</p><p>9 Correct case prediction is a crucial factor for the adequacy of SMT output, cf. [sent-18, score-0.199]
</p><p>10 the example in table 1 providing an erroneously inflected output (this is taken from a baseline “simple inflection prediction” system, cf. [sent-19, score-0.411]
</p><p>11 The translation of the English input sentence in terms of stems is perfectly acceptable; after the inflection step, however, the translation of NP4 ongoing military actions represents a genitive modifier of the subject NP2, instead of a direct object NP of the verb anordnen (to order). [sent-22, score-0.887]
</p><p>12 The  meaning is thus why the government of the ongoing military actions ordered, which has only one NP and is completely wrong. [sent-23, score-0.097]
</p><p>13 This is demonstrated by the invented examples (1) and (2): (1) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [den Bericht]NPacc [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben. [sent-25, score-0.132]
</p><p>14 [The employee]NPnom gave [his colleague]NPdat [the report]NPacc (2) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [dem Bericht]NPdat [des Kollegen]NPgen zugestimmt. [sent-26, score-0.107]
</p><p>15 [The employee]NPnom agreed [on the report]PP [of his colleague]PP Both inflected sentences rely on the stem sequence [d Mitarbeiter] [d Bericht] [d Kollege] hverbi,  ltfduaicrIetonlsi nght. [sent-27, score-0.296]
</p><p>16 native case), a benefactive (dative case) and a patient (accusative case), zustimmen (to agree) has  a strong preference for only selecting an agentive subject (nominative case) and an indirect object theme (dative case). [sent-32, score-0.195]
</p><p>17 So in the latter case the NP [d Kollege] cannot receive case from the verb and is instead the genitive modifier of the dative NP. [sent-33, score-0.443]
</p><p>18 While for examples (1) and (2) knowledge about the syntactic verb subcategorization functions is sufficient to correctly predict the NP cases, examples (3) to (6) require subcategorization information at the syntax-semantic interface. [sent-34, score-0.839]
</p><p>19 (3) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [dem Kollegen]NPdat [den Bericht]NPacc gegeben. [sent-35, score-0.107]
</p><p>20 (4) [Der Mitarbeiter]NPnom hat [den Bericht]NPacc [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben. [sent-36, score-0.107]
</p><p>21 (5) [Dem Kollegen]NPdat hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [den Bericht]NPacc gegeben. [sent-37, score-0.107]
</p><p>22 (6) [Den Bericht]NPacc hat [der Mitarbeiter]NPnom [dem Kollegen]NPdat gegeben. [sent-38, score-0.107]
</p><p>23 In all four examples, the verb and the participating noun phrases Mitarbeiter (employee), Kollege (colleague) and Bericht (report) are identical, and the noun phrases are assigned the same case. [sent-39, score-0.379]
</p><p>24 For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege would satisfy the agentive subject role of the verb geben better than Bericht, and Bericht is more likely to be the patient of geben. [sent-41, score-0.362]
</p><p>25 This subcategorization model is necessary when there are several plausible solutions for the syntactic functions of a noun in combina-  tion with a verb. [sent-43, score-0.548]
</p><p>26 For example, both Mitarbeiter and Kollege are plausible subjects and direct objects of the verb geben, so the information about these nouns’ roles in the input sentence allows for disambiguation. [sent-44, score-0.215]
</p><p>27 (ii) The case of an NP is derived from an external knowledge base comprising quantitative, dependency-based information about German verb subcategorization frames and noun modification. [sent-45, score-0.603]
</p><p>28 The verb subcategorization information is not restricted to syntactic noun functions but models association strength for verb– noun pairs with regard to the entire subcategorization frame plus the syntactic functions of the nouns. [sent-46, score-1.155]
</p><p>29 For example, the database can tell us that while the verb geben is very likely to subcategorize a ditransitive frame, the verb zustimmen is very likely to subcategorize only a direct object, next to the obligatory subject (subcat frame prediction). [sent-47, score-0.618]
</p><p>30 Furthermore, we can retrieve the information that the noun Bericht is less likely to appear as subject of geben than the nouns Mitarbeiter and Kollege (verb–noun subcat case prediction). [sent-48, score-0.445]
</p><p>31 And we can look up that the noun Aktion  is very unlikely to be a genitive modification of Regierung (cf. [sent-49, score-0.23]
</p><p>32 table 1), while Kollege is a plausible genitive modification of Bericht (noun–noun modification case prediction, cf. [sent-50, score-0.289]
</p><p>33 In summary, model (i) applies when there are no obvious preferences concerning verb–noun subcategorization or noun–noun modification. [sent-52, score-0.329]
</p><p>34 Model (ii) predicts case relying on the subcategorization and modification preferences. [sent-53, score-0.447]
</p><p>35 The combination of our two models approaches a simplified level of semantic role definition but only relies on dependency information that is considerably easier and cheaper to define and obtain than a very high quality semantic parser and/or a corpus annotated with semantic role information. [sent-54, score-0.052]
</p><p>36 Integrating semantic role information into SMT has been demonstrated by various researchers to improve translation quality (cf. [sent-55, score-0.16]
</p><p>37 2  Previous work  Previous work has already introduced the idea of generating inflected forms as a post-processing step for a translation system that has been stripped of (most) target-language-specific features. [sent-59, score-0.39]
</p><p>38 (2010) built translation systems that predict inflected word forms based on a large array of morphological and syntactic features, obtained from both source and target side. [sent-62, score-0.554]
</p><p>39 Kholy and Habash (2012) and Green and DeNero (2012) work on English to Arabic translation and model gender, number and definiteness, focusing primarily on improving fluency. [sent-63, score-0.109]
</p><p>40 (2012) used a phrase-based system to transfer stems and generated inflected forms based on the stems and their morphological features. [sent-65, score-0.652]
</p><p>41 For case prediction, they trained a CRF with access to lemmas and POS-tags within a given window. [sent-66, score-0.116]
</p><p>42 as a hierarchical machine translation system using a string-to-tree setup. [sent-68, score-0.109]
</p><p>43 (2012), syntactic trees on the SMT output allow us to work with verb–noun structures, which are relevant for case prediction. [sent-70, score-0.123]
</p><p>44 While the CRF used for case prediction in Fraser et al. [sent-71, score-0.199]
</p><p>45 (2012) has access to lexical information, it is limited to a certain window size and has no direct information about the relation of verb–noun pairs occurring in the sentence. [sent-72, score-0.08]
</p><p>46 Using a window of a limited size is particularly problematic for German, as there can be large gaps between the verb and its subcategorized nouns; introducing information about the relation of verbs and nouns helps to bridge such gaps. [sent-73, score-0.227]
</p><p>47 One of the objectives of using an inflection prediction model is morphologically well-formed output. [sent-75, score-0.333]
</p><p>48 (2012) evaluated user reactions to different error types in machine translation and came to the result that morphological well-formedness has only a marginal impact on the comprehensibility of SMT output in the case of English-Spanish translation. [sent-77, score-0.366]
</p><p>49 As already discussed, German case is essential to the meaning of the sentence, so this result will not hold for German output. [sent-78, score-0.065]
</p><p>50 3  Translation pipeline  This section presents an overview of our two-step translation process. [sent-79, score-0.109]
</p><p>51 In the first step, English input is translated to German stems. [sent-80, score-0.049]
</p><p>52 In the second step, morphological features are predicted and inflected forms are generated based on the word stems and the morphological features. [sent-81, score-0.728]
</p><p>53 4, we present the simple version of the inflection prediction system; our new features are described in sections 4. [sent-84, score-0.319]
</p><p>54 1 Stemmed representation/feature markup We first parse the German side of the parallel training data with BitPar (Schmid, 2004). [sent-88, score-0.061]
</p><p>55 This maps each surface form appearing in normal text to a stem and morphological features (case, gender, number). [sent-89, score-0.238]
</p><p>56 We use this representation to create the stemmed representation for training the translation model. [sent-90, score-0.26]
</p><p>57 With the exception of stem-markup (discussed below), all morphological features are removed from the stemmed representation. [sent-91, score-0.339]
</p><p>58 The stem markup is used as part of the input to the feature prediction; the basic idea is that the given feature values are picked up by the prediction model and then propagated over the phrase. [sent-92, score-0.271]
</p><p>59 Nouns, as the head of NPs and PPs, are annotated with gender and number. [sent-93, score-0.101]
</p><p>60 We consider gender as part of the stem, whereas the value for number is derived from the source-side: if marked for number, singular/plural nouns are distinguished during word alignment and then translated accordingly. [sent-94, score-0.215]
</p><p>61 Prepositions are also annotated with case; many prepositions are restricted to only one case,  some are ambiguous and allow for either dative or accusative. [sent-95, score-0.181]
</p><p>62 Other words which are subject to feature prediction (e. [sent-96, score-0.173]
</p><p>63 adjectives, articles) are reduced to their stems with no feature markup, as are all remaining words. [sent-98, score-0.117]
</p><p>64 As sole exception, we keep the inflected forms of verbs (verbal inflection is not modelled). [sent-99, score-0.441]
</p><p>65 In addition to the translation model, the target-side language model, as well as the reference data for parameter tuning use this representation. [sent-100, score-0.109]
</p><p>66 2 Building a stemmed translation model We use a hierarchical translation system. [sent-102, score-0.369]
</p><p>67 Instead of translating phrases, a hierarchical system extracts translation rules (Galley et al. [sent-103, score-0.139]
</p><p>68 , 2004) which allow the decoder to provide a tree spanning over the translated sentence. [sent-104, score-0.049]
</p><p>69 In order to avoid sparsity during rule extraction, we use a string-to-tree setup, where only the target-side part of the data is parsed. [sent-105, score-0.031]
</p><p>70 Translation rules are of the following form: [X ] [X ]  1 1  al lows al lows  [X ] [X ]  2 2  → →→  [ NP ] [ NP ]  1 1  [ NP ] 2 e rlaubt erl aubt [ NP ] 2  This example illustrates how rules can cover the different word ordering possibilities in German. [sent-106, score-0.108]
</p><p>71 PP nodes are annotated with their respective case, as well as with the lemma of the preposition they contain. [sent-107, score-0.058]
</p><p>72 This outcome, in particular that adding the lemma of the preposition to the PP node helps to improve translation quality, has been observed before in tree restructuring work for improving translation (Huang and Knight, 2006). [sent-109, score-0.243]
</p><p>73 3  Feature prediction and generation of inflected forms  In this section we discuss our focus, which is prediction of case, but also the prediction of number, gender and strong/weak adjectival inflection. [sent-111, score-0.832]
</p><p>74 Morphological features are predicted on four  separate CRF models, one for each feature. [sent-115, score-0.056]
</p><p>75 The models for case, number and gender are independent of another, whereas the model for adjectival inflection requires information about these features, and is thus the last one to be computed, taking the output of the 3 other models as part of its input. [sent-116, score-0.34]
</p><p>76 In contrast, the adjectival inflection model in Fraser et al. [sent-117, score-0.208]
</p><p>77 Each model has access to stems, POS-tags and the feature to be modelled within a window of four positions to the right and the left of the current position3. [sent-119, score-0.088]
</p><p>78 2Note that the values for strong/weak inflection are not always the same over the phrase, but follow a certain pattern depending on the settings of case, number and gender. [sent-120, score-0.16]
</p><p>79 3Preliminary experiments showed that larger windows do not improve translation quality. [sent-121, score-0.109]
</p><p>80 Table 2 illustrates the different steps of the inflection process: the markup (number and gender on nouns) in the stemmed output of the SMT system is part of the input to the respective feature prediction. [sent-122, score-0.537]
</p><p>81 For gender and number, the values given on the stems of the nouns are then propa-  gated over the phrase. [sent-123, score-0.309]
</p><p>82 While the case of prepositional phrases is determined by the case annotation on prepositions, the case of nominal phrases is computed only based on the respective contexts. [sent-124, score-0.296]
</p><p>83 After predicting all morphological features, the information required to generate inflected forms is complete: based on the stems and the features, we use the morphological tool SMOR (Schmid et al. [sent-125, score-0.672]
</p><p>84 One general problem with feature-prediction is that the ill-formed SMT output is not well represented by the training data which consists of wellformed sentences. [sent-127, score-0.031]
</p><p>85 They deal with this problem by translating the training data and annotating it with the respective features, and then adding this new data set to the original training data. [sent-129, score-0.063]
</p><p>86 As this method comes with its own problems, such as transferring the morphological annotation to not necessarily isomorphically translated text, we do not use translated data as part of the training data. [sent-130, score-0.235]
</p><p>87 4 Dealing with word formation issues To reduce data sparsity, we split portmanteau prepositions. [sent-133, score-0.058]
</p><p>88 Being components of nominal phrases, they have to agree in all morphological features with the rest of the phrase. [sent-137, score-0.162]
</p><p>89 As only some combinations of articles and prepositions can form a portmanteau, the decision of whether to merge prepositions and articles is made after feature prediction. [sent-138, score-0.208]
</p><p>90 Since our focus is case prediction, we do not do special modelling of German compounds. [sent-139, score-0.065]

<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lu ; Meng Sun ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Current translation models are mainly designed for languages with limited morphology, which are not readily applicable to agglutinative languages as the difference in the way lexical forms are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translating agglutinative languages by treating stems and affixes differently. We employ stem as the atomic translation unit to alleviate data spareness. In addition, we associate each stemgranularity translation rule with a distribution of related affixes, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their affix distributions with given spans to be translated. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the translation performance on tasks of translating from three Turkic languages to Chinese.</p><p>4 0.10007025 <a title="378-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Compositional-ly_Derived_Representations_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words_in_Distributional_Semantics.html">87 acl-2013-Compositional-ly Derived Representations of Morphologically Complex Words in Distributional Semantics</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Marco Marelli ; Roberto Zamparelli ; Marco Baroni</p><p>Abstract: Speakers of a language can construct an unlimited number of new words through morphological derivation. This is a major cause of data sparseness for corpus-based approaches to lexical semantics, such as distributional semantic models of word meaning. We adapt compositional methods originally developed for phrases to the task of deriving the distributional meaning of morphologically complex words from their parts. Semantic representations constructed in this way beat a strong baseline and can be of higher quality than representations directly constructed from corpus data. Our results constitute a novel evaluation of the proposed composition methods, in which the full additive model achieves the best performance, and demonstrate the usefulness of a compositional morphology component in distributional semantics.</p><p>5 0.098320179 <a title="378-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Categorization_of_Turkish_News_Documents_with_Morphological_Analysis.html">78 acl-2013-Categorization of Turkish News Documents with Morphological Analysis</a></p>

Our system uses a trainable classifier to predict “edit scripts” that are then used to transform lemmas into inflected word forms. Suffixes of lemmas are included as features to achieve robustness. We evaluate our system on 6 languages with a varying degree of morphological richness. The results show that the system is able to learn most morphological phenomena and generalize to unseen inputs, producing significantly better results than a dictionarybased baseline.</p><p>3 0.68933022 <a title="378-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Psycholinguistically_Motivated_Computational_Models_on_the_Organization_and_Processing_of_Morphologically_Complex_Words.html">286 acl-2013-Psycholinguistically Motivated Computational Models on the Organization and Processing of Morphologically Complex Words</a></p>
<p>Author: Tirthankar Dasgupta</p><p>Abstract: In this work we present psycholinguistically motivated computational models for the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Our goal is to identify whether morphologically complex words are stored as a whole or are they organized along the morphological line. For this, we have conducted a series of psycholinguistic experiments to build up hypothesis on the possible organizational structure of the mental lexicon. Next, we develop computational models based on the collected dataset. We observed that derivationally suffixed Bangla words are in general decomposed during processing and compositionality between the stem . and the suffix plays an important role in the decomposition process. We observed the same phenomena for Bangla verb sequences where experiments showed noncompositional verb sequences are in general stored as a whole in the ML and low traces of compositional verbs are found in the mental lexicon. 1 IInnttrroodduuccttiioonn Mental lexicon is the representation of the words in the human mind and their associations that help fast retrieval and comprehension (Aitchison, 1987). Words are known to be associated with each other in terms of, orthography, phonology, morphology and semantics. However, the precise nature of these relations is unknown. An important issue that has been a subject of study for a long time is to identify the fundamental units in terms of which the mental lexicon is i itkgp .ernet . in organized. That is, whether lexical representations in the mental lexicon are word based or are they organized along morphological lines. For example, whether a word such as “unimaginable” is stored in the mental lexicon as a whole word or do we break it up “un-” , “imagine” and “able”, understand the meaning of each of these constituent and then recombine the units to comprehend the whole word. Such questions are typically answered by designing appropriate priming experiments (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994) or other lexical decision tasks. The reaction time of the subjects for recognizing various lexical items under appropriate conditions reveals important facts about their organization in the brain. (See Sec. 2 for models of morphological organization and access and related experiments). A clear understanding of the structure and the processing mechanism of the mental lexicon will further our knowledge of how the human brain processes language. Further, these linguistically important and interesting questions are also highly significant for computational linguistics (CL) and natural language processing (NLP) applications. Their computational significance arises from the issue of their storage in lexical resources like WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) and raises the questions like, how to store morphologically complex words, in a lexical resource like WordNet keeping in mind the storage and access efficiency. There is a rich literature on organization and lexical access of morphologically complex words where experiments have been conducted mainly for derivational suffixed words of English, Hebrew, Italian, French, Dutch, and few other languages (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008; Frost et al., 1997; Grainger, et al., 1991 ; Drews and Zwitserlood, 1995). However, we do not know of any such investigations for Indian languages, which 123 Sofia, BuPrlgoacreiead, iAngusgu osft 4h-e9 A 2C01L3 S.tu ?c d2en0t1 3Re Ases aorc hiat Wio nrk fsohro Cp,om papguesta 1ti2o3n–a1l2 L9in,guistics are morphologically richer than many of their Indo-European cousins. Moreover, Indian languages show some distinct phenomena like, compound and composite verbs for which no such investigations have been conducted yet. On the other hand, experiments indicate that mental representation and processing of morphologically complex words are not quite language independent (Taft, 2004). Therefore, the findings from experiments in one language cannot be generalized to all languages making it important to conduct similar experimentations in other languages. This work aims to design cognitively motivated computational models that can explain the organization and processing of Bangla morphologically complex words in the mental lexicon. Presently we will concentrate on the following two aspects:   OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa PPo o l yy-mmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss:: our objective here is to determine whether the mental lexicon decomposes morphologically complex words into its constituent morphemes or does it represent the unanalyzed surface form of a word. OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd pprroocceessssiinngg ooff BBaannggllaa ccoomm-ppoouunndd vveerrbbss ((CCVV)) :: compound verbs are the subject of much debate in linguistic theory. No consensus has been reached yet with respect to the issue that whether to consider them as unitary lexical units or are they syntactically assembled combinations of two independent lexical units. As linguistic arguments have so far not led to a consensus, we here use cognitive experiments to probe the brain signatures of verb-verb combinations and propose cognitive as well as computational models regarding the possible organization and processing of Bangla CVs in the mental lexicon (ML). With respect to this, we apply the different priming and other lexical decision experiments, described in literature (Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Bentin, S. and Feldman, 1990) specifically for derivationally suffixed polymorphemic words and compound verbs of Bangla. Our cross-modal and masked priming experiment on Bangla derivationally suffixed words shows that morphological relatedness between lexical items triggers a significant priming effect, even when the forms are phonologically/orthographically unrelated. These observations are similar to those reported for English and indicate that derivationally suffixed words in Bangla are in general accessed through decomposition of the word into its constituent morphemes. Further, based on the experimental data we have developed a series of computational models that can be used to predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Our evaluation result shows that decom- position of a polymorphemic word depends on several factors like, frequency, productivity of the suffix and the compositionality between the stem and the suffix. The organization of the paper is as follows: Sec. 2 presents related works; Sec. 3 describes experiment design and procedure; Sec. 4 presents the processing of CVs; and finally, Sec. 5 concludes the paper by presenting the future direction of the work. 2 RReellaatteedd WWoorrkkss 2. . 11 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff ppoollyymmoorrpphheemmiicc wwoorrddss Over the last few decades many studies have attempted to understand the representation and processing of morphologically complex words in the brain for various languages. Most of the studies are designed to support one of the two mutually exclusive paradigms: the full-listing and the morphemic model. The full-listing model claims that polymorphic words are represented as a whole in the human mental lexicon (Bradley, 1980; Butterworth, 1983). On the other hand, morphemic model argues that morphologically complex words are decomposed and represented in terms of the smaller morphemic units. The affixes are stripped away from the root form, which in turn are used to access the mental lexicon (Taft and Forster, 1975; Taft, 1981 ; MacKay, 1978). Intermediate to these two paradigms is the partial decomposition model that argues that different types of morphological forms are processed separately. For instance, the derived morphological forms are believed to be represented as a whole, whereas the representation of the inflected forms follows the morphemic model (Caramazza et al., 1988). Traditionally, priming experiments have been used to study the effects of morphology in language processing. Priming is a process that results in increase in speed or accuracy of response to a stimulus, called the target, based on the occurrence of a prior exposure of another stimulus, called the prime (Tulving et al., 1982). Here, subjects are exposed to a prime word for a short duration, and are subsequently shown a target word. The prime and target words may be morphologically, phonologically or semantically re124 lated. An analysis of the effect of the reaction time of subjects reveals the actual organization and representation of the lexicon at the relevant level. See Pulvermüller (2002) for a detailed account of such phenomena. It has been argued that frequency of a word influences the speed of lexical processing and thus, can serve as a diagnostic tool to observe the nature and organization of lexical representations. (Taft, 1975) with his experiment on English inflected words, argued that lexical decision responses of polymorphemic words depends upon the base word frequency. Similar observation for surface word frequency was also observed by (Bertram et al., 2000;Bradley, 1980;Burani et al., 1987;Burani et al., 1984;Schreuder et al., 1997; Taft 1975;Taft, 2004) where it has been claimed that words having low surface frequency tends to decompose. Later, Baayen(2000) proposed the dual processing race model that proposes that a specific morphologically complex form is accessed via its parts if the frequency of that word is above a certain threshold of frequency, then the direct route will win, and the word will be accessed as a whole. If it is below that same threshold of frequency, the parsing route will win, and the word will be accessed via its parts. 2. . 22 RReepprreesseennttaattiioonn ooff CCoommppoouunndd A compound verb (CV) consists of two verbs (V1 and V2) acting as and expresses a single expression For example, in the sentence VVeerrbbss a sequence of a single verb of meaning. রুটিগুল ো খেল খেল ো (/ruTigulo kheYe phela/) ―bread-plural-the eat and drop-pres. Imp‖ ―Eat the breads‖ the verb sequence “খেল খেল ো (eat drop)” is an example of CV. Compound verbs are a special phenomena that are abundantly found in IndoEuropean languages like Indian languages. A plethora of works has been done to provide linguistic explanations on the formation of such word, yet none so far has led to any consensus. Hook (1981) considers the second verb V2 as an aspectual complex comparable to the auxiliaries. Butt (1993) argues CV formations in Hindi and Urdu are either morphological or syntactical and their formation take place at the argument struc- ture. Bashir (1993) tried to construct a semantic analysis based on “prepared” and “unprepared mind”. Similar findings have been proposed by Pandharipande (1993) that points out V1 and V2 are paired on the basis of their semantic compatibility, which is subject to syntactic constraints. Paul (2004) tried to represent Bangla CVs in terms of HPSG formalism. She proposes that the selection of a V2 by a V1 is determined at the semantic level because the two verbs will unify if and only if they are semantically compatible. Since none of the linguistic formalism could satisfactorily explain the unique phenomena of CV formation, we here for the first time drew our attention towards psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic studies to model the processing of verb-verb combinations in the ML and compare these responses with that of the existing models. 3 TThhee PPrrooppoosseedd AApppprrooaacchheess 3. . 11 TThhee ppssyycchhoolliinngguuiissttiicc eexxppeerriimmeennttss We apply two different priming experiments namely, the cross modal priming and masked priming experiment discussed in (Forster and Davis, 1984; Rastle et al., 2000;Marslen-Wilson et al., 1994; Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) for Bangla morphologically complex words. Here, the prime is morphologically derived form of the target presented auditorily (for cross modal priming) or visually (for masked priming). The subjects were asked to make a lexical decision whether the given target is a valid word in that language. The same target word is again probed but with a different audio or visual probe called the control word. The control shows no relationship with the target. For example, baYaska (aged) and baYasa (age) is a prime-target pair, for which the corresponding control-target pair could be naYana (eye) and baYasa (age). Similar to (Marslen-Wilson et al., 2008) the masked priming has been conducted for three different SOA (Stimulus Onset Asynchrony), 48ms, 72ms and 120ms. The SOA is measured as the amount of time between the start the first stimulus till the start of the next stimulus.

There were 500 prime-target and controltarget pairs classified into five classes. Depending on the class, the prime is related to the target 125 either in terms of morphology, semantics, orthography and/or Phonology (See Table 1). The experiments were conducted on 24 highly educated native Bangla speakers. Nineteen of them have a graduate degree and five hold a post graduate degree. The age of the subjects varies between 22 to 35 years. RReessuullttss:: The RTs with extreme values and incorrect decisions were excluded from the data. The data has been analyzed using two ways ANOVA with three factors: priming (prime and control), conditions (five classes) and prime durations (three different SOA). We observe strong priming effects (p<0.05) when the target word is morphologically derived and has a recognizable suffix, semantically and orthographically related with respect to the prime; no priming effects are observed when the prime and target words are orthographically related but share no morphological or semantic relationship; although not statistically significant (p>0.07), but weak priming is observed for prime target pairs that are only semantically related. We see no significant difference between the prime and control RTs for other classes. We also looked at the RTs for each of the 500 target words. We observe that maximum priming occurs for words in [M+S+O+](69%), some priming is evident in [M+S+O-](51%) and [M'+S-O+](48%), but for most of the words in [M-S+O-](86%) and [M-S-O+](92%) no priming effect was observed. 3. . 22 FFrreeqquueennccyy DDiissttrriibbuuttiioonn MMooddeellss ooff MMoo rrpphhoo-llooggiiccaall PPrroocceessssiinngg From the above results we saw that not all polymorphemic words tend to decompose during processing, thus we need to further investigate the processing phenomena of Bangla derived words. One notable means is to identify whether the stem or suffix frequency is involved in the processing stage of that word. For this, we apply different frequency based models to the Bangla polymorphemic words and try to evaluate their performance by comparing their predicted results with the result obtained through the priming experiment. MMooddeell --11:: BBaassee aanndd SSuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeqquueennccyy ee ff-ffeecctt -- It states that the probability of decomposition of a Bangla polymorphemic word depends upon the frequency of its base word. Thus, if the stem frequency of a polymorphemic word crosses a given threshold value, then the word will decomposed into its constituent morpheme. Similar claim has been made for surface word frequency model where decomposition depends upon the frequency of the surface word itself. We have evaluated both the models with the 500 words used in the priming experiments discussed above. We have achieved an accuracy of 62% and 49% respectively for base and surface word frequency models. MMooddeell --22:: CCoommbbiinniinngg tthhee bbaassee aanndd ssuurrffaaccee wwoorrdd ffrreeq quueennccyy -- In a pursuit towards an extended model, we combine model 1 and 2 together. We took the log frequencies of both the base and the derived words and plotted the best-fit regression curve over the given dataset. The evaluation of this model over the same set of 500 target words returns an accuracy of 68% which is better than the base and surface word frequency models. However, the proposed model still fails to predict processing of around 32% of words. This led us to further enhance the model. For this, we analyze the role of suffixes in morphological processing. MMooddeell -- 33:: DDeeggrreeee ooff AAffffiixxaattiioonn aanndd SSuuffffiixx PPrroodd-uuccttiivviittyy:: we examine whether the regression analysis between base and derived frequency of Bangla words varies between suffixes and how these variations affect morphological decomposition. With respect to this, we try to compute the degree of affixation between the suffix and the base word. For this, we perform regression analysis on sixteen different Bangla suffixes with varying degree of type and token frequencies. For each suffix, we choose 100 different derived words. We observe that those suffixes having high value of intercept are forming derived words whose base frequencies are substantially high as compared to their derived forms. Moreover we also observe that high intercept value for a given suffix indicates higher inclination towards decomposition. Next, we try to analyze the role of suffix type/token ratio and compare them with the base/derived frequency ratio model. This has been done by regression analysis between the suffix type-token ratios with the base-surface frequency ratio. We further tried to observe the role of suffix productivity in morphological processing. For this, we computed the three components of productivity P, P* and V as discussed in (Hay and Plag, 2004). P is the “conditioned degree of productivity” and is the probability that we are encountering a word with an affix and it is representing a new type. P* is the “hapaxedconditioned degree of productivity”. It expresses the probability that when an entirely new word is 126 encountered it will contain the suffix. V is the “type frequency”. Finally, we computed the productivity of a suffix through its P, P* and V values. We found that decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic word is directly proportional to the productivity of the suffix. Therefore, words that are composed of productive suffixes (P value ranges between 0.6 and 0.9) like “-oYAlA”, “-giri”, “-tba” and “-panA” are highly decomposable than low productive suffixes like “-Ani”, “-lA”, “-k”, and “-tama”. The evaluation of the proposed model returns an accuracy of 76% which comes to be 8% better than the preceding models. CCoommbbiinniinngg MMooddeell --22 aanndd MMooddeell -- 33:: One important observation that can be made from the above results is that, model-3 performs best in determining the true negative values. It also possesses a high recall value of (85%) but having a low precision of (50%). In other words, the model can predict those words for which decomposition will not take place. On the other hand, results of Model-2 posses a high precision of 70%. Thus, we argue that combining the above two models can better predict the decomposition of Bangla polymorphemic words. Hence, we combine the two models together and finally achieved an overall accuracy of 80% with a precision of 87% and a recall of 78%. This surpasses the performance of the other models discussed earlier. However, around 22% of the test words were wrongly classified which the model fails to justify. Thus, a more rigorous set of experiments and data analysis are required to predict access mechanisms of such Bangla polymorphemic words. 3. . 33 SStteemm- -SSuuffffiixx CCoommppoossiittiioonnaalliittyy Compositionality refers to the fact that meaning of a complex expression is inferred from the meaning of its constituents. Therefore, the cost of retrieving a word from the secondary memory is directly proportional to the cost of retrieving the individual parts (i.e the stem and the suffix). Thus, following the work of (Milin et al., 2009) we define the compositionality of a morphologically complex word (We) as: C(We)=α 1H(We)+α α2H(e)+α α3H(W|e)+ α4H(e|W) Where, H(x) is entropy of an expression x, H(W|e) is the conditional entropy between the stem W and suffix e and is the proportionality factor whose value is computed through regression analysis. Next, we tried to compute the compositionality of the stem and suffixes in terms of relative entropy D(W||e) and Point wise mutual information (PMI). The relative entropy is the measure of the distance between the probability distribution of the stem W and the suffix e. The PMI measures the amount of information that one random variable (the stem) contains about the other (the suffix). We have compared the above three techniques with the actual reaction time data collected through the priming and lexical decision experiment. We observed that all the three information theoretic models perform much better than the frequency based models discussed in the earlier section, for predicting the decomposability of Bangla polymorphemic words. However, we think it is still premature to claim anything concrete at this stage of our work. We believe much more rigorous experiments are needed to be per- formed in order to validate our proposed models. Further, the present paper does not consider factors related to age of acquisition, and word familiarity effects that plays important role in the processing of morphologically complex words. Moreover, it is also very interesting to see how stacking of multiple suffixes in a word are processed by the human brain. 44 OOrrggaanniizzaattiioonn aanndd PPrroocceessssiinngg ooff CCoomm-ppoouunndd VVeerrbbss iinn tthhee MMeennttaall LLeexxiiccoonn Compound verbs, as discussed above, are special type of verb sequences consisting of two or more verbs acting as a single verb and express a single expression of meaning. The verb V1 is known as pole and V2 is called as vector. For example, “ওঠে পড়া ” (getting up) is a compound verb where individual words do not entirely reflects the meaning of the whole expression. However, not all V1+V2 combinations are CVs. For example, expressions like, “নিঠে য়াও ”(take and then go) and “ নিঠে আঠ ়া” (return back) are the examples of verb sequences where meaning of the whole expression can be derived from the mean- ing of the individual component and thus, these verb sequences are not considered as CV. The key question linguists are trying to identify for a long time and debating a lot is whether to consider CVs as a single lexical units or consider them as two separate units. Since linguistic rules fails to explain the process, we for the first time tried to perform cognitive experiments to understand the organization and processing of such verb sequences in the human mind. A clear understanding about these phenomena may help us to classify or extract actual CVs from other verb 127 sequences. In order to do so, presently we have applied three different techniques to collect user data. In the first technique, we annotated 4500 V1+V2 sequences, along with their example sentences, using a group of three linguists (the expert subjects). We asked the experts to classify the verb sequences into three classes namely, CV, not a CV and not sure. Each linguist has received 2000 verb pairs along with their respective example sentences. Out of this, 1500 verb sequences are unique to each of them and rest 500 are overlapping. We measure the inter annotator agreement using the Fleiss Kappa (Fleiss et al., 1981) measure (κ) where the agreement lies around 0.79. Next, out of the 500 common verb sequences that were annotated by all the three linguists, we randomly choose 300 V1+V2 pairs and presented them to 36 native Bangla speakers. We ask each subjects to give a compositionality score of each verb sequences under 1-10 point scale, 10 being highly compositional and 1 for noncompositional. We found an agreement of κ=0.69 among the subjects. We also observe a continuum of compositionality score among the verb sequences. This reflects that it is difficult to classify Bangla verb sequences discretely into the classes of CV and not a CV. We then, compare the compositionality score with that of the expert user’s annotation. We found a significant correlation between the expert annotation and the compositionality score. We observe verb sequences that are annotated as CVs (like, খেঠে খিল )কঠে খি ,ওঠে পড ,have got low compositionality score (average score ranges between 1-4) on the other hand high compositional values are in general tagged as not a cv (নিঠে য়া (come and get), নিঠে আে (return back), তুঠল খেঠেনি (kept), গনিঠে পিল (roll on floor)). This reflects that verb sequences which are not CV shows high degree of compositionality. In other words non CV verbs can directly interpret from their constituent verbs. This leads us to the possibility that compositional verb sequences requires individual verbs to be recognized separately and thus the time to recognize such expressions must be greater than the non-compositional verbs which maps to a single expression of meaning. In order to validate such claim we perform a lexical decision experiment using 32 native Bangla speakers with 92 different verb sequences. We followed the same experimental procedure as discussed in (Taft, 2004) for English polymorphemic words. However, rather than derived words, the subjects were shown a verb sequence and asked whether they recognize them as a valid combination. The reaction time (RT) of each subject is recorded. Our preliminarily observation from the RT analysis shows that as per our claim, RT of verb sequences having high compositionality value is significantly higher than the RTs for low or noncompositional verbs. This proves our hypothesis that Bangla compound verbs that show less compositionality are stored as a hole in the mental lexicon and thus follows the full-listing model whereas compositional verb phrases are individually parsed. However, we do believe that our experiment is composed of a very small set of data and it is premature to conclude anything concrete based only on the current experimental results. 5 FFuuttuurree DDiirreeccttiioonnss In the next phase of our work we will focus on the following aspects of Bangla morphologically complex words: TThhee WWoorrdd FFaammiilliiaarriittyy EEffffeecctt:: Here, our aim is to study the role of familiarity of a word during its processing.

In this study, we examine the effects of morphological analysis on text categorization task in Turkish. We use stems and word categories that are extracted with morphological analysis as main features and compare them with fixed length stemmers in a bag of words approach with several learning algorithms. We aim to show the effects of using varying degrees of morphological information.</p><p>5 0.63609767 <a title="378-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_lemmatise_Polish_noun_phrases.html">227 acl-2013-Learning to lemmatise Polish noun phrases</a></p>

The idea draws on the observation that the lemmatisation of almost all Polish noun phrases may be decomposed into transformation of singular words (tokens) that make up each phrase. We perform evaluation, which shows results similar to those obtained earlier by a rule-based system, while our approach allows to separate chunking from lemmatisation.</p><p>6 0.61515301 <a title="378-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Deepfix%3A_Statistical_Post-editing_of_Statistical_Machine_Translation_Using_Deep_Syntactic_Analysis.html">110 acl-2013-Deepfix: Statistical Post-editing of Statistical Machine Translation Using Deep Syntactic Analysis</a></p>

We combine (i) features on sourceside syntactic subcategorization and (ii) an external knowledge base with quantitative, dependency-based information about target-side subcategorization frames. A manual evaluation of an English-toGerman translation task shows that the subcategorization information has a positive impact on translation quality through better prediction of case.</p><p>2 0.58182186 <a title="378-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Filling_Knowledge_Base_Gaps_for_Distant_Supervision_of_Relation_Extraction.html">159 acl-2013-Filling Knowledge Base Gaps for Distant Supervision of Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Wei Xu ; Raphael Hoffmann ; Le Zhao ; Ralph Grishman</p><p>Abstract: Distant supervision has attracted recent interest for training information extraction systems because it does not require any human annotation but rather employs existing knowledge bases to heuristically label a training corpus. However, previous work has failed to address the problem of false negative training examples mislabeled due to the incompleteness of knowledge bases. To tackle this problem, we propose a simple yet novel framework that combines a passage retrieval model using coarse features into a state-of-the-art relation extractor using multi-instance learning with fine features. We adapt the information retrieval technique of pseudo- relevance feedback to expand knowledge bases, assuming entity pairs in top-ranked passages are more likely to express a relation. Our proposed technique significantly improves the quality of distantly supervised relation extraction, boosting recall from 47.7% to 61.2% with a consistently high level of precision of around 93% in the experiments.</p><p>3 0.50482261 <a title="378-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-SenseSpotting%3A_Never_let_your_parallel_data_tie_you_to_an_old_domain.html">316 acl-2013-SenseSpotting: Never let your parallel data tie you to an old domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Marine Carpuat ; Hal Daume III ; Katharine Henry ; Ann Irvine ; Jagadeesh Jagarlamudi ; Rachel Rudinger</p><p>Abstract: Words often gain new senses in new domains. Being able to automatically identify, from a corpus of monolingual text, which word tokens are being used in a previously unseen sense has applications to machine translation and other tasks sensitive to lexical semantics. We define a task, SENSESPOTTING, in which we build systems to spot tokens that have new senses in new domain text. Instead of difficult and expensive annotation, we build a goldstandard by leveraging cheaply available parallel corpora, targeting our approach to the problem of domain adaptation for machine translation. Our system is able to achieve F-measures of as much as 80%, when applied to word types it has never seen before. Our approach is based on a large set of novel features that capture varied aspects of how words change when used in new domains.</p><p>4 0.50393838 <a title="378-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Projections_between_Languages_from_Different_Families.html">97 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Projections between Languages from Different Families</a></p>
<p>Author: Mo Yu ; Tiejun Zhao ; Yalong Bai ; Hao Tian ; Dianhai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual projection methods can benefit from resource-rich languages to improve performances of NLP tasks in resources-scarce languages. However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>5 0.50345671 <a title="378-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Real-World_Semi-Supervised_Learning_of_POS-Taggers_for_Low-Resource_Languages.html">295 acl-2013-Real-World Semi-Supervised Learning of POS-Taggers for Low-Resource Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Mielens ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for low-resource languages often requires creating resources from scratch. While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger. Our results show that annotation of word types is the most important, provided a sufficiently capable semi-supervised learning infrastructure is in place to project type information onto a raw corpus. We also show that finitestate morphological analyzers are effective sources of type information when few labeled examples are available.</p><p>6 0.50272989 <a title="378-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Turnarounds_in_Sentiment_Analysis%3A_Thwarting.html">117 acl-2013-Detecting Turnarounds in Sentiment Analysis: Thwarting</a></p>

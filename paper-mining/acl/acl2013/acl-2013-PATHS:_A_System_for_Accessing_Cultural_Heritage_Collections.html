</p><p>3 1 Introduction  Significant amounts of information about cultural heritage has been digitised in recent years and is now easily available through online portals. [sent-6, score-0.381]
</p><p>4 Potentially useful and relevant content is hidden from the users who are typically offered simple keyword-based searching functionality as the entry point into a cultural heritage collection. [sent-8, score-0.473]
</p><p>5 The situation is very different within traditional mechanisms for viewing cultural heritage (e. [sent-9, score-0.407]
</p><p>6 museums) where artefacts are organised thematically and users guided through the collection. [sent-11, score-0.729]
</p><p>7 This paper describes a system that allows users to explore large cultural heritage collections. [sent-12, score-0.455]
</p><p>8 Navigation is based around the metaphor of pathways (or trails) through the collection, an approach that has been widely explored as an alternative to standard keyword-based search (Furuta et al. [sent-13, score-0.152]
</p><p>9 Pathways are sets of artefacts or-  ganised around a theme which form access points to the collection. [sent-17, score-0.65]
</p><p>10 Pathways are a useful way to access information about cultural heritage. [sent-18, score-0.231]
</p><p>11 Users accessing these collections are often unfamiliar with their content, making keyword-based search unsuitable since they are unable to formulate appropriate queries (Wilson et al. [sent-19, score-0.223]
</p><p>12 Pathways support this exploration by echoing the organised galleries and guided tours found in museums. [sent-22, score-0.119]
</p><p>13 The user explores the collection through a set of web pages which provide descriptions of each artefact that are personalised for each user. [sent-25, score-0.447]
</p><p>14 The system makes use of information about the artefacts the user has viewed to build up a model of their interests and uses this to customise the descriptions  of each artefact and provide recommendations for further artefacts in which they may be interested. [sent-26, score-1.627]

</p><p>16 They make use of a range of techniques including language modelling, geospatial modelling and analysis of previous visitors’ behaviour to provide recommendations to visitors to the Melbourne Museum. [sent-29, score-0.101]

[sent-38, score-0.132]
</p><p>19 These approaches, like many of the systems that have been developed for online access to cultural heritage (e. [sent-39, score-0.432]
</p><p>20 , 2010)), are based around virtual access to a concrete physical space (i. [sent-42, score-0.129]
</p><p>21 They often provide tours which are constrained by the physical layout of the museum, such as virtual museum visits. [sent-45, score-0.307]
</p><p>22 However, these approaches are less suitable for unstructured collections such as databases of cultural heritage artefacts collected from multiple institutions or artefacts not connected with existing physical presentation (e. [sent-46, score-1.857]
</p><p>23 The PATHS system is designed for these types of collections and makes use of natural language analysis to support navigation. [sent-49, score-0.167]
</p><p>24 In particular, similarity between artefacts is computed automatically (see Section 4. [sent-50, score-0.631]
</p><p>25 1), background information automatically added to artefact descriptions (see Section 4. [sent-51, score-0.382]

</p><p>27 This is a web-portal to collections of cultural heritage artefacts provided by a wide range of European institutions. [sent-55, score-1.174]
</p><p>28 Europeana currently provides access to over 20 million artefacts including paintings, films, books, archival records and museum objects. [sent-56, score-0.842]
</p><p>29 The artefacts are provided by around 1,500 institutions which range from major institutions, including the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the British Library and the Louvre, to smaller organisations such as local museums. [sent-57, score-0.691]
</p><p>30 It therefore contains an aggregation of digital content from several sources and is not connected with any one physical museum. [sent-58, score-0.132]
</p><p>31 The PATHS system makes use of three collections from Europeana. [sent-59, score-0.167]
</p><p>32 The first of these contains artefacts from content providers in the United Kingdom which has meta-data in English. [sent-60, score-0.718]
</p><p>33 The artefacts in the remaining two collections come from institutions in Spain and have meta-data in Spanish. [sent-61, score-0.831]
</p><p>34 1  It contains information about over one million artefacts from 40 different UK content providers such as national and regional museums and libraries. [sent-63, score-0.793]
</p><p>35 The material is collected from different providers in Spain including museums and libraries. [sent-67, score-0.15]
</p><p>36 Europeana stores metadata for each artefact in an XML-based format which includes information such as its title, the digital format, the collection, the year of creation and also a short description of each artefact. [sent-68, score-0.38]
</p><p>37 However, this meta-data is created  by the content providers and varies significantly across artefacts. [sent-69, score-0.119]
</p><p>38 Many of the artefacts have only limited information associated with them, for example a single word title. [sent-70, score-0.599]
</p><p>39 In addition, the content providers that contribute to Europeana use different hierarchical structures to organise their collections (e. [sent-71, score-0.378]
</p><p>40 Library of Congress Subject Headings6 and the Art and Architecture Thesaurus7), or do not organise their content into any structure. [sent-73, score-0.136]
</p><p>41 Consequently the various hierarchies that are used in Europeana only cover some of the artefacts and are not compatible with each other. [sent-74, score-0.714]
</p><p>42 1 Filtering Data Analysis of the artefacts in these three collections revealed that many have short and uninformative titles or lack a description. [sent-76, score-0.766]
</p><p>43 The collections were filtered by removing any artefacts that have no description and have either fewer than four words in their title or have a title  that is repeated more than 100 times in the collection. [sent-78, score-0.85]
</p><p>44 Table 1 shows the number of artefacts in each of the Europeana collections before and 4http : //www . [sent-79, score-0.766]
</p><p>45 Applying the heuristic leads to the removal of around 3 1% ofthe artefacts, although the number varies significantly across the collections with 61% of the artefacts in CultureGrid being removed and only 1% of those in Hispana. [sent-96, score-0.766]

[sent-98, score-0.263]
</p><p>47 1 Artefact Similarity We begin by computing the similarity between the various artefacts in the Europeana collections. [sent-100, score-0.631]
</p><p>48 This information is useful for navigation and recommendation but is not available in the Europeana collections since they are drawn from a diverse range of sources. [sent-101, score-0.299]
</p><p>49 This approach is evaluated using a set of 295 pairs of artefacts for which human judgements of similarity were obtained using crowdsourcing (Aletras et al. [sent-110, score-0.631]
</p><p>50 The similarity between all the artefacts in the collection is computed in a pairwise fashion. [sent-114, score-0.67]
</p><p>51 The 25 artefacts with the highest score are retained for each artefact. [sent-115, score-0.599]
</p><p>52 2 Background Links The metadata associated with Europeana artefacts is often very limited. [sent-117, score-0.629]
</p><p>53 Consequently links to relevant articles in Wikipedia were added to each the meta-data of each artefact using Wikipedia Miner (Milne and Witten, 2008) to provide background information. [sent-118, score-0.442]
</p><p>54 Three annotators analysed the links added and found that a confidence value of 0. [sent-121, score-0.111]
</p><p>55 3 Hierarchies The range of hierarchies used by the various collections that comprise the Europeana collection make navigation difficult (see Section 3). [sent-125, score-0.417]
</p><p>56 Consequently, the Wikipedia links added to the artefact meta-data were used to automatically generate hierarchies that the cover the entire collection. [sent-126, score-0.513]
</p><p>57 These hierarchies are used by the PATHS system to assist browsing and exploration. [sent-127, score-0.139]
</p><p>58 Two approaches are used to generate hierarchies of Europeana artefacts (WikiFreq and WikiTax). [sent-128, score-0.714]
</p><p>59 These are combined to generate the WikiMerge hierarchy which is used in the PATHS system. [sent-129, score-0.102]
</p><p>60 WikiFreq uses link frequencies across the entire collection to organise the artefacts. [sent-130, score-0.161]
</p><p>61 The first stage in the hierarchy generation process is to compute the frequency with which each linked Wikipedia article appears in the collection. [sent-131, score-0.102]
</p><p>62 The links in each artefact are these analysed to construct a hierarchy consisting of Wikipedia articles. [sent-132, score-0.495]
</p><p>63 The links in the meta-data associated with each artefact are ordered based on their frequency in the entire collection and that set of links then inserted into the hierarchy. [sent-133, score-0.504]
</p><p>64 For example, if the set of ordered links for an artefact is a1, a2, a3 · · · an then the artefact is then inserted into the hierarchy under the branch a1 → a2 → a3 · · · → an, with a1 at the top level i→n th ae tr→ee a and· t·h·e → →arte afact appearing under the node an. [sent-134, score-0.834]
</p><p>65 153  The hierarchy is pruned to removing nodes with fewer than 20 artefacts in them. [sent-136, score-0.701]
</p><p>66 Europeana artefacts are inserted into this taxonomy using the links added by Wikipedia Miner with each artefact being added to the taxonomy for all categories listed in the links. [sent-139, score-1.17]
</p><p>67 This leads to a taxonomy in which artefacts can occur in multiple locations. [sent-140, score-0.658]
</p><p>68 Each approach was used to generate hierarchies from the Europeana collections. [sent-141, score-0.115]
</p><p>69 The resulting hierarchies were evaluated via online surveys, see Fernando et al. [sent-142, score-0.115]
</p><p>70 WikiFreq is used to link each artefact to Wikipedia articles a1 . [sent-147, score-0.361]
</p><p>71 The resulting hierarchy is pruned removing all WikiTax topics that do not have a WikiFreq child or have only one child topic. [sent-152, score-0.128]
</p><p>72 Finally top-level topics in the combined hierarchy are then linked to their respective Wikipedia root node. [sent-153, score-0.128]
</p><p>73 The resulting WikiMerge hierarchy has WikiFreq topics as its leaves and WikiTax topics as its interior and root nodes. [sent-154, score-0.154]
</p><p>74 5  The PATHS System  The PATHS system provides access to the Europeana collections described in Section 3 by making use of the additional information generated using the approaches described in Section 4. [sent-157, score-0.218]
</p><p>75 The interface of the PATHS system has three main areas: Paths enables users to navigate via pathways (see Section 5. [sent-158, score-0.168]
</p><p>76 Search supports discovery ofboth collection arte-  facts and pathways through keyword search (see Section 5. [sent-160, score-0.218]
</p><p>77 Explore enables users to explore the collections using a variety of types of overview (see Section 5. [sent-162, score-0.241]
</p><p>78 1 Paths Area This area provides users with access to Europeana through pathways or trails. [sent-165, score-0.25]
</p><p>79 These are manually generated sets of artefacts organised into a tree structure which are designed to showcase the content available to the user in an organised way. [sent-166, score-0.779]

</p><p>81 The example artefact is a portrait of Catherine the Great. [sent-171, score-0.308]
</p><p>82 The right side of the figure shows additional information  Figure 2: Example artefact displayed in system interface. [sent-175, score-0.341]

</p><p>86 2  Search Area  This area allows users to search for artefacts and pathways using standard keyword search implemented using Lucene (McCandless et al. [sent-182, score-0.889]
</p><p>87 3 Explore Area The system provides a variety of ways to view the hierarchies generated using the approach described in Section 4. [sent-185, score-0.115]
</p><p>88 Figure 3 shows how these are displayed for a section of the hierarchy with the label “Society”. [sent-187, score-0.135]
</p><p>89 The simplest view (shown in the top left of Figure 3) is a thesaurus type view in which levels of the hierarchy are represented by indentation. [sent-188, score-0.102]
</p><p>90 The system also allows levels of the hierarchy to be viewed as a tag cloud (top right of Figure 3). [sent-189, score-0.153]
</p><p>91 The final representation of the hierarchy is as a map, shown in the bottom of Figure 3. [sent-190, score-0.102]

We evaluated our system in comparison with Samsung S-Voice (which interfaces to Google navigation and Google search) with 17 users and found that users judged our system to be significantly more interesting to interact with and learn from.

<p>Author: Emmanuel Lassalle ; Pascal Denis</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for significantly improving the performance of pairwise coreference models. Given a set of indicators, our method learns how to best separate types of mention pairs into equivalence classes for which we construct distinct classification models. In effect, our approach finds an optimal feature space (derived from a base feature set and indicator set) for discriminating coreferential mention pairs. Although our approach explores a very large space of possible feature spaces, it remains tractable by exploiting the structure of the hierarchies built from the indicators. Our exper- iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English datasets (gold mentions) indicate that our method is robust relative to different clustering strategies and evaluation metrics, showing large and consistent improvements over a single pairwise model using the same base features. Our best system obtains a competitive 67.2 of average F1 over MUC, and CEAF which, despite its simplicity, places it above the mean score of other systems on these datasets.

<p>Author: Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Sandro Bauer ; Johannes Hoffart ; Marc Spaniol ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has shown progress in achieving high-quality, very fine-grained type classification in hierarchical taxonomies. Within such a multi-level type hierarchy with several hundreds of types at different levels, many entities naturally belong to multiple types. In order to achieve high-precision in type classification, current approaches are either limited to certain domains or require time consuming multistage computations. As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy.</p><p>5 0.04767774 <a title="268-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Are_Semantically_Coherent_Topic_Models_Useful_for_Ad_Hoc_Information_Retrieval%3F.html">55 acl-2013-Are Semantically Coherent Topic Models Useful for Ad Hoc Information Retrieval?</a></p>
<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections. Results show that retrieval perfor- mances tend to be better when using topics with higher semantic coherence.</p><p>6 0.044581544 <a title="268-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Extending_an_interoperable_platform_to_facilitate_the_creation_of_multilingual_and_multimodal_NLP_applications.html">150 acl-2013-Extending an interoperable platform to facilitate the creation of multilingual and multimodal NLP applications</a></p>

<p>Author: Kapila Ponnamperuma ; Advaith Siddharthan ; Cheng Zeng ; Chris Mellish ; Rene van der Wal</p><p>Abstract: The aim of the Tag2Blog system is to bring satellite tagged wild animals “to life” through narratives that place their movements in an ecological context. Our motivation is to use such automatically generated texts to enhance public engagement with a specific species reintroduction programme, although the protocols developed here can be applied to any animal or other movement study that involves signal data from tags. We are working with one of the largest nature conservation charities in Europe in this regard, focusing on a single species, the red kite. We describe a system that interprets a sequence of locational fixes obtained from a satellite tagged individual, and constructs a story around its use of the landscape.</p><p>3 0.58345509 <a title="268-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Using_Integer_Linear_Programming_in_Concept-to-Text_Generation_to_Produce_More_Compact_Texts.html">375 acl-2013-Using Integer Linear Programming in Concept-to-Text Generation to Produce More Compact Texts</a></p>

<p>Author: Valentin Tablan ; Kalina Bontcheva ; Ian Roberts ; Hamish Cunningham ; Marin Dimitrov</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents AnnoMarket, an open cloud-based platform which enables researchers to deploy, share, and use language processing components and resources, following the data-as-a-service and software-as-a-service paradigms. The focus is on multilingual text analysis resources and services, based on an opensource infrastructure and compliant with relevant NLP standards. We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>6 0.53855592 <a title="268-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Text-Driven_Toponym_Resolution_using_Indirect_Supervision.html">340 acl-2013-Text-Driven Toponym Resolution using Indirect Supervision</a></p>

<p>Author: Qun Liu ; Zhaopeng Tu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel compact representation called weighted bipartite hypergraph to exploit the fertility model, which plays a critical role in word alignment. However, estimating the probabilities of rules extracted from hypergraphs is an NP-complete problem, which is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy by decomposing a hypergraph into a set of independent subhypergraphs. The experiments show that our approach outperforms both 1-best and n-best alignments.</p><p>3 0.60858852 <a title="268-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-TransDoop%3A_A_Map-Reduce_based_Crowdsourced_Translation_for_Complex_Domain.html">355 acl-2013-TransDoop: A Map-Reduce based Crowdsourced Translation for Complex Domain</a></p>
<p>Author: Anoop Kunchukuttan ; Rajen Chatterjee ; Shourya Roy ; Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Large amount of parallel corpora is required for building Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) systems. We describe the TransDoop system for gathering translations to create parallel corpora from online crowd workforce who have familiarity with multiple languages but are not expert translators. Our system uses a Map-Reduce-like approach to translation crowdsourcing where sentence translation is decomposed into the following smaller tasks: (a) translation ofconstituent phrases of the sentence; (b) validation of quality of the phrase translations; and (c) composition of complete sentence translations from phrase translations. Trans- Doop incorporates quality control mechanisms and easy-to-use worker user interfaces designed to address issues with translation crowdsourcing. We have evaluated the crowd’s output using the METEOR metric. For a complex domain like judicial proceedings, the higher scores obtained by the map-reduce based approach compared to complete sentence translation establishes the efficacy of our work.</p><p>4 0.6039905 <a title="268-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_Definitions_and_Hypernym_Relations_relying_on_Syntactic_Dependencies_and_Support_Vector_Machines.html">152 acl-2013-Extracting Definitions and Hypernym Relations relying on Syntactic Dependencies and Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Guido Boella ; Luigi Di Caro</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a technique to reveal definitions and hypernym relations from text. Instead of using pattern matching methods that rely on lexico-syntactic patterns, we propose a technique which only uses syntactic dependencies between terms extracted with a syntactic parser. The assumption is that syntactic information are more robust than patterns when coping with length and complexity of the sentences. Afterwards, we transform such syntactic contexts in abstract representations, that are then fed into a Support Vector Machine classifier. The results on an annotated dataset of definitional sentences demonstrate the validity of our approach overtaking current state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>5 0.59902024 <a title="268-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Domain-Independent_Information_in_Semantic_Parsing.html">228 acl-2013-Leveraging Domain-Independent Information in Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Dan Goldwasser ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Semantic parsing is a domain-dependent process by nature, as its output is defined over a set of domain symbols. Motivated by the observation that interpretation can be decomposed into domain-dependent and independent components, we suggest a novel interpretation model, which augments a domain dependent model with abstract information that can be shared by multiple domains. Our experiments show that this type of information is useful and can reduce the annotation effort significantly when moving between domains.</p><p>6 0.55791038 <a title="268-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Structured_Distributional_Semantic_Model_for_Event_Co-reference.html">22 acl-2013-A Structured Distributional Semantic Model for Event Co-reference</a></p>

</p><p>2 This paper proposes a method for approximating diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus data and shows, using a state-of-the-art verb clustering system, that features based on alternation approximation outperform  those based on independent subcategorization frames. [sent-4, score-0.824]
</p><p>3 Our alternation-based approach is particularly adept at leveraging information from less frequent data. [sent-5, score-0.025]
</p><p>4 1 Introduction Diathesis alternations (DAs) are regular alternations of the syntactic expression of verbal arguments, sometimes accompanied by a change in meaning. [sent-6, score-0.272]
</p><p>5 Levin (1993)’s seminal book provides a manual inventory both of DAs and verb classes where membership is determined according to participation in these alternations. [sent-10, score-0.244]
</p><p>6 ) can all take various DAs, such as the causative alternation, middle alternation and instrument subject alternation. [sent-16, score-0.127]
</p><p>7 In computational linguistics, work inspired by Levin’s classification has exploited the link between syntax and semantics for producing classifications of verbs. [sent-17, score-0.093]
</p><p>8 Such classifications are use-  ful for a wide variety of purposes such as semantic role labelling (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2002), Diana McCarthy and Anna Korhonen DTAL and Computer Laboratory University of Cambridge Cambridge, UK diana@ dianamccarthy . [sent-18, score-0.066]
</p><p>9 uk predicting unseen syntax (Parisien and Stevenson, 2010), argument zoning (Guo et al. [sent-22, score-0.077]
</p><p>10 While Levin’s classification can be extended manually (Kipper-Schuler, 2005), a large body of research has developed methods for automatic verb classification since such methods can be applied easily to other domains and languages. [sent-25, score-0.23]
</p><p>11 Existing work on automatic classification relies largely on syntactic features such as subcategorization frames (SCF)s (Schulte im Walde, 2006; Sun and Korhonen, 2011; Vlachos et al. [sent-26, score-0.333]
</p><p>12 There has also been some success incorporating selectional preferences (Sun and Korhonen, 2009). [sent-28, score-0.082]
</p><p>13 Merlo and Stevenson (2001) used cues such as passive voice, animacy and syntactic frames coupled with the overlap of lexical fillers between the alternating slots to predict a 3-way classification (unergative, unaccusative and object-drop). [sent-32, score-0.332]
</p><p>14 (2008) used similar features to classify verbs on a much larger scale. [sent-34, score-0.086]
</p><p>15 They classify up to 496 verbs using 11 different classifications each having between 2 and 14 classes. [sent-35, score-0.125]
</p><p>16 (2008) we seek to automatically classify verbs into a broad range of classes. [sent-40, score-0.059]
</p><p>17 , we include evidence of DA, but we do not manually select features attributed to specific alternations but rather experiment with syntactic evidence for alternation approximation. [sent-42, score-0.274]
</p><p>18 We use the verb clustering system presented in Sun and Korhonen (2009) because it achieves state-of-theart results on several datasets, including those of Joanis et al. [sent-43, score-0.272]
</p><p>19 , even without the additional boost in performance from the selectional preference data. [sent-44, score-0.046]
</p><p>20 We are interested in the improvement that can be achieved to verb clustering using approximations for DAs, rather than the DA per se. [sent-45, score-0.295]
</p><p>21 As such we make the simple assumption that if a pair of SCFs tends to occur with the same verbs, we have a potential occurrence of DA. [sent-46, score-0.051]
</p><p>22 Although this approximation can give rise to false positives (pairs of frames that co-occur frequently but are not DA) we are nevertheless interested in investigating its potential usefulness for verb classification. [sent-47, score-0.422]
</p><p>23 2  Diathesis Alternation Approximation  A DA can be approximated by a pair of SCFs. [sent-49, score-0.028]
</p><p>24 We parameterize frames involving prepositional phrases with the preposition. [sent-50, score-0.185]
</p><p>25 Example SCFs for the verb “spray” are shown in Table 1. [sent-51, score-0.176]
</p><p>26 The feature value of a single frame feature is the frequency of the SCF. [sent-52, score-0.285]
</p><p>27 Given two frames fv (i) , fv (j) of a verb v, they can be transformed into a feature pair (fv (i), fv (j)) as an approximation to a DA. [sent-53, score-2.577]
</p><p>28 The feature value of the DA feature (fv (i) , fv (j)) is ap-  proximated by the joint probability of the pair of frames p(fv (i) , fv (j) |v), obtained by integrating all the possible DAs. [sent-54, score-1.679]
</p><p>29 Tv)h,e key assumption irsa tthinagt the joint probability of two SCFs has a strong correlation with a DA on the grounds that the DA gives rise to both SCFs in the pair. [sent-55, score-0.041]
</p><p>30 We use the DA feature (fv (i) , fv (j)) with its value p(fv (i) , fv (j) |v) as a new feature for verb clustering. [sent-56, score-1.642]
</p><p>31 As a comparison point, we can ignore the DA and make a frame independence assumption. [sent-57, score-0.196]
</p><p>32 The frame dependency is represented by a simple graphical model in figure 1. [sent-59, score-0.167]
</p><p>33 v represents a verb, a represents a DA and f represents a specific frame in total of M possible frames In the data, the verb (v) and frames (f) are observed, and any underlying alternation (a) is hidden. [sent-61, score-0.84]
</p><p>34 The aim is to approximate but not to detect a DA, so a is summed out:  p(fv(i), fv(j)|v) = Xp(fv(i), fv(j)|a) · p(a|v) Xa (2) In order to evaluate this sum, we use a relaxation 1: the sum in equation 1 is replaced with the maximum (max). [sent-62, score-0.067]
</p><p>35 This is a reasonable relaxation, as a pair of frames rarely participates in more than one  type of a DA. [sent-63, score-0.213]
</p><p>36 737  So we end up with a simple form: p(fv(i), fv(j)|v)  ≈  Z−1  ·  min(fv(i), fv(j)) (5)  The equation is intuitive: If fv (i) occurs 40 times and fv (j) 30 times, the DA between fv (i) and fv (j) ≤ 30 times. [sent-66, score-2.806]
</p><p>37 This upper bound value is used as (tjhe) f≤ea 3tu0re ti mvaelsu. [sent-67, score-0.02]
</p><p>38 vTalhuee original feature vector f of dimension M is transformed into M2 dimensions feature vector Table 2 shows the transformed feature space for spray. [sent-69, score-0.193]
</p><p>39 The feature space matches our expectation well:  f˜. [sent-70, score-0.043]
</p><p>40 3  Experiments  We evaluated this model by performing verb clustering experiments using three feature sets: F1: SCF parameterized with preposition. [sent-72, score-0.315]
</p><p>41 F2: The frame pair features built from F1 with the frame independence assumption (equation 1). [sent-74, score-0.441]
</p><p>42 This feature is not a DA feature as it ignores the inter-dependency of the frames. [sent-75, score-0.086]
</p><p>43 F3: The frame pair features (DAs) built from F1 with the frame dependency assumption (equation 4). [sent-76, score-0.412]
</p><p>44 This is the DA feature which considers the correlation of the two frames which are generated from the alternation. [sent-77, score-0.228]
</p><p>45 F3 implicitly includes F1, as a frame can pair with itself. [sent-78, score-0.195]
</p><p>46 2 In the example in Table 2, the frame pair “PP(on) PP(on)” will always have the same value as the “PP(on)” frame in F1. [sent-79, score-0.362]

</p><p>49 We experimented with two datasets that have been used in prior work on verb clustering: the test sets 7-11 (3-14 classes) in Joanis et al. [sent-85, score-0.198]
</p><p>50 We used the spectral clustering (SPEC) method and settings as in Sun and Korhonen (2009) but adopted the Bhattacharyya kernel (Jebara and Kondor, 2003) to improve the computational efficiency of the approach given the high dimensionality of the quadratic feature space. [sent-88, score-0.266]
</p><p>51 XD  wb(v,v0)  =X(vdv0d)1/2 Xd=1  (6)  The mean-filed bound of the Bhattacharyya kernel is very similar to the KL divergence kernel (Jebara et al. [sent-89, score-0.1]
</p><p>52 , 2004) which is frequently used in verb clustering experiments (Korhonen et al. [sent-90, score-0.272]
</p><p>53 To further reduce computational complexity, we restricted our scope to the more frequent features. [sent-92, score-0.025]
</p><p>54 In the experiment described in this section we used the 50 most frequent features for the 3-6 way classifications (Joanis et al. [sent-93, score-0.118]
</p><p>55 ’s test set 7-9) and 100 features for the 7-17 way classifications. [sent-94, score-0.027]
</p><p>56 In the next section, we will demonstrate that F3 outperforms F1 regardless of the feature number setting. [sent-95, score-0.043]
</p><p>57 The clustering results are evaluated using FMeasure as in Sun and Korhonen (2009) which provides the harmonic mean of precision (P) and recall (R) P is calculated using modified purity a global measure which evaluates the mean precision of clusters. [sent-97, score-0.096]

</p><p>63 This indicates that the frame independence assumption is a poor assumption. [sent-113, score-0.219]
</p><p>64 This experiment shows, on two datasets, that DA features are clearly more effective than the frame features for verb clustering, even when relaxations are used. [sent-121, score-0.397]
</p><p>65 The frequency ranked features were added to the  clustering one at a time, starting from the most frequent one. [sent-124, score-0.18]
</p><p>66 F3 outperforms F1 clearly on all the feature number settings. [sent-126, score-0.043]
</p><p>67 After adding some highly frequent frames (22 for test set 10 and 67 for test set 11), the performance for F1 is not further improved. [sent-127, score-0.21]
</p><p>68 The performance of F3, in contrast, is improved for almost all (including the mid-range frequency) frames, although to a lesser degree for low frequency frames. [sent-128, score-0.032]
</p><p>69 5  Related work  Parisien and Stevenson (2010) introduced a hierarchical Bayesian model capable of learning verb alternations and constructions from syntactic input. [sent-129, score-0.296]
</p><p>70 The focus was on modelling and explaining the child alternation acquisition rather than on automatic verb classification. [sent-130, score-0.329]
</p><p>71 Therefore, no quantitative evaluation of the clustering is reported, and the number of verbs under the novel verb generalization test is relatively small. [sent-131, score-0.312]
</p><p>72 Parisien and Figure 2: Comparison between frame features (F1) and  DA  features (F3) with different feature number settings. [sent-132, score-0.264]
</p><p>73 A fundamental difference is that we explicitly use a probability distribution over alternations (pair of frames) to represent a verb, whereas they represent a verb by a distribution over the observed frames similar to Vlachos et al. [sent-140, score-0.481]
</p><p>74 6  Conclusion and Future work  We have demonstrated the merits of using DAs for verb clustering compared to the SCF data from which they are derived on standard verb classi-  fication datasets and when integrated in a stateof-the-art verb clustering system. [sent-143, score-0.742]
</p><p>75 We have also demonstrated that the performance of frame features is dominated by the high frequency frames. [sent-144, score-0.226]
</p><p>76 In contrast, the DA features enable the mid-range frequency frames to further improve the performance. [sent-145, score-0.244]
</p><p>77 739  In the future, we plan to evaluate the performance of DA features in a larger scale experiment. [sent-146, score-0.027]
</p><p>78 Due to the high dimensionality of the transformed feature space (quadratic of the original feature space), we will need to improve the computational efficiency further, e. [sent-147, score-0.145]
</p><p>79 via use of an unsupervised dimensionality reduction technique Zhao and Liu (2007). [sent-149, score-0.027]
</p><p>80 Finally, we plan to supplement the DA feature with evidence from the slot fillers of the alternating slots, in the spirit of earlier work (McCarthy, 2000; Merlo and Stevenson, 2001 ; Joanis et al. [sent-152, score-0.129]
</p><p>81 Unlike these previous works, we will use selectional preferences to generalize the argument heads but will do so using preferences from distributional data (Sun and Korhonen, 2009) rather than WordNet, and use all argument head data in all frames. [sent-154, score-0.209]
</p><p>82 We envisage using maximum average distributional similarity of the argument heads in any potentially alternating slots in a pair of cooccurring frames as a feature, just as we currently use the frequency of the less frequent co-occurring frame. [sent-155, score-0.4]

<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selectional preferences (SPs) and verb classes capture related aspects of the predicateargument structure. We present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of these three types of information. We show how to utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our novel clustering algorithm constructs a joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and utilizes the efficient sampling algorithms of DPPs to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the induced clusters in the context of the three tasks and show results that are superior to strong baselines for each 1.</p><p>3 0.11661205 <a title="119-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Language_Acquisition_and_Probabilistic_Models%3A_keeping_it_simple.html">213 acl-2013-Language Acquisition and Probabilistic Models: keeping it simple</a></p>
<p>Author: Aline Villavicencio ; Marco Idiart ; Robert Berwick ; Igor Malioutov</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) have been used with some success to capture empirically observed patterns of under- and overgeneralization in child language acquisition. However, as is well known, HBMs are “ideal”learningsystems, assumingaccess to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisi- tion domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL). Our results demonstrate that LCL can match HBM model performance without incurring on the high computational costs associated with HBMs.</p><p>4 0.11543331 <a title="119-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Outsourcing_FrameNet_to_the_Crowd.html">265 acl-2013-Outsourcing FrameNet to the Crowd</a></p>

We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>5 0.10481297 <a title="119-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Semantic_Frames_to_Predict_Stock_Price_Movement.html">310 acl-2013-Semantic Frames to Predict Stock Price Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Boyi Xie ; Rebecca J. Passonneau ; Leon Wu ; German G. Creamer</p><p>Abstract: Semantic frames are a rich linguistic resource. There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems. We address a task to predict change in stock price from financial news. Semantic frames help to generalize from specific sentences to scenarios, and to detect the (positive or negative) roles of specific companies. We introduce a novel tree representation, and use it to train predictive models with tree kernels using support vector machines. Our experiments test multiple text representations on two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. Experiments show that features derived from semantic frame parsing have significantly better performance across years on the polarity task.</p><p>6 0.087241635 <a title="119-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Diana McCarthy ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Although diathesis alternations have been used as features for manual verb classification, and there is recent work on incorporating such features in computational models of human language acquisition, work on large scale verb classification has yet to examine the potential for using diathesis alternations as input features to the clustering process. This paper proposes a method for approximating diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus data and shows, using a state-of-the-art verb clustering system, that features based on alternation approximation outperform those based on independent subcategorization frames.

<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selectional preferences (SPs) and verb classes capture related aspects of the predicateargument structure. We present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of these three types of information. We show how to utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our novel clustering algorithm constructs a joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and utilizes the efficient sampling algorithms of DPPs to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the induced clusters in the context of the three tasks and show results that are superior to strong baselines for each 1.</p><p>3 0.70961875 <a title="119-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Language_Acquisition_and_Probabilistic_Models%3A_keeping_it_simple.html">213 acl-2013-Language Acquisition and Probabilistic Models: keeping it simple</a></p>
<p>Author: Aline Villavicencio ; Marco Idiart ; Robert Berwick ; Igor Malioutov</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) have been used with some success to capture empirically observed patterns of under- and overgeneralization in child language acquisition. However, as is well known, HBMs are “ideal”learningsystems, assumingaccess to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisi- tion domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL). Our results demonstrate that LCL can match HBM model performance without incurring on the high computational costs associated with HBMs.</p><p>4 0.57281095 <a title="119-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Semantic_Frames_to_Predict_Stock_Price_Movement.html">310 acl-2013-Semantic Frames to Predict Stock Price Movement</a></p>
<p>Author: Boyi Xie ; Rebecca J. Passonneau ; Leon Wu ; German G. Creamer</p><p>Abstract: Semantic frames are a rich linguistic resource. There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems. We address a task to predict change in stock price from financial news. Semantic frames help to generalize from specific sentences to scenarios, and to detect the (positive or negative) roles of specific companies. We introduce a novel tree representation, and use it to train predictive models with tree kernels using support vector machines. Our experiments test multiple text representations on two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. Experiments show that features derived from semantic frame parsing have significantly better performance across years on the polarity task.</p><p>5 0.56099212 <a title="119-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-The_Effects_of_Lexical_Resource_Quality_on_Preference_Violation_Detection.html">344 acl-2013-The Effects of Lexical Resource Quality on Preference Violation Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesse Dunietz ; Lori Levin ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet are widely used in a multitude of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora such as treebanks. Often, the resources are used as-is, without question or examination. This practice risks missing significant performance gains and even entire techniques. This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations. We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector. With asis lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources. More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements.</p><p>6 0.55825311 <a title="119-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Outsourcing_FrameNet_to_the_Crowd.html">265 acl-2013-Outsourcing FrameNet to the Crowd</a></p>

<p>Author: Arjun Mukherjee ; Vivek Venkataraman ; Bing Liu ; Sharon Meraz</p><p>Abstract: Social media platforms have enabled people to freely express their views and discuss issues of interest with others. While it is important to discover the topics in discussions, it is equally useful to mine the nature of such discussions or debates and the behavior of the participants. There are many questions that can be asked. One key question is whether the participants give reasoned arguments with justifiable claims via constructive debates or exhibit dogmatism and egotistic clashes of ideologies. The central idea of this question is tolerance, which is a key concept in the field of communications. In this work, we perform a computational study of tolerance in the context of online discussions. We aim to identify tolerant vs. intolerant participants and investigate how disagreement affects tolerance in discussions in a quantitative framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such study. Our experiments using real-life discussions demonstrate the effective- ness of the proposed technique and also provide some key insights into the psycholinguistic phenomenon of tolerance in online discussions.</p><p>3 0.70780993 <a title="119-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Combining_Intra-_and_Multi-sentential_Rhetorical_Parsing_for_Document-level_Discourse_Analysis.html">85 acl-2013-Combining Intra- and Multi-sentential Rhetorical Parsing for Document-level Discourse Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Shafiq Joty ; Giuseppe Carenini ; Raymond Ng ; Yashar Mehdad</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for developing a two-stage document-level discourse parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intrasentential parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of discourse parsing effectively. A set of empirical evaluations over two different datasets demonstrates that our discourse parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art, often by a wide margin.</p><p>4 0.58762282 <a title="119-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Improved_Lexical_Acquisition_through_DPP-based_Verb_Clustering.html">192 acl-2013-Improved Lexical Acquisition through DPP-based Verb Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Polina Kuznetsova ; Vicente Ordonez ; Alexander Berg ; Tamara Berg ; Yejin Choi</p><p>Abstract: The ever growing amount of web images and their associated texts offers new opportunities for integrative models bridging natural language processing and computer vision. However, the potential benefits of such data are yet to be fully realized due to the complexity and noise in the alignment between image content and text. We address this challenge with contributions in two folds: first, we introduce the new task of image caption generalization, formulated as visually-guided sentence compression, and present an efficient algorithm based on dynamic beam search with dependency-based constraints. Second, we release a new large-scale corpus with 1 million image-caption pairs achieving tighter content alignment between images and text. Evaluation results show the intrinsic quality of the generalized captions and the extrinsic utility of the new imagetext parallel corpus with respect to a concrete application of image caption transfer.</p><p>6 0.56958896 <a title="119-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Accurate_Shift-Reduce_Constituent_Parsing.html">155 acl-2013-Fast and Accurate Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing</a></p>

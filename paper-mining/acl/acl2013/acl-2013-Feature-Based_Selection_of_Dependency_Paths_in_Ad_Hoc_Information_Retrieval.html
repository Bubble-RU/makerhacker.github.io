<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer Extraction are often designed as isolated or loosely connected components in Question Answering (QA), with repeated overengineering on IR, and not necessarily performance gain for QA. We propose to tightly integrate them by coupling automatically learned features for answer extraction to a shallow-structured IR model. Our method is very quick to implement, and significantly improves IR for QA (measured in Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20% against an uncoupled retrieval baseline in both document and passage retrieval, which further leads to a downstream 20% improvement in QA F1.</p><p>3 0.070945777 <a title="158-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Are_Semantically_Coherent_Topic_Models_Useful_for_Ad_Hoc_Information_Retrieval%3F.html">55 acl-2013-Are Semantically Coherent Topic Models Useful for Ad Hoc Information Retrieval?</a></p>
<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections. Results show that retrieval perfor- mances tend to be better when using topics with higher semantic coherence.</p><p>4 0.060341377 <a title="158-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Crowd_Prefers_the_Middle_Path%3A_A_New_IAA_Metric_for_Crowdsourcing_Reveals_Turker_Biases_in_Query_Segmentation.html">99 acl-2013-Crowd Prefers the Middle Path: A New IAA Metric for Crowdsourcing Reveals Turker Biases in Query Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rohan Ramanath ; Monojit Choudhury ; Kalika Bali ; Rishiraj Saha Roy</p><p>Abstract: Query segmentation, like text chunking, is the first step towards query understanding. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for this task. Through carefully designed control experiments and Inter Annotator Agreement metrics for analysis of experimental data, we show that crowdsourcing may not be a suitable approach for query segmentation because the crowd seems to have a very strong bias towards dividing the query into roughly equal (often only two) parts. Similarly, in the case of hierarchical or nested segmentation, turkers have a strong preference towards balanced binary trees.</p><p>5 0.05691801 <a title="158-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrasing_Adaptation_for_Web_Search_Ranking.html">273 acl-2013-Paraphrasing Adaptation for Web Search Ranking</a></p>

<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><p>4 0.71197969 <a title="158-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrasing_Adaptation_for_Web_Search_Ranking.html">273 acl-2013-Paraphrasing Adaptation for Web Search Ranking</a></p>

The goal of the question analysis is to determine its general structure, type of an expected answer and create a search query for finding relevant documents in a textual knowledge base. The paper contains an overview of available solutions of these problems, description of their implementation and presents an evaluation based on a set of 1137 questions from a Polish quiz TV show. The results help to understand how an environment of a Slavonic language affects the performance of methods created for English.</p><p>6 0.63728821 <a title="158-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval.html">60 acl-2013-Automatic Coupling of Answer Extraction and Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingting Li ; Tiejun Zhao ; Andrew Finch ; Chunyue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Machine Transliteration is an essential task for many NLP applications. However, names and loan words typically originate from various languages, obey different transliteration rules, and therefore may benefit from being modeled independently. Recently, transliteration models based on Bayesian learning have overcome issues with over-fitting allowing for many-to-many alignment in the training of transliteration models. We propose a novel coupled Dirichlet process mixture model (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters and bilingually aligns transliteration data within a single unified model. The unified model decomposes into two classes of non-parametric Bayesian component models: a Dirichlet process mixture model for clustering, and a set of multinomial Dirichlet process models that perform bilingual alignment independently for each cluster. The experimental results show that our method considerably outperforms conventional alignment models.</p><p>5 0.82415313 <a title="158-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Synthetic_Discourse_Data_via_Multi-task_Learning_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Recognition.html">229 acl-2013-Leveraging Synthetic Discourse Data via Multi-task Learning for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Man Lan ; Yu Xu ; Zhengyu Niu</p><p>Abstract: To overcome the shortage of labeled data for implicit discourse relation recognition, previous works attempted to automatically generate training data by removing explicit discourse connectives from sentences and then built models on these synthetic implicit examples. However, a previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed that models trained on these synthetic data do not generalize very well to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse data. In this work we revisit this issue and present a multi-task learning based system which can effectively use synthetic data for implicit discourse relation recognition. Results on PDTB data show that under the multi-task learning framework our models with the use of the prediction of explicit discourse connectives as auxiliary learning tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 improvement of 5.86% over baseline models.</p><p>6 0.80312049 <a title="158-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_user-centric_model_of_voting_intention_from_Social_Media.html">33 acl-2013-A user-centric model of voting intention from Social Media</a></p>

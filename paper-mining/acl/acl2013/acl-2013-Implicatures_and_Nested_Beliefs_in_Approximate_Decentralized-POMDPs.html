</p><p>5 As Grice conceived of them, implicatures crucially involve reasoning about multiply-nested belief structures: roughly, for p to count as an implicature, the speaker must believe that the listener will infer that the speaker believes p. [sent-6, score-1.466]

</p><p>19 In the model presented here, our agent models the other agent’s beliefs about the state of the world, and assumes that the other agent does not take into account our own beliefs, a common approach (Gmytrasiewicz and Doshi, 2005). [sent-34, score-0.458]
</p><p>20 Agents make decisions according to a policy πi : ∆(S) → A which maximizes the discounted expected reward Pt∞=0γtE[R(st, at1, at2)|b0,π1,π2]. [sent-35, score-0.101]
</p><p>21 Using tPhe assumption that the )o|tbher agent tracks one less lPevel of belief, we can solve for the other agent’s policy π¯, which allows us to estimate his actions and beliefs over time. [sent-36, score-0.434]

</p><p>25 To accomplish this, we factor the transition distribution into two terms: T((s0, s0) |a, π¯( s¯) , (s, s)) = T¯( s¯0|s0, a, π¯( s¯), (s, s))T(s0|a, π¯( s¯), (s, s)). [sent-45, score-0.073]

</p><p>29 A literal listener, denoted L, interprets messages according to this semantics, without taking into account the beliefs of the speaker. [sent-53, score-0.63]
</p><p>30 L assumes that the perceptual observations and messages are conditionally independent given the state of the world. [sent-54, score-0.183]
</p><p>31 Using Bayes’ rule, the literal listener’sjoint observation/message distribution is Pr((o, m) |s, s0, a) = Ω(o|s0, a) Pr(m|s)  = Ω(o|s0,a)Pm0Pr(sP|mr(s)|Pmr0()mP)r(m0)  (2)  The Pr(m) prior ovPer messages can be estimated from corpus data, but we use a uniform prior for  simplicity.

</p><p>33 (3)  The literal speaker does not model the beliefs of the listener. [sent-57, score-0.758]
</p><p>34 To interpret implicatures, a level-one listener, denoted L(S), models the beliefs a literal speaker must have had to produce an utterance: Pr(m|s) = 1 ¯πS(s) = m], where π¯S is the level[ one mlis|ste)n =er’ s1 [e¯ πstimate of the speaker’s policy. [sent-58, score-0.758]

</p><p>36 A level-one speaker, S(L), produces utterances to influence a literal listener, and a level-two listener, L(S(L)), uses two levels of belief nesting to interpret utterances as the beliefs that a level-one speaker might have to produce that utterance. [sent-61, score-1.096]

</p><p>42 In the next two sections we show how a level-one and level-two listener infer implicatures. [sent-70, score-0.46]
</p><p>43 1a is the scenario for a reference game of the sort pioneered by Rosenberg and Cohen (1964) and Dale and Reiter (1995). [sent-72, score-0.171]
</p><p>44 The speaker is assigned a referent ri (hidden from the listener) and produces a message on that basis. [sent-75, score-0.451]
</p><p>45 The speaker and listener share the goal of having the listener identify the speaker’s intended referent ri. [sent-76, score-1.264]
</p><p>46 However, the language and scenario facilitate scalar implicature (Horn, 1972; Harnish, 1979; Gazdar, 1979). [sent-81, score-0.347]
</p><p>47 Briefly, the scalar implicature pattern is that a speaker who is knowledgeable about the relevant domain will choose a communicatively weak utterance U over a communicatively stronger utterance U0 iff U0 is false (assuming U and U0 are relevant). [sent-82, score-0.788]
</p><p>48 The required sense of  communicative strength encompasses logical entailments as well as more particularized pragmatic partial orders (Hirschberg, 1985). [sent-83, score-0.097]
</p><p>49 In our scenario, ‘hat’ is stronger than ‘glasses’ : the referents wearing a hat are a proper subset of those wearing glasses. [sent-84, score-0.273]
</p><p>50 Thus, given the players’ goal, if the speaker says ‘glasses’, the listener should draw the scalar implicature that ‘hat’ is false. [sent-85, score-1.044]
</p><p>51 Similarly, though ‘moustache’ and ‘glasses’ do not literally stand in the specific–general relationship needed for scalar implicature, they do with ‘glasses’ pragmatically associated with r2 (Fig. [sent-88, score-0.107]
</p><p>52 The state space S encodes the attributes of the referents (e. [sent-91, score-0.125]
</p><p>53 , hat(r2) = T, glasses(r1) = F) and includes a target variable t identifying the speaker’s referent (hidden from the  listener). [sent-93, score-0.07]
</p><p>54 The speaker has three speech actions, identified with the three messages. [sent-94, score-0.274]
</p><p>55 The listener has four actions: ‘listen’ plus a ‘choose’ action ci for each referent ri. [sent-95, score-0.57]
</p><p>56 The set of observations O is just the set of messages (construed as utterances). [sent-96, score-0.119]
</p><p>57 The agents receive a positive reward iff the listener action ci corresponds to the speaker’s target t. [sent-97, score-0.737]
</p><p>58 Because this is a one-step reference game, the transition distribution T is the identity distribution. [sent-98, score-0.11]
</p><p>59 The literal listener L interprets utterances as a truth-conditional speaker would produce them (Fig. [sent-99, score-1.122]

</p><p>83 To show how the Dec-POMDP model delivers implicatures, we begin with a literal speaker S who does not consider the location of the other player and instead searches the board until he finds the card. [sent-186, score-0.645]

The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>6 0.067186996 <a title="190-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Annotation_of_regular_polysemy_and_underspecification.html">53 acl-2013-Annotation of regular polysemy and underspecification</a></p>

<p>Author: Hua He ; Denilson Barbosa ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Speaker identification is the task of at- tributing utterances to characters in a literary narrative. It is challenging to auto- mate because the speakers of the majority ofutterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.</p><p>3 0.6014834 <a title="190-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>4 0.60125929 <a title="190-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Is_word-to-phone_mapping_better_than_phone-phone_mapping_for_handling_English_words%3F.html">203 acl-2013-Is word-to-phone mapping better than phone-phone mapping for handling English words?</a></p>

<p>Author: Pedro Fialho ; Luisa Coheur ; Sergio Curto ; Pedro Claudio ; Angela Costa ; Alberto Abad ; Hugo Meinedo ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe a platform for embodied conversational agents with tutoring goals, which takes as input written and spoken questions and outputs answers in both forms. The platform is developed within a game environment, and currently allows speech recognition and synthesis in Portuguese, English and Spanish. In this paper we focus on its understanding component that supports in-domain interactions, and also small talk. Most indomain interactions are answered using different similarity metrics, which compare the perceived utterances with questions/sentences in the agent’s knowledge base; small-talk capabilities are mainly due to AIML, a language largely used by the chatbots’ community. In this paper we also introduce EDGAR, the butler of MONSERRATE, which was developed in the aforementioned platform, and that answers tourists’ questions about MONSERRATE.</p><p>6 0.50897276 <a title="190-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Evaluating_a_City_Exploration_Dialogue_System_with_Integrated_Question-Answering_and_Pedestrian_Navigation.html">141 acl-2013-Evaluating a City Exploration Dialogue System with Integrated Question-Answering and Pedestrian Navigation</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We cover classic military and diplomatic ciphers, automatic decipherment algorithms, unsolved ciphers, language translation as decipherment, and analyzing ancient writing as decipherment. 1 Tutorial Overview The first natural language processing systems had a straightforward goal: decipher coded messages sent by the enemy. Sixty years later, we have many more applications, including web search, question answering, summarization, speech recognition, and language translation. This tutorial explores connections between early decipherment research and today’s NLP work. We find that many ideas from the earlier era have become core to the field, while others still remain to be picked up and developed. We first cover classic military and diplomatic cipher types, including complex substitution ciphers implemented in the first electro-mechanical encryption machines. We look at mathematical tools (language recognition, frequency counting, smoothing) developed to decrypt such ciphers on proto-computers. We show algorithms and extensive empirical results for solving different types of ciphers, and we show the role of algorithms in recent decipherments of historical documents. We then look at how foreign language can be viewed as a code for English, a concept developed by Alan Turing and Warren Weaver. We describe recently published work on building automatic translation systems from non-parallel data. We also demonstrate how some of the same algorithmic tools can be applied to natural language tasks like part-of-speech tagging and word alignment. Turning back to historical ciphers, we explore a number of unsolved ciphers, giving results of initial computer experiments on several of them. Finally, we look briefly at writing as a way to encipher phoneme sequences, covering ancient scripts and modern applications. 2 Outline 1.

<p>Author: Enrique Alfonseca ; Daniele Pighin ; Guillermo Garrido</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents HEADY: a novel, abstractive approach for headline generation from news collections. From a web-scale corpus of English news, we mine syntactic patterns that a Noisy-OR model generalizes into event descriptions. At inference time, we query the model with the patterns observed in an unseen news collection, identify the event that better captures the gist of the collection and retrieve the most appropriate pattern to generate a headline. HEADY improves over a state-of-theart open-domain title abstraction method, bridging half of the gap that separates it from extractive methods using humangenerated titles in manual evaluations, and performs comparably to human-generated headlines as evaluated with ROUGE.</p><p>5 0.63306791 <a title="190-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>6 0.41154268 <a title="190-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>

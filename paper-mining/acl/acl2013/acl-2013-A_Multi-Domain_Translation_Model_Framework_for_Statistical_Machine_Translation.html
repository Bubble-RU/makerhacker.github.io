<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>3 0.21651711 <a title="11-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-The_Haves_and_the_Have-Nots%3A_Leveraging_Unlabelled_Corpora_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">345 acl-2013-The Haves and the Have-Nots: Leveraging Unlabelled Corpora for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Mo Yu ; Tiejun Zhao ; Yalong Bai ; Hao Tian ; Dianhai Yu</p><p>Abstract: Cross-lingual projection methods can benefit from resource-rich languages to improve performances of NLP tasks in resources-scarce languages. However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>5 0.20861064 <a title="11-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Keh-Yih Su</p><p>Abstract: Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in matched and unmatched regions, integrated models are proposed in this paper to incorporate TM information into phrase-based SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese–English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system. Be- . sides, the proposed models also outperform previous approaches significantly.</p><p>6 0.20513307 <a title="11-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Hierarchical_Phrase_Table_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">181 acl-2013-Hierarchical Phrase Table Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>3 0.74121684 <a title="11-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>

Within this context, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for NLP tasks.

<p>Author: Conghui Zhu ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Typical statistical machine translation systems are batch trained with a given training data and their performances are largely influenced by the amount of data. With the growth of the available data across different domains, it is computationally demanding to perform batch training every time when new data comes. In face of the problem, we propose an efficient phrase table combination method. In particular, we train a Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammars for each domain separately. The learned phrase tables are hierarchically combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The performance measured by BLEU is at least as comparable to the traditional batch training method. Furthermore, each phrase table is trained separately in each domain, and while computational overhead is significantly reduced by training them in parallel.</p><p>6 0.70047045 <a title="11-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Stacking_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">328 acl-2013-Stacking for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Shachar Mirkin ; Sriram Venkatapathy ; Marc Dymetman ; Ioan Calapodescu</p><p>Abstract: The quality of automatic translation is affected by many factors. One is the divergence between the specific source and target languages. Another lies in the source text itself, as some texts are more complex than others. One way to handle such texts is to modify them prior to translation. Yet, an important factor that is often overlooked is the source translatability with respect to the specific translation system and the specific model that are being used. In this paper we present an interactive system where source modifications are induced by confidence estimates that are derived from the translation model in use. Modifications are automatically generated and proposed for the user’s ap- proval. Such a system can reduce postediting effort, replacing it by cost-effective pre-editing that can be done by monolinguals.</p><p>2 0.95033866 <a title="11-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Categorization_of_Turkish_News_Documents_with_Morphological_Analysis.html">78 acl-2013-Categorization of Turkish News Documents with Morphological Analysis</a></p>

They are usually trained on humanannotated datasets, which are very costly due to its task-specific nature. We investigate active learning techniques to reduce the size of these datasets and thus annotation effort. Experiments on a number of datasets show that with as little as 25% of the training instances it is possible to obtain similar or superior performance compared to that of the complete datasets. In other words, our active learning query strategies can not only reduce annotation effort but can also result in better quality predictors. ,t .</p><p>same-paper 5 0.89884573 <a title="11-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>6 0.88198107 <a title="11-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Bridging_Languages_through_Etymology%3A_The_case_of_cross_language_text_categorization.html">72 acl-2013-Bridging Languages through Etymology: The case of cross language text categorization</a></p>

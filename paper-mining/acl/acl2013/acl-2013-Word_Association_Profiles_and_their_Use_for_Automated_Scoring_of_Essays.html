<p>Author: Isaac Persing ; Vincent Ng</p><p>Abstract: Recently, researchers have begun exploring methods of scoring student essays with respect to particular dimensions of quality such as coherence, technical errors, and relevance to prompt, but there is relatively little work on modeling thesis clarity. We present a new annotated corpus and propose a learning-based approach to scoring essays along the thesis clarity dimension. Additionally, in order to provide more valuable feedback on why an essay is scored as it is, we propose a second learning-based approach to identifying what kinds of errors an essay has that may lower its thesis clarity score.</p><p>3 0.12142321 <a title="389-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Reconstructing_an_Indo-European_Family_Tree_from_Non-native_English_Texts.html">299 acl-2013-Reconstructing an Indo-European Family Tree from Non-native English Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryo Nagata ; Edward Whittaker</p><p>Abstract: Mother tongue interference is the phenomenon where linguistic systems of a mother tongue are transferred to another language. Although there has been plenty of work on mother tongue interference, very little is known about how strongly it is transferred to another language and about what relation there is across mother tongues. To address these questions, this paper explores and visualizes mother tongue interference preserved in English texts written by Indo-European language speakers. This paper further explores linguistic features that explain why certain relations are preserved in English writing, and which contribute to related tasks such as native language identification.</p><p>4 0.10842697 <a title="389-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Lexical_Cohesion_Trigger_Model_for_Document-Level_Machine_Translation.html">69 acl-2013-Bilingual Lexical Cohesion Trigger Model for Document-Level Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Abdellah Fourtassi ; Emmanuel Dupoux</p><p>Abstract: Evaluation methods for Distributional Semantic Models typically rely on behaviorally derived gold standards. These methods are difficult to deploy in languages with scarce linguistic/behavioral resources. We introduce a corpus-based measure that evaluates the stability of the lexical semantic similarity space using a pseudo-synonym same-different detection task and no external resources. We show that it enables to predict two behaviorbased measures across a range of parameters in a Latent Semantic Analysis model.</p><p>6 0.078916058 <a title="389-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Graph-based_Local_Coherence_Modeling.html">172 acl-2013-Graph-based Local Coherence Modeling</a></p>

<p>Author: Alessandro Valitutti ; Hannu Toivonen ; Antoine Doucet ; Jukka M. Toivanen</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for automated generation of adult humor by lexical replacement and present empirical evaluation results of the obtained humor. We propose three types of lexical constraints as building blocks of humorous word substitution: constraints concerning the similarity of sounds or spellings of the original word and the substitute, a constraint requiring the substitute to be a taboo word, and constraints concerning the position and context of the replacement. Empirical evidence from extensive user studies indicates that these constraints can increase the effectiveness of humor generation significantly.</p><p>6 0.30035579 <a title="389-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Measuring_semantic_content_in_distributional_vectors.html">238 acl-2013-Measuring semantic content in distributional vectors</a></p>

<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Modern phrase-based machine translation systems make extensive use of wordbased translation models for inducing alignments from parallel corpora. This is problematic, as the systems are incapable of accurately modelling many translation phenomena that do not decompose into word-for-word translation. This paper presents a novel method for inducing phrase-based translation units directly from parallel data, which we frame as learning an inverse transduction grammar (ITG) using a recursive Bayesian prior. Overall this leads to a model which learns translations of entire sentences, while also learning their decomposition into smaller units (phrase-pairs) recursively, terminating at word translations. Our experiments on Arabic, Urdu and Farsi to English demonstrate improvements over competitive baseline systems.</p><p>3 0.80659592 <a title="389-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Qi Zhang ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: The growing need for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) is largely in a range of research and commercial applications. However, most of the currently Chinese NLP tools or components still have a wide range of issues need to be further improved and developed. FudanNLP is an open source toolkit for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) , which uses statistics-based and rule-based methods to deal with Chinese NLP tasks, such as word segmentation, part-ofspeech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, time phrase recognition, anaphora resolution and so on.</p><p>4 0.80634594 <a title="389-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Syntactic_Patterns_versus_Word_Alignment%3A_Extracting_Opinion_Targets_from_Online_Reviews.html">336 acl-2013-Syntactic Patterns versus Word Alignment: Extracting Opinion Targets from Online Reviews</a></p>
<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews. To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods. Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts. In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing. However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews. To fill this gap, this paper empiri- cally studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus. We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not. In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size.</p><p>5 0.80568993 <a title="389-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Implicatures_and_Nested_Beliefs_in_Approximate_Decentralized-POMDPs.html">190 acl-2013-Implicatures and Nested Beliefs in Approximate Decentralized-POMDPs</a></p>
<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Christopher Potts ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Conversational implicatures involve reasoning about multiply nested belief structures. This complexity poses significant challenges for computational models of conversation and cognition. We show that agents in the multi-agent DecentralizedPOMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a by-product of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility. Our simulations involve a reference game of the sort studied in psychology and linguistics as well as a dynamic, interactional scenario involving implemented artificial agents.</p><p>6 0.80519062 <a title="389-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_relatedness_benchmark_to_test_the_role_of_determiners_in_compositional_distributional_semantics.html">32 acl-2013-A relatedness benchmark to test the role of determiners in compositional distributional semantics</a></p>

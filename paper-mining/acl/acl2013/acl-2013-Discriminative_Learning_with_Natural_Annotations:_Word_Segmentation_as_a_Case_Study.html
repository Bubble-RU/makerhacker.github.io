<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>3 0.46200013 <a title="123-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>
<p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><p>4 0.4333137 <a title="123-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_on_Micro-blog_Using_Rich_Punctuations.html">193 acl-2013-Improving Chinese Word Segmentation on Micro-blog Using Rich Punctuations</a></p>
<p>Author: Longkai Zhang ; Li Li ; Zhengyan He ; Houfeng Wang ; Ni Sun</p><p>Abstract: Micro-blog is a new kind of medium which is short and informal. While no segmented corpus of micro-blogs is available to train Chinese word segmentation model, existing Chinese word segmentation tools cannot perform equally well as in ordinary news texts. In this paper we present an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation of micro-blog. In our approach, we incorporate punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data by introducing characters behind or ahead of punctuations, for they indicate the beginning or end of words. Meanwhile a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances is also used, which prove to be helpful. Ex- periments on micro-blog data show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. 1 INTRODUCTION Micro-blog (also known as tweets in English) is a new kind of broadcast medium in the form of blogging. A micro-blog differs from a traditional blog in that it is typically smaller in size. Furthermore, texts in micro-blogs tend to be informal and new words occur more frequently. These new features of micro-blogs make the Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) models trained on the source domain, such as news corpus, fail to perform equally well when transferred to texts from micro-blogs. For example, the most widely used Chinese segmenter ”ICTCLAS” yields 0.95 f-score in news corpus, only gets 0.82 f-score on micro-blog data. The poor segmentation results will hurt subsequent analysis on micro-blog text. ∗Corresponding author Manually labeling the texts of micro-blog is time consuming. Luckily, punctuations provide useful information because they are used as indicators of the end of previous sentence and the beginning of the next one, which also indicate the start and the end of a word. These ”natural boundaries” appear so frequently in micro-blog texts that we can easily make good use of them. TABLE 1 shows some statistics of the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. Besides, English letters and digits are also more than those in news corpus. They all are natural delimiters of Chinese characters and we treat them just the same as punctuations. We propose a method to enlarge the training corpus by using punctuation information. We build a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework which can iteratively incorporate newly labeled instances from unlabeled micro-blog data during the training process. We test our method on microblog texts and experiments show good results. This paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we introduce the problem. Section 2 gives detailed description of our approach. We show the experi- ment and analyze the results in section 3. Section 4 gives the related works and in section 5 we conclude the whole work. 2 Our method 2.1 Punctuations Chinese word segmentation problem might be treated as a character labeling problem which gives each character a label indicating its position in one word. To be simple, one can use label ’B’ to indicate a character is the beginning of a word, and use ’N’ to indicate a character is not the beginning of a word. We also use the 2-tag in our work. Other tag sets like the ’BIES’ tag set are not suiteable because the puctuation information cannot decide whether a character after punctuation should be labeled as ’B’ or ’S’(word with Single 177 ProceedingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An uuaglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioinngauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgicess 177–182, micNreow-bslogC68h56i. n73e%%seE10n1.g6.8l%i%shN20u. m76%%berPu1n13c9.t u03a%%tion Table 1: Percentage of Chinese, English, number, punctuation in the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. character). Punctuations can serve as implicit labels for the characters before and after them. The character right after punctuations must be the first character of a word, meanwhile the character right before punctuations must be the last character of a word. An example is given in TABLE 2. 2.2 Algorithm Our algorithm “ADD-N” is shown in TABLE 3. The initially selected character instances are those right after punctuations. By definition they are all labeled with ’B’ . In this case, the number of training instances with label ’B’ is increased while the number with label ’N’ remains unchanged. Because of this, the model trained on this unbalanced corpus tends to be biased. This problem can become even worse when there is inexhaustible supply of texts from the target domain. We assume that labeled corpus of the source domain can be treated as a balanced reflection of different labels. Therefore we choose to estimate the balanced point by counting characters labeling ’B’ and ’N’ and calculate the ratio which we denote as η . We assume the enlarged corpus is also balanced if and only if the ratio of ’B’ to ’N’ is just the same to η of the source domain. Our algorithm uses data from source domain to make the labels balanced. When enlarging corpus using characters behind punctuations from texts in target domain, only characters labeling ’B’ are added. We randomly reuse some characters labeling ’N’ from labeled data until ratio η is reached. We do not use characters ahead of punctuations, because the single-character words ahead of punctuations take the label of ’B’ instead of ’N’ . In summary our algorithm tackles the problem by duplicating labeled data in source domain. We denote our algorithm as ”ADD-N”. We also use baseline feature templates include the features described in previous works (Sun and Xu, 2011; Sun et al., 2012). Our algorithm is not necessarily limited to a specific tagger. For simplicity and reliability, we use a simple MaximumEntropy tagger. 3 Experiment 3.1 Data set We evaluate our method using the data from weibo.com, which is the biggest micro-blog service in China. We use the API provided by weibo.com1 to crawl 500,000 micro-blog texts of weibo.com, which contains 24,243,772 characters. To keep the experiment tractable, we first randomly choose 50,000 of all the texts as unlabeled data, which contain 2,420,037 characters. We manually segment 2038 randomly selected microblogs.We follow the segmentation standard as the PKU corpus. In micro-blog texts, the user names and URLs have fixed format. User names start with ’ @ ’, followed by Chinese characters, English letters, numbers and ’ ’, and terminated when meeting punctuations or blanks. URLs also match fixed patterns, which are shortened using ”http : / /t . cn /” plus six random English letters or numbers. Thus user names and URLs can be pre-processed separately. We follow this principle in following experiments. We use the benchmark datasets provided by the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff2 as the labeled data. We choose the PKU data in our experiment because our baseline methods use the same segmentation standard. We compare our method with three baseline methods. The first two are both famous Chinese word segmentation tools: ICTCLAS3 and Stanford Chinese word segmenter4, which are widely used in NLP related to word segmentation. Stanford Chinese word segmenter is a CRF-based segmentation tool and its segmentation standard is chosen as the PKU standard, which is the same to ours. ICTCLAS, on the other hand, is a HMMbased Chinese word segmenter. Another baseline is Li and Sun (2009), which also uses punctuation in their semi-supervised framework.

The recall of out-of-vocabulary is also taken into consideration, which measures the ability of the model to correctly segment out of vocabulary words. 3.2 Main results methods on the development data. TABLE 4 summarizes the segmentation results. In TABLE 4, Li-Sun is the method in Li and Sun (2009). Maxent only uses the PKU data for training, with neither punctuation information nor self-training framework incorporated. The next 4 methods all require a 100 iteration of self-training. No-punc is the method that only uses self-training while no punctuation information is added. Nobalance is similar to ADD N. The only difference between No-balance and ADD-N is that the former does not balance label ’B’ and label ’N’ . The comparison of Maxent and No-punctuation shows that naively adding confident unlabeled instances does not guarantee to improve performance. The writing style and word formation of the source domain is different from target domain. When segmenting texts of the target domain using models trained on source domain, the performance will be hurt with more false segmented instances added into the training set. The comparison of Maxent, No-balance and ADD-N shows that considering punctuation as well as self-training does improve performance. Both the f-score and OOV-recall increase. By comparing No-balance and ADD-N alone we can find that we achieve relatively high f-score if we ignore tag balance issue, while slightly hurt the OOV-Recall. However, considering it will improve OOV-Recall by about +1.6% and the fscore +0.2%. We also experimented on different size of unlabeled data to evaluate the performance when adding unlabeled target domain data. TABLE 5 shows different f-scores and OOV-Recalls on different unlabeled data set. We note that when the number of texts changes from 0 to 50,000, the f-score and OOV both are improved. However, when unlabeled data changes to 200,000, the performance is a bit decreased, while still better than not using unlabeled data. This result comes from the fact that the method ’ADD-N’ only uses characters behind punctua179 Tabl152S0eiz 0:Segm0.8nP67ta245ion0p.8Rer6745f9om0a.8nF57c6e1witOh0 .d7Vi65f-2394Rernt size of unlabeled data tions from target domain. Taking more texts into consideration means selecting more characters labeling ’N’ from source domain to simulate those in target domain. If too many ’N’s are introduced, the training data will be biased against the true distribution of target domain. 3.3 Characters ahead of punctuations In the ”BN” tagging method mentioned above, we incorporate characters after punctuations from texts in micro-blog to enlarge training set.We also try an opposite approach, ”EN” tag, which uses ’E’ to represent ”End of word”, and ’N’ to rep- resent ”Not the end of word”. In this contrasting method, we only use charactersjust ahead ofpunctuations. We find that the two methods show similar results. Experiment results with ADD-N are shown in TABLE 6 . 5DU0an0lt a b0Tsiealzbe lde6:0.C8Fo7”m5BNpa”rO0itsOa.o7gVn7-3oRfBN0.8aFn”7E0dNEN”Ot0.aO.g7V6-3R 4 Related Work Recent studies show that character sequence labeling is an effective formulation of Chinese word segmentation (Low et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2006a,b; Chen et al., 2006; Xue, 2003). These supervised methods show good results, however, are unable to incorporate information from new domain, where OOV problem is a big challenge for the research community. On the other hand unsupervised word segmentation Peng and Schuurmans (2001); Goldwater et al. (2006); Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006); Feng et al. (2004); Maosong et al. (1998) takes advantage of the huge amount of raw text to solve Chinese word segmentation problems. However, they usually are less accurate and more complicated than supervised ones. Meanwhile semi-supervised methods have been applied into NLP applications. Bickel et al. (2007) learns a scaling factor from data of source domain and use the distribution to resemble target domain distribution. Wu et al. (2009) uses a Domain adaptive bootstrapping (DAB) framework, which shows good results on Named Entity Recognition. Similar semi-supervised applications include Shen et al. (2004); Daum e´ III and Marcu (2006); Jiang and Zhai (2007); Weinberger et al. (2006). Besides, Sun and Xu (201 1) uses a sequence labeling framework, while unsupervised statistics are used as discrete features in their model, which prove to be effective in Chinese word segmentation. There are previous works using punctuations as implicit annotations. Riley (1989) uses it in sentence boundary detection. Li and Sun (2009) proposed a compromising solution to by using a clas- sifier to select the most confident characters. We do not follow this approach because the initial errors will dramatically harm the performance. Instead, we only add the characters after punctuations which are sure to be the beginning of words (which means labeling ’B’) into our training set. Sun and Xu (201 1) uses punctuation information as discrete feature in a sequence labeling framework, which shows improvement compared to the pure sequence labeling approach. Our method is different from theirs. We use characters after punctuations directly. 5 Conclusion In this paper we have presented an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation on micro-blog texts. In our approach, punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data is used, as well as a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances. Experiments show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. Both the punctuation information and the self-training phase contribute to this improve- ment.

<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>6 0.30657375 <a title="123-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>

<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>2 0.91707963 <a title="123-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>3 0.90122199 <a title="123-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_on_Micro-blog_Using_Rich_Punctuations.html">193 acl-2013-Improving Chinese Word Segmentation on Micro-blog Using Rich Punctuations</a></p>
<p>Author: Longkai Zhang ; Li Li ; Zhengyan He ; Houfeng Wang ; Ni Sun</p><p>Abstract: Micro-blog is a new kind of medium which is short and informal. While no segmented corpus of micro-blogs is available to train Chinese word segmentation model, existing Chinese word segmentation tools cannot perform equally well as in ordinary news texts. In this paper we present an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation of micro-blog. In our approach, we incorporate punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data by introducing characters behind or ahead of punctuations, for they indicate the beginning or end of words. Meanwhile a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances is also used, which prove to be helpful. Ex- periments on micro-blog data show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. 1 INTRODUCTION Micro-blog (also known as tweets in English) is a new kind of broadcast medium in the form of blogging. A micro-blog differs from a traditional blog in that it is typically smaller in size. Furthermore, texts in micro-blogs tend to be informal and new words occur more frequently. These new features of micro-blogs make the Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) models trained on the source domain, such as news corpus, fail to perform equally well when transferred to texts from micro-blogs. For example, the most widely used Chinese segmenter ”ICTCLAS” yields 0.95 f-score in news corpus, only gets 0.82 f-score on micro-blog data. The poor segmentation results will hurt subsequent analysis on micro-blog text. ∗Corresponding author Manually labeling the texts of micro-blog is time consuming. Luckily, punctuations provide useful information because they are used as indicators of the end of previous sentence and the beginning of the next one, which also indicate the start and the end of a word. These ”natural boundaries” appear so frequently in micro-blog texts that we can easily make good use of them. TABLE 1 shows some statistics of the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. Besides, English letters and digits are also more than those in news corpus. They all are natural delimiters of Chinese characters and we treat them just the same as punctuations. We propose a method to enlarge the training corpus by using punctuation information. We build a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework which can iteratively incorporate newly labeled instances from unlabeled micro-blog data during the training process. We test our method on microblog texts and experiments show good results. This paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we introduce the problem. Section 2 gives detailed description of our approach. We show the experi- ment and analyze the results in section 3. Section 4 gives the related works and in section 5 we conclude the whole work. 2 Our method 2.1 Punctuations Chinese word segmentation problem might be treated as a character labeling problem which gives each character a label indicating its position in one word. To be simple, one can use label ’B’ to indicate a character is the beginning of a word, and use ’N’ to indicate a character is not the beginning of a word. We also use the 2-tag in our work. Other tag sets like the ’BIES’ tag set are not suiteable because the puctuation information cannot decide whether a character after punctuation should be labeled as ’B’ or ’S’(word with Single 177 ProceedingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An uuaglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioinngauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgicess 177–182, micNreow-bslogC68h56i. n73e%%seE10n1.g6.8l%i%shN20u. m76%%berPu1n13c9.t u03a%%tion Table 1: Percentage of Chinese, English, number, punctuation in the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. character). Punctuations can serve as implicit labels for the characters before and after them. The character right after punctuations must be the first character of a word, meanwhile the character right before punctuations must be the last character of a word. An example is given in TABLE 2. 2.2 Algorithm Our algorithm “ADD-N” is shown in TABLE 3. The initially selected character instances are those right after punctuations. By definition they are all labeled with ’B’ . In this case, the number of training instances with label ’B’ is increased while the number with label ’N’ remains unchanged. Because of this, the model trained on this unbalanced corpus tends to be biased. This problem can become even worse when there is inexhaustible supply of texts from the target domain. We assume that labeled corpus of the source domain can be treated as a balanced reflection of different labels. Therefore we choose to estimate the balanced point by counting characters labeling ’B’ and ’N’ and calculate the ratio which we denote as η . We assume the enlarged corpus is also balanced if and only if the ratio of ’B’ to ’N’ is just the same to η of the source domain. Our algorithm uses data from source domain to make the labels balanced. When enlarging corpus using characters behind punctuations from texts in target domain, only characters labeling ’B’ are added. We randomly reuse some characters labeling ’N’ from labeled data until ratio η is reached. We do not use characters ahead of punctuations, because the single-character words ahead of punctuations take the label of ’B’ instead of ’N’ . In summary our algorithm tackles the problem by duplicating labeled data in source domain. We denote our algorithm as ”ADD-N”. We also use baseline feature templates include the features described in previous works (Sun and Xu, 2011; Sun et al., 2012). Our algorithm is not necessarily limited to a specific tagger. For simplicity and reliability, we use a simple MaximumEntropy tagger. 3 Experiment 3.1 Data set We evaluate our method using the data from weibo.com, which is the biggest micro-blog service in China. We use the API provided by weibo.com1 to crawl 500,000 micro-blog texts of weibo.com, which contains 24,243,772 characters. To keep the experiment tractable, we first randomly choose 50,000 of all the texts as unlabeled data, which contain 2,420,037 characters. We manually segment 2038 randomly selected microblogs.We follow the segmentation standard as the PKU corpus. In micro-blog texts, the user names and URLs have fixed format. User names start with ’ @ ’, followed by Chinese characters, English letters, numbers and ’ ’, and terminated when meeting punctuations or blanks. URLs also match fixed patterns, which are shortened using ”http : / /t . cn /” plus six random English letters or numbers. Thus user names and URLs can be pre-processed separately. We follow this principle in following experiments. We use the benchmark datasets provided by the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff2 as the labeled data. We choose the PKU data in our experiment because our baseline methods use the same segmentation standard. We compare our method with three baseline methods. The first two are both famous Chinese word segmentation tools: ICTCLAS3 and Stanford Chinese word segmenter4, which are widely used in NLP related to word segmentation. Stanford Chinese word segmenter is a CRF-based segmentation tool and its segmentation standard is chosen as the PKU standard, which is the same to ours. ICTCLAS, on the other hand, is a HMMbased Chinese word segmenter. Another baseline is Li and Sun (2009), which also uses punctuation in their semi-supervised framework.

The recall of out-of-vocabulary is also taken into consideration, which measures the ability of the model to correctly segment out of vocabulary words. 3.2 Main results methods on the development data. TABLE 4 summarizes the segmentation results. In TABLE 4, Li-Sun is the method in Li and Sun (2009). Maxent only uses the PKU data for training, with neither punctuation information nor self-training framework incorporated. The next 4 methods all require a 100 iteration of self-training. No-punc is the method that only uses self-training while no punctuation information is added. Nobalance is similar to ADD N. The only difference between No-balance and ADD-N is that the former does not balance label ’B’ and label ’N’ . The comparison of Maxent and No-punctuation shows that naively adding confident unlabeled instances does not guarantee to improve performance. The writing style and word formation of the source domain is different from target domain. When segmenting texts of the target domain using models trained on source domain, the performance will be hurt with more false segmented instances added into the training set. The comparison of Maxent, No-balance and ADD-N shows that considering punctuation as well as self-training does improve performance. Both the f-score and OOV-recall increase. By comparing No-balance and ADD-N alone we can find that we achieve relatively high f-score if we ignore tag balance issue, while slightly hurt the OOV-Recall. However, considering it will improve OOV-Recall by about +1.6% and the fscore +0.2%. We also experimented on different size of unlabeled data to evaluate the performance when adding unlabeled target domain data. TABLE 5 shows different f-scores and OOV-Recalls on different unlabeled data set. We note that when the number of texts changes from 0 to 50,000, the f-score and OOV both are improved. However, when unlabeled data changes to 200,000, the performance is a bit decreased, while still better than not using unlabeled data. This result comes from the fact that the method ’ADD-N’ only uses characters behind punctua179 Tabl152S0eiz 0:Segm0.8nP67ta245ion0p.8Rer6745f9om0a.8nF57c6e1witOh0 .d7Vi65f-2394Rernt size of unlabeled data tions from target domain. Taking more texts into consideration means selecting more characters labeling ’N’ from source domain to simulate those in target domain. If too many ’N’s are introduced, the training data will be biased against the true distribution of target domain. 3.3 Characters ahead of punctuations In the ”BN” tagging method mentioned above, we incorporate characters after punctuations from texts in micro-blog to enlarge training set.We also try an opposite approach, ”EN” tag, which uses ’E’ to represent ”End of word”, and ’N’ to rep- resent ”Not the end of word”. In this contrasting method, we only use charactersjust ahead ofpunctuations. We find that the two methods show similar results. Experiment results with ADD-N are shown in TABLE 6 . 5DU0an0lt a b0Tsiealzbe lde6:0.C8Fo7”m5BNpa”rO0itsOa.o7gVn7-3oRfBN0.8aFn”7E0dNEN”Ot0.aO.g7V6-3R 4 Related Work Recent studies show that character sequence labeling is an effective formulation of Chinese word segmentation (Low et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2006a,b; Chen et al., 2006; Xue, 2003). These supervised methods show good results, however, are unable to incorporate information from new domain, where OOV problem is a big challenge for the research community. On the other hand unsupervised word segmentation Peng and Schuurmans (2001); Goldwater et al. (2006); Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006); Feng et al. (2004); Maosong et al. (1998) takes advantage of the huge amount of raw text to solve Chinese word segmentation problems. However, they usually are less accurate and more complicated than supervised ones. Meanwhile semi-supervised methods have been applied into NLP applications. Bickel et al. (2007) learns a scaling factor from data of source domain and use the distribution to resemble target domain distribution. Wu et al. (2009) uses a Domain adaptive bootstrapping (DAB) framework, which shows good results on Named Entity Recognition. Similar semi-supervised applications include Shen et al. (2004); Daum e´ III and Marcu (2006); Jiang and Zhai (2007); Weinberger et al. (2006). Besides, Sun and Xu (201 1) uses a sequence labeling framework, while unsupervised statistics are used as discrete features in their model, which prove to be effective in Chinese word segmentation. There are previous works using punctuations as implicit annotations. Riley (1989) uses it in sentence boundary detection. Li and Sun (2009) proposed a compromising solution to by using a clas- sifier to select the most confident characters. We do not follow this approach because the initial errors will dramatically harm the performance. Instead, we only add the characters after punctuations which are sure to be the beginning of words (which means labeling ’B’) into our training set. Sun and Xu (201 1) uses punctuation information as discrete feature in a sequence labeling framework, which shows improvement compared to the pure sequence labeling approach. Our method is different from theirs. We use characters after punctuations directly. 5 Conclusion In this paper we have presented an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation on micro-blog texts. In our approach, punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data is used, as well as a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances. Experiments show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. Both the punctuation information and the self-training phase contribute to this improve- ment.

<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>5 0.82578951 <a title="123-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>
<p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><p>6 0.79446048 <a title="123-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Informal_Language_from_Chinese_Microtext%3A_Joint_Word_Recognition_and_Segmentation.html">243 acl-2013-Mining Informal Language from Chinese Microtext: Joint Word Recognition and Segmentation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiang Li ; Wenbin Jiang ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an effective algorithm of annotation adaptation for constituency treebanks, which transforms a treebank from one annotation guideline to another with an iterative optimization procedure, thus to build a much larger treebank to train an enhanced parser without increasing model complexity. Experiments show that the transformed Tsinghua Chinese Treebank as additional training data brings significant improvement over the baseline trained on Penn Chinese Treebank only.</p><p>2 0.89220554 <a title="123-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Bilingually-Guided_Monolingual_Dependency_Grammar_Induction.html">70 acl-2013-Bilingually-Guided Monolingual Dependency Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Liu ; Yajuan Lu ; Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel strategy for automatic induction of a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency. By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>3 0.88847673 <a title="123-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Subtree_Extractive_Summarization_via_Submodular_Maximization.html">332 acl-2013-Subtree Extractive Summarization via Submodular Maximization</a></p>
<p>Author: Hajime Morita ; Ryohei Sasano ; Hiroya Takamura ; Manabu Okumura</p><p>Abstract: This study proposes a text summarization model that simultaneously performs sentence extraction and compression. We translate the text summarization task into a problem of extracting a set of dependency subtrees in the document cluster. We also encode obligatory case constraints as must-link dependency constraints in order to guarantee the readability of the generated summary. In order to handle the subtree extraction problem, we investigate a new class of submodular maximization problem, and a new algorithm that has the approximation ratio 21 (1 − e−1). Our experiments with the NTC(1IR − −A eCLIA test collections show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p><p>4 0.88845801 <a title="123-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Transition-Based_Dependency_Parser_Using_a_Dynamic_Parsing_Strategy.html">26 acl-2013-A Transition-Based Dependency Parser Using a Dynamic Parsing Strategy</a></p>
<p>Author: Francesco Sartorio ; Giorgio Satta ; Joakim Nivre</p><p>Abstract: We present a novel transition-based, greedy dependency parser which implements a flexible mix of bottom-up and top-down strategies. The new strategy allows the parser to postpone difficult decisions until the relevant information becomes available. The novel parser has a ∼12% error reduction in unlabeled attach∼ment score over an arc-eager parser, with a slow-down factor of 2.8.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.88825119 <a title="123-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>6 0.88487864 <a title="123-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Recognizing_Partial_Textual_Entailment.html">297 acl-2013-Recognizing Partial Textual Entailment</a></p>

</p><p>5 1 Introduction Following the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigm from cloud computing (Dikaiakos et al. [sent-9, score-0.196]

</p><p>7 These provide information extraction services, accessible programmatically and charged per number of documents processed. [sent-13, score-0.025]

</p><p>11 Additionally, these text processing SaaS sites come with daily rate limits, in terms of number of API calls or documents that can be processed. [sent-25, score-0.025]
</p><p>12 Consequently, using these services for research is not just limited in terms of text processing functionality offered, but also quickly becomes very expensive on large-scale datasets. [sent-26, score-0.318]

[sent-29, score-0.794]
</p><p>15 In the context of traditional NLP research and development, and pre-dating cloud computing, similar needs were addressed through NLP infrastructures, such as GATE (Cunningham et al. [sent-30, score-0.196]
</p><p>16 These infrastructures accelerated significantly the pace of NLP research, through reusable algorithms (e. [sent-32, score-0.084]
</p><p>17 rule-based pattern matching engines, machine learning algorithms), free tools for low-level NLP tasks, and support for multiple input and output document formats (e. [sent-34, score-0.058]

</p><p>20 It gives researchers access to an open, standard-  compliant NLP infrastructure and enables them 3At the time of writing, a beta version of AnnoMarket is available at http://annomarket. [sent-39, score-0.199]
</p><p>21 It supports not only NLP algorithm development and execution, but also ondemand collaborative corpus annotation and performance evaluation. [sent-43, score-0.196]
</p><p>22 Important infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently for the researcher: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance. [sent-44, score-0.49]
</p><p>23 In that sense, it combines the ease of use of an NLP SaaS with the openness and comprehensive facilities of the GATE NLP infrastructure. [sent-50, score-0.045]
</p><p>24 Additionally, as a specialised NLP PaaS, it also supports a bring-your-own-pipeline option, which can be built easily by reusing pre-existing GATEcompatible NLP components and adding some new ones. [sent-52, score-0.048]
</p><p>25 Moreover, in addition to offering entity extraction services like OpenCalais, our NLP PaaS also supports manual corpus annotation, semantic indexing and search, and performance evaluation. [sent-53, score-0.33]

</p><p>30 2  The AnnoMarket NLP PaaS  This section first discusses the methodology underpinning the AnnoMarket platform, then presents its architecture and key components. [sent-61, score-0.046]
</p><p>31 1 Development and Deployment Methodology The development of text analysis algorithms and pipelines typically follows a certain methodological pattern, or lifecycle. [sent-63, score-0.147]
</p><p>32 It is common to use double or triple annotation, where several people perform the annotation task independently and we then measure their level of agreement (Inter-Annotator Agreement, or IAA) to quantify and control the quality of this data (Hovy, 2010). [sent-65, score-0.113]
</p><p>33 The AnnoMarket platform was therefore designed to offer full methodological support for all  stages of the text analysis development lifecycle: 1. [sent-66, score-0.322]
</p><p>34 Create an initial prototype of the NLP pipeline, testing on a small document collection, using the desktop-based GATE user interface (Cunningham et al. [sent-67, score-0.105]
</p><p>35 If required, collect a gold-standard corpus for evaluation and/or training, using the GATE Teamware collaborative corpus annotation service (Bontcheva et al. [sent-69, score-0.28]
</p><p>36 Evaluate the performance of the automatic pipeline on the gold standard (either locally in the GATE development environment or on the cloud). [sent-71, score-0.063]
</p><p>37 Return to step 1for further development and evaluation cycles, as needed. [sent-72, score-0.023]
</p><p>38 Upload the large datasets and deploy the NLP pipeline on the AnnoMarket PaaS; 5. [sent-74, score-0.101]
</p><p>39 Run the large-scale NLP experiment and download the results as XML or a standard linguistic annotation format (Ide and Romary, 2004). [sent-75, score-0.171]
</p><p>40 AnnoMarket also offers scalable semantic indexing and search over the linguistic annotations and document content. [sent-76, score-0.102]
</p><p>41 AnnoMarket is fully compatible with the GATE open-source architecture (Cunningham et al. [sent-79, score-0.046]
</p><p>42 , 2002), in order to benefit from GATEâ€™s numerous reusable and multilingual text processing components, and also from its infrastructural support for linguistic standards and diverse input formats. [sent-80, score-0.08]
</p><p>43 2  Architecture  The architecture of the AnnoMarket PaaS comprises of four layers (see Figure 1), combining 20  Figure 1: The AnnoMarket Architecture components with related capabilities. [sent-82, score-0.071]
</p><p>44 The fourth, web user interface layer, contains a number of UI components that allow researchers to use the AnnoMarket platform in various ways, â€“  â€“  e. [sent-88, score-0.38]
</p><p>45 to run an already deployed text annotation service on a large dataset, to deploy and share a new service on the platform, or to upload (and optionally share) a document collection (i. [sent-90, score-0.796]
</p><p>46 There is also support for finding relevant services, deployed on the AnnoMarket platform. [sent-93, score-0.112]
</p><p>47 Lastly, due to the platform running on the Amazon cloud infrastructure, there are account management interfaces, including billing information, payments, and usage reports. [sent-94, score-0.577]
</p><p>48 The first vertical aspect is cloud deployment on Amazon. [sent-95, score-0.351]
</p><p>49 This covers support for automatic up and down-scaling of the allocated Amazon resources, detection of and recovery from Amazon infrastructure failures and network failures, and data backup. [sent-96, score-0.134]
</p><p>50 Usage monitoring and billing is the second key vertical aspect, since fine-grained pay-asyou-go ability is essential. [sent-97, score-0.086]
</p><p>51 Even in the case of freely-available annotations services, Amazon usage charges are incurred and thus such functionality is needed. [sent-98, score-0.075]
</p><p>52 Various usage metrics are monitored and metered so that proper billing can be  guaranteed, including: storage space required by language resources and data sets; CPU utilisation ofthe annotation services; number and size ofdocuments processed. [sent-99, score-0.29]
</p><p>53 In addition, we have implemented a REST programming API for AnnoMarket, so that data upload and download and running of annotation services can all be done automatically, outside of the web interface. [sent-101, score-0.616]
</p><p>54 crawled web content, usersâ€™ own corpora (private or shared with others), results from running the annotation services, etc. [sent-108, score-0.15]
</p><p>55 , XML, HTML, JSON, PDF, DOC), based on GATEâ€™s comprehensive format support. [sent-111, score-0.028]
</p><p>56 In all cases, when a document is being processed by AnnoMarket, the format is analysed and converted into a single unified, graph-based model of annotation: the one of the GATE NLP framework (Cunningham et al. [sent-112, score-0.063]
</p><p>57 Then this internal annotation format is also used by the collaborative corpus annotation web tool, and for annotation indexing and search. [sent-114, score-0.44]
</p><p>58 S3 provides a REST service for content access, as well as direct HTTP access, which provides an easy way for AnnoMarket users to upload and download content. [sent-117, score-0.36]
</p><p>59 While stored on the cloud, data is protected by  Amazonâ€™s security procedures. [sent-118, score-0.056]
</p><p>60 All transfers between the cloud storage, the annotation services, and the userâ€™s computer are done via an encrypted channel, using SSL. [sent-119, score-0.309]
</p><p>61 4 The Platform Layer The AnnoMarket platform provides an environment where text processing applications can be deployed as annotation services on the cloud. [sent-121, score-0.75]
</p><p>62 It allows processing pipelines that were produced on a 21  Figure 2: Web-based Job Editor  developerâ€™s stand-alone computer to be deployed seamlessly on distributed hardware resources (the compute cloud) with the aim of processing large amounts of data in a timely fashion. [sent-122, score-0.25]
</p><p>63 This process needs to be resilient in the face of failures at the level of the cloud infrastructure, the network com-  munication, errors in the processing pipeline and in the input data. [sent-123, score-0.304]
</p><p>64 The platform layer determines the optimal number of virtual machines for running a given NLP application, given the size of the document collection to be processed and taking into account the overhead in starting up new virtual machines on demand. [sent-124, score-0.628]
</p><p>65 The implementation is designed to be robust in the face of hardware failures and processing errors. [sent-125, score-0.102]
</p><p>66 Users can upload any pipelines compliant with the GATE Processing Resource (PR) model and these are automatically deployed as annotation services on the AnnoMarket platform. [sent-130, score-0.785]
</p><p>67 5  Annotation Services  As discussed above, the platform layer in AnnoMarket addresses most of the technical and methodological requirements towards the NLP  PaaS, making  the deployment,  execution,  and  sharing of annotation services (i. [sent-132, score-0.807]

</p><p>69 e While the job is running, a regularly updated execution log is made available in the userâ€™s dashboard. [sent-136, score-0.078]
</p><p>70 Upon job completion, an email notification is also sent. [sent-137, score-0.041]
</p><p>71 Most ofthe implementation details are hidden away from the user, who interacts with the system through a web-based job editor, depicted in Figure 2, or through a REST API. [sent-138, score-0.041]
</p><p>72 The number of already deployed annotation services on the platform is growing continuously. [sent-139, score-0.75]
</p><p>73 Figure 3 shows a subset of them, as well as the metadata tags associated with these services, so that users can quickly restrict which types of ser-  vices they are after and then be shown only the relevant subset. [sent-140, score-0.035]
</p><p>74 At the time of writing, there are services of the following kinds: â€¢ Part-of-Speech-Taggers for English, German, Dutch, -aSnpde Hungarian. [sent-141, score-0.271]
</p><p>75 The deployment of new annotation services is done via a web interface (see Figure 4), where an administrator needs to configure some basic details related to the utilisation of the platform layer and provide a self-contained GATE-compatible application. [sent-150, score-1.005]
</p><p>76 Platform users can only publish their own annotation services by contacting an administrator, who can validate the provided pipeline before making it publicly available to the other users. [sent-151, score-0.459]
</p><p>77 This step is intended to protect the users community from malicious or poor quality pipelines. [sent-152, score-0.035]
</p><p>78 3 Search and Browsing of Annotated Corpora The AnnoMarket platform also includes a service for indexing and searching over a collection of semantically annotated documents. [sent-153, score-0.469]
</p><p>79 The output of an annotation service (see Figure 2) can be fed directly into a search index, which is created as the service is run on the documents. [sent-154, score-0.404]
</p><p>80 This provides fa-  cilities for searching over different views of document text, for example one can search the documentâ€™s words, the part-of-speech of those words, or their morphological roots. [sent-155, score-0.091]
</p><p>81 As well as searching the document text, we also support searches over the documentsâ€™ semantic annotations, e. [sent-156, score-0.06]
</p><p>82 Figure 5 shows a semantic search over 80,000 news web pages from the BBC. [sent-159, score-0.031]
</p><p>83 They have first been pre-processed with the POS tagging, morphological analysis, and NER services on the platform and the output indexed automatically. [sent-160, score-0.525]
</p><p>84 The search query is for documents, where entities of type Person are followed by any morphological form of the verb say, i. [sent-161, score-0.031]
</p><p>85 4  Conclusion  This paper described a cloud-based open platform for text mining, which aims to assist the development and deployment of robust, large-scale text processing applications. [sent-164, score-0.433]
</p><p>86 By supporting the shar-  ing of annotation pipelines, AnnoMarket also pro23  Figure 5: Example Semantic Search Results  motes reuse and repeatability of experiments. [sent-165, score-0.113]
</p><p>87 As the number of annotation services offered by the platform has grown, we identified a need for service search, so that users can locate useful NLP services more effectively. [sent-166, score-1.101]
</p><p>88 We are currently developing a new UI, which offers search and browsing functionality, alongside various criteria, such as functionality (e. [sent-167, score-0.132]
</p><p>89 POS tagger, named entity recogniser), user ratings, natural language supported). [sent-169, score-0.036]
</p><p>90 A beta version is currently open to researchers for experimentation. [sent-171, score-0.084]

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>3 0.10679118 <a title="51-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Extending_an_interoperable_platform_to_facilitate_the_creation_of_multilingual_and_multimodal_NLP_applications.html">150 acl-2013-Extending an interoperable platform to facilitate the creation of multilingual and multimodal NLP applications</a></p>

In line with METANETâ€™s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>4 0.10155258 <a title="51-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-WebAnno%3A_A_Flexible%2C_Web-based_and_Visually_Supported_System_for_Distributed_Annotations.html">385 acl-2013-WebAnno: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations</a></p>
<p>Author: Seid Muhie Yimam ; Iryna Gurevych ; Richard Eckart de Castilho ; Chris Biemann</p><p>Abstract: We present WebAnno, a general purpose web-based annotation tool for a wide range of linguistic annotations. WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser.

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces.

The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources.

<p>Author: Georgios Kontonatsios ; Paul Thompson ; Riza Theresa Batista-Navarro ; Claudiu Mihaila ; Ioannis Korkontzelos ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: U-Compare is a UIMA-based workflow construction platform for building natural language processing (NLP) applications from heterogeneous language resources (LRs), without the need for programming skills. U-Compare has been adopted within the context of the METANET Network of Excellence, and over 40 LRs that process 15 European languages have been added to the U-Compare component library. In line with METANETâ€™s aims of increasing communication between citizens of different European countries, U-Compare has been extended to facilitate the development of a wider range of applications, including both mul- tilingual and multimodal workflows. The enhancements exploit the UIMA Subject of Analysis (Sofa) mechanism, that allows different facets of the input data to be represented. We demonstrate how our customised extensions to U-Compare allow the construction and testing of NLP applications that transform the input data in different ways, e.g., machine translation, automatic summarisation and text-to-speech.</p><p>4 0.79746372 <a title="51-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-WebAnno%3A_A_Flexible%2C_Web-based_and_Visually_Supported_System_for_Distributed_Annotations.html">385 acl-2013-WebAnno: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations</a></p>

<p>Author: Feifei Zhai ; Jiajun Zhang ; Yu Zhou ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Predicate-argument structure (PAS) has been demonstrated to be very effective in improving SMT performance. However, since a sourceside PAS might correspond to multiple different target-side PASs, there usually exist many PAS ambiguities during translation. In this paper, we group PAS ambiguities into two types: role ambiguity and gap ambiguity. Then we propose two novel methods to handle the two PAS ambiguities for SMT accordingly: 1) inside context integration; 2) a novel maximum entropy PAS disambiguation (MEPD) model. In this way, we incorporate rich context information of PAS for disambiguation. Then we integrate the two methods into a PASbased translation framework. Experiments show that our approach helps to achieve significant improvements on translation quality. 1</p><p>3 0.44385448 <a title="51-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Social_Text_Normalization_using_Contextual_Graph_Random_Walks.html">326 acl-2013-Social Text Normalization using Contextual Graph Random Walks</a></p>
<p>Author: Hany Hassan ; Arul Menezes</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a social media text normalization system that can be deployed as a preprocessing step for Machine Translation and various NLP applications to handle social media text. The proposed system is based on unsupervised learning of the normalization equivalences from unlabeled text. The proposed approach uses Random Walks on a contextual similarity bipartite graph constructed from n-gram sequences on large unlabeled text corpus. We show that the proposed approach has a very high precision of (92.43) and a reasonable recall of (56.4). When used as a preprocessing step for a state-of-the-art machine translation system, the translation quality on social media text improved by 6%. The proposed approach is domain and language independent and can be deployed as a preprocessing step for any NLP application to handle social media text.</p><p>4 0.44294864 <a title="51-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>

<p>Author: Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian inference method to train statistical machine translation systems using only nonparallel corpora. Following a probabilistic decipherment approach, we first introduce a new framework for decipherment training that is flexible enough to incorporate any number/type of features (besides simple bag-of-words) as side-information used for estimating translation models. In order to perform fast, efficient Bayesian inference in this framework, we then derive a hash sampling strategy that is inspired by the work of Ahmed et al. (2012). The new translation hash sampler enables us to scale elegantly to complex models (for the first time) and large vocab- ulary/corpora sizes. We show empirical results on the OPUS dataâ€”our method yields the best BLEU scores compared to existing approaches, while achieving significant computational speedups (several orders faster). We also report for the first timeâ€”BLEU score results for a largescale MT task using only non-parallel data (EMEA corpus).</p><p>6 0.44111246 <a title="51-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Turning_on_the_Turbo%3A_Fast_Third-Order_Non-Projective_Turbo_Parsers.html">362 acl-2013-Turning on the Turbo: Fast Third-Order Non-Projective Turbo Parsers</a></p>

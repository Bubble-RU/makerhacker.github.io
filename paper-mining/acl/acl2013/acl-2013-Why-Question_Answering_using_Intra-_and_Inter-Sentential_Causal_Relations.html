<p>Author: Istvan Varga ; Motoki Sano ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Kiyonori Ohtake ; Takao Kawai ; Jong-Hoon Oh ; Stijn De Saeger</p><p>Abstract: The 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake caused a wide range of problems, and as countermeasures, many aid activities were carried out. Many of these problems and aid activities were reported via Twitter. However, most problem reports and corresponding aid messages were not successfully exchanged between victims and local governments or humanitarian organizations, overwhelmed by the vast amount of information. As a result, victims could not receive necessary aid and humanitarian organizations wasted resources on redundant efforts. In this paper, we propose a method for discovering matches between problem reports and aid messages. Our system contributes to problem-solving in a large scale disaster situation by facilitating communication between victims and humanitarian organizations.</p><p>3 0.19953333 <a title="387-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-What_causes_a_causal_relation%3F_Detecting_Causal_Triggers_in_Biomedical_Scientific_Discourse.html">386 acl-2013-What causes a causal relation? Detecting Causal Triggers in Biomedical Scientific Discourse</a></p>
<p>Author: Claudiu Mihaila ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Current domain-specific information extraction systems represent an important resource for biomedical researchers, who need to process vaster amounts of knowledge in short times. Automatic discourse causality recognition can further improve their workload by suggesting possible causal connections and aiding in the curation of pathway models. We here describe an approach to the automatic identification of discourse causality triggers in the biomedical domain using machine learning. We create several baselines and experiment with various parameter settings for three algorithms, i.e., Conditional Random Fields (CRF), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forests (RF). Also, we evaluate the impact of lexical, syntactic and semantic features on each of the algorithms and look at er- rors. The best performance of 79.35% F-score is achieved by CRFs when using all three feature types.</p><p>4 0.18038967 <a title="387-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.15910992 <a title="387-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>6 0.15803522 <a title="387-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval.html">60 acl-2013-Automatic Coupling of Answer Extraction and Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Nan Duan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents two minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches for the question answering (QA) task. The first approach re-ranks single QA system’s outputs by using a traditional MBR model, by measuring correlations between answer candidates; while the second approach reranks the combined outputs of multiple QA systems with heterogenous answer extraction components by using a mixture model-based MBR model. Evaluations are performed on factoid questions selected from two different domains: Jeopardy! and Web, and significant improvements are achieved on all data sets.</p><p>3 0.71739024 <a title="387-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-PAL%3A_A_Chatterbot_System_for_Answering_Domain-specific_Questions.html">266 acl-2013-PAL: A Chatterbot System for Answering Domain-specific Questions</a></p>

This system focuses on providing primary suggestions or helping people relieve pressure by extracting knowledge from online forums, based on which the chatterbot system is constructed. The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed.

<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer Extraction are often designed as isolated or loosely connected components in Question Answering (QA), with repeated overengineering on IR, and not necessarily performance gain for QA. We propose to tightly integrate them by coupling automatically learned features for answer extraction to a shallow-structured IR model. Our method is very quick to implement, and significantly improves IR for QA (measured in Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20% against an uncoupled retrieval baseline in both document and passage retrieval, which further leads to a downstream 20% improvement in QA F1.</p><p>6 0.67621297 <a title="387-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>

<p>Author: Akiko Eriguchi ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In a multi-class document categorization using graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL), it is essential to construct a proper graph expressing the relation among nodes and to use a reasonable categorization algorithm. Furthermore, it is also important to provide high-quality correct data as training data. In this context, we propose a method to construct a similarity graph by employing both surface information and latent information to express similarity between nodes and a method to select high-quality training data for GBSSL by means of the PageR- ank algorithm. Experimenting on Reuters21578 corpus, we have confirmed that our proposed methods work well for raising the accuracy of a multi-class document categorization.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.72720063 <a title="387-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Why-Question_Answering_using_Intra-_and_Inter-Sentential_Causal_Relations.html">387 acl-2013-Why-Question Answering using Intra- and Inter-Sentential Causal Relations</a></p>

<p>Author: Martin Popel ; David Marecek ; Jan StÄłpanek ; Daniel Zeman ; ZdÄłnÄłk Zabokrtsky</p><p>Abstract: Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.</p><p>4 0.68217438 <a title="387-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Identification_of_Speakers_in_Novels.html">184 acl-2013-Identification of Speakers in Novels</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua He ; Denilson Barbosa ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Speaker identification is the task of at- tributing utterances to characters in a literary narrative. It is challenging to auto- mate because the speakers of the majority ofutterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.</p><p>5 0.68040973 <a title="387-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>
<p>Author: Kun Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Keh-Yih Su</p><p>Abstract: Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in matched and unmatched regions, integrated models are proposed in this paper to incorporate TM information into phrase-based SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese–English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system. Be- . sides, the proposed models also outperform previous approaches significantly.</p><p>6 0.66280156 <a title="387-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Aid_is_Out_There%3A_Looking_for_Help_from_Tweets_during_a_Large_Scale_Disaster.html">42 acl-2013-Aid is Out There: Looking for Help from Tweets during a Large Scale Disaster</a></p>

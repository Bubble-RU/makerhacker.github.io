<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>3 0.1839688 <a title="201-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>4 0.14157623 <a title="201-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Improving_machine_translation_by_training_against_an_automatic_semantic_frame_based_evaluation_metric.html">195 acl-2013-Improving machine translation by training against an automatic semantic frame based evaluation metric</a></p>
<p>Author: Chi-kiu Lo ; Karteek Addanki ; Markus Saers ; Dekai Wu</p><p>Abstract: We present the first ever results showing that tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function, MEANT, produces more robustly adequate translations than tuning against BLEU or TER as measured across commonly used metrics and human subjective evaluation. Moreover, for informal web forum data, human evaluators preferred MEANT-tuned systems over BLEU- or TER-tuned systems by a significantly wider margin than that for formal newswire—even though automatic semantic parsing might be expected to fare worse on informal language. We argue thatbypreserving the meaning ofthe trans- lations as captured by semantic frames right in the training process, an MT system is constrained to make more accurate choices of both lexical and reordering rules. As a result, MT systems tuned against semantic frame based MT evaluation metrics produce output that is more adequate. Tuning a machine translation system against a semantic frame based objective function is independent ofthe translation model paradigm, so, any translation model can benefit from the semantic knowledge incorporated to improve translation adequacy through our approach.</p><p>5 0.14133693 <a title="201-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>6 0.13057813 <a title="201-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-QuEst_-_A_translation_quality_estimation_framework.html">289 acl-2013-QuEst - A translation quality estimation framework</a></p>

<p>Author: Conghui Zhu ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Typical statistical machine translation systems are batch trained with a given training data and their performances are largely influenced by the amount of data. With the growth of the available data across different domains, it is computationally demanding to perform batch training every time when new data comes. In face of the problem, we propose an efficient phrase table combination method. In particular, we train a Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammars for each domain separately. The learned phrase tables are hierarchically combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The performance measured by BLEU is at least as comparable to the traditional batch training method. Furthermore, each phrase table is trained separately in each domain, and while computational overhead is significantly reduced by training them in parallel.</p><p>3 0.82537448 <a title="201-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Bilingual_Data_Cleaning_for_SMT_using_Graph-based_Random_Walk.html">68 acl-2013-Bilingual Data Cleaning for SMT using Graph-based Random Walk</a></p>
<p>Author: Lei Cui ; Dongdong Zhang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: The quality of bilingual data is a key factor in Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Low-quality bilingual data tends to produce incorrect translation knowledge and also degrades translation modeling performance. Previous work often used supervised learning methods to filter lowquality data, but a fair amount of human labeled examples are needed which are not easy to obtain. To reduce the reliance on labeled examples, we propose an unsupervised method to clean bilingual data. The method leverages the mutual reinforcement between the sentence pairs and the extracted phrase pairs, based on the observation that better sentence pairs often lead to better phrase extraction and vice versa. End-to-end experiments show that the proposed method substantially improves the performance in largescale Chinese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>4 0.81388843 <a title="201-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>6 0.7784515 <a title="201-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Docent%3A_A_Document-Level_Decoder_for_Phrase-Based_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">127 acl-2013-Docent: A Document-Level Decoder for Phrase-Based Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Akiko Eriguchi ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In a multi-class document categorization using graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL), it is essential to construct a proper graph expressing the relation among nodes and to use a reasonable categorization algorithm. Furthermore, it is also important to provide high-quality correct data as training data. In this context, we propose a method to construct a similarity graph by employing both surface information and latent information to express similarity between nodes and a method to select high-quality training data for GBSSL by means of the PageR- ank algorithm. Experimenting on Reuters21578 corpus, we have confirmed that our proposed methods work well for raising the accuracy of a multi-class document categorization.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.83923268 <a title="201-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Jong-Hoon Oh ; Kentaro Torisawa ; Chikara Hashimoto ; Motoki Sano ; Stijn De Saeger ; Kiyonori Ohtake</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the utility of intra- and inter-sentential causal relations between terms or clauses as evidence for answering why-questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>4 0.82672125 <a title="201-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>
<p>Author: Martin Popel ; David Marecek ; Jan StÄłpanek ; Daniel Zeman ; ZdÄłnÄłk Zabokrtsky</p><p>Abstract: Paratactic syntactic structures are notoriously difficult to represent in dependency formalisms. This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages. In addition, empirical observations on convertibility between selected styles of representations are shown too.</p><p>5 0.80058575 <a title="201-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>
<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>6 0.79626518 <a title="201-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Cut_the_noise%3A_Mutually_reinforcing_reordering_and_alignments_for_improved_machine_translation.html">101 acl-2013-Cut the noise: Mutually reinforcing reordering and alignments for improved machine translation</a></p>

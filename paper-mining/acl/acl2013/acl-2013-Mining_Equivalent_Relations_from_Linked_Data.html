</p><p>3 We introduce an unsupervised method to measure equivalency of relation pairs and cluster equivalent relations. [sent-10, score-0.812]
</p><p>4 Early experiments have shown encouraging results with an average of 0. [sent-11, score-0.053]

</p><p>6 For the last few years Linked Open Data has grown to a gigantic knowledge base, which, as of 2013, comprised 3 1 billion triples in 295 datasets1. [sent-18, score-0.071]
</p><p>7 A major research question concerning Linked Data is linking heterogeneous resources, the fact that publishers may describe analogous information using different vocabulary, or may assign different identifiers to the same referents. [sent-19, score-0.14]
</p><p>8 Among such work, many study mappings between ontology concepts and data instances (e. [sent-20, score-0.221]
</p><p>9 An insufficiently addressed problem is linking heterogeneous relations, which is also widely found in data and can cause problems in information retrieval (Fu et al. [sent-26, score-0.211]
</p><p>10 Existing work in linking relations typically employ string similarity metrics or semantic similarity mea-  1 http://lod-cloud. [sent-28, score-0.545]
</p><p>11 This paper introduces a novel method to discover equivalent groups of relations for Linked Data concepts. [sent-36, score-0.534]
</p><p>12 It consists of two components: 1) a measure of equivalency between pairs of relations of a concept and 2) a clustering process to group equivalent relations. [sent-37, score-1.101]
</p><p>13 Two types of experiments have been carried out using two major Linked Data sets: 1) evaluating the precision of predicting equivalency of relation pairs and 2) evaluating the precision of clustering equivalent relations. [sent-39, score-0.94]
</p><p>14 Preliminary results have shown encouraging results as the method achieves between 0. [sent-40, score-0.053]
</p><p>15 85 precision in the first set of experiments while 0. [sent-42, score-0.062]
</p><p>16 2  Related Work  Research on linking heterogeneous ontological resources mostly addresses mapping classes (or  concepts) and instances (Isaac et al, 2007; Mi et al. [sent-45, score-0.216]
</p><p>17 string edit distance), semantic similarity (Budanitsky and Hirst, 2006), and distributional similarity based on the overlap in data usage (Duan et al. [sent-52, score-0.335]
</p><p>18 There have been insufficient studies on mapping relations (or properties) across ontologies. [sent-55, score-0.265]
</p><p>19 Typical methods make use of a combination of string similarity and semantic similarity metrics (Zhong et al. [sent-56, score-0.206]
</p><p>20 While string similarity fails to identify equivalent relations if their lexicalizations are distinct, semantic similarity often depends on taxonomic structures 289  Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t. [sent-60, score-0.698]

</p><p>22 Unfortunately many Linked Data instances use relations that are invented arbitrarily or originate in rudimentary ontologies (Parundekar et al. [sent-63, score-0.382]
</p><p>23 Distributional similarity has also been used to discover equivalent or similar rela-  tions. [sent-65, score-0.325]
</p><p>24 (2012) extract product properties from an e-commerce website and align equivalent properties using a supervised maximum entropy classification method. [sent-67, score-0.343]
</p><p>25 We study linking relations on Linked Data and propose an unsupervised method. [sent-68, score-0.339]
</p><p>26 (2012) identify similar relations using the overlap of the subjects of two relations and the overlap of their objects. [sent-70, score-0.918]
</p><p>27 On the contrary, we aim at identifying strictly equivalent relations rather than similarity in general. [sent-71, score-0.548]
</p><p>28 3  Method  Let t denote a 3-tuple (triple) consisting of a subject (ts), predicate (tp) and object (to). [sent-75, score-0.072]
</p><p>29 We write type (ts) = c meaning that ts is of class c. [sent-77, score-0.132]
</p><p>30 p denotes a relation and rp is a set of triples whose tp=p, i. [sent-78, score-0.33]
</p><p>31 Given a specific class c, and its pairs of relations (p, p ’) such that rp= {t|tp=p, type(ts)=c} and  {t|tp=p ’, type (ts)=c}, we measure the equivalency of p and p ’ and then cluster equivalent relations. [sent-81, score-1.026]
</p><p>32 The equivalency is calculated locally (within same class c) rather than globally (across all classes) because two relations can have identical meaning in specific class context but not necessarily so in general. [sent-82, score-0.728]
</p><p>33 For example, for the class Book, the relations dbpp:title and foaf:name are used with the same meaning, however for Actor, dbpp:title is used interchangeably with awards dbpp:awards (e. [sent-83, score-0.353]
</p><p>34 In practice, given a class c, our method starts with retrieving all t from a Linked Data set where type(ts)=c, using the universal query language SPARQL with any SPARQL data endpoint. [sent-86, score-0.039]
</p><p>35 This data is then used to measure equivalency for each pair of relations (Section 3. [sent-87, score-0.711]
</p><p>36 The equivalence scores are then used to group relations in equivalent clusters (Section 3. [sent-89, score-0.684]
</p><p>37 1 Measure of equivalence The equivalence for each distinct pair of relations depends on three components. [sent-92, score-0.572]
</p><p>38 Triple overlap evaluates the degree of overlap2 in terms of the usage of relations in triples. [sent-93, score-0.427]
</p><p>39 The MAX function allows addressing infrequently used, but still equivalent relations (i. [sent-95, score-0.55]
</p><p>40 , where the overlap covers most triples of an infrequently used relation but only a very small proportion of a much more frequently used). [sent-97, score-0.348]
</p><p>41 Subject agreement While triple overlap looks at the data in general, subject agreement looks at the overlap of subjects of two relations, and the degree to which these subjects have overlapping objects. [sent-98, score-0.797]
</p><p>42 Let S(p) return the set of subjects of relation p, and O(p|s) returns the set of objects of relation p whose subjects are s, i. [sent-99, score-0.474]
</p><p>43 The higher the value of α, the more the two relations “agree” in terms of their shared subjects. [sent-102, score-0.265]
</p><p>44 For each shared subject of p and p ’ we count 1 if they have at least 1 overlapping object and 0 otherwise. [sent-103, score-0.117]
</p><p>45 This is because both p and p ’ can be 1:many relations and a low overlap value could mean that one is densely populated while the other is not, which does not necessarily mean they do not “agree”. [sent-104, score-0.394]
</p><p>46 Equation [6] evaluates the degree to which two relations share the same set of subjects. [sent-105, score-0.298]
</p><p>47 The agreement AG(p, p ’) balances the two factors by taking the product. [sent-106, score-0.035]
</p><p>48 As a result,  2 In this paper overlap is based on “exact” match. [sent-107, score-0.129]
</p><p>49 290  relations that have high level of agreement will have more subjects in common, and higher proportion of shared subjects with shared objects. [sent-108, score-0.56]
</p><p>50 Cardinality ratio is a ratio between cardinality of the two relations. [sent-109, score-0.087]
</p><p>51 2 Clustering We apply the measure to every pair of relations of a concept, and keep those with a non-zero equivalence score. [sent-112, score-0.49]
</p><p>52 The goal of clustering is to create groups of equivalent relations based on the pair-wise equivalence scores. [sent-113, score-0.717]
</p><p>53 We use a simple rule-based agglomerative clustering algorithm for this purpose. [sent-114, score-0.138]
</p><p>54 First, we rank all relation pairs by their equivalence score, then we keep a pair if (i) its score and (ii) the number of triples covered by each relation are above a certain threshold, TminEqvl and TminTP respectively. [sent-115, score-0.479]
</p><p>55 To merge clusters, given an existing cluster c and a new pair (p, p ’) where either p c or p ’ c, the pair is added to c if E(p, p ’) is close (as a fractional number above the threshold TminEqvlRel) to the average scores of all connected pairs in c. [sent-117, score-0.178]
</p><p>56 Adjusting these thresholds allows balancing between precision and recall. [sent-120, score-0.143]
</p><p>57 4  Experiment Design  To our knowledge, there is no publically availa-  ble gold standard for relation equivalency using Linked Data. [sent-121, score-0.443]
</p><p>58 We randomly selected 21 concepts (Figure 1) from the DBpedia ontology (v3. [sent-122, score-0.188]
</p><p>59 it lne t, We apply our method to each concept to discover clusters of equivalent relations, using as SPARQL endpoint both DBpedia3 and Sindice4 and report results separately. [sent-125, score-0.389]
</p><p>60 For this preliminary evaluation, we have limited the amount of anno-  tations to a maximum of 100 top scoring pairs of relations per concept, resulting in 16~100 pairs per concept (avg. [sent-134, score-0.465]
</p><p>61 40) for DBpedia experiment and 29~100 pairs for Sindice (avg. [sent-135, score-0.053]
</p><p>62 The annotators were asked to rate each edge in each cluster with -1 (wrong), 1 (correct) or 0 (cannot decide). [sent-137, score-0.039]
</p><p>63 Also using this data, we derived a gold standard for clustering based on edge connectivity and we evaluate (i) the precision of top n% (p@n%) ranked equivalent relation pairs and (ii) the precision of clustering for each concept. [sent-141, score-0.723]
</p><p>64 IAA on annotating pair equivalency So far the output of 13 concepts has been annotated. [sent-146, score-0.454]
</p><p>65 This dataset 5 contains ≈1800 relation  pairs and is larger than the one by Fu et al. [sent-147, score-0.143]
</p><p>66 Annotation process shows that over 75% of relation pairs in the Sindice experiment contain non-English relations and mostly are crosslingual. [sent-149, score-0.408]
</p><p>67 We used this data to report performance, although the method has been applied to all the 21 concepts, and the complete results can be visualized at our demo website link. [sent-150, score-0.08]
</p><p>68 Examples of visualized clusters 5  Result and Discussion  equivalency6  Figure 3 shows p@n% for pair Figure 4 shows clustering precision. [sent-161, score-0.242]
</p><p>69 The box plots show the ranges of precision at each n%; the lines show the average. [sent-164, score-0.062]
</p><p>70 Clustering precision As it is shown in Figure 2, Linked Data relations are often heterogeneous. [sent-166, score-0.327]
</p><p>71 Therefore, finding equivalent relations to improve coverage is important. [sent-167, score-0.492]
</p><p>72 Results in Figure 3 show that in most cases the method identifies equivalent relations with high precision. [sent-168, score-0.492]
</p><p>73 It is effective for both single- and cross-language relation pairs. [sent-169, score-0.09]
</p><p>74 The worst performing case for DBpedia is Aircraft (for all n%), mostly due to duplicating numeric valued objects of different relations (e. [sent-170, score-0.358]
</p><p>75 The decreasing precision with respect to n% suggests the measure effectively ranks correct pairs to the top. [sent-173, score-0.165]
</p><p>76 Figure 4 shows that the  method effectively clusters equivalent relations with very high precision: 0. [sent-175, score-0.552]
</p><p>77 (2012), for BasketballPlayer, our method creates separate clusters for relations meaning “draft team” and “former team” because although they are “similar” they are not “equivalent”. [sent-181, score-0.325]
</p><p>78 We noticed that annotating equivalent relations is a non-trivial task. [sent-182, score-0.492]
</p><p>79 Sometimes relations and their corresponding schemata (if any) are poorly documented and it is impossible to understand the meaning of relations (e. [sent-183, score-0.53]
</p><p>80 Analyses of the evaluation output show that errors are typically found between highly similar relations, or whose object values are numeric types. [sent-186, score-0.099]
</p><p>81 In both cases, there is a very high probability of having a high overlap of subject-object pairs between relations. [sent-187, score-0.182]
</p><p>82 For example, for Aircraft, the relations dbpp:heightIn and dbpp:  weight are predicted to be equivalent because many instances have the same numeric value for the properties. [sent-188, score-0.584]
</p><p>83 Another example are the Airport properties dbpp:runwaySurface, dbpp:r1Surface, dbpp:r2Surface etc. [sent-189, score-0.041]
</p><p>84 The relations are semantically highly similar and the object values have a high overlap. [sent-193, score-0.305]
</p><p>85 A potential solution to such issues is incorporating ontological knowledge if available. [sent-194, score-0.043]
</p><p>86 For example, if an ontology defines the two distinct properties of Airport without explicitly defining an “equivalence” relation between them, they are unlikely to be equivalent even if the data suggests the opposite. [sent-195, score-0.488]
</p><p>87 6  Conclusion  This paper introduced a data-driven, unsupervised and domain and language independent method to learn equivalent relations for Linked Data concepts. [sent-196, score-0.492]
</p><p>88 Preliminary experiments show encouraging results as it effectively discovers equivalent relations in both single- and multilingual settings. [sent-197, score-0.545]
</p><p>89 In future, we will revise the equivalence measure and also experiment with  clustering algorithms such as (Beeferman et al. [sent-198, score-0.275]
</p><p>90 We will also study the contribution of individual components of the measure in such task. [sent-200, score-0.05]

Unlike the previous approaches relying on the “symmetry” found in parallel corpora, the proposed method is tolerant to asymmetry often found in comparable corpora, by distinguishing different semantics of relations of entity pairs to selectively propagate seed entity translations on weakly comparable corpora. Our experimental results on English-Chinese corpora show that our selective propagation approach outperforms the previous approaches in named entity translation in terms of the mean reciprocal rank by up to 0.16 for organization names, and 0.14 in a low com- parability case.</p><p>5 0.082741246 <a title="242-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_New_Set_of_Norms_for_Semantic_Relatedness_Measures.html">12 acl-2013-A New Set of Norms for Semantic Relatedness Measures</a></p>
<p>Author: Sean Szumlanski ; Fernando Gomez ; Valerie K. Sims</p><p>Abstract: We have elicited human quantitative judgments of semantic relatedness for 122 pairs of nouns and compiled them into a new set of relatedness norms that we call Rel-122. Judgments from individual subjects in our study exhibit high average correlation to the resulting relatedness means (r = 0.77, σ = 0.09, N = 73), although not as high as Resnik’s (1995) upper bound for expected average human correlation to similarity means (r = 0.90). This suggests that human perceptions of relatedness are less strictly constrained than perceptions of similarity and establishes a clearer expectation for what constitutes human-like performance by a computational measure of semantic relatedness. We compare the results of several WordNet-based similarity and relatedness measures to our Rel-122 norms and demonstrate the limitations of WordNet for discovering general indications of semantic relatedness. We also offer a critique of the field’s reliance upon similarity norms to evaluate relatedness measures.</p><p>6 0.079795562 <a title="242-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>

It is a linked structure of wordnets of 18 different Indian languages, Universal Word dictionary and the Suggested Upper Merged Ontology (SUMO). We discuss various benefits of the network and challenges involved in the development. The system is encoded in Lexical Markup Framework (LMF) and we propose modifications in LMF to accommodate Universal Word Dictionary and SUMO. This standardized version of lexical knowledge base of Indian Languages can now easily , be linked to similar global resources.</p><p>3 0.68679231 <a title="242-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Interpretation_of_the_English_Possessive.html">61 acl-2013-Automatic Interpretation of the English Possessive</a></p>
<p>Author: Stephen Tratz ; Eduard Hovy</p><p>Abstract: The English ’s possessive construction occurs frequently in text and can encode several different semantic relations; however, it has received limited attention from the computational linguistics community. This paper describes the creation of a semantic relation inventory covering the use of ’s, an inter-annotator agreement study to calculate how well humans can agree on the relations, a large collection of possessives annotated according to the relations, and an accurate automatic annotation system for labeling new examples. Our 21,938 example dataset is by far the largest annotated possessives dataset we are aware of, and both our automatic classification system, which achieves 87.4% accuracy in our classification experiment, and our annotation data are publicly available.</p><p>4 0.65998012 <a title="242-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-PATHS%3A_A_System_for_Accessing_Cultural_Heritage_Collections.html">268 acl-2013-PATHS: A System for Accessing Cultural Heritage Collections</a></p>

<p>Author: Qingqing Cai ; Alexander Yates</p><p>Abstract: Supervised training procedures for semantic parsers produce high-quality semantic parsers, but they have difficulty scaling to large databases because of the sheer number of logical constants for which they must see labeled training data. We present a technique for developing semantic parsers for large databases based on a reduction to standard supervised training algorithms, schema matching, and pattern learning. Leveraging techniques from each of these areas, we develop a semantic parser for Freebase that is capable of parsing questions with an F1 that improves by 0.42 over a purely-supervised learning algorithm.</p><p>6 0.637456 <a title="242-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Post-Retrieval_Clustering_Using_Third-Order_Similarity_Measures.html">281 acl-2013-Post-Retrieval Clustering Using Third-Order Similarity Measures</a></p>

<p>Author: Haifeng Hu ; Bingquan Liu ; Baoxun Wang ; Ming Liu ; Xiaolong Wang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem for predicting cQA answer quality as a classification task. We propose a multimodal deep belief nets based approach that operates in two stages: First, the joint representation is learned by taking both textual and non-textual features into a deep learning network. Then, the joint representation learned by the network is used as input features for a linear classifier. Extensive experimental results conducted on two cQA datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</p><p>3 0.67867362 <a title="242-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Task_Alternation_in_Parallel_Sentence_Retrieval_for_Twitter_Translation.html">338 acl-2013-Task Alternation in Parallel Sentence Retrieval for Twitter Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Felix Hieber ; Laura Jehl ; Stefan Riezler</p><p>Abstract: We present an approach to mine comparable data for parallel sentences using translation-based cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR). By iteratively alternating between the tasks of retrieval and translation, an initial general-domain model is allowed to adapt to in-domain data. Adaptation is done by training the translation system on a few thousand sentences retrieved in the step before. Our setup is time- and memory-efficient and of similar quality as CLIR-based adaptation on millions of parallel sentences.</p><p>4 0.63434416 <a title="242-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>5 0.57822883 <a title="242-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Accurate_Shift-Reduce_Constituent_Parsing.html">155 acl-2013-Fast and Accurate Shift-Reduce Constituent Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Muhua Zhu ; Yue Zhang ; Wenliang Chen ; Min Zhang ; Jingbo Zhu</p><p>Abstract: Shift-reduce dependency parsers give comparable accuracies to their chartbased counterparts, yet the best shiftreduce constituent parsers still lag behind the state-of-the-art. One important reason is the existence of unary nodes in phrase structure trees, which leads to different numbers of shift-reduce actions between different outputs for the same input. This turns out to have a large empirical impact on the framework of global training and beam search. We propose a simple yet effective extension to the shift-reduce process, which eliminates size differences between action sequences in beam-search. Our parser gives comparable accuracies to the state-of-the-art chart parsers. With linear run-time complexity, our parser is over an order of magnitude faster than the fastest chart parser.</p><p>6 0.57460672 <a title="242-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Lattice-based_Framework_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation%2C_POS_Tagging_and_Parsing.html">7 acl-2013-A Lattice-based Framework for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation, POS Tagging and Parsing</a></p>

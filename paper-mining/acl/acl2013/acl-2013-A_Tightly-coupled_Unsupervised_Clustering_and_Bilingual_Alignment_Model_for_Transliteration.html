<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>5 0.15515977 <a title="25-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>6 0.15512069 <a title="25-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Non-Monotonic_Sentence_Alignment_via_Semisupervised_Learning.html">259 acl-2013-Non-Monotonic Sentence Alignment via Semisupervised Learning</a></p>

However, estimating the probabilities of rules extracted from hypergraphs is an NP-complete problem, which is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy by decomposing a hypergraph into a set of independent subhypergraphs.

<p>Author: K. Tamsin Maxwell ; Jon Oberlander ; W. Bruce Croft</p><p>Abstract: Techniques that compare short text segments using dependency paths (or simply, paths) appear in a wide range of automated language processing applications including question answering (QA). However, few models in ad hoc information retrieval (IR) use paths for document ranking due to the prohibitive cost of parsing a retrieval collection. In this paper, we introduce a flexible notion of paths that describe chains of words on a dependency path. These chains, or catenae, are readily applied in standard IR models. Informative catenae are selected using supervised machine learning with linguistically informed features and compared to both non-linguistic terms and catenae selected heuristically with filters derived from work on paths. Automatically selected catenae of 1-2 words deliver significant performance gains on three TREC collections.</p><p>5 0.78426695 <a title="25-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Synthetic_Discourse_Data_via_Multi-task_Learning_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Recognition.html">229 acl-2013-Leveraging Synthetic Discourse Data via Multi-task Learning for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Man Lan ; Yu Xu ; Zhengyu Niu</p><p>Abstract: To overcome the shortage of labeled data for implicit discourse relation recognition, previous works attempted to automatically generate training data by removing explicit discourse connectives from sentences and then built models on these synthetic implicit examples. However, a previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed that models trained on these synthetic data do not generalize very well to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse data. In this work we revisit this issue and present a multi-task learning based system which can effectively use synthetic data for implicit discourse relation recognition. Results on PDTB data show that under the multi-task learning framework our models with the use of the prediction of explicit discourse connectives as auxiliary learning tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 improvement of 5.86% over baseline models.</p><p>6 0.77790266 <a title="25-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Large-scale_Semantic_Parsing_via_Schema_Matching_and_Lexicon_Extension.html">215 acl-2013-Large-scale Semantic Parsing via Schema Matching and Lexicon Extension</a></p>

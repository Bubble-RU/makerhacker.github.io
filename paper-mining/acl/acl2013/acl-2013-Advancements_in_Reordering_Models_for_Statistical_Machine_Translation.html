<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Mitesh M. Khapra ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of a source language sentence to match target word order has proved to be useful for improving machine translation systems. Previous work has shown that a reordering model can be learned from high quality manual word alignments to improve machine translation performance. In this paper, we focus on further improving the performance of the reordering model (and thereby machine translation) by using a larger corpus of sentence aligned data for which manual word alignments are not available but automatic machine generated alignments are available. The main challenge we tackle is to generate quality data for training the reordering model in spite of the machine align- ments being noisy. To mitigate the effect of noisy machine alignments, we propose a novel approach that improves reorderings produced given noisy alignments and also improves word alignments using information from the reordering model. This approach generates alignments that are 2.6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner. The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1.8 BLEU points on the NIST MT-08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses manual word alignments, and a gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline.</p><p>3 0.32642677 <a title="40-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Generalized_Reordering_Rules_for_Improved_SMT.html">166 acl-2013-Generalized Reordering Rules for Improved SMT</a></p>
<p>Author: Fei Huang ; Cezar Pendus</p><p>Abstract: We present a simple yet effective approach to syntactic reordering for Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). Instead of solely relying on the top-1 best-matching rule for source sentence preordering, we generalize fully lexicalized rules into partially lexicalized and unlexicalized rules to broaden the rule coverage. Furthermore, , we consider multiple permutations of all the matching rules, and select the final reordering path based on the weighed sum of reordering probabilities of these rules. Our experiments in English-Chinese and English-Japanese translations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach: we observe consistent and significant improvement in translation quality across multiple test sets in both language pairs judged by both humans and automatic metric. 1</p><p>4 0.23467368 <a title="40-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Phrase-based_Reordering_Features_into_a_Chart-based_Decoder_for_Machine_Translation.html">200 acl-2013-Integrating Phrase-based Reordering Features into a Chart-based Decoder for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: ThuyLinh Nguyen ; Stephan Vogel</p><p>Abstract: Hiero translation models have two limitations compared to phrase-based models: 1) Limited hypothesis space; 2) No lexicalized reordering model. We propose an extension of Hiero called PhrasalHiero to address Hieroâ€™s second problem. Phrasal-Hiero still has the same hypothesis space as the original Hiero but incorporates a phrase-based distance cost feature and lexicalized reodering features into the chart decoder. The work consists of two parts: 1) for each Hiero translation derivation, find its corresponding dis- continuous phrase-based path. 2) Extend the chart decoder to incorporate features from the phrase-based path. We achieve significant improvement over both Hiero and phrase-based baselines for ArabicEnglish, Chinese-English and GermanEnglish translation.</p><p>5 0.23279478 <a title="40-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts.html">363 acl-2013-Two-Neighbor Orientation Model with Cross-Boundary Global Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>6 0.19838995 <a title="40-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Isao Goto ; Masao Utiyama ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Akihiro Tamura ; Sadao Kurohashi</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes new distortion models for phrase-based SMT. In decoding, a distortion model estimates the source word position to be translated next (NP) given the last translated source word position (CP). We propose a distortion model that can consider the word at the CP, a word at an NP candidate, and the context of the CP and the NP candidate simultaneously. Moreover, we propose a further improved model that considers richer context by discriminating label sequences that specify spans from the CP to NP candidates. It enables our model to learn the effect of relative word order among NP candidates as well as to learn the effect of distances from the training data. In our experiments, our model improved 2.9 BLEU points for Japanese-English and 2.6 BLEU points for Chinese-English translation compared to the lexical reordering models.</p><p>5 0.82861298 <a title="40-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts.html">363 acl-2013-Two-Neighbor Orientation Model with Cross-Boundary Global Contexts</a></p>

We use token level labels to derive sentence-level features.

The system achieves an accuracy of 85.5% on an Arabic online-commentary dataset outperforming a previously proposed approach achieving 80.9% and reflecting a significant gain over a majority baseline of 5 1.9% and two strong baseline systems of 78.5% and 80.4%, respectively.</p><p>3 0.83258617 <a title="40-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>4 0.81019032 <a title="40-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Named_Entity_Recognition_using_Cross-lingual_Resources%3A_Arabic_as_an_Example.html">256 acl-2013-Named Entity Recognition using Cross-lingual Resources: Arabic as an Example</a></p>
<p>Author: Kareem Darwish</p><p>Abstract: Some languages lack large knowledge bases and good discriminative features for Name Entity Recognition (NER) that can generalize to previously unseen named entities. One such language is Arabic, which: a) lacks a capitalization feature; and b) has relatively small knowledge bases, such as Wikipedia. In this work we address both problems by incorporating cross-lingual features and knowledge bases from English using cross-lingual links. We show that such features have a dramatic positive effect on recall. We show the effectiveness of cross-lingual features and resources on a standard dataset as well as on two new test sets that cover both news and microblogs. On the standard dataset, we achieved a 4.1% relative improvement in Fmeasure over the best reported result in the literature. The features led to improvements of 17.1% and 20.5% on the new news and mi- croblogs test sets respectively.</p><p>same-paper 5 0.80737072 <a title="40-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Advancements_in_Reordering_Models_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">40 acl-2013-Advancements in Reordering Models for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Minwei Feng ; Jan-Thorsten Peter ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel reordering model based on sequence labeling techniques. Our model converts the reordering problem into a sequence labeling problem, i.e. a tagging task. Results on five Chinese-English NIST tasks show that our model improves the baseline system by 1.32 BLEU and 1.53 TER on average. Results of comparative study with other seven widely used reordering models will also be reported.</p><p>6 0.80492038 <a title="40-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>

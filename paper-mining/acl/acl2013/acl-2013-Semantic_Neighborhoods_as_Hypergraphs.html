<p>Author: Haonan Yu ; Jeffrey Mark Siskind</p><p>Abstract: We present a method that learns representations for word meanings from short video clips paired with sentences. Unlike prior work on learning language from symbolic input, our input consists of video of people interacting with multiple complex objects in outdoor environments. Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts si- multaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of new video.</p><p>3 0.14130479 <a title="311-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrasing_Adaptation_for_Web_Search_Ranking.html">273 acl-2013-Paraphrasing Adaptation for Web Search Ranking</a></p>
<p>Author: Chenguang Wang ; Nan Duan ; Ming Zhou ; Ming Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Mismatch between queries and documents is a key issue for the web search task. In order to narrow down such mismatch, in this paper, we present an in-depth investigation on adapting a paraphrasing technique to web search from three aspects: a search-oriented paraphrasing model; an NDCG-based parameter optimization algorithm; an enhanced ranking model leveraging augmented features computed on paraphrases of original queries. Ex- periments performed on the large scale query-document data set show that, the search performance can be significantly improved, with +3.28% and +1.14% NDCG gains on dev and test sets respectively.</p><p>4 0.12256512 <a title="311-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Identification_of_Speakers_in_Novels.html">184 acl-2013-Identification of Speakers in Novels</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua He ; Denilson Barbosa ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Speaker identification is the task of at- tributing utterances to characters in a literary narrative. It is challenging to auto- mate because the speakers of the majority ofutterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.</p><p>5 0.12124421 <a title="311-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Utterance-Level_Multimodal_Sentiment_Analysis.html">379 acl-2013-Utterance-Level Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronica Perez-Rosas ; Rada Mihalcea ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: During real-life interactions, people are naturally gesturing and modulating their voice to emphasize specific points or to express their emotions. With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality.</p><p>6 0.11511912 <a title="311-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>

<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars have the unusual property of not always defining tight distributions (i.e., the sum of the “probabilities” of the trees the grammar generates can be less than one). This paper reviews how this non-tightness can arise and discusses its impact on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs. We begin by presenting the notion of “almost everywhere tight grammars” and show that linear CFGs follow it. We then propose three different ways of reinterpreting non-tight PCFGs to make them tight, show that the Bayesian estimators in Johnson et al. (2007) are correct under one of them, and provide MCMC samplers for the other two. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of tightness empirically.</p><p>3 0.70578212 <a title="311-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-General_binarization_for_parsing_and_translation.html">165 acl-2013-General binarization for parsing and translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaojun Quan ; Chunyu Kit ; Yan Song</p><p>Abstract: This paper studies the problem of nonmonotonic sentence alignment, motivated by the observation that coupled sentences in real bitexts do not necessarily occur monotonically, and proposes a semisupervised learning approach based on two assumptions: (1) sentences with high affinity in one language tend to have their counterparts with similar relatedness in the other; and (2) initial alignment is readily available with existing alignment techniques. They are incorporated as two constraints into a semisupervised learning framework for optimization to produce a globally optimal solution. The evaluation with realworld legal data from a comprehensive legislation corpus shows that while exist- ing alignment algorithms suffer severely from non-monotonicity, this approach can work effectively on both monotonic and non-monotonic data.</p><p>5 0.68033707 <a title="311-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Multilingual_Affect_Polarity_and_Valence_Prediction_in_Metaphor-Rich_Texts.html">253 acl-2013-Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphor-Rich Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>6 0.66559762 <a title="311-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

<p>Author: Yu Sawai ; Mamoru Komachi ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: We propose a verb suggestion method which uses candidate sets and domain adaptation to incorporate error patterns produced by ESL learners. The candidate sets are constructed from a large scale learner corpus to cover various error patterns made by learners. Furthermore, the model is trained using both a native corpus and the learner corpus via a domain adaptation technique. Experiments on two learner corpora show that the candidate sets increase the coverage of error patterns and domain adaptation improves the performance for verb suggestion.</p><p>3 0.067428261 <a title="122-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Collocation_Suggestion_for_Japanese_Second_Language_Learners.html">58 acl-2013-Automated Collocation Suggestion for Japanese Second Language Learners</a></p>
<p>Author: Lis Pereira ; Erlyn Manguilimotan ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: This study addresses issues of Japanese language learning concerning word combinations (collocations). Japanese learners may be able to construct grammatically correct sentences, however, these may sound “unnatural”. In this work, we analyze correct word combinations using different collocation measures and word similarity methods. While other methods use well-formed text, our approach makes use of a large Japanese language learner corpus for generating collocation candidates, in order to build a system that is more sensitive to constructions that are difficult for learners. Our results show that we get better results compared to other methods that use only wellformed text. 1</p><p>4 0.054157756 <a title="122-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Machine_Translation_Detection_from_Monolingual_Web-Text.html">235 acl-2013-Machine Translation Detection from Monolingual Web-Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuki Arase ; Ming Zhou</p><p>Abstract: We propose a method for automatically detecting low-quality Web-text translated by statistical machine translation (SMT) systems. We focus on the phrase salad phenomenon that is observed in existing SMT results and propose a set of computationally inexpensive features to effectively detect such machine-translated sentences from a large-scale Web-mined text. Unlike previous approaches that require bilingual data, our method uses only monolingual text as input; therefore it is applicable for refining data produced by a variety of Web-mining activities. Evaluation results show that the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 95.8% for sentences and 80.6% for text in noisy Web pages.</p><p>5 0.045861643 <a title="122-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>6 0.040181514 <a title="122-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-A_New_Set_of_Norms_for_Semantic_Relatedness_Measures.html">12 acl-2013-A New Set of Norms for Semantic Relatedness Measures</a></p>

<p>Author: Veronika Vincze ; Istvan Nagy T. ; Richard Farkas</p><p>Abstract: Here, we introduce a machine learningbased approach that allows us to identify light verb constructions (LVCs) in Hungarian and English free texts. We also present the results of our experiments on the SzegedParalellFX English–Hungarian parallel corpus where LVCs were manually annotated in both languages. With our approach, we were able to contrast the performance of our method and define language-specific features for these typologically different languages. Our presented method proved to be sufficiently robust as it achieved approximately the same scores on the two typologically different languages.</p><p>5 0.61204374 <a title="122-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Understanding_Verbs_based_on_Overlapping_Verbs_Senses.html">366 acl-2013-Understanding Verbs based on Overlapping Verbs Senses</a></p>
<p>Author: Kavitha Rajan</p><p>Abstract: Natural language can be easily understood by everyone irrespective of their differences in age or region or qualification. The existence of a conceptual base that underlies all natural languages is an accepted claim as pointed out by Schank in his Conceptual Dependency (CD) theory. Inspired by the CD theory and theories in Indian grammatical tradition, we propose a new set of meaning primitives in this paper. We claim that this new set of primitives captures the meaning inherent in verbs and help in forming an inter-lingual and computable ontological classification of verbs. We have identified seven primitive overlapping verb senses which substantiate our claim. The percentage of coverage of these primitives is 100% for all verbs in Sanskrit and Hindi and 3750 verbs in English. 1</p><p>6 0.56003511 <a title="122-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Robust_Automated_Natural_Language_Processing_with_Multiword_Expressions_and_Collocations.html">302 acl-2013-Robust Automated Natural Language Processing with Multiword Expressions and Collocations</a></p>

<p>Author: Kapila Ponnamperuma ; Advaith Siddharthan ; Cheng Zeng ; Chris Mellish ; Rene van der Wal</p><p>Abstract: The aim of the Tag2Blog system is to bring satellite tagged wild animals “to life” through narratives that place their movements in an ecological context. Our motivation is to use such automatically generated texts to enhance public engagement with a specific species reintroduction programme, although the protocols developed here can be applied to any animal or other movement study that involves signal data from tags. We are working with one of the largest nature conservation charities in Europe in this regard, focusing on a single species, the red kite. We describe a system that interprets a sequence of locational fixes obtained from a satellite tagged individual, and constructs a story around its use of the landscape.</p><p>2 0.70103514 <a title="122-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-The_effect_of_non-tightness_on_Bayesian_estimation_of_PCFGs.html">348 acl-2013-The effect of non-tightness on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs</a></p>
<p>Author: Shay B. Cohen ; Mark Johnson</p><p>Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars have the unusual property of not always defining tight distributions (i.e., the sum of the “probabilities” of the trees the grammar generates can be less than one). This paper reviews how this non-tightness can arise and discusses its impact on Bayesian estimation of PCFGs. We begin by presenting the notion of “almost everywhere tight grammars” and show that linear CFGs follow it. We then propose three different ways of reinterpreting non-tight PCFGs to make them tight, show that the Bayesian estimators in Johnson et al. (2007) are correct under one of them, and provide MCMC samplers for the other two. We conclude with a discussion of the impact of tightness empirically.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.6844582 <a title="122-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Approach_to_Fill-in-the-Blank_Quiz_Generation_for_Language_Learners.html">122 acl-2013-Discriminative Approach to Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generation for Language Learners</a></p>

<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>6 0.65254778 <a title="122-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>

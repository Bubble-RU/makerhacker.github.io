<p>Author: Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Ben King ; Mona Diab ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we use Arabic natural language processing techniques to analyze Arabic debates. The goal is to identify how the participants in a discussion split into subgroups with contrasting opinions. The members of each subgroup share the same opinion with respect to the discussion topic and an opposing opinion to the members of other subgroups. We use opinion mining techniques to identify opinion expressions and determine their polarities and their targets. We opinion predictions to represent the discussion in one of two formal representations: signed attitude network or a space of attitude vectors. We identify opinion subgroups by partitioning the signed network representation or by clustering the vector space representation. We evaluate the system using a data set of labeled discussions and show that it achieves good results.</p><p>3 0.31887418 <a title="211-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Identifying_Sentiment_Words_Using_an_Optimization-based_Model_without_Seed_Words.html">188 acl-2013-Identifying Sentiment Words Using an Optimization-based Model without Seed Words</a></p>

<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>5 0.2561729 <a title="211-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Ivan Titov ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.</p><p>6 0.2177254 <a title="211-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Co-Regression_for_Cross-Language_Review_Rating_Prediction.html">81 acl-2013-Co-Regression for Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction</a></p>

<p>Author: Ankit Ramteke ; Akshat Malu ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; J. Saketha Nath</p><p>Abstract: Thwarting and sarcasm are two uncharted territories in sentiment analysis, the former because of the lack of training corpora and the latter because of the enormous amount of world knowledge it demands. In this paper, we propose a working definition of thwarting amenable to machine learning and create a system that detects if the document is thwarted or not. We focus on identifying thwarting in product reviews, especially in the camera domain. An ontology of the camera domain is created. Thwarting is looked upon as the phenomenon of polarity reversal at a higher level of ontology compared to the polarity expressed at the lower level. This notion of thwarting defined with respect to an ontology is novel, to the best of our knowledge. A rule based implementation building upon this idea forms our baseline. We show that machine learning with annotated corpora (thwarted/nonthwarted) is more effective than the rule based system. Because of the skewed distribution of thwarting, we adopt the Areaunder-the-Curve measure of performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at the difficult problem of thwarting detection, which we hope will at Akshat Malu Dept. of Computer Science & Engg., Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, Mumbai, India. akshatmalu@ cse .i itb .ac .in J.

<p>Author: Rui Xia ; Tao Wang ; Xuelei Hu ; Shoushan Li ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Bag-of-words (BOW) is now the most popular way to model text in machine learning based sentiment classification. However, the performance of such approach sometimes remains rather limited due to some fundamental deficiencies of the BOW model. In this paper, we focus on the polarity shift problem, and propose a novel approach, called dual training and dual prediction (DTDP), to address it. The basic idea of DTDP is to first generate artificial samples that are polarity-opposite to the original samples by polarity reversion, and then leverage both the original and opposite samples for (dual) training and (dual) prediction. Experimental results on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach for polarity classification. 1</p><p>6 0.6967212 <a title="211-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Exploring_Sentiment_in_Social_Media%3A_Bootstrapping_Subjectivity_Clues_from_Multilingual_Twitter_Streams.html">148 acl-2013-Exploring Sentiment in Social Media: Bootstrapping Subjectivity Clues from Multilingual Twitter Streams</a></p>

<p>Author: Lian Tze Lim ; Lay-Ki Soon ; Tek Yong Lim ; Enya Kong Tang ; Bali Ranaivo-Malancon</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for word sense disambiguation and translation selection typically require lexical resources or large bilingual corpora with rich information fields and annotations, which are often infeasible for under-resourced languages. We extract translation context knowledge from a bilingual comparable corpora of a richer-resourced language pair, and inject it into a multilingual lexicon. The multilin- gual lexicon can then be used to perform context-dependent lexical lookup on texts of any language, including under-resourced ones. Evaluations on a prototype lookup tool, trained on a English–Malay bilingual Wikipedia corpus, show a precision score of 0.65 (baseline 0.55) and mean reciprocal rank score of 0.81 (baseline 0.771). Based on the early encouraging results, the context-dependent lexical lookup tool may be developed further into an intelligent reading aid, to help users grasp the gist of a second or foreign language text.</p><p>4 0.76203591 <a title="211-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>5 0.7596401 <a title="211-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Language_Independent_Connectivity_Strength_Features_for_Phrase_Pivot_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">214 acl-2013-Language Independent Connectivity Strength Features for Phrase Pivot Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmed El Kholy ; Nizar Habash ; Gregor Leusch ; Evgeny Matusov ; Hassan Sawaf</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge to statistical machine translation (SMT) is the lack of parallel data for many language pairs. One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations. In this paper, we present two language-independent features to improve the quality of phrase-pivot based SMT. The features, source connectivity strength and target connectivity strength reflect the quality of projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results (0.6 BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT as a case study.</p><p>6 0.75776184 <a title="211-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Development_and_Analysis_of_NLP_Pipelines_in_Argo.html">118 acl-2013-Development and Analysis of NLP Pipelines in Argo</a></p>

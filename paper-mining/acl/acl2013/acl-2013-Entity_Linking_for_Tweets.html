<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Hao Li ; Heng Ji ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Many current Natural Language Processing [NLP] techniques work well assuming a large context of text as input data. However they become ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds. To overcome the issue, we want to find a related newswire document to a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks. This requires robust modeling and understanding of the semantics of short texts. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-toNews task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ- ous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a graph based latent variable model that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information). This is motivated by the observation that a tweet usually only covers one aspect of an event. We show that using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus completes the semantic picture of a short text. Our experiments show significant improvement of our new model over baselines with three evaluation metrics in the new task.</p><p>3 0.27199993 <a title="139-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Event-Related_Links_and_Sentiments_from_Social_Media_Texts.html">115 acl-2013-Detecting Event-Related Links and Sentiments from Social Media Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral. In this manner, readers can follow the main events happening in the world, both from the perspective of mainstream as well as social media and the public’s perception on them. This system will be part of the EMM media monitoring framework working live and it will be demonstrated using Google Earth.</p><p>4 0.24208055 <a title="139-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Sequential_Summarization%3A_A_New_Application_for_Timely_Updated_Twitter_Trending_Topics.html">319 acl-2013-Sequential Summarization: A New Application for Timely Updated Twitter Trending Topics</a></p>
<p>Author: Dehong Gao ; Wenjie Li ; Renxian Zhang</p><p>Abstract: The growth of the Web 2.0 technologies has led to an explosion of social networking media sites. Among them, Twitter is the most popular service by far due to its ease for realtime sharing of information. It collects millions of tweets per day and monitors what people are talking about in the trending topics updated timely. Then the question is how users can understand a topic in a short time when they are frustrated with the overwhelming and unorganized tweets. In this paper, this problem is approached by sequential summarization which aims to produce a sequential summary, i.e., a series of chronologically ordered short subsummaries that collectively provide a full story about topic development. Both the number and the content of sub-summaries are automatically identified by the proposed stream-based and semantic-based approaches. These approaches are evaluated in terms of sequence coverage, sequence novelty and sequence correlation and the effectiveness of their combination is demonstrated. 1 Introduction and Background Twitter, as a popular micro-blogging service, collects millions of real-time short text messages (known as tweets) every second. It acts as not only a public platform for posting trifles about users’ daily lives, but also a public reporter for real-time news. Twitter has shown its powerful ability in information delivery in many events, like the wildfires in San Diego and the earthquake in Japan. Nevertheless, the side effect is individual users usually sink deep under millions of flooding-in tweets. To alleviate this problem, the applications like whatthetrend 1 have evolved from Twitter to provide services that encourage users to edit explanatory tweets about a trending topic, which can be regarded as topic summaries. It is to some extent a good way to help users understand trending topics. 1 whatthetrend.com There is also pioneering research in automatic Twitter trending topic summarization. (O'Connor et al., 2010) explained Twitter trending topics by providing a list of significant terms. Users could utilize these terms to drill down to the tweets which are related to the trending topics. (Sharifi et al., 2010) attempted to provide a one-line summary for each trending topic using phrase reinforcement ranking. The relevance model employed by (Harabagiu and Hickl, 2011) generated summaries in larger size, i.e., 250word summaries, by synthesizing multiple high rank tweets. (Duan et al., 2012) incorporate the user influence and content quality information in timeline tweet summarization and employ reinforcement graph to generate summaries for trending topics. Twitter summarization is an emerging research area. Current approaches still followed the traditional summarization route and mainly focused on mining tweets of both significance and representativeness. Though, the summaries generated in such a way can sketch the most important aspects of the topic, they are incapable of providing full descriptions of the changes of the focus of a topic, and the temporal information or freshness of the tweets, especially for those newsworthy trending topics, like earthquake and sports meeting. As the main information producer in Twitter, the massive crowd keeps close pace with the development of trending topics and provide the timely updated information. The information dynamics and timeliness is an important consideration for Twitter summarization. That is why we propose sequential summarization in this work, which aims to produce sequential summaries to capture the temporal changes of mass focus. Our work resembles update summarization promoted by TAC 2 which required creating summaries with new information assuming the reader has already read some previous documents under the same topic. Given two chronologically ordered documents sets about a topic, the systems were asked to generate two 2 www.nist.gov/tac 567 summaries, and the second one should inform the user of new information only. In order to achieve this goal, existing approaches mainly emphasized the novelty of the subsequent summary (Li and Croft, 2006; Varma et al., 2009; Steinberger and Jezek, 2009). Different from update summarization, we focus more on the temporal change of trending topics. In particular, we need to automatically detect the “update points” among a myriad of related tweets. It is the goal of this paper to set up a new practical summarization application tailored for timely updated Twitter messages. With the aim of providing a full description of the focus changes and the records of the timeline of a trending topic, the systems are expected to discover the chronologically ordered sets of information by themselves and they are free to generate any number of update summaries according to the actual situations instead of a fixed number of summaries as specified in DUC/TAC. Our main contributions include novel approaches to sequential summarization and corresponding evaluation criteria for this new application. All of them will be detailed in the following sections. 2 Sequential Summarization Sequential summarization proposed here aims to generate a series of chronologically ordered subsummaries for a given Twitter trending topic. Each sub-summary is supposed to represent one main subtopic or one main aspect of the topic, while a sequential summary, made up by the subsummaries, should retain the order the information is delivered to the public. In such a way, the sequential summary is able to provide a general picture of the entire topic development. 2.1 Subtopic Segmentation One of the keys to sequential summarization is subtopic segmentation. How many subtopics have attracted the public attention, what are they, and how are they developed? It is important to provide the valuable and organized materials for more fine-grained summarization approaches. We proposed the following two approaches to automatically detect and chronologically order the subtopics. 2.1.1 Stream-based Subtopic Detection and Ordering Typically when a subtopic is popular enough, it will create a certain level of surge in the tweet stream. In other words, every surge in the tweet stream can be regarded as an indicator of the appearance of a subtopic that is worthy of being summarized. Our early investigation provides evidence to support this assumption. By examining the correlations between tweet content changes and volume changes in randomly selected topics, we have observed that the changes in tweet volume can really provide the clues of topic development or changes of crowd focus. The stream-based subtopic detection approach employs the offline peak area detection (Opad) algorithm (Shamma et al., 2010) to locate such surges by tracing tweet volume changes. It regards the collection of tweets at each such surge time range as a new subtopic. Offline Peak Area Detection (Opad) Algorithm 1: Input: TS (tweets stream, each twi with timestamp ti); peak interval window ∆? (in hour), and time stepℎ (ℎ ≪ ∆?); 2: Output: Peak Areas PA. 3: Initial: two time slots: ?′ = ? = ?0 + ∆?; Tweet numbers: ?′ = ? = ?????(?) 4: while (?? = ? + ℎ) < ??−1 5: update ?′ = ?? + ∆? and ?′ = ?????(?′) 6: if (?′ < ? And up-hilling) 7: output one peak area ??? 8: state of down-hilling 9: else 10: update ? = ?′ and ? = ?′ 11: state of up-hilling 12: 13: function ?????(?) 14: Count tweets in time interval T The subtopics detected by the Opad algorithm are naturally ordered in the timeline. 2.1.2 Semantic-based Subtopic Detection and Ordering Basically the stream-based approach monitors the changes of the level of user attention. It is easy to implement and intuitively works, but it fails to handle the cases where the posts about the same subtopic are received at different time ranges due to the difference of geographical and time zones. This may make some subtopics scattered into several time slots (peak areas) or one peak area mixed with more than one subtopic. In order to sequentially segment the subtopics from the semantic aspect, the semantic-based subtopic detection approach breaks the time order of tweet stream, and regards each tweet as an individual short document. It takes advantage of Dynamic Topic Modeling (David and Michael, 2006) to explore the tweet content. 568 DTM in nature is a clustering approach which can dynamically generate the subtopic underlying the topic. Any clustering approach requires a pre-specified cluster number. To avoid tuning the cluster number experimentally, the subtopic number required by the semantic-based approach is either calculated according to heuristics or determined by the number of the peak areas detected from the stream-based approach in this work. Unlike the stream-based approach, the subtopics formed by DTM are the sets of distributions of subtopic and word probabilities. They are time independent. Thus, the temporal order among these subtopics is not obvious and needs to be discovered. We use the probabilistic relationships between tweets and topics learned from DTM to assign each tweet to a subtopic that it most likely belongs to. Then the subtopics are ordered temporally according to the mean values of their tweets’ timestamps. 2.2 Sequential Summary Generation Once the subtopics are detected and ordered, the tweets belonging to each subtopic are ranked and the most significant one is extracted to generate the sub-summary regarding that subtopic. Two different ranking strategies are adopted to conform to two different subtopic detection mechanisms. For a tweet in a peak area, the linear combination of two measures is considered to independently. Each sub-summary is up to 140 characters in length to comply with the limit of tweet, but the annotators are free to choose the number of sub-summaries. It ends up with 6.3 and 4.8 sub-summaries on average in a sequential summary written by the two annotators respectively. These two sets of sequential summaries are regarded as reference summaries to evaluate system-generated summaries from the following three aspects. Sequence Coverage Sequence coverage measures the N-gram match between system-generated summaries and human-written summaries (stopword removed first). Considering temporal information is an important factor in sequential summaries, we evaluate its significance to be a sub-summary: (1) subtopic representativeness measured by the  cosine similarity between the tweet and the centroid of all the tweets in the same peak area; (2) crowding endorsement measured by the times that the tweet is re-tweeted normalized by the total number of re-tweeting. With the DTM model, the significance of the tweets is evaluated directly by word distribution per subtopic. MMR (Carbonell and Goldstein, 1998) is used to reduce redundancy in sub-summary generation. 3 Experiments and Evaluations The experiments are conducted on the 24 Twitter trending topics collected using Twitter APIs 3 . The statistics are shown in Table 1. Due to the shortage of gold-standard sequential summaries, we invite two annotators to read the chronologically ordered tweets, and write a series of sub-summaries for each topic 3https://dev.twitter.com/ propose the position-aware coverage measure by accommodating the position information in matching. Let S={s1, s2, sk} denote a … … …, sequential summary and si the ith sub-summary, N-gram coverage is defined as: ???????? =|? 1?|?∑?∈? ?∑? ? ?∈?∙ℎ ?∑ ? ?∈?-?ℎ? ?∑? ∈-? ?,? ? ? ?∈? ? ? ? ? ? ? (ℎ?(?-?-? ? ? ?) where, ??? = |? − ?| + 1, i and j denote the serial numbers of the sub-summaries in the systemgenerated summary ??? and the human-written summary ?ℎ? , respectively. ? serves as a coefficient to discount long-distance matched sub-summaries. We evaluate unigram, bigram, and skipped bigram matches. Like in ROUGE (Lin, 2004), the skip distance is up to four words.  Sequence Novelty Sequence novelty evaluates the average novelty of two successive sub-summaries. Information content (IC) has been used to measure the novelty of update summaries by (Aggarwal et al., 2009). In this paper, the novelty of a system569 generated sequential summary is defined as the average of IC increments of two adjacent subsummaries, ??????? =|?|1 − 1?∑>1(????− ????, ??−1) × where |?| is the number of sub-summaries in the sequential summary. ???? = ∑?∈?? ??? . ????, ??−1 = ∑?∈??∩??−1 ??? is the overlapped information in the two adjacent sub-summaries. ??? = ???? ?????????(?, ???) where w is a word, ???? is the inverse tweet frequency of w, and ??? is all the tweets in the trending topic. The relevance function is introduced to ensure that the information brought by new sub-summaries is not only novel but also related to the topic.  Sequence Correlation Sequence correlation evaluates the sequential matching degree between system-generated and human-written summaries. In statistics, Kendall’s tau coefficient is often used to measure the association between two sequences (Lapata, 2006). The basic idea is to count the concordant and discordant pairs which contain the same elements in two sequences. Borrowing this idea, for each sub-summary in a human-generated summary, we find its most matched subsummary (judged by the cosine similarity measure) in the corresponding system-generated summary and then define the correlation according to the concordance between the two matched sub-summary sequences. ??????????? 2(|#???????????????| |#???????????????|) − = ?(? − 1) where n is the number of human-written subsummaries. Tables 2 and 3 below present the evaluation results. For the stream-based approach, we set ∆t=3 hours experimentally. For the semanticbased approach, we compare three different approaches to defining the sub-topic number K: (1) Semantic-based 1: Following the approach proposed in (Li et al., 2007), we first derive the matrix of tweet cosine similarity. Given the 1norm of eigenvalues ?????? (? = 1, 2, ,?) of the similarity matrix and the ratios ?? = ??????/?2 , the subtopic number ? = ? + 1 if ?? − ??+1 > ? (? 0.4 ). (2) Semantic-based 2: Using the rule of thumb in (Wan and Yang, 2008), ? = √? , where n is the tweet number. (3) Combined: K is defined as the number of the peak areas detected from the Opad algorithm, meanwhile we use the … = tweets within peak areas as the tweets of DTM. This is our new idea. The experiments confirm the superiority of the semantic-based approach over the stream-based approach in summary content coverage and novelty evaluations, showing that the former is better at subtopic content modeling. The subsummaries generated by the stream-based approach have comparative sequence (i.e., order) correlation with the human summaries. Combining the advantages the two approaches leads to the best overall results.

We develop several solutions to automatically detect, segment and order subtopics temporally, and extract the most significant tweets into the sub-summaries to compose sequential summaries. Empirically, the combination of the stream-based approach and the semantic-based approach leads to sequential summaries with high coverage, low redundancy, and good order.

<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Guang Xiang ; Chris Dyer ; Alan Black ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In the ever-expanding sea of microblog data, there is a surprising amount of naturally occurring parallel text: some users create post multilingual messages targeting international audiences while others “retweet” translations. We present an efficient method for detecting these messages and extracting parallel segments from them. We have been able to extract over 1M Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo (the Chinese counterpart of Twitter) using only their public APIs. As a supplement to existing parallel training data, our automatically extracted parallel data yields substantial translation quality improvements in translating microblog text and modest improvements in translating edited news commentary.

<p>Author: Xiaohua Liu ; Yitong Li ; Haocheng Wu ; Ming Zhou ; Furu Wei ; Yi Lu</p><p>Abstract: We study the task of entity linking for tweets, which tries to associate each mention in a tweet with a knowledge base entry. Two main challenges of this task are the dearth of information in a single tweet and the rich entity mention variations. To address these challenges, we propose a collective inference method that simultaneously resolves a set of mentions. Particularly, our model integrates three kinds of similarities, i.e., mention-entry similarity, entry-entry similarity, and mention-mention similarity, to enrich the context for entity linking, and to address irregular mentions that are not covered by the entity-variation dictionary. We evaluate our method on a publicly available data set and demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.</p><p>2 0.81011623 <a title="139-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Linking_Tweets_to_News%3A_A_Framework_to_Enrich_Short_Text_Data_in_Social_Media.html">233 acl-2013-Linking Tweets to News: A Framework to Enrich Short Text Data in Social Media</a></p>
<p>Author: Weiwei Guo ; Hao Li ; Heng Ji ; Mona Diab</p><p>Abstract: Many current Natural Language Processing [NLP] techniques work well assuming a large context of text as input data. However they become ineffective when applied to short texts such as Twitter feeds. To overcome the issue, we want to find a related newswire document to a given tweet to provide contextual support for NLP tasks. This requires robust modeling and understanding of the semantics of short texts. The contribution of the paper is two-fold: 1. we introduce the Linking-Tweets-toNews task as well as a dataset of linked tweet-news pairs, which can benefit many NLP applications; 2. in contrast to previ- ous research which focuses on lexical features within the short texts (text-to-word information), we propose a graph based latent variable model that models the inter short text correlations (text-to-text information). This is motivated by the observation that a tweet usually only covers one aspect of an event. We show that using tweet specific feature (hashtag) and news specific feature (named entities) as well as temporal constraints, we are able to extract text-to-text correlations, and thus completes the semantic picture of a short text. Our experiments show significant improvement of our new model over baselines with three evaluation metrics in the new task.</p><p>3 0.77452528 <a title="139-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-A_Stacking-based_Approach_to_Twitter_User_Geolocation_Prediction.html">20 acl-2013-A Stacking-based Approach to Twitter User Geolocation Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Han ; Paul Cook ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: We implement a city-level geolocation prediction system for Twitter users. The system infers a user’s location based on both tweet text and user-declared metadata using a stacking approach. We demonstrate that the stacking method substantially outperforms benchmark methods, achieving 49% accuracy on a benchmark dataset. We further evaluate our method on a recent crawl of Twitter data to investigate the impact of temporal factors on model generalisation. Our results suggest that user-declared location metadata is more sensitive to temporal change than the text of Twitter messages. We also describe two ways of accessing/demoing our system.</p><p>4 0.72985935 <a title="139-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Study_on_Uncertainty_Identification_in_Social_Media_Context.html">45 acl-2013-An Empirical Study on Uncertainty Identification in Social Media Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhongyu Wei ; Junwen Chen ; Wei Gao ; Binyang Li ; Lanjun Zhou ; Yulan He ; Kam-Fai Wong</p><p>Abstract: Uncertainty text detection is important to many social-media-based applications since more and more users utilize social media platforms (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, etc.) as information source to produce or derive interpretations based on them. However, existing uncertainty cues are ineffective in social media context because of its specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a variant of annotation scheme for uncertainty identification and construct the first uncertainty corpus based on tweets. We then conduct experiments on the generated tweets corpus to study the effectiveness of different types of features for uncertainty text identification.</p><p>5 0.70504898 <a title="139-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Chronic_Critics_Based_on_Sentiment_Polarity_and_User%C3%A2%E2%80%A2%C5%BDs_Behavior_in_Social_Media.html">114 acl-2013-Detecting Chronic Critics Based on Sentiment Polarity and Userâ•Žs Behavior in Social Media</a></p>
<p>Author: Sho Takase ; Akiko Murakami ; Miki Enoki ; Naoaki Okazaki ; Kentaro Inui</p><p>Abstract: There are some chronic critics who always complain about the entity in social media. We are working to automatically detect these chronic critics to prevent the spread of bad rumors about the reputation of the entity. In social media, most comments are informal, and, there are sarcastic and incomplete contexts. This means that it is difficult for current NLP technology such as opinion mining to recognize the complaints. As an alternative approach for social media, we can assume that users who share the same opinions will link to each other. Thus, we propose a method that combines opinion mining with graph analysis for the connections between users to identify the chronic critics. Our ex- perimental results show that the proposed method outperforms analysis based only on opinion mining techniques.</p><p>6 0.67988175 <a title="139-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Sequential_Summarization%3A_A_New_Application_for_Timely_Updated_Twitter_Trending_Topics.html">319 acl-2013-Sequential Summarization: A New Application for Timely Updated Twitter Trending Topics</a></p>

<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Wanxiang Che ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We intro- duce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</p><p>3 0.86889154 <a title="139-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Exact_Maximum_Inference_for_the_Fertility_Hidden_Markov_Model.html">143 acl-2013-Exact Maximum Inference for the Fertility Hidden Markov Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Chris Quirk</p><p>Abstract: The notion of fertility in word alignment (the number of words emitted by a single state) is useful but difficult to model. Initial attempts at modeling fertility used heuristic search methods. Recent approaches instead use more principled approximate inference techniques such as Gibbs sampling for parameter estimation. Yet in practice we also need the single best alignment, which is difficult to find using Gibbs. Building on recent advances in dual decomposition, this paper introduces an exact algorithm for finding the single best alignment with a fertility HMM. Finding the best alignment appears important, as this model leads to a substantial improvement in alignment quality.</p><p>4 0.86865622 <a title="139-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel bilingual word alignment approach based on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has been proven to be very effective in various machine learning tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.</p><p>5 0.8682375 <a title="139-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering.html">272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</a></p>
<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><p>6 0.86816055 <a title="139-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Arguments_and_Modifiers_from_the_Learner%27s_Perspective.html">57 acl-2013-Arguments and Modifiers from the Learner's Perspective</a></p>

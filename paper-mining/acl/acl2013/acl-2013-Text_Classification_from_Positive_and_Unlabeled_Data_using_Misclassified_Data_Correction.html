<p>Author: Michael Lucas ; Doug Downey</p><p>Abstract: Semi-supervised learning (SSL) methods augment standard machine learning (ML) techniques to leverage unlabeled data. SSL techniques are often effective in text classification, where labeled data is scarce but large unlabeled corpora are readily available. However, existing SSL techniques typically require multiple passes over the entirety of the unlabeled data, meaning the techniques are not applicable to large corpora being produced today. In this paper, we show that improving marginal word frequency estimates using unlabeled data can enable semi-supervised text classification that scales to massive unlabeled data sets. We present a novel learning algorithm, which optimizes a Naive Bayes model to accord with statistics calculated from the unlabeled corpus. In experiments with text topic classification and sentiment analysis, we show that our method is both more scalable and more accurate than SSL techniques from previous work.</p><p>3 0.13186471 <a title="342-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Graph-based_Semi-Supervised_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">173 acl-2013-Graph-based Semi-Supervised Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a graph-based semisupervised joint model of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The proposed approach is based on a graph-based label propagation technique. One constructs a nearest-neighbor similarity graph over all trigrams of labeled and unlabeled data for propagating syntactic information, i.e., label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as virtual evidences to regularize the learning of linear conditional random fields (CRFs) on unlabeled data. An inductive character-based joint model is obtained eventually. Empirical results on Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research corpora (MSR) reveal that the proposed model can yield better results than the supervised baselines and other competitive semi-supervised CRFs in this task.</p><p>4 0.11362565 <a title="342-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Building_Comparable_Corpora_Based_on_Bilingual_LDA_Model.html">74 acl-2013-Building Comparable Corpora Based on Bilingual LDA Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Zede Zhu ; Miao Li ; Lei Chen ; Zhenxin Yang</p><p>Abstract: Comparable corpora are important basic resources in cross-language information processing. However, the existing methods of building comparable corpora, which use intertranslate words and relative features, cannot evaluate the topical relation between document pairs. This paper adopts the bilingual LDA model to predict the topical structures of the documents and proposes three algorithms of document similarity in different languages. Experiments show that the novel method can obtain similar documents with consistent top- ics own better adaptability and stability performance.</p><p>5 0.1094246 <a title="342-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Co-Regression_for_Cross-Language_Review_Rating_Prediction.html">81 acl-2013-Co-Regression for Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan</p><p>Abstract: The task of review rating prediction can be well addressed by using regression algorithms if there is a reliable training set of reviews with human ratings. In this paper, we aim to investigate a more challenging task of crosslanguage review rating prediction, which makes use of only rated reviews in a source language (e.g. English) to predict the rating scores of unrated reviews in a target language (e.g. German). We propose a new coregression algorithm to address this task by leveraging unlabeled reviews. Evaluation results on several datasets show that our proposed co-regression algorithm can consistently improve the prediction results. 1</p><p>6 0.10466724 <a title="342-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

<p>Author: Asli Celikyilmaz ; Dilek Hakkani-Tur ; Gokhan Tur ; Ruhi Sarikaya</p><p>Abstract: Microsoft Research Microsoft Mountain View, CA, USA Redmond, WA, USA dilek @ ieee .org rus arika@mi cro s o ft . com gokhan .tur @ ieee .org performance (Tur and DeMori, 2011). This requires a tedious and time intensive data collection Finding concepts in natural language utterances is a challenging task, especially given the scarcity of labeled data for learning semantic ambiguity. Furthermore, data mismatch issues, which arise when the expected test (target) data does not exactly match the training data, aggravate this scarcity problem. To deal with these issues, we describe an efficient semisupervised learning (SSL) approach which has two components: (i) Markov Topic Regression is a new probabilistic model to cluster words into semantic tags (concepts). It can efficiently handle semantic ambiguity by extending standard topic models with two new features. First, it encodes word n-gram features from labeled source and unlabeled target data. Second, by going beyond a bag-of-words approach, it takes into account the inherent sequential nature of utterances to learn semantic classes based on context. (ii) Retrospective Learner is a new learning technique that adapts to the unlabeled target data. Our new SSL approach improves semantic tagging performance by 3% absolute over the baseline models, and also compares favorably on semi-supervised syntactic tagging.</p><p>4 0.65877122 <a title="342-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

Some of these data are in the form of free text and require preprocessing to be able to used in automated systems. Efficient and effective use of this data could be vital to the speed and quality of health care. As a case study, we analyzed classification of CT imaging reports into binary categories. In addition to regular text classification, we utilized topic modeling of the entire dataset in various ways. Topic modeling of the corpora provides interpretable themes that exist in these reports. Representing reports according to their topic distributions is more compact than bag-of-words representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent automated processes. A binary topic model was also built as an unsupervised classification approach with the assumption that each topic corresponds to a class. And, finally an aggregate topic classifier was built where reports are classified based on a single discriminative topic that is determined from the training dataset. Our proposed topic based classifier system is shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and provides a more efficient and interpretable representation.</p><p>5 0.6507163 <a title="342-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Part-of-speech_tagging_with_antagonistic_adversaries.html">277 acl-2013-Part-of-speech tagging with antagonistic adversaries</a></p>
<p>Author: Anders Sgaard</p><p>Abstract: Supervised NLP tools and on-line services are often used on data that is very different from the manually annotated data used during development. The performance loss observed in such cross-domain applications is often attributed to covariate shifts, with out-of-vocabulary effects as an important subclass. Many discriminative learning algorithms are sensitive to such shifts because highly indicative features may swamp other indicative features. Regularized and adversarial learning algorithms have been proposed to be more robust against covariate shifts. We present a new perceptron learning algorithm using antagonistic adversaries and compare it to previous proposals on 12 multilin- gual cross-domain part-of-speech tagging datasets. While previous approaches do not improve on our supervised baseline, our approach is better across the board with an average 4% error reduction.</p><p>6 0.6502623 <a title="342-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Co-Regression_for_Cross-Language_Review_Rating_Prediction.html">81 acl-2013-Co-Regression for Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction</a></p>

As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy.</p><p>5 0.66583669 <a title="342-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Specific_Coreference_Resolution_with_Lexicalized_Features.html">130 acl-2013-Domain-Specific Coreference Resolution with Lexicalized Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolvers rely heavily on string matching, syntactic properties, and semantic attributes of words, but they lack the ability to make decisions based on individual words. In this paper, we explore the benefits of lexicalized features in the setting of domain-specific coreference resolution. We show that adding lexicalized features to off-the-shelf coreference resolvers yields significant performance gains on four domain-specific data sets and with two types of coreference resolution architectures.</p><p>6 0.65777451 <a title="342-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Fine-grained_Semantic_Typing_of_Emerging_Entities.html">160 acl-2013-Fine-grained Semantic Typing of Emerging Entities</a></p>

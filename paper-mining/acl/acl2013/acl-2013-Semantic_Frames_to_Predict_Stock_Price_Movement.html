</p><p>5 1 Introduction A growing literature evaluates the financial effects of media on the market (Tetlock, 2007; Engelberg and Parsons, 2011). [sent-12, score-0.402]
</p><p>6 Recent work has applied NLP techniques to various financial media (conventional news, tweets) to detect sentiment in conventional news (Devitt and Ahmad, 2007; Haider and Mehrotra, 2011) or message boards (Chua et al. [sent-13, score-0.48]

</p><p>10 To test this hypothesis, we use  price information to label data from six years of financial news. [sent-62, score-0.606]
</p><p>11 Our experiments test several document representations for two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. [sent-63, score-0.439]
</p><p>12 Our main contribution is a novel tree representation based on semantic frame parses that performs significantly better than enriched bag-of-words vectors. [sent-64, score-0.508]
</p><p>13 Figure 1 shows a constructed example based on extracts from financial news about Google in April, 2012. [sent-65, score-0.357]

</p><p>18 To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to apply semantic frames in this domain. [sent-79, score-0.227]
</p><p>19 On the polarity task, the semantic frame features encoded as trees perform significantly better across years and sectors than bag-of-words vectors (BOW), and outperform BOW vectors enhanced with semantic frame features, and a supervised topic modeling approach. [sent-80, score-1.087]
</p><p>20 The results on the price change task show the same trend, but are not statistically significant, possibly due to the volatility of the market in 2007 and the following several years. [sent-81, score-0.603]
</p><p>21 Yet even modest predictive performance on both tasks could have an impact, as discussed  below, if incorporated into financial models such as Rydberg and Shephard (2003). [sent-82, score-0.235]
</p><p>22 Section 4 presents vector-based and tree-based features from semantic frame parses, and section 5 describes our dataset. [sent-84, score-0.366]
</p><p>23 Many news organizations that feature financial news, such as Reuters, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, devote significant resources to the analysis of corporate news. [sent-87, score-0.397]
</p><p>24 Much of the data that would support studies of a link between the news media and the market are publicly available. [sent-88, score-0.289]
</p><p>25 Because very few stock market investors directly observe firms’ production activities, they get most of their information sec-  ondhand. [sent-91, score-0.405]
</p><p>26 We hypothesize that semantic frames can address these issues. [sent-107, score-0.227]
</p><p>27 Most of the NLP literature on semantic frames addresses how to build robust semantic frame parsers, with intrinsic evaluation against gold standard parses. [sent-108, score-0.593]
</p><p>28 There have been few applications of semantic frame parsing for extrinsic tasks. [sent-109, score-0.366]
</p><p>29 To test for measurable benefits of semantic frame parsing, this paper poses the following questions: 1. [sent-110, score-0.366]
</p><p>30 Are semantic frames useful for document representation of financial news? [sent-111, score-0.498]
</p><p>31 Rather, we investigate whether computational linguistic methodologies can improve our understanding of a company’s fundamental market value, and whether linguistic information derived  from news produces a consistent enough result to benefit more comprehensive financial models. [sent-119, score-0.486]
</p><p>32 3  Related Work  NLP has recently been applied to financial text for market analysis, primarily using bag-ofwords (BOW) document representation. [sent-120, score-0.364]
</p><p>33 Luss and d’Aspremont (2008) use text classification to model price movements of financial assets on a per-day basis. [sent-121, score-0.599]

</p><p>37 They find that graph centrality measures like page rank and degree are more strongly correlated to both price and traded volume for an aggregation of similar companies, while individual stocks are less corre-  lated. [sent-129, score-0.333]
</p><p>38 (2000) present an approach to identify news stories that influence the behavior of financial markets, and predict trends in stock prices based on the content of news stories that precede the trends. [sent-131, score-0.771]
</p><p>39 We explore a rich feature space that relies on frame semantic parsing. [sent-134, score-0.366]
</p><p>40 Other resources for sentiment detection include the Dictionary of Affect in Language (DAL) to score the prior polarity of words, as in Agarwal et al. [sent-138, score-0.241]

</p><p>42 Our work addresses classification tasks that have potential relevance to an influential financial model (Rydberg and Shephard, 2003). [sent-147, score-0.266]
</p><p>43 This model decomposes stock price analysis of financial data into a three-part ADS model - activity (a binary  process modeling the price move or not), direction (another binary process modeling the direction of the moves) and size (a number quantifying the size of the moves). [sent-148, score-1.118]
</p><p>44 Our two binary classification tasks for news, price change and polarity, are analogous to their activity and direction. [sent-149, score-0.439]
</p><p>45 At present, our goal is limited to the determination of whether NLP features can uncover information from news that could help predict stock price movement or support analysts’ investigations. [sent-151, score-0.712]
</p><p>46 The second is a tree representation that encodes semantic frame features, and depends on tree kernel measures for support vector machine classification. [sent-154, score-0.596]
</p><p>47 The semantic parses of both methods are derived from SEMAFOR1 (Das and Smith, 2012; Das and Smith, 2011), which solves the se-  mantic parsing problem by rule-based target identification, log-linear model based frame identification and frame element filling. [sent-155, score-0.714]
</p><p>48 FrameNet defines hundreds of frames, each of  which represents a scenario associated with semantic roles, or frame elements, that serve as participants in the scenario the frame signifies. [sent-167, score-0.681]
</p><p>49 Here we use F for the frame name, FT for the target words, and FE for frame elements. [sent-172, score-0.63]

</p><p>55 If multiple frames have been assigned to the same designated object, their backbones are merged. [sent-192, score-0.347]

<p>Author: Alexandra Balahur ; Hristo Tanev</p><p>Abstract: Nowadays, the importance of Social Media is constantly growing, as people often use such platforms to share mainstream media news and comment on the events that they relate to. As such, people no loger remain mere spectators to the events that happen in the world, but become part of them, commenting on their developments and the entities involved, sharing their opinions and distributing related content. This paper describes a system that links the main events detected from clusters of newspaper articles to tweets related to them, detects complementary information sources from the links they contain and subsequently applies sentiment analysis to classify them into positive, negative and neutral.

<p>Author: Boyi Xie ; Rebecca J. Passonneau ; Leon Wu ; German G. Creamer</p><p>Abstract: Semantic frames are a rich linguistic resource. There has been much work on semantic frame parsers, but less that applies them to general NLP problems. We address a task to predict change in stock price from financial news. Semantic frames help to generalize from specific sentences to scenarios, and to detect the (positive or negative) roles of specific companies. We introduce a novel tree representation, and use it to train predictive models with tree kernels using support vector machines. Our experiments test multiple text representations on two binary classification tasks, change of price and polarity. Experiments show that features derived from semantic frame parsing have significantly better performance across years on the polarity task.</p><p>2 0.74334699 <a title="310-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Outsourcing_FrameNet_to_the_Crowd.html">265 acl-2013-Outsourcing FrameNet to the Crowd</a></p>

We compare two approaches: the first one is the standard annotation methodology of lexical units and frame elements in two steps, while the second is a novel approach aimed at acquiring frames in a bottom-up fashion, starting from frame element annotation. We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>3 0.66569704 <a title="310-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Diathesis_alternation_approximation_for_verb_clustering.html">119 acl-2013-Diathesis alternation approximation for verb clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Diana McCarthy ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Although diathesis alternations have been used as features for manual verb classification, and there is recent work on incorporating such features in computational models of human language acquisition, work on large scale verb classification has yet to examine the potential for using diathesis alternations as input features to the clustering process. This paper proposes a method for approximating diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus data and shows, using a state-of-the-art verb clustering system, that features based on alternation approximation outperform those based on independent subcategorization frames. Our alternation-based approach is particularly adept at leveraging information from less frequent data.</p><p>4 0.57857382 <a title="310-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>

<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selectional preferences (SPs) and verb classes capture related aspects of the predicateargument structure. We present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of these three types of information. We show how to utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our novel clustering algorithm constructs a joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and utilizes the efficient sampling algorithms of DPPs to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the induced clusters in the context of the three tasks and show results that are superior to strong baselines for each 1.</p><p>6 0.48850527 <a title="310-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-FrameNet_on_the_Way_to_Babel%3A_Creating_a_Bilingual_FrameNet_Using_Wiktionary_as_Interlingual_Connection.html">162 acl-2013-FrameNet on the Way to Babel: Creating a Bilingual FrameNet Using Wiktionary as Interlingual Connection</a></p>

<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Graham Neubig ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Hajime Tsukada</p><p>Abstract: Data selection is an effective approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation. The idea is to use language models trained on small in-domain text to select similar sentences from large general-domain corpora, which are then incorporated into the training data. Substantial gains have been demonstrated in previous works, which employ standard ngram language models. Here, we explore the use of neural language models for data selection. We hypothesize that the continuous vector representation of words in neural language models makes them more effective than n-grams for modeling un- known word contexts, which are prevalent in general-domain text. In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.79359984 <a title="310-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Semantic_Frames_to_Predict_Stock_Price_Movement.html">310 acl-2013-Semantic Frames to Predict Stock Price Movement</a></p>

<p>Author: Kun Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Keh-Yih Su</p><p>Abstract: Since statistical machine translation (SMT) and translation memory (TM) complement each other in matched and unmatched regions, integrated models are proposed in this paper to incorporate TM information into phrase-based SMT. Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese–English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system. Be- . sides, the proposed models also outperform previous approaches significantly.</p><p>4 0.60903066 <a title="310-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Vector_Space_Model_for_Adaptation_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">383 acl-2013-Vector Space Model for Adaptation in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Boxing Chen ; Roland Kuhn ; George Foster</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation (SMT) based on a vector space model (VSM). The general idea is first to create a vector profile for the in-domain development (“dev”) set. This profile might, for instance, be a vector with a dimensionality equal to the number of training subcorpora; each entry in the vector reflects the contribution of a particular subcorpus to all the phrase pairs that can be extracted from the dev set. Then, for each phrase pair extracted from the training data, we create a vector with features defined in the same way, and calculate its similarity score with the vector representing the dev set. Thus, we obtain a de- coding feature whose value represents the phrase pair’s closeness to the dev. This is a simple, computationally cheap form of instance weighting for phrase pairs. Experiments on large scale NIST evaluation data show improvements over strong baselines: +1.8 BLEU on Arabic to English and +1.4 BLEU on Chinese to English over a non-adapted baseline, and significant improvements in most circumstances over baselines with linear mixture model adaptation. An informal analysis suggests that VSM adaptation may help in making a good choice among words with the same meaning, on the basis of style and genre.</p><p>5 0.54472089 <a title="310-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>6 0.54190058 <a title="310-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Explicit_and_Implicit_Syntactic_Features_for_Text_Classification.html">144 acl-2013-Explicit and Implicit Syntactic Features for Text Classification</a></p>

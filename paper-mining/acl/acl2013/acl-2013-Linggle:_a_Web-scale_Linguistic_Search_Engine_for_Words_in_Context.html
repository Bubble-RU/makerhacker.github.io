<h1>231 acl-2013-Linggle: a Web-scale Linguistic Search Engine for Words in Context</h1>

<p>Author: Romain Deveaud ; Eric SanJuan ; Patrice Bellot</p><p>Abstract: The current topic modeling approaches for Information Retrieval do not allow to explicitly model query-oriented latent topics. More, the semantic coherence of the topics has never been considered in this field. We propose a model-based feedback approach that learns Latent Dirichlet Allocation topic models on the top-ranked pseudo-relevant feedback, and we measure the semantic coherence of those topics. We perform a first experimental evaluation using two major TREC test collections. Results show that retrieval perfor- mances tend to be better when using topics with higher semantic coherence.</p><p>3 0.11489443 <a title="231-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-ICARUS_-_An_Extensible_Graphical_Search_Tool_for_Dependency_Treebanks.html">183 acl-2013-ICARUS - An Extensible Graphical Search Tool for Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>5 0.10997845 <a title="231-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Crowd_Prefers_the_Middle_Path%3A_A_New_IAA_Metric_for_Crowdsourcing_Reveals_Turker_Biases_in_Query_Segmentation.html">99 acl-2013-Crowd Prefers the Middle Path: A New IAA Metric for Crowdsourcing Reveals Turker Biases in Query Segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rohan Ramanath ; Monojit Choudhury ; Kalika Bali ; Rishiraj Saha Roy</p><p>Abstract: Query segmentation, like text chunking, is the first step towards query understanding. In this study, we explore the effectiveness of crowdsourcing for this task. Through carefully designed control experiments and Inter Annotator Agreement metrics for analysis of experimental data, we show that crowdsourcing may not be a suitable approach for query segmentation because the crowd seems to have a very strong bias towards dividing the query into roughly equal (often only two) parts. Similarly, in the case of hierarchical or nested segmentation, turkers have a strong preference towards balanced binary trees.</p><p>6 0.1060999 <a title="231-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Question_Analysis_for_Polish_Question_Answering.html">290 acl-2013-Question Analysis for Polish Question Answering</a></p>

This paper studies the task of mining equivalent relations from Linked Data, which was insufficiently addressed before. We introduce an unsupervised method to measure equivalency of relation pairs and cluster equivalent relations. Early experiments have shown encouraging results with an average of 0.75~0.87 precision in predicting relation pair equivalency and 0.78~0.98 precision in relation clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.62590128 <a title="231-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_based_on_the_Latent_Topics_of_Important_Sentences_extracted_by_the_PageRank_Algorithm.html">341 acl-2013-Text Classification based on the Latent Topics of Important Sentences extracted by the PageRank Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Yukari Ogura ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to raise the accuracy of text classification based on latent topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary for good classification for example, to decide important sentences in a document, the sentences with important words are usually regarded as important sentences. In this case, tf.idf is often used to decide important words. On the other hand, we apply the PageRank algorithm to rank important words in each document. Furthermore, before clustering documents, we refine the target documents by representing them as a collection of important sentences in each document. We then classify the documents based on latent information in the documents. As a clustering method, we employ the k-means algorithm and inves– tigate how our proposed method works for good clustering. We conduct experiments with Reuters-21578 corpus under various conditions of important sentence extraction, using latent and surface information for clustering, and have confirmed that our proposed method provides better result among various conditions for clustering.</p><p>6 0.60324848 <a title="231-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Improved_Lexical_Acquisition_through_DPP-based_Verb_Clustering.html">192 acl-2013-Improved Lexical Acquisition through DPP-based Verb Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>2 0.83439052 <a title="231-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Statistical_NLG_Framework_for_Aggregated_Planning_and_Realization.html">21 acl-2013-A Statistical NLG Framework for Aggregated Planning and Realization</a></p>
<p>Author: Ravi Kondadadi ; Blake Howald ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid natural language generation (NLG) system that consolidates macro and micro planning and surface realization tasks into one statistical learning process. Our novel approach is based on deriving a template bank automatically from a corpus of texts from a target domain. First, we identify domain specific entity tags and Discourse Representation Structures on a per sentence basis. Each sentence is then organized into semantically similar groups (representing a domain specific concept) by k-means clustering. After this semi-automatic processing (human review of cluster assignments), a number of corpus–level statistics are compiled and used as features by a ranking SVM to develop model weights from a training corpus. At generation time, a set of input data, the collection of semantically organized templates, and the model weights are used to select optimal templates. Our system is evaluated with automatic, non–expert crowdsourced and expert evaluation metrics. We also introduce a novel automatic metric syntactic variability that represents linguistic variation as a measure of unique template sequences across a collection of automatically generated documents. The metrics for generated weather and biography texts fall within acceptable ranges. In sum, we argue that our statistical approach to NLG reduces the need for complicated knowledge-based architectures and readily adapts to different domains with reduced development time. – – *∗Ravi Kondadadi is now affiliated with Nuance Communications, Inc.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.82464433 <a title="231-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Linggle%3A_a_Web-scale_Linguistic_Search_Engine_for_Words_in_Context.html">231 acl-2013-Linggle: a Web-scale Linguistic Search Engine for Words in Context</a></p>

We plan to extend Linggle to provide fast and convenient access to a wealth of linguistic information embodied in Web scale datasets including Google Web 1T and Google Books Ngram for many major languages in the world. 1</p><p>4 0.7960704 <a title="231-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>5 0.79581875 <a title="231-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>6 0.78222293 <a title="231-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Syntactic_Patterns_versus_Word_Alignment%3A_Extracting_Opinion_Targets_from_Online_Reviews.html">336 acl-2013-Syntactic Patterns versus Word Alignment: Extracting Opinion Targets from Online Reviews</a></p>

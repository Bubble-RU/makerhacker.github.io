<p>Author: Ben King ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev ; Robert Mankoff</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of automatically annotating the factoids present in collective discourse. Factoids are information units that are shared between instances of collective discourse and may have many different ways ofbeing realized in words. Our approach divides this problem into two steps, using a graph-based approach for each step: (1) factoid discovery, finding groups of words that correspond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid assignment, using these groups of words to mark collective discourse units that contain the respective factoids. We study this on two novel data sets: the New Yorker caption contest data set, and the crossword clues data set.</p><p>3 0.13306485 <a title="23-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Align%2C_Disambiguate_and_Walk%3A_A_Unified_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity.html">43 acl-2013-Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Taher Pilehvar ; David Jurgens ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: seman- tic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.</p><p>4 0.11101662 <a title="23-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-DKPro_WSD%3A_A_Generalized_UIMA-based_Framework_for_Word_Sense_Disambiguation.html">105 acl-2013-DKPro WSD: A Generalized UIMA-based Framework for Word Sense Disambiguation</a></p>
<p>Author: Tristan Miller ; Nicolai Erbs ; Hans-Peter Zorn ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: Implementations of word sense disambiguation (WSD) algorithms tend to be tied to a particular test corpus format and sense inventory. This makes it difficult to test their performance on new data sets, or to compare them against past algorithms implemented for different data sets. In this paper we present DKPro WSD, a freely licensed, general-purpose framework for WSD which is both modular and extensible. DKPro WSD abstracts the WSD process in such a way that test corpora, sense inventories, and algorithms can be freely swapped. Its UIMA-based architecture makes it easy to add support for new resources and algorithms. Related tasks such as word sense induction and entity linking are also supported.</p><p>5 0.10617281 <a title="23-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Automated_Pyramid_Scoring_of_Summaries_using_Distributional_Semantics.html">59 acl-2013-Automated Pyramid Scoring of Summaries using Distributional Semantics</a></p>

<p>Author: Yukari Ogura ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to raise the accuracy of text classification based on latent topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary for good classification for example, to decide important sentences in a document, the sentences with important words are usually regarded as important sentences. In this case, tf.idf is often used to decide important words. On the other hand, we apply the PageRank algorithm to rank important words in each document. Furthermore, before clustering documents, we refine the target documents by representing them as a collection of important sentences in each document. We then classify the documents based on latent information in the documents. As a clustering method, we employ the k-means algorithm and invesâ€“ tigate how our proposed method works for good clustering. We conduct experiments with Reuters-21578 corpus under various conditions of important sentence extraction, using latent and surface information for clustering, and have confirmed that our proposed method provides better result among various conditions for clustering.</p><p>4 0.56348228 <a title="23-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-High-quality_Training_Data_Selection_using_Latent_Topics_for_Graph-based_Semi-supervised_Learning.html">182 acl-2013-High-quality Training Data Selection using Latent Topics for Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning</a></p>
<p>Author: Akiko Eriguchi ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In a multi-class document categorization using graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL), it is essential to construct a proper graph expressing the relation among nodes and to use a reasonable categorization algorithm. Furthermore, it is also important to provide high-quality correct data as training data. In this context, we propose a method to construct a similarity graph by employing both surface information and latent information to express similarity between nodes and a method to select high-quality training data for GBSSL by means of the PageR- ank algorithm. Experimenting on Reuters21578 corpus, we have confirmed that our proposed methods work well for raising the accuracy of a multi-class document categorization.</p><p>5 0.54576421 <a title="23-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Evolutionary_Hierarchical_Dirichlet_Process_for_Timeline_Summarization.html">142 acl-2013-Evolutionary Hierarchical Dirichlet Process for Timeline Summarization</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Sujian Li</p><p>Abstract: Timeline summarization aims at generating concise summaries and giving readers a faster and better access to understand the evolution of news. It is a new challenge which combines salience ranking problem with novelty detection. Previous researches in this field seldom explore the evolutionary pattern of topics such as birth, splitting, merging, developing and death. In this paper, we develop a novel model called Evolutionary Hierarchical Dirichlet Process(EHDP) to capture the topic evolution pattern in time- line summarization. In EHDP, time varying information is formulated as a series of HDPs by considering time-dependent information. Experiments on 6 different datasets which contain 3 156 documents demonstrates the good performance of our system with regard to ROUGE scores.</p><p>6 0.54554254 <a title="23-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>

We first analyze a labeled RTE-5 test set and find that the negative entailment phenomena are very effective features for TE recognition. Then, a method is proposed to extract this kind of phenomena from text-hypothesis pairs automatically. We evaluate the performance of using the negative entailment phenomena on both the English RTE-5 dataset and Chinese NTCIR-9 RITE dataset, and conclude the same findings.</p><p>3 0.74729073 <a title="23-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Lightly_Supervised_Learning_of_Procedural_Dialog_Systems.html">230 acl-2013-Lightly Supervised Learning of Procedural Dialog Systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>4 0.73554909 <a title="23-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Two-Neighbor_Orientation_Model_with_Cross-Boundary_Global_Contexts.html">363 acl-2013-Two-Neighbor Orientation Model with Cross-Boundary Global Contexts</a></p>
<p>Author: Hendra Setiawan ; Bowen Zhou ; Bing Xiang ; Libin Shen</p><p>Abstract: Long distance reordering remains one of the greatest challenges in statistical machine translation research as the key contextual information may well be beyond the confine of translation units. In this paper, we propose Two-Neighbor Orientation (TNO) model that jointly models the orientation decisions between anchors and two neighboring multi-unit chunks which may cross phrase or rule boundaries. We explicitly model the longest span of such chunks, referred to as Maximal Orientation Span, to serve as a global parameter that constrains underlying local decisions. We integrate our proposed model into a state-of-the-art string-to-dependency translation system and demonstrate the efficacy of our proposal in a large-scale Chinese-to-English translation task. On NIST MT08 set, our most advanced model brings around +2.0 BLEU and -1.0 TER improvement.</p><p>5 0.73430675 <a title="23-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-FudanNLP%3A_A_Toolkit_for_Chinese_Natural_Language_Processing.html">164 acl-2013-FudanNLP: A Toolkit for Chinese Natural Language Processing</a></p>
<p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Qi Zhang ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: The growing need for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) is largely in a range of research and commercial applications. However, most of the currently Chinese NLP tools or components still have a wide range of issues need to be further improved and developed. FudanNLP is an open source toolkit for Chinese natural language processing (NLP) , which uses statistics-based and rule-based methods to deal with Chinese NLP tasks, such as word segmentation, part-ofspeech tagging, named entity recognition, dependency parsing, time phrase recognition, anaphora resolution and so on.</p><p>6 0.73332626 <a title="23-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Approach_to_Fill-in-the-Blank_Quiz_Generation_for_Language_Learners.html">122 acl-2013-Discriminative Approach to Fill-in-the-Blank Quiz Generation for Language Learners</a></p>

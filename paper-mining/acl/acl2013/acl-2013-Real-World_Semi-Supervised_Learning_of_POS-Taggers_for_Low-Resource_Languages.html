While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger.

</p><p>5 It is thus important to develop approaches that achieve good accuracy based on the amount of data that can be reasonably obtained, for example, in just a few hours by a linguist doing fieldwork on a non-native language. [sent-15, score-0.263]
</p><p>6 Most research simulated weak supervision with tag dictionaries extracted from existing large, expertly-annotated corpora. [sent-17, score-0.202]
</p><p>7 They are also biased towards including only the most likely tag for each word type, resulting in a cleaner dictionary than one would find in a real scenario. [sent-19, score-0.169]
</p><p>8 Haghighi and Klein (2006) develop a model in which a POS-tagger is learned from a list of POS tags and just three “prototype” word types for each tag, but their approach requires a vector space to compute the distributional similarity between prototypes and other word types in the corpus. [sent-27, score-0.178]
</p><p>9 Such distributional models are not feasible for low-resource languages because they require immense amounts of raw text, much more than is available in these settings (Abney and Bird, 2010). [sent-28, score-0.254]
</p><p>10 (2013) evaluate the use of mixed type and token constraints generated by projecting information from a high-  resource language to a low-resource language via a parallel corpus. [sent-31, score-0.242]
</p><p>11 We also did not consider morphological analyzers as a form of type supervision, as suggested by Merialdo (1994). [sent-37, score-0.242]
</p><p>12 This paper addresses these questions via a series of experiments designed to quantify the effect on performance given by the amount of time spent finding or annotating training materials. [sent-38, score-0.247]
</p><p>13 Also, morphological analyzers help for morphologically rich languages when there are few labeled types or tokens (and, it never hurts to use them). [sent-46, score-0.453]
</p><p>14 With just four hours of type annotation, our system obtains good accuracy across the three languages: 89. [sent-48, score-0.297]
</p><p>15 (2012) use the entirety of English Wiktionary directly as a tag dictionary to obtain 87. [sent-54, score-0.169]
</p><p>16 For each language, sentences were divided into four sets: training data to be labeled by annotators, raw training data, development data, and test data. [sent-62, score-0.169]

</p><p>18 Collecting annotations Linguists with nonnative knowledge of KIN and MLG produced annotations for four hours (in 30-minute intervals) for two tasks. [sent-82, score-0.548]
</p><p>19 In the first task, type-supervision, the annotator was given a list of the words in the target language (ranked from most to least frequent), and they annotated each word type with its potential POS tags. [sent-83, score-0.234]
</p><p>20 The word types and frequencies used for this task were taken from the raw training data and did not include the test sets. [sent-84, score-0.218]
</p><p>21 The 30-minute intervals allow us to investigate the incremental benefit of additional annotation of each type as well as how both annotation types might be combined within a fixed  annotation budget. [sent-86, score-0.572]
</p><p>22 To see how differences in annotator speed and quality impact our task, we obtained ENG data from an experienced annotator and a novice one. [sent-88, score-0.541]
</p><p>23 ts  for ENG annotators on type and token annotations. [sent-96, score-0.268]
</p><p>24 With token-annotation, tag dictionary growth slows because high-frequency words are repeatedly annotated, producing only additional frequency and sequence information. [sent-98, score-0.169]
</p><p>25 In contrast, every type-annotation label is a new tag dictionary entry. [sent-99, score-0.169]
</p><p>26 For ENG, we can compare the tagging speed of the experienced annotator with the novice: 50% more tokens and 3 times as many types. [sent-101, score-0.399]
</p><p>27 The token-tagging speed stayed fairly constant for the experienced annotator, but the novice increased his rate, showing the result of practice. [sent-102, score-0.335]
</p><p>28 Comparing  the tag dictionary entries versus the test data, precision starts in the high 80%s and falls to to the mid-70%s in all cases. [sent-104, score-0.169]
</p><p>29 On types, the experienced annotator maxed out at 32%, but the novice only reaches 11%. [sent-106, score-0.41]
</p><p>30 Moreover, the maximum for token annotations is much lower due to high repeat-annotation. [sent-107, score-0.291]
</p><p>31 The discrepancies between experienced and novice, and between type and token recall explain a great deal of the performance disparity seen in the experiments. [sent-108, score-0.387]
</p><p>32 We use FSTs for morphologi-  cal analysis: the FST accepts a word type and produces a set of morphological features. [sent-111, score-0.18]
</p><p>33 Development of the FSTs for all three languages was done by iteratively adding rules and lexical  items with the goal of increasing coverage on a raw dataset. [sent-120, score-0.202]
</p><p>34 To accomplish this on a fixed time budget, the most frequently occurring unanalyzed tokens were examined, and their stems plus any observable morphological or phonological patterns were added to the transducer. [sent-121, score-0.243]
</p><p>35 Recall that most work on learning POS-taggers from tag dictionaries used tag dictionaries culled from test sets (even when considering incomplete dictionaries). [sent-139, score-0.306]
</p><p>36 We thus build on our previous approach, which exploits extremely sparse, human-generated annotations that are produced without knowledge of which words appear in the test set (Garrette and Baldridge, 2013). [sent-140, score-0.211]
</p><p>37 This approach generalizes a small initial tag dictionary to include unannotated word types appearing in raw data. [sent-141, score-0.429]
</p><p>38 It estimates word/tag pair and tag-transition frequency information using modelminimization, which also reduces noise introduced by automatic tag dictionary expansion. [sent-142, score-0.169]
</p><p>39 The approach exploits type annotations effectively to learn parameters for out-of-vocabulary words and infer missing frequency and sequence informa-  tion. [sent-143, score-0.282]
</p><p>40 The purpose oftag dictionary expansion is to estimate label distributions for tokens in a raw cor586  pus, including words missing in the annotations. [sent-145, score-0.292]
</p><p>41 Here, we modify the LP graph by supplementing or replacing generic affix features with a focused set of morphological features produced by an FST. [sent-155, score-0.225]
</p><p>42 Since the LP graph contains a node for each corpus token, and each node is labeled with a distribution over POS tags, the graph provides a corpus of sentences labeled with noisy tag distributions along with an expanded tag dictionary. [sent-162, score-0.24]
</p><p>43 (2010), which finds a minimal set of tag bigrams needed to explain the sentences in the raw corpus. [sent-165, score-0.237]
</p><p>44 The expanded tag dictionary constrains the EM search space by providing a limited tagset for each word type, steering EM towards a desirable result. [sent-167, score-0.169]
</p><p>45 5  Experiments3  To better understand the effect that each type of supervision has on tagger accuracy, we perform a series of experiments, with KIN and MLG as true low-resource languages. [sent-170, score-0.23]
</p><p>46 English experiments, for which we had both experienced and novice annotators, allow for further exploration into issues concerning data collection and preparation. [sent-171, score-0.307]
</p><p>47 8% for ENG using all types and the maximal amount of raw data. [sent-175, score-0.256]
</p><p>48 1 Types versus tokens Our primary question was the relationship between annotation type and time. [sent-179, score-0.307]
</p><p>49 To make the best use of their time, we need to know which annotations are most use3Code and all MLG data available at github . [sent-182, score-0.181]

</p><p>51 tagger accuracy for ENG type-only and token-only annotations with affix and FST LP features. [sent-188, score-0.404]
</p><p>52 Additionally, it is useful to identify when returns on annotation effort diminish so that annotators do not spend time doing work that is unlikely to add much value. [sent-190, score-0.328]
</p><p>53 The annotators produced four hours each of type and token annotations, each in 30-minute in-  crements. [sent-191, score-0.454]
</p><p>54 To assess the effects of annotation time, we trained taggers cumulatively on each increment and determine the value of each additional halfhour of effort. [sent-192, score-0.168]
</p><p>55 This indicates the LP procedure makes effective use of the morphological features produced by the FST and that the affix features are able to capture missing information without adding too much noise to the LP graph. [sent-196, score-0.225]
</p><p>56 Furthermore, performance is considerably better when type annotations are used than only tokens. [sent-197, score-0.282]
</p><p>57 Type annotations plateau much faster, so a shorter amount of time must be spent annotating types than if token annotations are used. [sent-198, score-0.794]
</p><p>58 5 hours to reach nearmaximum accuracy for types, but 2. [sent-200, score-0.196]
</p><p>59 This difference is due to the fact that the type annotations started with the most frequent words whereas the token annotations were on random  sentences. [sent-202, score-0.573]
</p><p>60 Thus, type annotations quickly cover a significant portion of the language’s tokens. [sent-203, score-0.282]
</p><p>61 With annotations directly on tokens, some of the highest 588  (a) KIN  −  Type/Token Annotation  Mixture  (b) MLG  −  Type/Token Annotation Mixture  Figure 3: Annotation mixture vs. [sent-204, score-0.227]

</p><p>64 frequency types are covered, but annotation time is also ineffectively used on low-frequency types that happen to appear in those sentences. [sent-213, score-0.336]
</p><p>65 Finally, the use of FST features yields the largest gains for KIN, but only when small amounts of annotation are available. [sent-214, score-0.237]
</p><p>66 But, with more annotations, the gains of the FST over affix features alone diminishes: the affix features eventually capture enough of the morphology to make up the difference. [sent-217, score-0.331]
</p><p>67 Figure 2 shows the dramatic differences between the experienced and novice ENG annotators. [sent-218, score-0.307]
</p><p>68 kens were similar after 30 minutes, but type annotations proved much more useful beyond that. [sent-221, score-0.282]
</p><p>69 In contrast, the novice annotated types much more slowly, so early on there were not enough annotated types for the training to be as effective. [sent-222, score-0.372]
</p><p>70 Even so, after three hours of annotation, type annotations still win with the novice, and even beat the experienced annotator labeling tokens. [sent-223, score-0.712]
</p><p>71 2 Mixing type and token annotations Because type and token annotations are each better at providing different information a tag dictionary of high-frequency words vs. [sent-225, score-0.953]
</p><p>72 This matters in low-resource settings because type or token annotations will likely be produced by the same people, so there is a tradeoff between spending resources on one form of annotation over the other. [sent-227, score-0.583]
</p><p>73 Understanding the best mixture of annotations can inform us on how to maximize the benefit of a set annotation budget. [sent-228, score-0.359]
</p><p>74 To this end, we ran experiments fixing the annotation time to four hours while varying the mix of type and token annotations. [sent-229, score-0.553]
</p><p>75 For KIN and ENG, tagger accuracy increases as the proportion of type annotations increases for all LP feature configurations. [sent-231, score-0.389]
</p><p>76 When only affix features are used, the optimal mixture is 1 hour of types and 3 hours of tokens. [sent-233, score-0.393]
</p><p>77 When FST and affix features are used, the optimum is 2 hours 589  each of types and tokens. [sent-234, score-0.347]
</p><p>78 The experienced annotator was much faster at annotating types and the speed difference was less pronounced for tokens, so accuracy is most similar when only token annotations are used. [sent-240, score-0.764]
</p><p>79 (2013) explore the use of mixed type and token annotations in which a tagger is learned by projecting information via parallel text. [sent-243, score-0.49]
</p><p>80 In their experiments, they—like us—  found that type information is more valuable than token information. [sent-244, score-0.211]
</p><p>81 However, they were able to see gains through the complementary effects of mixing type and token annotations. [sent-245, score-0.264]
</p><p>82 It seems that the amount of type information collected in four hours is not sufficient to saturate the system, meaning that switching to annotating tokens tends to hurt performance. [sent-247, score-0.451]
</p><p>83 Moreover, since large gains in accuracy can be achieved by spending a small amount of time just annotating word types with POS tags, we are led to conclude that time should be spent annotating types or tokens instead of developing an FST. [sent-252, score-0.729]
</p><p>84 While it is likely that FST development time would  have a greater impact for morphologically rich languages, we suspect that greater gains can still be obtained by instead annotating types. [sent-253, score-0.241]
</p><p>85 4 The effect of more raw data In addition to annotations, semi-supervised tagger training requires a corpus of raw text. [sent-256, score-0.353]
</p><p>86 Therefore, the collection of raw data can be considered another time-sensitive task for which the tradeoffs with previously-discussed annotation efforts must contend. [sent-264, score-0.301]
</p><p>87 It could be the case that more raw data for training could make up for additional annotation and FST development effort or make the LP procedure unnecessary. [sent-265, score-0.275]
</p><p>88 Figure 5 shows that that increased raw data does provide increasing gains, but they diminish after 200k tokens. [sent-266, score-0.174]
</p><p>89 Most importantly, however, removing either annotations or LP results in a significant de-  cline in accuracy, such that even with 600k training tokens, we are unable to achieve the results of high annotation and LP using only 100k tokens. [sent-268, score-0.313]
</p><p>90 Using this simulated “perfect annotator” data shows we lose accuracy due to annotator mistakes: for our experienced annotator and maximal FST, using 4 hours of types the oracle accuracy is 90. [sent-271, score-0.662]
</p><p>91 Nonetheless, we have explored realistic annotation scenarios for POStagging for low-resource languages and found several consistent patterns. [sent-282, score-0.22]
</p><p>92 Most importantly, it is clear that type annotations are the most useful input one can obtain from a linguist—provided a semi-supervised algorithm for projecting that information reliably onto raw tokens is available. [sent-283, score-0.53]
</p><p>93 The result of most immediate practical value is that we show it is possible to train effective POStaggers on actual low-resource languages given only a relatively small amount of unlabeled text and a few hours of annotation by a non-native linguist. [sent-285, score-0.385]
</p><p>94 Instead of having annotators label full sentences as one might expect the natural choice would be, it is much more effective to simply extract a list of the most frequent word types in the language and concentrate efforts on annotating these types with their potential parts of speech. [sent-286, score-0.315]
</p><p>95 Furthermore, for languages with rich morphology, a morphological transducer can yield significant performance gains when large amounts of other annotated resources are unavailable. [sent-287, score-0.273]
</p><p>96 However, using substantial amounts of raw text is unlikely to produce gains larger than only a few hours spent annotating types. [sent-290, score-0.559]
</p><p>97 Thus,  when deciding whether to spend time locating larger volumes of digitized text or to spend time annotating types, choose types. [sent-291, score-0.34]
</p><p>98 Despite the consistent superiority of type annotations in our experiments, it of course may be the case that techniques such as active learning may better select sentences for token annotation, so this should be explored in future work. [sent-292, score-0.418]

<p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Maria Skeppstedt</p><p>Abstract: For expanding a corpus of clinical text, annotated for named entities, a method that combines pre-tagging with a version of active learning is proposed. In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>4 0.12017439 <a title="295-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Stem_Translation_with_Affix-Based_Rule_Selection_for_Agglutinative_Languages.html">330 acl-2013-Stem Translation with Affix-Based Rule Selection for Agglutinative Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lu ; Meng Sun ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Current translation models are mainly designed for languages with limited morphology, which are not readily applicable to agglutinative languages as the difference in the way lexical forms are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translating agglutinative languages by treating stems and affixes differently. We employ stem as the atomic translation unit to alleviate data spareness. In addition, we associate each stemgranularity translation rule with a distribution of related affixes, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their affix distributions with given spans to be translated. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the translation performance on tasks of translating from three Turkic languages to Chinese.</p><p>5 0.098308183 <a title="295-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>

In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text.

<p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Mielens ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for low-resource languages often requires creating resources from scratch. While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger. Our results show that annotation of word types is the most important, provided a sufficiently capable semi-supervised learning infrastructure is in place to project type information onto a raw corpus.

In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>3 0.64227664 <a title="295-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Collective_Annotation_of_Linguistic_Resources%3A_Basic_Principles_and_a_Formal_Model.html">83 acl-2013-Collective Annotation of Linguistic Resources: Basic Principles and a Formal Model</a></p>
<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>4 0.63676333 <a title="295-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Categorization_of_Turkish_News_Documents_with_Morphological_Analysis.html">78 acl-2013-Categorization of Turkish News Documents with Morphological Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Long Duong ; Paul Cook ; Steven Bird ; Pavel Pecina</p><p>Abstract: We present an unsupervised approach to part-of-speech tagging based on projections of tags in a word-aligned bilingual parallel corpus. In contrast to the existing state-of-the-art approach of Das and Petrov, we have developed a substantially simpler method by automatically identifying “good” training sentences from the parallel corpus and applying self-training. In experimental results on eight languages, our method achieves state-of-the-art results. 1 Unsupervised part-of-speech tagging Currently, part-of-speech (POS) taggers are available for many highly spoken and well-resourced languages such as English, French, German, Italian, and Arabic. For example, Petrov et al. (2012) build supervised POS taggers for 22 languages using the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), with an average accuracy of 95.2%. However, many widelyspoken languages including Bengali, Javanese, and Lahnda have little data manually labelled for POS, limiting supervised approaches to POS tagging for these languages. However, with the growing quantity of text available online, and in particular, multilingual parallel texts from sources such as multilingual websites, government documents and large archives ofhuman translations ofbooks, news, and so forth, unannotated parallel data is becoming more widely available. This parallel data can be exploited to bridge languages, and in particular, transfer information from a highly-resourced language to a lesser-resourced language, to build unsupervised POS taggers. In this paper, we propose an unsupervised approach to POS tagging in a similar vein to the work of Das and Petrov (201 1). In this approach, — — pecina@ ufal .mff .cuni . c z a parallel corpus for a more-resourced language having a POS tagger, and a lesser-resourced language, is word-aligned. These alignments are exploited to infer an unsupervised tagger for the target language (i.e., a tagger not requiring manuallylabelled data in the target language). Our approach is substantially simpler than that of Das and Petrov, the current state-of-the art, yet performs comparably well. 2 Related work There is a wealth of prior research on building unsupervised POS taggers. Some approaches have exploited similarities between typologically similar languages (e.g., Czech and Russian, or Telugu and Kannada) to estimate the transition probabilities for an HMM tagger for one language based on a corpus for another language (e.g., Hana et al., 2004; Feldman et al., 2006; Reddy and Sharoff, 2011). Other approaches have simultaneously tagged two languages based on alignments in a parallel corpus (e.g., Snyder et al., 2008). A number of studies have used tag projection to copy tag information from a resource-rich to a resource-poor language, based on word alignments in a parallel corpus. After alignment, the resource-rich language is tagged, and tags are projected from the source language to the target language based on the alignment (e.g., Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001 ; Das and Petrov, 2011). Das and Petrov (201 1) achieved the current state-of-the-art for unsupervised tagging by exploiting high confidence alignments to copy tags from the source language to the target language. Graph-based label propagation was used to automatically produce more labelled training data. First, a graph was constructed in which each vertex corresponds to a unique trigram, and edge weights represent the syntactic similarity between vertices. Labels were then propagated by optimizing a convex function to favor the same tags for closely related nodes 634 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 634–639, ModelCoverageAccuracy Many-to-1 alignments88%68% 1-to-1 alignments 68% 78% 1-to-1 alignments: Top 60k sents 91% 80% Table 1: Token coverage and accuracy of manyto-one and 1-to-1 alignments, as well as the top 60k sentences based on alignment score for 1-to-1 alignments, using directly-projected labels only. while keeping a uniform tag distribution for unrelated nodes. A tag dictionary was then extracted from the automatically labelled data, and this was used to constrain a feature-based HMM tagger. The method we propose here is simpler to that of Das and Petrov in that it does not require convex optimization for label propagation or a feature based HMM, yet it achieves comparable results. 3 Tagset Our tagger exploits the idea ofprojecting tag information from a resource-rich to resource-poor language. To facilitate this mapping, we adopt Petrov et al.’s (2012) twelve universal tags: NOUN, VERB, ADJ, ADV, PRON (pronouns), DET (de- terminers and articles), ADP (prepositions and postpositions), NUM (numerals), CONJ (conjunctions), PRT (particles), “.” (punctuation), and X (all other categories, e.g., foreign words, abbreviations). These twelve basic tags are common across taggers for most languages. Adopting a universal tagset avoids the need to map between a variety of different, languagespecific tagsets. Furthermore, it makes it possible to apply unsupervised tagging methods to languages for which no tagset is available, such as Telugu and Vietnamese. 4 A Simpler Unsupervised POS Tagger Here we describe our proposed tagger. The key idea is to maximize the amount of information gleaned from the source language, while limiting the amount of noise. We describe the seed model and then explain how it is successively refined through self-training and revision. 4.1 Seed Model The first step is to construct a seed tagger from directly-projected labels. Given a parallel corpus for a source and target language, Algorithm 1provides a method for building an unsupervised tagger for the target language. In typical applications, the source language would be a better-resourced language having a tagger, while the target language would be lesser-resourced, lacking a tagger and large amounts of manually POS-labelled data. Algorithm 1 Build seed model Algorithm 1Build seed model 1:Tag source side. 2: Word align the corpus with Giza++ and remove the many-to-one mappings. 3: Project tags from source to target using the remaining 1-to-1 alignments. 4: Select the top n sentences based on sentence alignment score. 5: Estimate emission and transition probabilities. 6: Build seed tagger T. We eliminate many-to-one alignments (Step 2). Keeping these would give more POS-tagged tokens for the target side, but also introduce noise. For example, suppose English and French were the source and target language, respectively. In this case alignments such as English laws (NNS) to French les (DT) lois (NNS) would be expected (Yarowsky and Ngai, 2001). However, in Step 3, where tags are projected from the source to target language, this would incorrectly tag French les as NN. We build a French tagger based on English– French data from the Europarl Corpus (Koehn, 2005). We also compare the accuracy and coverage of the tags obtained through direct projection using the French Melt POS tagger (Denis and Sagot, 2009). Table 1confirms that the one-to-one alignments indeed give higher accuracy but lower coverage than the many-to-one alignments. At this stage of the model we hypothesize that highconfidence tags are important, and hence eliminate the many-to-one alignments. In Step 4, in an effort to again obtain higher quality target language tags from direct projection, we eliminate all but the top n sentences based on their alignment scores, as provided by the aligner via IBM model 3. We heuristically set this cutoff × to 60k to balance the accuracy and size of the seed model.1 Returning to our preliminary English– French experiments in Table 1, this process gives improvements in both accuracy and coverage.2 1We considered values in the range 60–90k, but this choice had little impact on the accuracy of the model. 2We also considered using all projected labels for the top 60k sentences, not just 1-to-1 alignments, but in preliminary experiments this did not perform as well, possibly due to the previously-observed problems with many-to-one alignments. 635 The number of parameters for the emission probability is |V | |T| where V is the vocabulary and aTb iilsi ttyh eis tag |s e×t. TTh| ew htrearnesi Vtio ins probability, on atnhed other hand, has only |T|3 parameters for the trigram hmaondde,l we use. TB|ecause of this difference in number of parameters, in step 5, we use different strategies to estimate the emission and transition probabilities. The emission probability is estimated from all 60k selected sentences. However, for the transition probability, which has less parameters, we again focus on “better” sentences, by estimating this probability from only those sen- tences that have (1) token coverage > 90% (based on direct projection of tags from the source language), and (2) length > 4 tokens. These criteria aim to identify longer, mostly-tagged sentences, which we hypothesize are particularly useful as training data. In the case of our preliminary English–French experiments, roughly 62% of the 60k selected sentences meet these criteria and are used to estimate the transition probability. For unaligned words, we simply assign a random POS and very low probability, which does not substantially affect transition probability estimates. In Step 6 we build a tagger by feeding the estimated emission and transition probabilities into the TNT tagger (Brants, 2000), an implementation of a trigram HMM tagger. 4.2 Self training and revision For self training and revision, we use the seed model, along with the large number of target language sentences available that have been partially tagged through direct projection, in order to build a more accurate tagger. Algorithm 2 describes this process of self training and revision, and assumes that the parallel source–target corpus has been word aligned, with many-to-one alignments removed, and that the sentences are sorted by alignment score. In contrast to Algorithm 1, all sentences are used, not just the 60k sentences with the highest alignment scores. We believe that sentence alignment score might correspond to difficulty to tag. By sorting the sentences by alignment score, sentences which are more difficult to tag are tagged using a more mature model. Following Algorithm 1, we divide sentences into blocks of 60k. In step 3 the tagged block is revised by comparing the tags from the tagger with those obtained through direct projection. Suppose source Algorithm 2 Self training and revision 1:Divide target language sentences into blocks of n sentences. 2: Tag the first block with the seed tagger. 3: Revise the tagged block. 4: Train a new tagger on the tagged block. 5: Add the previous tagger’s lexicon to the new tagger. 6: Use the new tagger to tag the next block. 7: Goto 3 and repeat until all blocks are tagged. language word wis is aligned with target language word wjt with probability p(wjt |wsi), Tis is the tag for wis using the tagger availa|bwle for the source language, and Tjt is the tag for wjt using the tagger learned for the > S, where S is a threshold which we heuristically set to 0.7, we replace Tjt by Tis. Self-training can suffer from over-fitting, in which errors in the original model are repeated and amplified in the new model (McClosky et al., 2006). To avoid this, we remove the tag of any token that the model is uncertain of, i.e., if p(wjt |wsi) < S and Tjt Tis then Tjt = Null. So, on th|ew target side, aligned words have a tag from direct projection or no tag, and unaligned words have a tag assigned by our model. Step 4 estimates the emission and transition target language. If p(wtj|wis) = probabilities as in Algorithm 1. In Step 5, emission probabilities for lexical items in the previous model, but missing from the current model, are added to the current model. Later models therefore take advantage of information from earlier models, and have wider coverage. 5 Experimental Results Using parallel data from Europarl (Koehn, 2005) we apply our method to build taggers for the same eight target languages as Das and Petrov (201 1) Danish, Dutch, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Spanish and Swedish with English as the source language. Our training data (Europarl) is a subset of the training data of Das and Petrov (who also used the ODS United Nations dataset which we were unable to obtain). The evaluation metric and test data are the same as that used by Das and Petrov. Our results are comparable to theirs, although our system is penalized by having less training data. We tag the source language with the Stanford POS tagger (Toutanova et al., 2003). — — 636 DanishDutchGermanGreekItalianPortugueseSpanishSwedishAverage Seed model83.781.183.677.878.684.981.478.981.3 Self training + revision 85.6 84.0 85.4 80.4 81.4 86.3 83.3 81.0 83.4 Das and Petrov (2011) 83.2 79.5 82.8 82.5 86.8 87.9 84.2 80.5 83.4 Table 2: Token-level POS tagging accuracy for our seed model, self training and revision, and the method of Das and Petrov (201 1).

Table 2 shows results for our seed model, self training and revision, and the results reported by Das and Petrov. Self training and revision improve the accuracy for every language over the seed model, and gives an average improvement of roughly two percentage points. The average accuracy of self training and revision is on par with that reported by Das and Petrov. On individual languages, self training and revision and the method of Das and Petrov are split each performs better on half of the cases. Interestingly, our method achieves higher accuracies on Germanic languages the family of our source language, English while Das and Petrov perform better on Romance languages. This might be because our model relies on alignments, which might be more accurate for more-related languages, whereas Das and Petrov additionally rely on label propagation. Compared to Das and Petrov, our model performs poorest on Italian, in terms of percentage point difference in accuracy. Figure 1 (left panel) shows accuracy, accuracy on known words, accuracy on unknown words, and proportion of known tokens for each iteration of our model for Italian; iteration 0 is the seed model, and iteration 3 1 is the final model. Our model performs poorly on unknown words as indicated by the low accuracy on unknown words, and high accuracy on known — — — words compared to the overall accuracy. The poor performance on unknown words is expected because we do not use any language-specific rules to handle this case. Moreover, on average for the final model, approximately 10% of the test data tokens are unknown. One way to improve the performance of our tagger might be to reduce the proportion of unknown words by using a larger training corpus, as Das and Petrov did. We examine the impact of self-training and revision over training iterations. We find that for all languages, accuracy rises quickly in the first 5–6 iterations, and then subsequently improves only slightly. We exemplify this in Figure 1 (right panel) for Dutch. (Findings are similar for other languages.) Although accuracy does not increase much in later iterations, they may still have some benefit as the vocabulary size continues to grow. 6 Conclusion We have proposed a method for unsupervised POS tagging that performs on par with the current state- of-the-art (Das and Petrov, 2011), but is substantially less-sophisticated (specifically not requiring convex optimization or a feature-based HMM). The complexity of our algorithm is O(nlogn) compared to O(n2) for that of Das and Petrov 637 (201 1) where n is the size of training data.3 We made our code are available for download.4 In future work we intend to consider using a larger training corpus to reduce the proportion of unknown tokens and improve accuracy. Given the improvements of our model over that of Das and Petrov on languages from the same family as our source language, and the observation of Snyder et al. (2008) that a better tagger can be learned from a more-closely related language, we also plan to consider strategies for selecting an appropriate source language for a given target language. Using our final model with unsupervised HMM methods might improve the final performance too, i.e. use our final model as the initial state for HMM, then experiment with differ- ent inference algorithms such as Expectation Maximization (EM), Variational Bayers (VB) or Gibbs sampling (GS).5 Gao and Johnson (2008) compare EM, VB and GS for unsupervised English POS tagging. In many cases, GS outperformed other methods, thus we would like to try GS first for our model. 7 Acknowledgements This work is funded by Erasmus Mundus European Masters Program in Language and Communication Technologies (EM-LCT) and by the Czech Science Foundation (grant no.

<p>Author: Dan Garrette ; Jason Mielens ; Jason Baldridge</p><p>Abstract: Developing natural language processing tools for low-resource languages often requires creating resources from scratch. While a variety of semi-supervised methods exist for training from incomplete data, there are open questions regarding what types of training data should be used and how much is necessary. We discuss a series of experiments designed to shed light on such questions in the context of part-of-speech tagging. We obtain timed annotations from linguists for the low-resource languages Kinyarwanda and Malagasy (as well as English) and eval- uate how the amounts of various kinds of data affect performance of a trained POS-tagger. Our results show that annotation of word types is the most important, provided a sufficiently capable semi-supervised learning infrastructure is in place to project type information onto a raw corpus. We also show that finitestate morphological analyzers are effective sources of type information when few labeled examples are available.</p><p>3 0.77155256 <a title="295-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Broadcast_News_Story_Segmentation_Using_Manifold_Learning_on_Latent_Topic_Distributions.html">73 acl-2013-Broadcast News Story Segmentation Using Manifold Learning on Latent Topic Distributions</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaoming Lu ; Lei Xie ; Cheung-Chi Leung ; Bin Ma ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: We present an efficient approach for broadcast news story segmentation using a manifold learning algorithm on latent topic distributions. The latent topic distribution estimated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to represent each text block. We employ Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) to project the latent topic distributions into low-dimensional semantic representations while preserving the intrinsic local geometric structure. We evaluate two approaches employing LDA and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) distributions respectively. The effects of different amounts of training data and different numbers of latent topics on the two approaches are studied. Experimental re- sults show that our proposed LDA-based approach can outperform the corresponding PLSA-based approach. The proposed approach provides the best performance with the highest F1-measure of 0.7860.</p><p>4 0.748788 <a title="295-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Context_Free_TAG_Variant.html">4 acl-2013-A Context Free TAG Variant</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben Swanson ; Elif Yamangil ; Eugene Charniak ; Stuart Shieber</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new variant of TreeAdjoining Grammar that allows adjunction of full wrapping trees but still bears only context-free expressivity. We provide a transformation to context-free form, and a further reduction in probabilistic model size through factorization and pooling of parameters. This collapsed context-free form is used to implement efficient gram- mar estimation and parsing algorithms. We perform parsing experiments the Penn Treebank and draw comparisons to TreeSubstitution Grammars and between different variations in probabilistic model design. Examination of the most probable derivations reveals examples of the linguistically relevant structure that our variant makes possible.</p><p>5 0.73992318 <a title="295-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_with_Compositional_Vector_Grammars.html">275 acl-2013-Parsing with Compositional Vector Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Richard Socher ; John Bauer ; Christopher D. Manning ; Ng Andrew Y.</p><p>Abstract: Natural language parsing has typically been done with small sets of discrete categories such as NP and VP, but this representation does not capture the full syntactic nor semantic richness of linguistic phrases, and attempts to improve on this by lexicalizing phrases or splitting categories only partly address the problem at the cost of huge feature spaces and sparseness. Instead, we introduce a Compositional Vector Grammar (CVG), which combines PCFGs with a syntactically untied recursive neural network that learns syntactico-semantic, compositional vector representations. The CVG improves the PCFG of the Stanford Parser by 3.8% to obtain an F1 score of 90.4%. It is fast to train and implemented approximately as an efficient reranker it is about 20% faster than the current Stanford factored parser. The CVG learns a soft notion of head words and improves performance on the types of ambiguities that require semantic information such as PP attachments.</p><p>6 0.67401135 <a title="295-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Mapping_Source_to_Target_Strings_without_Alignment_by_Analogical_Learning%3A_A_Case_Study_with_Transliteration.html">236 acl-2013-Mapping Source to Target Strings without Alignment by Analogical Learning: A Case Study with Transliteration</a></p>

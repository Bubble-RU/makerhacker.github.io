<p>Author: Nan Duan</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents two minimum Bayes risk (MBR) based Answer Re-ranking (MBRAR) approaches for the question answering (QA) task. The first approach re-ranks single QA system’s outputs by using a traditional MBR model, by measuring correlations between answer candidates; while the second approach reranks the combined outputs of multiple QA systems with heterogenous answer extraction components by using a mixture model-based MBR model. Evaluations are performed on factoid questions selected from two different domains: Jeopardy! and Web, and significant improvements are achieved on all data sets.</p><p>3 0.31375301 <a title="60-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Question_Answering_Using_Enhanced_Lexical_Semantic_Models.html">291 acl-2013-Question Answering Using Enhanced Lexical Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Wen-tau Yih ; Ming-Wei Chang ; Christopher Meek ; Andrzej Pastusiak</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the answer sentence selection problem for question answering. Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>4 0.31287521 <a title="60-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Deceptive_Answer_Prediction_with_User_Preference_Graph.html">107 acl-2013-Deceptive Answer Prediction with User Preference Graph</a></p>
<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>5 0.27140909 <a title="60-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Question_Classification_Transfer.html">292 acl-2013-Question Classification Transfer</a></p>
<p>Author: Anne-Laure Ligozat</p><p>Abstract: Question answering systems have been developed for many languages, but most resources were created for English, which can be a problem when developing a system in another language such as French. In particular, for question classification, no labeled question corpus is available for French, so this paper studies the possibility to use existing English corpora and transfer a classification by translating the question and their labels. By translating the training corpus, we obtain results close to a monolingual setting.</p><p>6 0.23260179 <a title="60-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Question_Analysis_for_Polish_Question_Answering.html">290 acl-2013-Question Analysis for Polish Question Answering</a></p>

The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed.

<p>Author: Lian Tze Lim ; Lay-Ki Soon ; Tek Yong Lim ; Enya Kong Tang ; Bali Ranaivo-Malancon</p><p>Abstract: Current approaches for word sense disambiguation and translation selection typically require lexical resources or large bilingual corpora with rich information fields and annotations, which are often infeasible for under-resourced languages. We extract translation context knowledge from a bilingual comparable corpora of a richer-resourced language pair, and inject it into a multilingual lexicon. The multilin- gual lexicon can then be used to perform context-dependent lexical lookup on texts of any language, including under-resourced ones. Evaluations on a prototype lookup tool, trained on a English–Malay bilingual Wikipedia corpus, show a precision score of 0.65 (baseline 0.55) and mean reciprocal rank score of 0.81 (baseline 0.771). Based on the early encouraging results, the context-dependent lexical lookup tool may be developed further into an intelligent reading aid, to help users grasp the gist of a second or foreign language text.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.93733644 <a title="60-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Coupling_of_Answer_Extraction_and_Information_Retrieval.html">60 acl-2013-Automatic Coupling of Answer Extraction and Information Retrieval</a></p>

<p>Author: Bishan Yang ; Claire Cardie</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the task of finegrained opinion extraction the identification of opinion-related entities: the opinion expressions, the opinion holders, and the targets of the opinions, and the relations between opinion expressions and their targets and holders. Most existing approaches tackle the extraction of opinion entities and opinion relations in a pipelined manner, where the interdependencies among different extraction stages are not captured. We propose a joint inference model that leverages knowledge from predictors that optimize subtasks – of opinion extraction, and seeks a globally optimal solution. Experimental results demonstrate that our joint inference approach significantly outperforms traditional pipeline methods and baselines that tackle subtasks in isolation for the problem of opinion extraction.</p><p>4 0.92270756 <a title="60-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Implicatures_and_Nested_Beliefs_in_Approximate_Decentralized-POMDPs.html">190 acl-2013-Implicatures and Nested Beliefs in Approximate Decentralized-POMDPs</a></p>

Our simulations involve a reference game of the sort studied in psychology and linguistics as well as a dynamic, interactional scenario involving implemented artificial agents.</p><p>5 0.92239702 <a title="60-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>
<p>Author: Anirban Dasgupta ; Ravi Kumar ; Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new optimization framework for summarization by generalizing the submodular framework of (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases. We conduct experiments on two corpora—DUC 2004 and user comments on news articles—and show that the performance of our algorithm outperforms those that rely only on submodularity.</p><p>6 0.92203301 <a title="60-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Bi-directional_Inter-dependencies_of_Subjective_Expressions_and_Targets_and_their_Value_for_a_Joint_Model.html">67 acl-2013-Bi-directional Inter-dependencies of Subjective Expressions and Targets and their Value for a Joint Model</a></p>

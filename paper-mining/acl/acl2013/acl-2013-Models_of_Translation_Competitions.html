<h1>250 acl-2013-Models of Translation Competitions</h1>

We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates. For the same reasons as before, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each = 1419 preference distribution, which gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1) =α3α + +PPs2s∈2S∈|SC|πC( s 1 , s 2 ) | + + | CCˆ π( s 2 , s 1 ) | The estimates Q(π|Ps1) do not yet constitute a preference mimoadteesl. QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons). Error bars (left) indicate one stddev of the estimated ability means. In the heatmap (right), cell (s1, s2) is darker if preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) skews in favor of student s1, lighter if it skews in favor of student s2. Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology. In this paper, we showed how WMT can restore confidence in 15In the heatmap, cell (s1, s2) is darker ifpreference model Q(π|s1 , s2) skews in favor of student s1, lighter if it skews iQn (fπa|vsor of student s2. 1423 its conclusions – by shifting the focus from rank- ings to relative ability. Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates. For the same reasons as before, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each = 1419 preference distribution, which gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1) =α3α + +PPs2s∈2S∈|SC|πC( s 1 , s 2 ) | + + | CCˆ π( s 2 , s 1 ) | The estimates Q(π|Ps1) do not yet constitute a preference mimoadteesl. QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

Specifically, Pr(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N(0, σobs). aWuses ieasntim Na(0te,dσ the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984). We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons).

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology. In this paper, we showed how WMT can restore confidence in 15In the heatmap, cell (s1, s2) is darker ifpreference model Q(π|s1 , s2) skews in favor of student s1, lighter if it skews iQn (fπa|vsor of student s2. 1423 its conclusions – by shifting the focus from rank- ings to relative ability. Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

We show that knowing multiple scores for each example instead of a single score results in a more reliable estimation of a system quality. To reduce the cost of collecting these multiple ratings, we propose to use matrix completion techniques to predict some scores knowing only scores of other judges and some common ratings. Even if prediction performance is pretty low, decisions made using the predicted score proved to be more reliable than decision based on a single rating of each example.</p><p>3 0.14707913 <a title="250-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-English-to-Russian_MT_evaluation_campaign.html">135 acl-2013-English-to-Russian MT evaluation campaign</a></p>

<p>Author: Ulle Endriss ; Raquel Fernandez</p><p>Abstract: Crowdsourcing, which offers new ways of cheaply and quickly gathering large amounts of information contributed by volunteers online, has revolutionised the collection of labelled data. Yet, to create annotated linguistic resources from this data, we face the challenge of having to combine the judgements of a potentially large group of annotators. In this paper we investigate how to aggregate individual annotations into a single collective annotation, taking inspiration from the field of social choice theory. We formulate a general formal model for collective annotation and propose several aggregation methods that go beyond the commonly used majority rule. We test some of our methods on data from a crowdsourcing experiment on textual entailment annotation.</p><p>5 0.13068879 <a title="250-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Modelling_Annotator_Bias_with_Multi-task_Gaussian_Processes%3A_An_Application_to_Machine_Translation_Quality_Estimation.html">248 acl-2013-Modelling Annotator Bias with Multi-task Gaussian Processes: An Application to Machine Translation Quality Estimation</a></p>
<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Lucia Specia</p><p>Abstract: Annotating linguistic data is often a complex, time consuming and expensive endeavour. Even with strict annotation guidelines, human subjects often deviate in their analyses, each bringing different biases, interpretations of the task and levels of consistency. We present novel techniques for learning from the outputs of multiple annotators while accounting for annotator specific behaviour. These techniques use multi-task Gaussian Processes to learn jointly a series of annotator and metadata specific models, while explicitly representing correlations between models which can be learned directly from data. Our experiments on two machine translation quality estimation datasets show uniform significant accuracy gains from multi-task learning, and consistently outperform strong baselines.</p><p>6 0.12728046 <a title="250-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Dirt_Cheap_Web-Scale_Parallel_Text_from_the_Common_Crawl.html">120 acl-2013-Dirt Cheap Web-Scale Parallel Text from the Common Crawl</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0).

The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons).

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons). Error bars (left) indicate one stddev of the estimated ability means.

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology.

Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

We show that knowing multiple scores for each example instead of a single score results in a more reliable estimation of a system quality. To reduce the cost of collecting these multiple ratings, we propose to use matrix completion techniques to predict some scores knowing only scores of other judges and some common ratings. Even if prediction performance is pretty low, decisions made using the predicted score proved to be more reliable than decision based on a single rating of each example.</p><p>3 0.79582995 <a title="250-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-English-to-Russian_MT_evaluation_campaign.html">135 acl-2013-English-to-Russian MT evaluation campaign</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Michael Carl</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce Translation Difficulty Index (TDI), a measure of difficulty in text translation. We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L, DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of “binning” sentences (to be translated) in “easy”, “medium” and “hard” categories as per their predicted TDI. This can decide pricing of any translation task, especially useful in a scenario where parallel corpora for Machine Translation are built through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing. This can also provide a way of monitoring progress of second language learners.</p><p>6 0.65381539 <a title="250-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-%22Let_Everything_Turn_Well_in_Your_Wife%22%3A_Generation_of_Adult_Humor_Using_Lexical_Constraints.html">1 acl-2013-"Let Everything Turn Well in Your Wife": Generation of Adult Humor Using Lexical Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Mark Hopkins ; Jonathan May</p><p>Abstract: What do we want to learn from a translation competition and how do we learn it with confidence? We argue that a disproportionate focus on ranking competition participants has led to lots of different rankings, but little insight about which rankings we should trust. In response, we provide the first framework that allows an empirical comparison of different analyses of competition results. We then use this framework to compare several analytical models on data from the Workshop on Machine Translation (WMT). 1 The WMT Translation Competition Every year, the Workshop on Machine Transla- , tion (WMT) conducts a competition between machine translation systems. The WMT organizers invite research groups to submit translation systems in eight different tracks: Czech to/from English, French to/from English, German to/from English, and Spanish to/from English. For each track, the organizers also assemble a panel of judges, typically machine translation specialists.1 The role of a judge is to repeatedly rank five different translations of the same source text. Ties are permitted. In Table 1, we show an example2 where a judge (we’ll call him “jdoe”) has ranked five translations of the French sentence “Il ne va pas.” Each such elicitation encodes ten pairwise comparisons, as shown in Table 2. For each competition track, WMT typically elicits between 5000 and 20000 comparisons. Once the elicitation process is complete, WMT faces a large database of comparisons and a question that must be answered: whose system is the best? 1Although in recent competitions, some ofthejudging has also been crowdsourced (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). 2The example does not use actual system output. jmay} @ sdl . com Table21r:a(451tniekW)MsTuycbejskhmtdeiunltmics“Hp r“eHt derfa eongris densolacstneogi tnsog.”bto. y”asking judges to simultaneously rank five translations, with ties permitted. In this (fictional) example, the source sentence is the French “Il ne va pas.” ble 1. A preference of 0 means neither translation was preferred. Otherwise the preference specifies the preferred system. 2 A Ranking Problem For several years, WMT used the following heuristic for ranking the translation systems: ORIGWMT(s) =win(sw)in +(s ti)e( +s t)ie +(s lo)ss(s) For system s, win (s) is the number of pairwise comparisons in which s was preferred, loss(s) is the number of comparisons in which s was dispreferred, and tie(s) is the number of comparisons in which s participated but neither system was preferred. Recently, (Bojar et al., 2011) questioned the adequacy of this heuristic through the following ar1416 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1416–1424, gument. Consider a competition with systems A and B. Suppose that the systems are different but equally good, such that one third of the time A is judged better than B, one third of the time B is judged better than A, and one third of the time they are judged to be equal. The expected values of ORIGWMT(A) and ORIGWMT(B) are both 2/3, so the heuristic accurately judges the systems to be equivalently good. Suppose however that we had duplicated B and had submitted it to the competition a second time as system C. Since B and C produce identical translations, they should always tie with one another. The expected value of ORIGWMT(A) would not change, but the expected value of ORIGWMT(B) would increase to 5/6, buoyed by its ties with system C. This vulnerability prompted (Bojar et al., 2011) to offer the following revision: BOJAR(s) =win(sw)in +(s lo)ss(s) The following year, it was BOJAR’s turn to be criticized, this time by (Lopez, 2012): Superficially, this appears to be an improvement....couldn’t a system still be penalized simply by being compared to [good systems] more frequently than its competitors? On the other hand, couldn’t a system be rewarded simply by being compared against a bad system more frequently than its competitors? Lopez’s concern, while reasonable, is less obviously damning than (Bojar et al., 2011)’s criticism of ORIGWMT. It depends on whether the collected set of comparisons is small enough or biased enough to make the variance in competition significant. While this hypothesis is plausible, Lopez makes no attempt to verify it. Instead, he offers a ranking heuristic of his own, based on a Minimum Feedback Arc solver. The proliferation of ranking heuristics continued from there. The WMT 2012 organizers (Callison-Burch et al., 2012) took Lopez’s ranking scheme and provided a variant called Most Proba- ble Ranking. Then, noting some potential pitfalls with that, they created two more, called Monte Carlo Playoffs and Expected Wins. While one could raise philosophical objections about each of these, where would it end? Ultimately, the WMT 2012 findings presented five different rankings for the English-German competition track, with no guidance about which ranking we should pay attention to. How can we know whether one ranking is better than other? Or is this even the right question to ask? 3 A Problem with Rankings Suppose four systems participate in a translation competition. Three of these systems are extremely close in quality. We’ll call these close1, close2, and close3. Nevertheless, close1 is very slightly better3 than close2, and close2 is very slightly better than close3. The fourth system, called terrific, is a really terrific system that far exceeds the other three. Now which is the better ranking? terrific, close3, close1, close2 close1, terrific, close2, close3 (1) (2) Spearman’s rho4 would favor the second ranking, since it is a less disruptive permutation of the gold ranking. But intuition favors the first. While its mistakes are minor, the second ranking makes the hard-to-forgive mistake of placing close1 ahead of the terrific system. The problem is not with Spearman’s rho. The problem is the disconnnect between the knowledge that we want a ranking to reflect and the knowledge that a ranking actually contains. Without this additional knowledge, we cannot determine whether one ranking is better than another, even if we know the gold ranking. We need to determine what information they lack, and define more rigorously what we hope to learn from a translation competition. 4 From Rankings to Relative Ability Ostensibly the purpose of a translation competition is to determine the relative ability of a set of translation systems. Let S be the space of all otrfan trsalnatsiloanti systems. Hereafter, we hwei lslp raecfeer o tfo Sll as nthslea space ostfe smtus.de Hntesr. a Wftee c,h woeos wei ltlh ires teerrm to t So evoke the metaphor of a translation competition as a standardized test, which shares the same goal: to assess the relative abilities of a set of participants. But what exactly do we mean by “ability”? Before formally defining this term, first recognize that it means little without context, namely: 3What does “better” mean? We’ll return to this question. 4Or Pearson’s correlation coefficient. 1417 1. What kind of source text do we want the systems to translate well? Say system A is great at translating travel-related documents, but terrible at translating newswire. Meanwhile, system B is pretty good at both. The question “which system is better?” requires us to state how much we care about travel versus newswire documents otherwise the question is underspecified. – 2. Who are we trying to impress? While it’s tempting to think that translation quality is a universal notion, the 50-60% interannotator agreement in WMT evaluations (CallisonBurch et al., 2012) suggests otherwise. It’s also easy to imagine reasons why one group of judges might have different priorities than another. Think a Fortune 500 company versus web forum users. Lawyers versus laymen. Non-native versus native speakers. Posteditors versus Google Translate users. Different groups have different uses for translation, and therefore different definitions of what “better” means. With this in mind, let’s define some additional elements of a translation competition. Let X be the space osf o afll a possible segments toitfi source text, J h bee tshpea space lolf p paolls possible judges, fa snodu rΠc = {0, 1, 2} bthee tshpea space ol fp pairwise d pgreesf,e arenndc Πes=. 5 W0,e1 assume all spaces are countable. Unless stated otherwise, variables s1 and s2 represent students from S, variable x represents a segment from X, variaSb,l ev j represents a judge af sroemgm J, ta fnrod mva Xria,b vlea π represents a preference fero fmro mΠ. J Moreover, adbelfein πe the negation ˆπ of preference π such that ˆπ = 2 (if π = 1), ˆπ = 1(if π = 2), and ˆπ = 0 (if π = 0). Now assume a joint distribution P(s1, s2, x, j,π) specifying the probability that we ask judge j to evaluate students s1 and s2’s respective translations of source text x, and that judge j’s preference is π. We will further assume that the choice of student pair, source text, and judge are marginally independent of one another. In other words: P(s1, s2, x, j,π) = P(π|s1, s2, x,j) · P(x|s1, s2, j) = ·P(j|s1,s2) · P(s1,s2) P(π|s1, s2, x, j) · P(x) · P(j) · P(s1, s2) = PX(x) · PJ(j) · P(s1, s2) · P(π|s1, s2, x,j) X(x) 5As a reminder, 0 indicates no preference. It will be useful to reserve notation PX and PJ for the marginal distributions over source text and judges. We can marginalize over the source segments and judges to obtain a useful quantity: P(π|s1, s2) = X XPX(x) · PJ(j) · P(π|s1,s2,x,j) Xx∈X Xj∈J We refer to this as the hPX, PJi-relative ability of Wstued reenftesr s1 hanisd a s2. By using d-rifeflearteinvet marginal distributions PX, we can specify what kinds of source text interest us (for instance, PX could focus most of its probability mass on German tweets). Similarly, by using different marginal distributions PJ, we can specify what judges we want to impress (for instance, PJ could focus all of its mass on one important corporate customer or evenly among all fluent bilingual speakers of a language pair). With this machinery, we can express the purpose of a translation competition more clearly: to estimate the hPX, PJi-relative ability of a set toof eststuidmenattes. Ien h Pthe case orefl WMT, PJ presumably6 defines a space of competent source-totarget bilingual speakers, while PX defines a space of newswire documents. We’ll refer to an estimate of P(π|s1 , s2) as a preference rm toode anl. Istni moattheer o words, a prefer- ence model is a distribution Q(π|s1 , s2). Given a cseet moofd pairwise comparisons (e.g., Table 2), the challenge is to estimate a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) such that Q is “close” to P. For measuring distributional proximity, a natural choice is KL-divergence (Kullback and Leibler, 195 1), but we cannot use it here because P is unknown. Fortunately, ifwe have i.i.d. data drawn from P, then we can do the next best thing and compute the perplexity of preference model Q on this heldout test data. Let D be a sequence of triples hs1, s2, πi wteshter dea tah.e L preferences π are i o.if.d t.r samples fr,oπmi P(π|s1 , s2). The perplexity of preference model Q on stest data D is: perplexity(Q|D) = 2−Phs1,s2,πi∈D |D1|log2Q(π|s1,s2) How do we obtain such a test set from competition data? Recall that a WMT competition produces pairwise comparisons like those in Table 2. 6One could argue that it specifies a space of machine translation specialists, but likely these individuals are thought to be a representative sample of a broader community. 1418 Let C be the set of comparisons hs1, s2, x, j,πi Lobettai Cne bde f trhoem s a t orfan csolamtipoanr competition. ,Cjo,mπipetition data C is not necessarily7 sampled i.i.d. fpreotmiti P(s1, s2, x, j,π) n beeccaeusssaer we may intentionally8 bias data collection towards certain students, judges or source text. Also, because WMT elicits its data in batches (see Table 1), every segment x of source text appears in at least ten comparisons. To create an appropriately-sized test set that closely resembles i.i.d. data, we isolate the subset C0 of comparisons whose source text appears isne ta tC most k comparisons, where k is the smallest positive integer such that |C0| >= 2000. We then cporesaitteiv teh ien tteegste sre stu uDch hfr thomat |CC0: D = {hs1, s2, πi|hs1, s2, x,j, πi ∈ C0} We reserve the remaining comparisons for training preference models. Table 3 shows the resulting dataset sizes for each competition track. Unlike with raw rankings, the claim that one preference model is better than another has testable implications. Given two competing models, we can train them on the same comparisons, and compare their perplexities on the test set. This gives us a quantitative9 answer to the question of which is the better model. We can then publish a system ranking based on the most trustworthy preference model. 5 Baselines Let’s begin then, and create some simple preference models to serve as baselines. 5.1 Uniform The simplest preference model is a uniform distribution over preferences, for any choice of students s1 s2: , Q(π|s1,s2) =31 ∀π ∈ Π This will be our only model that does not require training data, and its perplexity on any test set will be 3 (i.e. equal to number of possible preferences). 5.2 Adjusted Uniform Now suppose we have a set C of comparisons aNvoawilab sluep pfoors training.

C(s1 , s2) denote the subset comparing students s1 aCn(ds s2. Perhaps the simplest thing we can do with the training data is to estimate the probability of ties (i.e. preference 0). We can then distribute the remaining probability mass uniformly among the other two preferences: 6SQim(pπ|lse1B,sa2y)e=sia   n1M−o2d|C Ce0| lsiofthπer=wi0se 6.1 Independent Pairs Another simple model is the direct estimation of each relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) independently. In oetahcher words, f aobri eliatych P pair sof students s1 and s2, we estimate a separate preference distribution. The maximum likelihood estimate of each distribution would be: Q(π|s1,s2) =|C|Cπ((ss11,,ss22))|| ++ | CC πˆ(s(2s,2s,1s)1|)| However the maximum likelihood estimate would test poorly, since any zero probability estimates for test set preferences would result in infinite perplexity. To make this model practical, we assume a symmetric Dirichlet prior with strength α for each preference distribution. This gives us the following Bayesian estimate: Q(π|s1,s2) =α3α + + |C |πC((ss11,,ss22))|| + + | |CC πˆ((ss22,,ss11))|| We call this the Independent model. Pairs preference 6.2 Independent Students The Independent Pairs model makes a strong inde- pendence assumption. It assumes that even if we know that student A is much better than student B, and that student B is much better than student C, we can infer nothing about how student A will fare versus student C. Instead of directly estimating the relative ability P(π|s1 , s2) of students s1 and s2, we ctoivueld a binilsittyead P Ptry tso estimate the universal ability P(π|s1) Ps2∈S P(π|s1, s2) · P(s2|s1) of ietaych P i(nπd|sividual sPtud∈enSt s1 πa|nsd the)n try tso reconstruct the relativeP abilities from these estimates.

QA( dπo|swnside of this approach is that there is no principled way to reconstruct a preference model from the universal ability estimates. We experiment with three ad-hoc reconstructions. The asymmetric reconstruction simply ignores any information we have about student s2: Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) The arithmetic and geometric reconstructions compute an arithmetic/geometric average of the two universal abilities: Q(π|s1,s2) Q(π|s1, s2) = Q(π|s1) +2 Q( πˆ|s2) = [Q(π|s1) ∗ Q(ˆ π|s2)]21 We respectively call these the (Asymmetric/Arithmetic/Geometric) Independent Students preference models.

Presuming the students are paired uniformly at random, this issue diminishes as more comparisons are elicited. But preference elicitation is expensive, so it makes sense to assess the relative ability of the students with as few elicitations as possible. Still, WMT 2012’s decision to eliminate references entirely is a bit of a draconian measure, a treatment of the symptom rather than the (perceived) disease. If our models cannot function in the presence of training data variation, then we should change the models, not the data. A model that only works when the students are all about the same level is not one we should rely on. We experiment with a simple model that relaxes some independence assumptions made by previous models, in order to allow training data variation (e.g. who a student has been paired with) to influence the estimation of the student abilities. Figure 1(left) shows plate notation (Koller and Friedman, 2009) for the model’s independence structure. First, each student’s ability distribution is drawn from a common prior distribution. Then a number of translation items are generated. Each item is authored by a student and has a quality drawn from the student’s ability distribution. Then a number of pairwise comparisons are generated. Each comparison has two options, each a translation item. The quality of each item is observed by a judge (possibly noisily) and then the judge states a preference by comparing the two observations. We investigate two parameterizations of this model: Gaussian and categorical. Figure 1(right) shows an example of the Gaussian parameterization. The student ability distributions are Gaussians with a known standard deviation σa, drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian prior with known standard deviation σ0. In the example, we show the ability distributions for students 6 (an aboveaverage student, whose mean is 0.4) and 14 (a poor student, whose mean is -0.6). We also show an item authored by each student. Item 43 has a somewhat low quality of -0.3 (drawn from student 14’s ability distribution), while item 205 is not student 6’s best work (he produces a mean quality of 0.4), but still has a decent quality at 0.2. Comparison 1pits these items against one another. A judge draws noise from a zero-mean Gaussian with known standard deviation σobs, then adds this to the item’s actual quality to get an observed quality. For the first option (item 43), the judge draws a noise of -0.12 to observe a quality of -0.42 (worse than it actually is). For the second option (item 205), the judge draws a noise of 0.15 to observe a quality of 0.35 (better than it actually is). Finally, the judge compares the two observed qualities. If the absolute difference is lower than his decision 1420 Figure 1: Plate notation (left) showing the independence tiated subnetwork structure of the IRT Models.

Shaded ellipses are variables observable from a set of comparisons. radius (which here is 0.5), then he states no preference (i.e. a preference of 0). Otherwise he prefers the item with the higher observed quality. The categorical parameterization is similar to the Gaussian parameterization, with the following differences. Item quality is not continuous, but rather a member of the discrete set {1, 2, ..., Λ}. rTahteh srtau d menetm ability tdhiest rdiibsuctrieotens are categorical distributions over {1, 2, ..., Λ}, and the student ability prior sis o a symmetric ,DΛir}ic,h alnetd dw tihthe strength αa.

Specifically, Pr(ν) is proportional to the value of the probability density function of the zero-mean Gaussian N(0, σobs). aWuses ieasntim Na(0te,dσ the model parameters with Gibbs sampling (Geman and Geman, 1984). We found that Gibbs sampling converged quickly and consistently10 for both parameterizations. Given the parameter estimates, we obtain a preference model Q(π|s1 , s2) through the inference query: Pr(comp.c0.pref = π | item.i0.author = s1, item.i00.author = s2 , comp.c0.opt1 = i0, comp.c0.opt2 = i00) − 10We ran 200 iterations with a burn-in of 50. where c0, i0, i00 are new comparison and item ids that do not appear in the training data. We call these models Item-Response Theoretic (IRT) models, to acknowledge their roots in the psychometrics (Thurstone, 1927; Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) and item-response theory (Hambleton, 1991 ; van der Linden and Hambleton, 1996; Baker, 2001) literature. Itemresponse theory is the basis of modern testing theory and drives adaptive standardized tests like the Graduate Record Exam (GRE). In particular, the Gaussian parameterization of our IRT models strongly resembles11 the Thurstone (Thurstone, 1927) and Bradley-Terry-Luce (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) models of paired comparison and the 1PL normal-ogive and Rasch (Rasch, 1960) models of student testing. From the testing perspective, we can view each comparison as two students simultaneously posing a test question to the other: “Give me a translation of the source text which is better than mine.” The students can answer the question correctly, incorrectly, or they can provide a translation of analogous quality. An extra dimension of our models is judge noise, not a factor when modeling multiple-choice tests, for which the right answer is not subject to opinion. 11These models are not traditionally expressed using graphical models, although it is not unprecedented (Mislevy and Almond, 1997; Mislevy et al., 1999). 1421 (number of comparisons). Figure 2: WMT10 model perplexities. The perplexity of the uniform preference model is 3.0 for all training sizes. 8 Experiments We organized the competition data as described at the end of Section 4.

For each model and training size, we averaged the perplexities from 5 trials of each competition track. We then plotted average perplexity as a function of training size. These graphs are shown 12If k was greater than the total number of training comparisons, then we took the entire set. Figure 3: WMT1 1model perplexities. Figure 4: WMT12 model perplexities. in Figure 2 (WMT10)13, and Figure 4 (WMT12). For WMT10 and WMT1 1, the best models were the IRT models, with the Gaussian parameterization converging the most rapidly and reaching the lowest perplexity. For WMT12, in which reference translations were excluded from the competition, four models were nearly indistinguishable: the two IRT models and the two averaged Independent Student models. This somewhat validates the organizers’ decision to exclude the references, particularly given WMT’s use of the BOJAR ranking heuristic (the nucleus of the Independent Student models) for its official rankings. 13Results for WMT10 exclude the German-English and English-German tracks, since we used these to tune our model hyperparameters. These were set as follows. The Dirichlet strength for each baseline was 1. For IRT-Gaussian: σ0 = 1.0, σobs = 1.0, σa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0.4. For IRT-Categorical: Λ = 8, σobs = 1.0, αa = 0.5, and the decision radius was 0. 1422 Figure 6: English-Czech WMT1 1 results (average of 5 trainings on 1600 comparisons). Error bars (left) indicate one stddev of the estimated ability means.

Figure 5: WMT10 model perplexities sourced versus expert training). (crowd- The IRT models proved the most robust at handling judge noise. We repeated the WMT10 experiment using the same test sets, but using the unfiltered crowdsourced comparisons (rather than “expert”14 comparisons) for training. Figure 5 shows the results. Whereas the crowdsourced noise considerably degraded the Geometric Independent Students model, the IRT models were remarkably robust. IRT-Gaussian in particular came close to replicating the performance of Geometric Independent Students trained on the much cleaner expert data. This is rather impressive, since the crowdsourced judges agree only 46.6% of the time, compared to a 65.8% agreement rate among 14I.e., machine translation specialists. expert judges (Callison-Burch et al., 2010). Another nice property of the IRT models is that they explicitly model student ability, so they yield a natural ranking. For training size 1600 of the WMT1 1 English-Czech track, Figure 6 (left) shows the mean student abilities learned by the IRT-Gaussian model. The error bars show one standard deviation of the ability means (recall that we performed 5 trials, each with a random training subset of size 1600). These results provide further insight into a case analyzed by (Lopez, 2012), which raised concern about the relative ordering of online-B, cu-bojar, and cu-marecek. According to IRT-Gaussian’s analysis of the data, these three students are so close in ability that any ordering is essentially arbitrary. Short of a full ranking, the analysis does suggest four strata. Viewing one of IRT-Gaussian’s induced preference models as a heatmap15 (Figure 6, right), four bands are discernable. First, the reference sentences are clearly the darkest (best). Next come students 2-7, followed by the slightly lighter (weaker) students 810, followed by the lightest (weakest) student 11. 9 Conclusion WMT has faced a crisis of confidence lately, with researchers raising (real and conjectured) issues with its analytical methodology.

Estimates of relative ability (the expected head-to-head performance of system pairs over a probability space of judges and source text) can be empirically compared, granting substance to previously nebulous questions like: 1. Is my analysis better than your analysis? Rather than the current anecdotal approach to comparing competition analyses (e.g. presenting example rankings that seem somehow wrong), we can empirically compare the predictive power of the models on test data. 2. How much of an impact does judge noise have on my conclusions? We showed that judge noise can have a significant impact on the quality of our conclusions, if we use the wrong models. However, the IRTGaussian appears to be quite noise-tolerant, giving similar-quality conclusions on both expert and crowdsourced comparisons. 3. How many comparisons should Ielicit? Many of our preference models (including IRT-Gaussian and Geometric Independent Students) are close to convergence at around 1000 comparisons. This suggests that we can elicit far fewer comparisons and still derive confident conclusions. This is the first time a concrete answer to this question has been provided. References F.B.

<p>Author: Kang Liu ; Liheng Xu ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Mining opinion targets is a fundamental and important task for opinion mining from online reviews. To this end, there are usually two kinds of methods: syntax based and alignment based methods. Syntax based methods usually exploited syntactic patterns to extract opinion targets, which were however prone to suffer from parsing errors when dealing with online informal texts. In contrast, alignment based methods used word alignment model to fulfill this task, which could avoid parsing errors without using parsing. However, there is no research focusing on which kind of method is more better when given a certain amount of reviews. To fill this gap, this paper empiri- cally studies how the performance of these two kinds of methods vary when changing the size, domain and language of the corpus. We further combine syntactic patterns with alignment model by using a partially supervised framework and investigate whether this combination is useful or not. In our experiments, we verify that our combination is effective on the corpus with small and medium size.</p><p>3 0.93809617 <a title="250-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Typesetting_for_Improved_Readability_using_Lexical_and_Syntactic_Information.html">364 acl-2013-Typesetting for Improved Readability using Lexical and Syntactic Information</a></p>

We also use a simple genetic algorithm to search for a subset of the features optimizing F1, to arrive at a set of features that delivers 89.2% Precision, 90.2% Recall (89.7% F1) on a test set, improving the rule-based baseline by about 11points and the classifier trained on all features by about 1point in F1. 1 Introduction and Motivation Current best practice in typography focuses on several interrelated factors (Humar et al., 2008; Tinkel, 1996). These factors include typeface selection, the color of the type and its contrast with the background, the size of the type, the length of the lines of type in the body of the text, the media in which the type will live, the distance between each line of type, and the appearance of the justified or ragged right side edge of the paragraphs, which should maintain either the appearance of a straight line on both sides of the block of type (justified) or create a gentle wave on the ragged right side edge. cmu .edu hagan @ cmu .edu This paper addresses one aspect of current “best practice,” concerning the alignment of text in a paragraph. While current practice values that gentle “wave,” which puts the focus on the elegant look of the overall paragraph, it does so at the expense of meaning-making features. Meaningmaking features enable typesetting to maintain the integrity of phrases within sentences, giving those interests equal consideration with the overall look of the paragraph. Figure 1 (a) shows a text fragment typeset without any regard to natural breaks while (b) shows an example of a typesetting that we would like to get, where many natural breaks are respected. While current practice works well enough for native speakers, fluency problems for non-native speakers lead to uncertainty when the beginning and end of English phrases are interrupted by the need to move to the next line of the text before completing the phrase. This pause is a potential problem for readers because they try to interpret content words, relate them to their referents and anticipate the role of the next word, as they encounter them in the text (Just and Carpenter, 1980). While incorrect anticipation might not be problematic for native speakers, who can quickly re-adjust, non-native speakers may find inaccurate anticipation more troublesome. This problem could be more significant because English as a second language (ESL) readers are engaged not only in understanding a foreign language, but also in processing the “anticipated text” as they read a partial phrase, and move to the next line in the text, only to discover that they anticipated meaning incorrectly. Even native speakers with less skill may experience difficulty comprehending text and work with young readers suggests that ”[c]omprehension difficulties may be localized at points of high processing demands whether from syntax or other sources” (Perfetti et al., 2005). As ESL readers process a partial phrase, and move to 719 ProceedingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An uuaglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioinngauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 719–724, the next line in the text, instances of incorrectly anticipated meaning would logically increase processing demands to a greater degree. Additionally, as readers make meaning, we assume that they don’t parse their thoughts using the same phrasal divisions “needed to diagram a sentence.” Our perspective not only relies on the immediacy assumption, but also develops as an outgrowth of other ways that we make meaning outside of the form or function rules of grammar. Specifically, Halliday and Hasan (1976) found that rules of grammar do not explain how cohesive principals engage readers in meaning making across sentences. In order to make meaning across sentences, readers must be able to refer anaphorically backward to the previous sentence, and cataphorically forward to the next sentence. Along similar lines, readers of a single sentence assume that transitive verbs will include a direct object, and will therefore speculate about what that object might be, and sometimes get it wrong. Thus proper typesetting of a segment of text must explore ways to help readers avoid incorrect anticipation, while also considering those moments in the text where readers tend to pause in order to integrate the meaning of a phrase. Those decisions depend on the context. A phrasal break between a one-word subject and its verb tends to be more unattractive, because the reader does not have to make sense of relationships between the noun/subject and related adjectives before moving on to the verb. In this case, the reader will be more likely to anticipate the verb to come. However, a break between a subject preceded by multiple adjectives and its verb is likely to be more useful to a reader (if not ideal), because the relationships between the noun and its related adjectives are more likely to have thematic importance leading to longer gaze time on the relevant words in the subject phrase (Just and Carpenter, 1980). We are not aware of any prior work for bringing computational linguistic techniques to bear on this problem. A relatively recent study (Levasseur et al., 2006) that accounted only for breaks at commas and ends of sentences, found that even those breaks improved reading fluency. While the participants in that study were younger (7 to 9+ years old), the study is relevant because the challenges those young participants face, are faced again when readers of any age encounter new and complicated texts that present words they do not know, and ideas they have never considered. On the other hand, there is ample work on the basic algorithm to place a sequence of words in a typesetting area with a certain width, commonly known as the optimal line breaking problem (e.g., Plass (1981), Knuth and Plass (1981)). This problem is quite well-understood and basic variants are usually studied as an elementary example application of dynamic programming. In this paper we explore the problem of learning where to break sentences in order to avoid the problems discussed above. Once such unbreakable segments are identified, a simple application of the dynamic programming algorithm for optimal line breaking, using unbreakable segments as “words”, easily typesets the text to a given width area. 2 Text Breaks The rationale for content breaks is linked to our interest in preventing inaccurate anticipation, which is based on the immediacy assumption. The immediacy assumption (Just and Carpenter, 1980) considers, among other things, the reader’s interest in trying to relate content words to their referents as soon as possible. Prior context also encourages the reader to anticipate a particular role or case for the next word, such as agent or the manner in which something is done.Therefore, in defining our breaks, we consider not only the need to maintain the syntactic integrity of phrases, such as the prepositional phrase, but also the semantic integrity across syntactical divisions. For example, semantic integrity is important when transitive verbs anticipate direct objects. Strictly speaking, we define a bad break as one that will cause (i) unintended anaphoric collocation, (ii) unintended cataphoric collocation, or (iii) incorrect anticipation. Using these broad constraints, we derived a set of about 30 rules that define acceptable and nonacceptable breaks, with exceptions based on context and other special cases. Some of the rules are very simple and are only related to the word posi- tion in the sentence: • • Break at the end of a sentence. Keep the first and last words of a sentence wKietehp pth teh rest sotf a aint.d The rest of the rule set are more complex and depend on the structure of the sentence in question, 720 . s anct ions and UN charge s o f gro s s right s abuse s Mi l ary tens i it ons on the Korean peninsula have risen to the i highe st level for years r with the communi st st ate under the youthful Kim threatening nuclear war in re sponse t o UN s anct i s impo s ed a ft e r it s thi rd at omi c t e st l on ast month .

Keep the verb, the object and the preposition together ei nv a phrasal bvjeercbt phrase. Keep a gerund clause with its adverbial complement. There are exceptions to these rules in certain cases such as overly long phrases. 3 Experimental Setup Our data set consists of a modest set of 150 sentences (3918 tokens) selected from four different documents and manually annotated by a human expert relying on the 30 or so rules. The annotation consists of marking after each token whether one is allowed to break at that position or not.1 We developed three systems for predicting breaks: a rule-based baseline system, a maximumentropy classifier that learns to classify breaks us- ing about 100 lexical, syntactic and collocational features, and a maximum entropy classifier that uses a subset of these features selected by a simple genetic algorithm in a hill-climbing fashion. We evaluated our classifiers intrinsically using the usual measures: 1We expect to make our annotated data available upon the publication of the paper. • Precision: Percentage of the breaks posited tPhraetc were actually ctaogrere octf bthreeak bsre aink tshe p goldstandard hand-annotated data. It is possible to get 100% precision by putting a single break at the end. • Recall: Percentage of the actual breaks correctly posited. tIatg ies possible ttou get 1e0ak0%s c recall by positing a break after each token. F1: The geometric mean of precision and recFall divided by their average. It should be noted that when a text is typeset into an area of width of a certain number of characters, an erroneous break need not necessarily lead to an actual break in the final output, that is an error may • not be too bad. On the other hand, a missed break while not hurting the readability of the text may actually lead to a long segment that may eventually worsen raggedness in the final typesetting. Baseline Classifier We implemented a subset of the rules (those that rely only on lexical and partof-speech information), as a baseline rule-based break classifier. The baseline classifier avoids breaks: • • • after the first word in a sentence, quote or parentheses, before the last word in a sentence, quote or parentheses, asntd w between a punctuation mark following a bweotrwde or b aet wpueennct two nco nmsearckuti vfoel punctuation marks. It posits breaks (i) before a word following a punctuation, and (ii) before prepositions, auxiliary verbs, coordinating conjunctions, subordinate conjunctions, relative pronouns, relative adverbs, conjunctive adverbs, and correlative conjunctions. 721 Maximum Entropy Classifier We used the CRF++ Tool2 but with the option to run it only as a maximum entropy classifier (Berger et al., 1996), to train a classifier. We used a large set of about 100 features grouped into the following categories: • • Lexical features: These features include the tLoekxeinca aln fde athtuer ePsO:S T tag efo fre athtuer previous, current and the next word. We also encode whether the word is part of a compound noun or a verb, or is an adjective that subcategorizes a specific preposition in WordNet, (e.g., familiar with). Constituency structure features: These are Cunolnesxtiictauleinzecdy f setarutucrtuers eth faeat ttaurkees i:nt To aecsecou anret in the parse tree, for a word and its previous and next words, the labels of the parent, the grandparent and their siblings, and number of siblings they have. We also consider the label of the closest common ancestor for a word and its next word. • • Dependency structure features: These are unlDeexipceanldizeendc yfe satrtuurcteus eth faeat essentially capture the number of dependency relation links that cross-over a given word boundary. The motivation for these comes from the desire to limit the amount of information that would need to be carried over that boundary, assuming this would be captured by the number of dependency links over the break point. Baseline feature: This feature reflects Bwahseethlienre the rule-based baseline break classifier posits a break at this point or not. We use the following tools to process the sentences to extract some of these features: • Stanford constituency and dependency parsers, (De Marneffe et al., 2006; Klein and Manning, 2002; Klein and Manning, 2003), • • lemmatization tool in NLTK (Bird, 2006), WordNet for compound (Fellbaum, 1998). nouns and verbs 2Available at http : / / crfpp . googlecode .com/ svn /t runk / doc / index . html .

Basically, we start with a randomly selected set of features and through mutation and crossover try to obtain feature combinations that perform better over the development set in terms of F1 score. After a few hundred generations of this kind of hill-climbing, we get a subset of features that perform the best. 4 Results Our current evaluation is only intrinsic in that we measure our performance in getting the break and no-break points correctly in a test set. The results are shown in Table 1. The column ME-All shows the results for a maximum entropy classifier using all the features and the column ME-GA shows the results for a maximum entropy classifier using about 50 of the about 100 features available, as selected by the genetic algorithm. Our best system delivers 89.2% precision and 90.2% recall (with 89.7% F1), improving the rulebased baseline by about 11points and the classifier trained on all features by about 1point in F1. After processing our test set with the ME-GA classifier, we can feed the segments into a standard word-wrapping dynamic programming algorithm (along with a maximum width) and obtain a typeset version with minimum raggedness on the right margin. This algorithm is fast enough to use even dynamically when resizing a window if the text is displayed in a browser on a screen. Figure 1 (b) displays an example of a small fragment of text typeset using the output of our best break classifier. One can immediately note that this typesetting has more raggedness overall, but avoids the bad breaks in (a). We are currently in the process of designing a series of experiments for extrinsic evaluation to determine if such typeset text helps comprehension for secondary language learners. 722 4.1 Error Analysis An analysis of the errors our best classifier makes (which may or may not be translated into an actual error in the final typesetting) shows that the majority of the errors basically can be categorized into the following groups: • Incorrect breaks posited for multiword colloIcnatcioornrse (e.g., akcst *po of weda fr,o3r rmuulel*ti of law, far ahead* of, raining cats* and dogs, etc.) • Missed breaks after a verb (e.g., calls | an act of war, proceeded to | implement, etc.) Missed breaks before or after prepositions or aMdvisesrebdia blsre (e.g., ethfoer day after | tehpeo wsitoiroldns realized, every .kgi.n,d th | of interference) We expect to overcome such cases by increasing our training data size significantly by using our classifier to break new texts and then have a human annotator to manually correct the breaks. • 5 Conclusions and Future Work We have used syntactically motivated information to help in typesetting text to facilitate better understanding of English text especially by secondary language learners, by avoiding breaks which may cause unnecessary anticipation errors. We have cast this as a classification problem to indicate whether to break after a certain word or not, by taking into account a variety of features. Our best system maximum entropy framework uses about 50 such features, which were selected using a genetic algorithm and performs significantly better than a rule-based break classifier and better than a maximum entropy classifier that uses all available features. We are currently working on extending this work in two main directions: We are designing a set of experiments to extrinsically test whether typesetting by our system improves reading ease and comprehension. We are also looking into a break labeling scheme that is not binary but based on a notion of “badness” perhaps quantized into 3-4 grades, that would allow flexibility between preventing bad breaks and minimizing raggedness. For instance, breaking a noun-phrase right after an initial the may be considered very bad. On the other hand, although it is desirable to keep an object NP together with the preceding transitive verb, – 3* indicates a spurious incorrect break, | indicates a misse*d i nbrdeiacka.t breaking before the object NP, could be OK, if not doing so causes an inordinate amount of raggedness. Then the final typesetting stage can optimize a combination of raggedness and the total “bad- ness” of all the breaks it posits.

<p>Author: Yoav Goldberg ; Kai Zhao ; Liang Huang</p><p>Abstract: Beam search incremental parsers are accurate, but not as fast as they could be. We demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, most current implementations of beam parsers in fact run in O(n2), rather than linear time, because each statetransition is actually implemented as an O(n) operation. We present an improved implementation, based on Tree Structured Stack (TSS), in which a transition is performed in O(1), resulting in a real lineartime algorithm, which is verified empiri- cally. We further improve parsing speed by sharing feature-extraction and dotproduct across beam items. Practically, our methods combined offer a speedup of ∼2x over strong baselines on Penn Treeb∼a2nxk sentences, a bnads are eosrd oenrs P eofn magnitude faster on much longer sentences.</p><p>6 0.93693906 <a title="250-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Shift-Reduce_Parsing_Algorithm_for_Phrase-based_String-to-Dependency_Translation.html">19 acl-2013-A Shift-Reduce Parsing Algorithm for Phrase-based String-to-Dependency Translation</a></p>

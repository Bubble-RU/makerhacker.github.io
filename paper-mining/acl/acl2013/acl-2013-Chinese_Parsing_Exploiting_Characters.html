<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>3 0.46200013 <a title="80-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>6 0.36574024 <a title="80-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_on_Micro-blog_Using_Rich_Punctuations.html">193 acl-2013-Improving Chinese Word Segmentation on Micro-blog Using Rich Punctuations</a></p>

By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>3 0.86117113 <a title="80-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Subtree_Extractive_Summarization_via_Submodular_Maximization.html">332 acl-2013-Subtree Extractive Summarization via Submodular Maximization</a></p>

We translate the text summarization task into a problem of extracting a set of dependency subtrees in the document cluster. We also encode obligatory case constraints as must-link dependency constraints in order to guarantee the readability of the generated summary. In order to handle the subtree extraction problem, we investigate a new class of submodular maximization problem, and a new algorithm that has the approximation ratio 21 (1 − e−1). Our experiments with the NTC(1IR − −A eCLIA test collections show that our approach outperforms a state-of-the-art algorithm.</p><p>4 0.85324544 <a title="80-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Adaptation_Data_Selection_using_Neural_Language_Models%3A_Experiments_in_Machine_Translation.html">35 acl-2013-Adaptation Data Selection using Neural Language Models: Experiments in Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Graham Neubig ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Hajime Tsukada</p><p>Abstract: Data selection is an effective approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation. The idea is to use language models trained on small in-domain text to select similar sentences from large general-domain corpora, which are then incorporated into the training data. Substantial gains have been demonstrated in previous works, which employ standard ngram language models. Here, we explore the use of neural language models for data selection. We hypothesize that the continuous vector representation of words in neural language models makes them more effective than n-grams for modeling un- known word contexts, which are prevalent in general-domain text. In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams.</p><p>5 0.84335864 <a title="80-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Iterative_Transformation_of_Annotation_Guidelines_for_Constituency_Parsing.html">204 acl-2013-Iterative Transformation of Annotation Guidelines for Constituency Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiang Li ; Wenbin Jiang ; Yajuan Lu ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents an effective algorithm of annotation adaptation for constituency treebanks, which transforms a treebank from one annotation guideline to another with an iterative optimization procedure, thus to build a much larger treebank to train an enhanced parser without increasing model complexity. Experiments show that the transformed Tsinghua Chinese Treebank as additional training data brings significant improvement over the baseline trained on Penn Chinese Treebank only.</p><p>same-paper 6 0.83738559 <a title="80-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>

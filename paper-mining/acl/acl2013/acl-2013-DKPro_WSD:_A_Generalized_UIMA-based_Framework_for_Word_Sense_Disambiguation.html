<p>Author: Daniel Bar ; Torsten Zesch ; Iryna Gurevych</p><p>Abstract: We present DKPro Similarity, an open source framework for text similarity. Our goal is to provide a comprehensive repository of text similarity measures which are implemented using standardized interfaces. DKPro Similarity comprises a wide variety of measures ranging from ones based on simple n-grams and common subsequences to high-dimensional vector comparisons and structural, stylistic, and phonetic measures. In order to promote the reproducibility of experimental results and to provide reliable, permanent experimental conditions for future studies, DKPro Similarity additionally comes with a set of full-featured experimental setups which can be run out-of-the-box and be used for future systems to built upon.</p><p>3 0.30331233 <a title="105-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Align%2C_Disambiguate_and_Walk%3A_A_Unified_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity.html">43 acl-2013-Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity</a></p>
<p>Author: Mohammad Taher Pilehvar ; David Jurgens ; Roberto Navigli</p><p>Abstract: Semantic similarity is an essential component of many Natural Language Processing applications. However, prior methods for computing semantic similarity often operate at different levels, e.g., single words or entire documents, which requires adapting the method for each data type. We present a unified approach to semantic similarity that operates at multiple levels, all the way from comparing word senses to comparing text documents. Our method leverages a common probabilistic representation over word senses in order to compare different types of linguistic data. This unified representation shows state-ofthe-art performance on three tasks: seman- tic textual similarity, word similarity, and word sense coarsening.</p><p>4 0.30125356 <a title="105-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Density_Maximization_in_Context-Sense_Metric_Space_for_All-words_WSD.html">111 acl-2013-Density Maximization in Context-Sense Metric Space for All-words WSD</a></p>
<p>Author: Koichi Tanigaki ; Mitsuteru Shiba ; Tatsuji Munaka ; Yoshinori Sagisaka</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel smoothing model with a combinatorial optimization scheme for all-words word sense disambiguation from untagged corpora. By generalizing discrete senses to a continuum, we introduce a smoothing in context-sense space to cope with data-sparsity resulting from a large variety of linguistic context and sense, as well as to exploit senseinterdependency among the words in the same text string. Through the smoothing, all the optimal senses are obtained at one time under maximum marginal likelihood criterion, by competitive probabilistic kernels made to reinforce one another among nearby words, and to suppress conflicting sense hypotheses within the same word. Experimental results confirmed the superiority of the proposed method over conventional ones by showing the better performances beyond most-frequent-sense baseline performance where none of SemEval2 unsupervised systems reached.</p><p>5 0.25917071 <a title="105-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Neighbors_Help%3A_Bilingual_Unsupervised_WSD_Using_Context.html">258 acl-2013-Neighbors Help: Bilingual Unsupervised WSD Using Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>6 0.15419459 <a title="105-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-FrameNet_on_the_Way_to_Babel%3A_Creating_a_Bilingual_FrameNet_Using_Wiktionary_as_Interlingual_Connection.html">162 acl-2013-FrameNet on the Way to Babel: Creating a Bilingual FrameNet Using Wiktionary as Interlingual Connection</a></p>

<p>Author: Ravi Kondadadi ; Blake Howald ; Frank Schilder</p><p>Abstract: We present a hybrid natural language generation (NLG) system that consolidates macro and micro planning and surface realization tasks into one statistical learning process. Our novel approach is based on deriving a template bank automatically from a corpus of texts from a target domain. First, we identify domain specific entity tags and Discourse Representation Structures on a per sentence basis. Each sentence is then organized into semantically similar groups (representing a domain specific concept) by k-means clustering. After this semi-automatic processing (human review of cluster assignments), a number of corpus–level statistics are compiled and used as features by a ranking SVM to develop model weights from a training corpus. At generation time, a set of input data, the collection of semantically organized templates, and the model weights are used to select optimal templates. Our system is evaluated with automatic, non–expert crowdsourced and expert evaluation metrics. We also introduce a novel automatic metric syntactic variability that represents linguistic variation as a measure of unique template sequences across a collection of automatically generated documents. The metrics for generated weather and biography texts fall within acceptable ranges. In sum, we argue that our statistical approach to NLG reduces the need for complicated knowledge-based architectures and readily adapts to different domains with reduced development time. – – *∗Ravi Kondadadi is now affiliated with Nuance Communications, Inc.</p><p>3 0.63011342 <a title="105-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Linggle%3A_a_Web-scale_Linguistic_Search_Engine_for_Words_in_Context.html">231 acl-2013-Linggle: a Web-scale Linguistic Search Engine for Words in Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Joanne Boisson ; Ting-Hui Kao ; Jian-Cheng Wu ; Tzu-Hsi Yen ; Jason S. Chang</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a Web-scale linguistics search engine, Linggle, that retrieves lexical bundles in response to a given query. The query might contain keywords, wildcards, wild parts of speech (PoS), synonyms, and additional regular expression (RE) operators. In our approach, we incorporate inverted file indexing, PoS information from BNC, and semantic indexing based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation with Google Web 1T. The method involves parsing the query to transforming it into several keyword retrieval commands. Word chunks are retrieved with counts, further filtering the chunks with the query as a RE, and finally displaying the results according to the counts, similarities, and topics. Clusters of synonyms or conceptually related words are also provided. In addition, Linggle provides example sentences from The New York Times on demand. The current implementation of Linggle is the most functionally comprehensive, and is in principle language and dataset independent. We plan to extend Linggle to provide fast and convenient access to a wealth of linguistic information embodied in Web scale datasets including Google Web 1T and Google Books Ngram for many major languages in the world. 1</p><p>4 0.5998252 <a title="105-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>5 0.59499705 <a title="105-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_from_Positive_and_Unlabeled_Data_using_Misclassified_Data_Correction.html">342 acl-2013-Text Classification from Positive and Unlabeled Data using Misclassified Data Correction</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki ; Suguru Matsuyoshi</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dealing with a collection of labeled training documents, especially annotating negative training documents and presents a method of text classification from positive and unlabeled data. We applied an error detection and correction technique to the results of positive and negative documents classified by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results using Reuters documents showed that the method was comparable to the current state-of-the-art biasedSVM method as the F-score obtained by our method was 0.627 and biased-SVM was 0.614.</p><p>6 0.59263891 <a title="105-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>

</p><p>18 Through other languages, various ways of adding semantic information to a question could be available, thereby leading to potentially more improvements than using the original language only. [sent-61, score-0.403]
</p><p>19 Taking a step toward using other languages, we propose the use of translated representation by alternatively enriching the original questions with the words from other languages. [sent-62, score-0.484]
</p><p>20 The idea of improving question retrieval with statistical machine translation is based on the following two observations: (1) Contextual information is exploited during the translation from one language to another. [sent-63, score-0.8]
</p><p>21 4e Thus, -warotrd tr ambiguity oblas −ed− on contextual information is naturally involved when questions are translated. [sent-65, score-0.375]
</p><p>22 (2012) exploited bilingual translation for question retrieval and obtained the better performance than traditional monolingual translation models. [sent-70, score-0.811]
</p><p>23 To solve these two problems, we propose to leverage statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval via matrix factorization. [sent-72, score-0.854]
</p><p>24 Section 2 describes the proposed method  by leveraging statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval via matrix factorization. [sent-74, score-0.848]
</p><p>25 1 Problem Statement This paper aims to leverage statistical machine translation to enrich the question representation. [sent-80, score-0.532]
</p><p>26 In order to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems, we expand a question by adding its translation counterparts. [sent-81, score-0.734]
</p><p>27 , Google Translate) can utilize contextual information during the question translation, so it can solve the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems to some extent. [sent-84, score-0.736]
</p><p>28 , be the set of historical question collection in original language, where N is the number of historical questions in D1 with vocabulary size M1. [sent-94, score-0.894]
</p><p>29 Now we first translate each original historical question from language l1 into other languages lp (p ∈ [2, P]) by Google Translate. [sent-95, score-0.733]
</p><p>30 A question in Dp is simply represented as a Mp dimensional vector  di(p),  in which each entry is calculated by tf-idf. [sent-100, score-0.351]
</p><p>31 The N historical questions in Dp are then represented in a Mp N term-question matrix Dp =  {d1(p), d2(p), . [sent-101, score-0.529]
</p><p>32 , d(Np)},  in which each row corresponds to a term and} e,a icnh wcholiucmhn e corresponds etoa question. [sent-104, score-0.328]
</p><p>33 Intuitively, we can enrich the original question representation by adding the translated words from language l2 to lP, the origina∑l vocabulary size is increased from M1 to Mp. [sent-105, score-0.567]
</p><p>34 , DP} and D ∈ However, there are two problems with∑ this enrichment: (1) enriching the original questions with the translated words from other languages makes the question representation even more sparse; (2) statistical machine translation may introduce noise. [sent-110, score-1.115]
</p><p>35 5 To solve these two problems, we propose to leverage statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval via matrix factorization. [sent-111, score-0.854]
</p><p>36 Figure 1presents the framework of our proposed method, where qi represents a queried question, and qi is a vector representation of qi. [sent-112, score-0.468]
</p><p>37 2 Model Formulation To tackle the data sparseness of question representation with the translated words, we hope to find  two or more lower dimensional matrices whose product provides a good approximate to the original one via matrix factorization. [sent-116, score-0.789]
</p><p>38 The non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is proposed to learn the parts of objects like text documents (Lee and Seung, 2001). [sent-119, score-0.319]
</p><p>39 wMhaetrriec ∥es · Up ∈ RMp×K and Vp ∈ RK×N are the reduced representation for terms ∈an Rd questions in the K dimensional space, respectively. [sent-131, score-0.368]
</p><p>40 ,u(ipK))Tbe the column vectors whose enLet  tries are those of the ith row of Dp and Up respectively. [sent-173, score-0.359]
</p><p>41 Thus, the optimization of equation (5) can be decomposed into Mp optimization problems that can be solved independently, with each corresponding to one row of Up:  um(ip)in≥0∥d¯(ip)− VpT u¯i(p)∥22  (6)  for i= 1, . [sent-174, score-0.598]
</p><p>42 To do so, given a queried question q and a historical question d from Yahoo! [sent-211, score-0.981]

</p><p>44 For queried question q = q1, we represent it in the reduced space: vq1  = argmv≥i0n∥q1− U1v∥22+ λ1∥v∥22  (17)  where vector q1 is the tf-idf representation of queried question q1 in the term space. [sent-216, score-1.13]
</p><p>45 Similarly,  for historical question d = d1 (and its tf-idf representation d1 in the term space) we represent it in the reduced space as vd1 . [sent-217, score-0.632]
</p><p>46 Similarly, for translated representation di (and its tf-idf representation di in the term space) we also represent it in the reduced space as vdi . [sent-219, score-0.479]
</p><p>47 More specifically, we utilize the resolved questions and the resulting question  repository that we use for question retrieval contains 2,288,607 questions. [sent-232, score-1.011]
</p><p>48 Each resolved question consists of four parts: “question title”, “question description”, “question answers” and “question category”. [sent-233, score-0.321]
</p><p>49 For question retrieval, we only use the “question title” part. [sent-234, score-0.321]
</p><p>50 It is assumed that question title already provides enough semantic information for understanding the users’ information needs (Duan et al. [sent-235, score-0.351]
</p><p>51 This set contains 252 queried questions and can be freely downloaded for research communities. [sent-246, score-0.396]
</p><p>52 7 The original language of the above data set is English (l1) and then they are translated into four other languages (Chinese (l2), French (l3), German (l4), Italian (l5)), thus the number of language considered is P = 5) by using the state-of-the-art translation tool −−Google Translate. [sent-247, score-0.38]
</p><p>53 Evaluation Metrics: We evaluate the performance of question retrieval using the following metrics: Mean Average Precision (MAP) and Precision@N (P@N). [sent-248, score-0.476]
</p><p>54 Row 1 and row 2 are two baseline systems, which model the relevance score using VSM (Cao et al. [sent-272, score-0.386]
</p><p>55 Row 3 and row 6 are monolingual translation models to address the word mismatch problem and obtain the state-of-the-art performance in previous work. [sent-275, score-0.682]
</p><p>56 , 2005), and row 4 is the wordbased translation language model, which linearly combines the word-based translation model and  language model into a unified framework (Xue et al. [sent-277, score-0.681]
</p><p>57 Row 6 is the entitybased translation model, which extends the wordbased translation model and explores strategies to learn the translation probabilities between words and the concepts using the CQA archives and a popular entity catalog (Singh, 2012). [sent-281, score-0.531]
</p><p>58 Row 7 is the bilingual translation model, which translates the English questions from Yahoo! [sent-282, score-0.391]
</p><p>59 Row 8 and row 9 are our proposed method, which leverages statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval via matrix factorization. [sent-286, score-1.176]
</p><p>60 In row 8, we only consider two languages (English and Chinese) and translate English questions into Chinese using Google Translate in order to compare with Zhou et al. [sent-287, score-0.708]
</p><p>61 In row 9, we translate English questions into other  four languages. [sent-289, score-0.623]
</p><p>62 There are some clear trends in the result of Table 3: (1) Monolingual translation models significantly outperform the VSM and LM (row 1 and row 2 vs. [sent-290, score-0.474]
</p><p>63 (2) Taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages via statistical machine translation, question retrieval performance can be significantly improved (row 3, row 4, row 5 and row 6 vs. [sent-292, score-1.675]
</p><p>64 row 7, row 8 and row 9, all these comparisons are statistically significant at p < 0. [sent-293, score-0.984]
</p><p>65 (3) Our proposed method (leveraging statistical machine translation via matrix factorization, SMT + MF) significantly outperforms the bilingual translation model of Zhou et al. [sent-295, score-0.518]
</p><p>66 row 8, the comparison is statistically significant at p < 0. [sent-297, score-0.328]
</p><p>67 The reason is that matrix factorization used in the paper can effectively solve the data sparseness and noise introduced by the machine translator simultaneously. [sent-299, score-0.453]
</p><p>68 (4) When considering more languages, question retrieval performance can be further improved  (row 8 vs. [sent-300, score-0.476]
</p><p>69 (2009) also addressed the word mismatch problem for question retrieval by using syntactic tree matching. [sent-303, score-0.641]
</p><p>70 Besides, some other studies attempt to improve question retrieval with category information (Cao et al. [sent-309, score-0.476]
</p><p>71 3 Impact of the Matrix Factorization Our proposed method (SMT + MF) can effectively solve the data sparseness and noise via matrix factorization. [sent-317, score-0.364]
</p><p>72 To further investigate the impact of  the matrix factorization, one intuitive way is to expand the original questions with the translated words from other four languages, without considering the data sparseness and noise introduced by machine translator. [sent-318, score-0.649]
</p><p>73 Besides, we also employ our proposed matrix factorization to the original question representation (VSM + MF). [sent-320, score-0.749]
</p><p>74 (1) Our proposed matrix factorization can significantly improve the performance of question retrieval (row 1 vs. [sent-325, score-0.795]
</p><p>75 (2) Compared to the relative improvements of row 3 and row 4, the relative improvements of row 1 and row 2 is much larger. [sent-330, score-1.312]
</p><p>76 row 3), which supports the motivation that the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems could be partially addressed by Google Translate. [sent-333, score-0.642]
</p><p>77 4 Impact of the Translation Language One of the success of this paper is to take advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages to solve the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems. [sent-335, score-0.492]
</p><p>78 Row 1 (DT + MF) represents integrating two copies of English questions with our proposed matrix factorization. [sent-339, score-0.408]
</p><p>79 From Table 5, we have several different findings: (1) Taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages can significantly improve the performance of question retrieval (row 1vs. [sent-340, score-0.659]
</p><p>80 row 2, row 3, row 4 and row 5, the improvements relative to DT + MF are statistically significant at p < 0. [sent-341, score-1.312]
</p><p>81 (2) Different languages contribute unevenly for question retrieval (e. [sent-343, score-0.604]

</p><p>83 is better than row 2 because the translation quality of English-French is much better than EnglishChinese. [sent-353, score-0.474]
</p><p>84 (3) Using much more languages does not seem to produce significantly better performance (row 6 and row 7 vs. [sent-354, score-0.413]
</p><p>85 5 Impact of the Contextual Information In this paper, we translate the English questions  into other four languages using Google Translate (GTrans), which takes into account contextual information during translation. [sent-358, score-0.439]
</p><p>86 If we translate a question word by word, it discards the contextual information. [sent-359, score-0.461]
</p><p>87 To investigate the impact of contextual information for question retrieval, we only consider two languages and translate English questions into Chinese using an English to Chinese lexicon (Dict) in StarDict8. [sent-361, score-0.76]
</p><p>88 4  Conclusions and Future Work  In this paper, we propose to employ statistical ma-  chine translation to improve question retrieval and 8StarDict is an open source dictionary software, available at http://stardict. [sent-365, score-0.654]

Unlike previous work, which primarily leverages syntactic analysis through dependency tree matching, we focus on improving the performance using models of lexical semantic resources. Experiments show that our systems can be consistently and significantly improved with rich lexical semantic information, regardless of the choice of learning algorithms. When evaluated on a benchmark dataset, the MAP and MRR scores are increased by 8 to 10 points, compared to one of our baseline systems using only surface-form matching. Moreover, our best system also outperforms pervious work that makes use of the dependency tree structure by a wide margin.</p><p>4 0.19889987 <a title="329-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Question_Classification_Transfer.html">292 acl-2013-Question Classification Transfer</a></p>

<p>Author: Oleg Rokhlenko ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: We introduce the novel task of automatically generating questions that are relevant to a text but do not appear in it. One motivating example of its application is for increasing user engagement around news articles by suggesting relevant comparable questions, such as “is Beyonce a better singer than Madonna?”, for the user to answer. We present the first algorithm for the task, which consists of: (a) offline construction of a comparable question template database; (b) ranking of relevant templates to a given article; and (c) instantiation of templates only with entities in the article whose comparison under the template’s relation makes sense. We tested the suggestions generated by our algorithm via a Mechanical Turk experiment, which showed a significant improvement over the strongest baseline of more than 45% in all metrics.</p><p>6 0.16964889 <a title="329-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering.html">272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Guangyou Zhou ; Fang Liu ; Yang Liu ; Shizhu He ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Community question answering (CQA) has become an increasingly popular research topic. In this paper, we focus on the problem of question retrieval. Question retrieval in CQA can automatically find the most relevant and recent questions that have been solved by other users. However, the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems bring about new challenges for question retrieval in CQA. State-of-the-art approaches address these issues by implicitly expanding the queried questions with additional words or phrases using monolingual translation models. While useful, the effectiveness of these models is highly dependent on the availability of quality parallel monolingual corpora (e.g., question-answer pairs) in the absence of which they are troubled by noise issue. In this work, we propose an alternative way to address the word ambiguity and word mismatch problems by taking advantage of potentially rich semantic information drawn from other languages. Our proposed method employs statistical machine translation to improve question retrieval and enriches the question representation with the translated words from other languages via matrix factorization. Experiments conducted on a real CQA data show that our proposed approach is promising.</p><p>2 0.93748724 <a title="329-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Latent_Semantic_Tensor_Indexing_for_Community-based_Question_Answering.html">218 acl-2013-Latent Semantic Tensor Indexing for Community-based Question Answering</a></p>
<p>Author: Xipeng Qiu ; Le Tian ; Xuanjing Huang</p><p>Abstract: Retrieving similar questions is very important in community-based question answering(CQA) . In this paper, we propose a unified question retrieval model based on latent semantic indexing with tensor analysis, which can capture word associations among different parts of CQA triples simultaneously. Thus, our method can reduce lexical chasm of question retrieval with the help of the information of question content and answer parts. The experimental result shows that our method outperforms the traditional methods.</p><p>3 0.83591658 <a title="329-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Question_Classification_Transfer.html">292 acl-2013-Question Classification Transfer</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) and Answer Extraction are often designed as isolated or loosely connected components in Question Answering (QA), with repeated overengineering on IR, and not necessarily performance gain for QA. We propose to tightly integrate them by coupling automatically learned features for answer extraction to a shallow-structured IR model. Our method is very quick to implement, and significantly improves IR for QA (measured in Mean Average Precision and Mean Reciprocal Rank) by 10%-20% against an uncoupled retrieval baseline in both document and passage retrieval, which further leads to a downstream 20% improvement in QA F1.</p><p>5 0.75776011 <a title="329-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-PAL%3A_A_Chatterbot_System_for_Answering_Domain-specific_Questions.html">266 acl-2013-PAL: A Chatterbot System for Answering Domain-specific Questions</a></p>

The strategies used by PAL, including semantic-extension-based question matching, solution management with personal information consideration, and XML-based knowledge pattern construction, are described and discussed. We also conduct a primary test for the feasibility of our system.</p><p>6 0.75424063 <a title="329-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Question_Analysis_for_Polish_Question_Answering.html">290 acl-2013-Question Analysis for Polish Question Answering</a></p>

<p>Author: Jesse Dunietz ; Lori Levin ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet are widely used in a multitude of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora such as treebanks. Often, the resources are used as-is, without question or examination. This practice risks missing significant performance gains and even entire techniques. This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations. We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector. With asis lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources. More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements.</p><p>4 0.75706488 <a title="329-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_Latent_Personas_of_Film_Characters.html">220 acl-2013-Learning Latent Personas of Film Characters</a></p>

These lexical classes capture the stereotypical actions of which a character is the agent and patient, as well as attributes by which they are described. As the first attempt to solve this problem explicitly, we also present a new dataset for the text-driven analysis of film, along with a benchmark testbed to help drive future work in this area.</p><p>5 0.75476342 <a title="329-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Transfer_Learning_Based_Cross-lingual_Knowledge_Extraction_for_Wikipedia.html">356 acl-2013-Transfer Learning Based Cross-lingual Knowledge Extraction for Wikipedia</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhigang Wang ; Zhixing Li ; Juanzi Li ; Jie Tang ; Jeff Z. Pan</p><p>Abstract: Wikipedia infoboxes are a valuable source of structured knowledge for global knowledge sharing. However, infobox information is very incomplete and imbalanced among the Wikipedias in different languages. It is a promising but challenging problem to utilize the rich structured knowledge from a source language Wikipedia to help complete the missing infoboxes for a target language. In this paper, we formulate the problem of cross-lingual knowledge extraction from multilingual Wikipedia sources, and present a novel framework, called WikiCiKE, to solve this problem. An instancebased transfer learning method is utilized to overcome the problems of topic drift and translation errors. Our experimental results demonstrate that WikiCiKE outperforms the monolingual knowledge extraction method and the translation-based method.</p><p>6 0.7498672 <a title="329-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Models_of_Semantic_Representation_with_Visual_Attributes.html">249 acl-2013-Models of Semantic Representation with Visual Attributes</a></p>

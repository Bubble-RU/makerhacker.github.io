<p>Author: Yukari Ogura ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to raise the accuracy of text classification based on latent topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary for good classification for example, to decide important sentences in a document, the sentences with important words are usually regarded as important sentences. In this case, tf.idf is often used to decide important words. On the other hand, we apply the PageRank algorithm to rank important words in each document. Furthermore, before clustering documents, we refine the target documents by representing them as a collection of important sentences in each document. We then classify the documents based on latent information in the documents. As a clustering method, we employ the k-means algorithm and inves– tigate how our proposed method works for good clustering. We conduct experiments with Reuters-21578 corpus under various conditions of important sentence extraction, using latent and surface information for clustering, and have confirmed that our proposed method provides better result among various conditions for clustering.</p><p>3 0.17308396 <a title="182-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Graph-based_Semi-Supervised_Model_for_Joint_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_and_Part-of-Speech_Tagging.html">173 acl-2013-Graph-based Semi-Supervised Model for Joint Chinese Word Segmentation and Part-of-Speech Tagging</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper introduces a graph-based semisupervised joint model of Chinese word segmentation and part-of-speech tagging. The proposed approach is based on a graph-based label propagation technique. One constructs a nearest-neighbor similarity graph over all trigrams of labeled and unlabeled data for propagating syntactic information, i.e., label distributions. The derived label distributions are regarded as virtual evidences to regularize the learning of linear conditional random fields (CRFs) on unlabeled data. An inductive character-based joint model is obtained eventually. Empirical results on Chinese tree bank (CTB-7) and Microsoft Research corpora (MSR) reveal that the proposed model can yield better results than the supervised baselines and other competitive semi-supervised CRFs in this task.</p><p>4 0.087113596 <a title="182-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Parsing_Graphs_with_Hyperedge_Replacement_Grammars.html">274 acl-2013-Parsing Graphs with Hyperedge Replacement Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: David Chiang ; Jacob Andreas ; Daniel Bauer ; Karl Moritz Hermann ; Bevan Jones ; Kevin Knight</p><p>Abstract: Hyperedge replacement grammar (HRG) is a formalism for generating and transforming graphs that has potential applications in natural language understanding and generation. A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithm’s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.</p><p>5 0.082175031 <a title="182-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Conditional_Random_Fields_for_Responsive_Surface_Realisation_using_Global_Features.html">90 acl-2013-Conditional Random Fields for Responsive Surface Realisation using Global Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>6 0.078261197 <a title="182-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Building_Comparable_Corpora_Based_on_Bilingual_LDA_Model.html">74 acl-2013-Building Comparable Corpora Based on Bilingual LDA Model</a></p>

<p>Author: Ben King ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev ; Robert Mankoff</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of automatically annotating the factoids present in collective discourse. Factoids are information units that are shared between instances of collective discourse and may have many different ways ofbeing realized in words. Our approach divides this problem into two steps, using a graph-based approach for each step: (1) factoid discovery, finding groups of words that correspond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid assignment, using these groups of words to mark collective discourse units that contain the respective factoids. We study this on two novel data sets: the New Yorker caption contest data set, and the crossword clues data set.</p><p>4 0.53904742 <a title="182-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_from_Positive_and_Unlabeled_Data_using_Misclassified_Data_Correction.html">342 acl-2013-Text Classification from Positive and Unlabeled Data using Misclassified Data Correction</a></p>
<p>Author: Fumiyo Fukumoto ; Yoshimi Suzuki ; Suguru Matsuyoshi</p><p>Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of dealing with a collection of labeled training documents, especially annotating negative training documents and presents a method of text classification from positive and unlabeled data. We applied an error detection and correction technique to the results of positive and negative documents classified by the Support Vector Machines (SVM). The results using Reuters documents showed that the method was comparable to the current state-of-the-art biasedSVM method as the F-score obtained by our method was 0.627 and biased-SVM was 0.614.</p><p>5 0.5328421 <a title="182-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-A_System_for_Summarizing_Scientific_Topics_Starting_from_Keywords.html">23 acl-2013-A System for Summarizing Scientific Topics Starting from Keywords</a></p>
<p>Author: Rahul Jha ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic generation of scientific surveys starting from keywords provided by a user. We present a system that can take a topic query as input and generate a survey of the topic by first selecting a set of relevant documents, and then selecting relevant sentences from those documents. We discuss the issues of robust evaluation of such systems and describe an evaluation corpus we generated by manually extracting factoids, or information units, from 47 gold standard documents (surveys and tutorials) on seven topics in Natural Language Processing. We have manually annotated 2,625 sentences with these factoids (around 375 sentences per topic) to build an evaluation corpus for this task. We present evaluation results for the performance of our system using this annotated data.</p><p>6 0.52259511 <a title="182-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Graph_Propagation_for_Paraphrasing_Out-of-Vocabulary_Words_in_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">174 acl-2013-Graph Propagation for Paraphrasing Out-of-Vocabulary Words in Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses both intra- and inter-sentential causal relations for why-QA. We also propose a method for assessing the appropriateness of causal relations as answers to a given question using the semantic orientation of excitation proposed by Hashimoto et al. (2012). By applying these ideas to Japanese why-QA, we improved precision by 4.4% against all the questions in our test set over the current state-of-theart system for Japanese why-QA. In addi- tion, unlike the state-of-the-art system, our system could achieve very high precision (83.2%) for 25% of all the questions in the test set by restricting its output to the confident answers only.</p><p>3 0.6087662 <a title="182-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

This has painful consequences such as high frequency of parsing errors related to coordination. In other words, coordination is a pending problem in dependency analysis of natural languages. This paper tries to shed some light on this area by bringing a systematizing view of various formal means developed for encoding coordination structures. We introduce a novel taxonomy of such approaches and apply it to treebanks across a typologically diverse range of 26 languages.

Unlike previous multi-stage pipeline approaches, which directly merge TM result into the final output, the proposed models refer to the corresponding TM information associated with each phrase at SMT decoding. On a Chinese–English TM database, our experiments show that the proposed integrated Model-III is significantly better than either the SMT or the TM systems when the fuzzy match score is above 0.4. Furthermore, integrated Model-III achieves overall 3.48 BLEU points improvement and 2.62 TER points reduction in comparison with the pure SMT system. Be- . sides, the proposed models also outperform previous approaches significantly.</p><p>5 0.58388627 <a title="182-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Identification_of_Speakers_in_Novels.html">184 acl-2013-Identification of Speakers in Novels</a></p>
<p>Author: Hua He ; Denilson Barbosa ; Grzegorz Kondrak</p><p>Abstract: Speaker identification is the task of at- tributing utterances to characters in a literary narrative. It is challenging to auto- mate because the speakers of the majority ofutterances are not explicitly identified in novels. In this paper, we present a supervised machine learning approach for the task that incorporates several novel features. The experimental results show that our method is more accurate and general than previous approaches to the problem.</p><p>6 0.56099164 <a title="182-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Aid_is_Out_There%3A_Looking_for_Help_from_Tweets_during_a_Large_Scale_Disaster.html">42 acl-2013-Aid is Out There: Looking for Help from Tweets during a Large Scale Disaster</a></p>

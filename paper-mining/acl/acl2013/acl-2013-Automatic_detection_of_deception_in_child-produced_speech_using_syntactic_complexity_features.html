<p>Author: Fangtao Li ; Yang Gao ; Shuchang Zhou ; Xiance Si ; Decheng Dai</p><p>Abstract: In Community question answering (QA) sites, malicious users may provide deceptive answers to promote their products or services. It is important to identify and filter out these deceptive answers. In this paper, we first solve this problem with the traditional supervised learning methods. Two kinds of features, including textual and contextual features, are investigated for this task. We further propose to exploit the user relationships to identify the deceptive answers, based on the hypothesis that similar users will have similar behaviors to post deceptive or authentic answers. To measure the user similarity, we propose a new user preference graph based on the answer preference expressed by users, such as “helpful” voting and “best answer” selection. The user preference graph is incorporated into traditional supervised learning framework with the graph regularization technique. The experiment results demonstrate that the user preference graph can indeed help improve the performance of deceptive answer prediction.</p><p>3 0.47299126 <a title="63-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-TopicSpam%3A_a_Topic-Model_based_approach_for_spam_detection.html">350 acl-2013-TopicSpam: a Topic-Model based approach for spam detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Claire Cardie ; Sujian Li</p><p>Abstract: Product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for decision making (Litvin et al., 2008; Jansen, 2010). And because of the profits at stake, people have been known to try to game the system by writing fake reviews to promote target products. As a result, the task of deceptive review detection has been gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we propose a generative LDA-based topic modeling approach for fake review detection. Our model can aptly detect the subtle dif- ferences between deceptive reviews and truthful ones and achieves about 95% accuracy on review spam datasets, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin.</p><p>4 0.089054987 <a title="63-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Utterance-Level_Multimodal_Sentiment_Analysis.html">379 acl-2013-Utterance-Level Multimodal Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Veronica Perez-Rosas ; Rada Mihalcea ; Louis-Philippe Morency</p><p>Abstract: During real-life interactions, people are naturally gesturing and modulating their voice to emphasize specific points or to express their emotions. With the recent growth of social websites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Amazon, video reviews are emerging as a new source of multimodal and natural opinions that has been left almost untapped by automatic opinion analysis techniques. This paper presents a method for multimodal sentiment classification, which can identify the sentiment expressed in utterance-level visual datastreams. Using a new multimodal dataset consisting of sentiment annotated utterances extracted from video reviews, we show that multimodal sentiment analysis can be effectively performed, and that the joint use of visual, acoustic, and linguistic modalities can lead to error rate reductions of up to 10.5% as compared to the best performing individual modality.</p><p>5 0.084688388 <a title="63-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Multilingual_Affect_Polarity_and_Valence_Prediction_in_Metaphor-Rich_Texts.html">253 acl-2013-Multilingual Affect Polarity and Valence Prediction in Metaphor-Rich Texts</a></p>
<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>6 0.070975818 <a title="63-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Predicting_and_Eliciting_Addressee%27s_Emotion_in_Online_Dialogue.html">282 acl-2013-Predicting and Eliciting Addressee's Emotion in Online Dialogue</a></p>

<p>Author: Adam Vogel ; Christopher Potts ; Dan Jurafsky</p><p>Abstract: Conversational implicatures involve reasoning about multiply nested belief structures. This complexity poses significant challenges for computational models of conversation and cognition. We show that agents in the multi-agent DecentralizedPOMDP reach implicature-rich interpretations simply as a by-product of the way they reason about each other to maximize joint utility. Our simulations involve a reference game of the sort studied in psychology and linguistics as well as a dynamic, interactional scenario involving implemented artificial agents.</p><p>5 0.27508664 <a title="63-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Is_word-to-phone_mapping_better_than_phone-phone_mapping_for_handling_English_words%3F.html">203 acl-2013-Is word-to-phone mapping better than phone-phone mapping for handling English words?</a></p>

Specifically, we investigate methods of pronouncing English words using Telugu phoneset in the con- text of Telugu Text-to-Speech. We compare phone-phone substitution and wordphone mapping for pronunciation of English words using Telugu phones. We are not considering other than native language phoneset in all our experiments. This differentiates our approach from other works in polyglot speech synthesis.</p><p>6 0.27379733 <a title="63-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Co-Regression_for_Cross-Language_Review_Rating_Prediction.html">81 acl-2013-Co-Regression for Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction</a></p>

Although such pivoted paraphrase collections have been successfully used to improve the performance of several different NLP applications, it is still difficult to get an intrinsic estimate of the quality and coverage of the paraphrases contained in these collections. We present ParaQuery, a tool that helps a user interactively explore and characterize a given pivoted paraphrase collection, analyze its utility for a particular domain, and compare it to other popular lexical similarity resources all within a single interface.</p><p>3 0.72250611 <a title="63-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Random_Walk_Factoid_Annotation_for_Collective_Discourse.html">293 acl-2013-Random Walk Factoid Annotation for Collective Discourse</a></p>
<p>Author: Ben King ; Rahul Jha ; Dragomir Radev ; Robert Mankoff</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of automatically annotating the factoids present in collective discourse. Factoids are information units that are shared between instances of collective discourse and may have many different ways ofbeing realized in words. Our approach divides this problem into two steps, using a graph-based approach for each step: (1) factoid discovery, finding groups of words that correspond to the same factoid, and (2) factoid assignment, using these groups of words to mark collective discourse units that contain the respective factoids. We study this on two novel data sets: the New Yorker caption contest data set, and the crossword clues data set.</p><p>4 0.70087308 <a title="63-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Equivalent_Relations_from_Linked_Data.html">242 acl-2013-Mining Equivalent Relations from Linked Data</a></p>

This paper studies the task of mining equivalent relations from Linked Data, which was insufficiently addressed before. We introduce an unsupervised method to measure equivalency of relation pairs and cluster equivalent relations. Early experiments have shown encouraging results with an average of 0.75~0.87 precision in predicting relation pair equivalency and 0.78~0.98 precision in relation clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.68143493 <a title="63-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>6 0.65898663 <a title="63-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

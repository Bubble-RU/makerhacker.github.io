[sent-3, score-0.588]
</p><p>2 Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. [sent-4, score-0.088]
</p><p>3 Previous work on syntactic parsing generally assumes a processing pipeline where an input sentence is first tokenized, POS-tagged and then parsed (Collins, 1999; Charniak, 2000; Petrov and Klein, 2007). [sent-7, score-0.131]
</p><p>4 This approach works well for languages like English where automatic tokenization and POS tagging can be performed with high accuracy without the guidance of the highlevel syntactic structure. [sent-8, score-0.252]
</p><p>5 Such an approach, however, is not optimal for languages like Chinese where there are no natural delimiters for word boundaries, and word segmentation (or tokenization) is a non-trivial research problem by itself. [sent-9, score-0.489]
</p><p>6 Errors in word segmentation would propagate to later processing stages such as POS tagging and syntactic parsing. [sent-10, score-0.506]
</p><p>7 More importantly, Chinese is a language that lacks the morphological clues that help determine the POS tag of a word. [sent-11, score-0.033]
</p><p>8 edu s This contributes  to the relatively low accuracy  (95% or below) in Chinese POS tagging when evaluated as a stand-alone task (Sun and Uszkoreit, 2012), and the noun/verb ambiguity is a major source of error. [sent-15, score-0.117]
</p><p>9 More recently, joint inference approaches have been proposed to address the shortcomings of the pipeline approach. [sent-16, score-0.155]
</p><p>10 Qian and Liu (2012) proposed a joint inference approach where syntactic parsing can provide feedback to word segmentation and POS tagging and showed that the joint inference approach leads to improvements in all three sub-tasks. [sent-17, score-0.746]
</p><p>11 However, a major challenge for joint inference approach is that the large combined search space makes efficient decoding and parameter estimation very hard. [sent-18, score-0.128]
</p><p>12 In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework for Chinese. [sent-19, score-0.061]
</p><p>13 An input Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, which is a compact representation of a small set of high-quality word segmentations. [sent-20, score-0.232]
</p><p>14 Then, a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the word lattice from two different viewpoints. [sent-21, score-1.041]
</p><p>15 We next employ the dual decomposition method to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and  encourage them to predict agreed structures. [sent-22, score-0.775]
</p><p>16 Experimental results show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracies of the three sub-tasks 2  The Lattice-based Framework  Figure 1 gives the organization of the framework. [sent-23, score-0.116]
</p><p>17 There are four types of linguistic structures: a Chinese sentence, the word lattice, tagged word sequence and parse tree of the Chinese sentence. [sent-24, score-0.451]
</p><p>18 We can see that the terminals and preterminals of a parse tree constitute a tagged word sequence. [sent-26, score-0.343]
</p><p>19 Therefore, we define a comparator between a tagged word sequence and a parse tree: if they contain the same word sequence and POS tags, they are equal, otherwise unequal. [sent-27, score-0.56]
</p><p>20 First, the Chinese sentence is segmented into a word lattice using the word segmentation system. [sent-31, score-1.057]
</p><p>21 Then the word lattice is fed into the lattice-based POS tagger to produce a  . [sent-32, score-0.867]
</p><p>22 tagged word sequence and into the latticebased parser to separately produce a parse tree We then compare with to see whether they are equal. [sent-33, score-0.614]
</p><p>23 Otherwise, the guidance generator generates some guidance orders based on the difference between and and guides the tagger and the parser to process the lattice again. [sent-35, score-1.1]
</p><p>24 This procedure may iterate many times until the tagger and parser predict equal structures. [sent-36, score-0.515]

</p><p>26 The motivation to design such a framework is as follows. [sent-43, score-0.061]
</p><p>27 First, state-of-the-art word segmentation systems can now perform with high accuracy. [sent-44, score-0.389]
</p><p>28 We can easily get an F1 score greater than  96%, and an oracle (upper bound) F1 score greater than 99% for the word lattice (Jiang et al. [sent-45, score-0.622]
</p><p>29 Therefore, a word lattice provides us a good enough search space to allow sufficient interaction among word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing systems. [sent-47, score-0.876]
</p><p>30 Second, both the lattice-based POS tagger and the lattice-based parser can select word segmentation from the word lattice and predict POS tags, but they do so from two different perspectives. [sent-48, score-1.483]
</p><p>31 The lattice-based POS tagger looks at a path in a word lattice as a sequence and performs sequence labeling based on linear local context, while the lattice-based parser builds the parse trees in a hierarchical manner. [sent-49, score-1.255]
</p><p>32 They have different strengths with regard to word segmentation and POS tagging. [sent-50, score-0.482]
</p><p>33 We hypothesize that exploring the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser would improve each of the sub-tasks. [sent-51, score-0.569]
</p><p>34 We build a character-based model (Xue, 2003) for the word segmentation system, and treat segmentation as a sequence labeling task, where each Chinese character is labeled with a tag. [sent-52, score-0.906]
</p><p>35 To get a word lattice, we first generate N-best word segmentation results, and then compact the N-best lists into a word lattice by collapsing all the identical words into one edge. [sent-56, score-1.124]
</p><p>36 We also assign a probability to each edge, which is calculated by multiplying the tagging probabilities of each character in the word. [sent-57, score-0.289]
</p><p>37 The goal of the lattice-based POS tagger is to predict a tagged word sequence for an input word lattice  . [sent-58, score-1.157]
</p><p>38 : = a∈r g m a(x ) ∙ ( )  where ( ) represents the set of all possible tagged word sequences derived from the word lattice ( ) is used to map onto a global feature vector, and is the corresponding weight vector. [sent-59, score-0.796]
</p><p>39 We use the perceptron algorithm (Collins, 2002) for parameter estimation. [sent-62, score-0.044]
</p><p>40 Goldberg and Elhadad (201 1) proposed a lattice-based parser for Heberw based on the PCFG-LA model (Matsuzaki et al. [sent-63, score-0.174]
</p><p>41 We adopted their approach, but found the un-  weighted word lattice their parser takes as input to be ineffective for our Chinese experiments. [sent-65, score-0.823]
</p><p>42 Instead, we use a weighted lattice as input and weigh each edge in the lattice with the word probability. [sent-66, score-1.198]
</p><p>43 In our model, each syntactic category is split into multiple subcategories [ ] by labeling a latent annotation Then, a parse tree 624  . [sent-67, score-0.168]
</p><p>44 3  Combined Optimization Between The Lattice-based POS Tagger and The Lattice-based Parser  We first define some variables to make it easier to compare a tagged word sequence with a  . [sent-70, score-0.271]
</p><p>45 ,  parse tree We define as the set of all POS tags. [sent-71, score-0.175]
</p><p>46 For we define ( , , )=1 if contains a POS tag ∈ spanning from the i-th character to the j-th character, otherwise ( , , )= 0. [sent-72, score-0.327]
</p><p>47 We also define ( , , #) = 1 if contains the word spanning from the i-th character to the j-th character, otherwise ( , , #) = 0. [sent-73, score-0.367]
</p><p>48 Similarly, for we define ( , , )=1 if contains a POS tag ∈ spanning from the i-th character to the j-th character, otherwise ( , , )= 0. [sent-74, score-0.327]
</p><p>49 We also define ( , , #) = 1 if contains the word spanning from the i-th character to the j-th character, otherwise ( , , #) = 0. [sent-75, score-0.367]
</p><p>50 Therefore, and are equal, only if ( , , )= ( , , ) for all ∈ [0, ] , ∈ [ + 1,] and ∈ ∪ #, otherwise unequal. [sent-76, score-0.065]
</p><p>51 The dual decomposition (a special case of Lagrangian relaxation) method introduced in Komodakis et al. [sent-78, score-0.187]
</p><p>52 Using this method, we solve the primal constraint optimization problem by optimizing the dual problem. [sent-80, score-0.203]
</p><p>53 (2010), we define the subgradient of ( ) as: ( , , ) ( , , )− ( , , ) for all ( , , ) Then, adjust ( , , ) as follows: ( , , ) ( , , )− ( ( , , )− ( , , )) where >0 is a step size. [sent-86, score-0.12]
</p><p>54 The algorithm initializes the Lagrange multiplier values with 0 (line  1) and then iterates many times. [sent-88, score-0.08]
</p><p>55 In each iteration, the algorithm finds the best ( ) and ( ) by running the lattice-based POS tagger (line 3) and the lattice-based parser (line 4). [sent-89, score-0.419]
</p><p>56 If ( ) and ( ) share the same tagged word sequence (line 5), then the algorithm returns the solution (line 6). [sent-90, score-0.237]
</p><p>57 Otherwise, the algorithm adjusts the Lagrange multiplier values based on the differences between ( ) and ( ) (line 8). [sent-91, score-0.08]
</p><p>58 A crucial point is that the argmax problems in line 3 and line 4 can be solved efficiently using the original decoding algorithms, because the Lagrange multiplier can be regarded as adjustments for lexical rule probabilities and word probabilities. [sent-92, score-0.421]
</p><p>59 The traditional evaluation metrics for POS tagging and parsing are not suitable for the joint task. [sent-95, score-0.232]
</p><p>60 Following with Qian and Liu (2012), we redefine precision and recall by computing the span of a constituent based on  character offsets rather than word offsets. [sent-96, score-0.238]
</p><p>61 1 Performance of the Basic Sub-systems We train the word segmentation system with 100 iterations of the Maximum Entropy model using the OpenNLP toolkit. [sent-98, score-0.42]
</p><p>62 It shows that our word segmentation system is comparable with the state-of-the-art systems and the upper bound F1 score of the word lattice exceeds 99. [sent-100, score-1.076]
</p><p>63 This indicates that our word segmentation system can provide a good search space for the lattice-based POS tagger and the lattice-based parser. [sent-102, score-0.634]
</p><p>64 To train the lattice-based POS tagger, we generate the word lattice for each sentence in the training set using cross validation approach. [sent-120, score-0.622]
</p><p>65 We divide the entire training set into 18 folds on av-  erage (each fold contains 1,000 sentences). [sent-121, score-0.053]
</p><p>66 For each fold, we segment each sentence in the fold into a word lattice by compacting 20-best segmentation list produced with a model trained on the other 17 folds. [sent-122, score-1.019]
</p><p>67 Then, we train the latticebased POS tagger with 20 iterations of the average perceptron algorithm. [sent-123, score-0.382]
</p><p>68 Table 2 presents the joint word segmentation and POS tagging performance and shows that our lattice-based POS tagger obtains results that are comparable with state-of-the-art systems. [sent-124, score-0.802]
</p><p>69 We implement the lattice-based parser by modifying the Berkeley Parser, and train it with 5 iterations of the split-merge-smooth strategy (Petrov et al. [sent-138, score-0.205]
</p><p>70 Table 3 shows the performance, where the “Pipeline Parser” represents the system taking one-best segmentation result  from our word segmentation system as input and “Lattice-based Parser” represents the system taking the compacted word lattice as input. [sent-140, score-1.358]
</p><p>71 We find the lattice-based parser gets better performance than the pipeline system among all three subtasks. [sent-141, score-0.241]
</p><p>72 Table 4 shows the parsing performance on the test set. [sent-167, score-0.064]
</p><p>73 It shows that the lattice-based framework achieves improvement over the lattice-based parser alone among all  three sub-tasks: 0. [sent-168, score-0.235]
</p><p>74 It also outperforms the lattice-based POS tagger by 0. [sent-172, score-0.245]
</p><p>75 Our lattice-based framework also improves over the best joint inference parsing system (Qian and Liu, 2012) by 0. [sent-174, score-0.24]
</p><p>76 5  Conclusion  In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework for the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing. [sent-197, score-0.298]
</p><p>77 We first segment a Chinese sentence into a word lattice, then process the lattice using a lattice-  based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser. [sent-198, score-0.895]
</p><p>78 We also design a strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and the parser and encourage them to predict agreed structures. [sent-199, score-0.762]
</p><p>79 Experimental results show that the lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracies of the three tasks. [sent-200, score-0.116]
</p><p>80 The parsing accuracy of the framework also outperforms the best joint parsing system reported in the literature. [sent-201, score-0.24]

<p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><p>3 0.32143235 <a title="7-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>4 0.3114751 <a title="7-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenbin Jiang ; Meng Sun ; Yajuan Lu ; Yating Yang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Structural information in web text provides natural annotations for NLP problems such as word segmentation and parsing. In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>5 0.25992429 <a title="7-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Examination_of_Challenges_in_Chinese_Parsing.html">44 acl-2013-An Empirical Examination of Challenges in Chinese Parsing</a></p>

However, the contribution of individual sources of error to overall difficulty is not well understood. We conduct a comprehensive automatic analysis of error types made by Chinese parsers, covering a broad range of error types for large sets of sentences, enabling the first empirical ranking of Chinese error types by their performance impact. We also investigate which error types are resolved by using gold part-of-speech tags, showing that improving Chinese tagging only addresses certain error types, leaving substantial outstanding challenges.</p><p>6 0.2449604 <a title="7-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_on_Micro-blog_Using_Rich_Punctuations.html">193 acl-2013-Improving Chinese Word Segmentation on Micro-blog Using Rich Punctuations</a></p>

<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>2 0.92213404 <a title="7-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>
<p>Author: Meishan Zhang ; Yue Zhang ; Wanxiang Che ; Ting Liu</p><p>Abstract: Characters play an important role in the Chinese language, yet computational processing of Chinese has been dominated by word-based approaches, with leaves in syntax trees being words. We investigate Chinese parsing from the character-level, extending the notion of phrase-structure trees by annotating internal structures of words. We demonstrate the importance of character-level information to Chinese processing by building a joint segmentation, part-of-speech (POS) tagging and phrase-structure parsing system that integrates character-structure features. Our joint system significantly outperforms a state-of-the-art word-based baseline on the standard CTB5 test, and gives the best published results for Chinese parsing.</p><p>3 0.87524664 <a title="7-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_Learning_with_Natural_Annotations%3A_Word_Segmentation_as_a_Case_Study.html">123 acl-2013-Discriminative Learning with Natural Annotations: Word Segmentation as a Case Study</a></p>

In this paper we propose a discriminative learning algorithm to take advantage of the linguistic knowledge in large amounts of natural annotations on the Internet. It utilizes the Internet as an external corpus with massive (although slight and sparse) natural annotations, and enables a classifier to evolve on the large-scaled and real-time updated web text. With Chinese word segmentation as a case study, experiments show that the segmenter enhanced with the Chinese wikipedia achieves sig- nificant improvement on a series of testing sets from different domains, even with a single classifier and local features.</p><p>4 0.83880985 <a title="7-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Co-regularizing_character-based_and_word-based_models_for_semi-supervised_Chinese_word_segmentation.html">82 acl-2013-Co-regularizing character-based and word-based models for semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaodong Zeng ; Derek F. Wong ; Lidia S. Chao ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a semi-supervised Chinese word segmentation (CWS) approach that co-regularizes character-based and word-based models. Similarly to multi-view learning, the “segmentation agreements” between the two different types of view are used to overcome the scarcity of the label information on unlabeled data. The proposed approach trains a character-based and word-based model on labeled data, respectively, as the initial models. Then, the two models are constantly updated using unlabeled examples, where the learning objective is maximizing their segmentation agreements. The agreements are regarded as a set of valuable constraints for regularizing the learning of both models on unlabeled data. The segmentation for an input sentence is decoded by using a joint scoring function combining the two induced models. The evaluation on the Chinese tree bank reveals that our model results in better gains over the state-of-the-art semi-supervised models reported in the literature.</p><p>5 0.83544666 <a title="7-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Chinese_Word_Segmentation_on_Micro-blog_Using_Rich_Punctuations.html">193 acl-2013-Improving Chinese Word Segmentation on Micro-blog Using Rich Punctuations</a></p>
<p>Author: Longkai Zhang ; Li Li ; Zhengyan He ; Houfeng Wang ; Ni Sun</p><p>Abstract: Micro-blog is a new kind of medium which is short and informal. While no segmented corpus of micro-blogs is available to train Chinese word segmentation model, existing Chinese word segmentation tools cannot perform equally well as in ordinary news texts. In this paper we present an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation of micro-blog. In our approach, we incorporate punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data by introducing characters behind or ahead of punctuations, for they indicate the beginning or end of words. Meanwhile a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances is also used, which prove to be helpful. Ex- periments on micro-blog data show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. 1 INTRODUCTION Micro-blog (also known as tweets in English) is a new kind of broadcast medium in the form of blogging. A micro-blog differs from a traditional blog in that it is typically smaller in size. Furthermore, texts in micro-blogs tend to be informal and new words occur more frequently. These new features of micro-blogs make the Chinese Word Segmentation (CWS) models trained on the source domain, such as news corpus, fail to perform equally well when transferred to texts from micro-blogs. For example, the most widely used Chinese segmenter ”ICTCLAS” yields 0.95 f-score in news corpus, only gets 0.82 f-score on micro-blog data. The poor segmentation results will hurt subsequent analysis on micro-blog text. ∗Corresponding author Manually labeling the texts of micro-blog is time consuming. Luckily, punctuations provide useful information because they are used as indicators of the end of previous sentence and the beginning of the next one, which also indicate the start and the end of a word. These ”natural boundaries” appear so frequently in micro-blog texts that we can easily make good use of them. TABLE 1 shows some statistics of the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. Besides, English letters and digits are also more than those in news corpus. They all are natural delimiters of Chinese characters and we treat them just the same as punctuations. We propose a method to enlarge the training corpus by using punctuation information. We build a semi-supervised learning (SSL) framework which can iteratively incorporate newly labeled instances from unlabeled micro-blog data during the training process. We test our method on microblog texts and experiments show good results. This paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we introduce the problem. Section 2 gives detailed description of our approach. We show the experi- ment and analyze the results in section 3. Section 4 gives the related works and in section 5 we conclude the whole work. 2 Our method 2.1 Punctuations Chinese word segmentation problem might be treated as a character labeling problem which gives each character a label indicating its position in one word. To be simple, one can use label ’B’ to indicate a character is the beginning of a word, and use ’N’ to indicate a character is not the beginning of a word. We also use the 2-tag in our work. Other tag sets like the ’BIES’ tag set are not suiteable because the puctuation information cannot decide whether a character after punctuation should be labeled as ’B’ or ’S’(word with Single 177 ProceedingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An uuaglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioinngauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgicess 177–182, micNreow-bslogC68h56i. n73e%%seE10n1.g6.8l%i%shN20u. m76%%berPu1n13c9.t u03a%%tion Table 1: Percentage of Chinese, English, number, punctuation in the news corpus vs. the micro-blogs. character). Punctuations can serve as implicit labels for the characters before and after them. The character right after punctuations must be the first character of a word, meanwhile the character right before punctuations must be the last character of a word. An example is given in TABLE 2. 2.2 Algorithm Our algorithm “ADD-N” is shown in TABLE 3. The initially selected character instances are those right after punctuations. By definition they are all labeled with ’B’ . In this case, the number of training instances with label ’B’ is increased while the number with label ’N’ remains unchanged. Because of this, the model trained on this unbalanced corpus tends to be biased. This problem can become even worse when there is inexhaustible supply of texts from the target domain. We assume that labeled corpus of the source domain can be treated as a balanced reflection of different labels. Therefore we choose to estimate the balanced point by counting characters labeling ’B’ and ’N’ and calculate the ratio which we denote as η . We assume the enlarged corpus is also balanced if and only if the ratio of ’B’ to ’N’ is just the same to η of the source domain. Our algorithm uses data from source domain to make the labels balanced. When enlarging corpus using characters behind punctuations from texts in target domain, only characters labeling ’B’ are added. We randomly reuse some characters labeling ’N’ from labeled data until ratio η is reached. We do not use characters ahead of punctuations, because the single-character words ahead of punctuations take the label of ’B’ instead of ’N’ . In summary our algorithm tackles the problem by duplicating labeled data in source domain. We denote our algorithm as ”ADD-N”. We also use baseline feature templates include the features described in previous works (Sun and Xu, 2011; Sun et al., 2012). Our algorithm is not necessarily limited to a specific tagger. For simplicity and reliability, we use a simple MaximumEntropy tagger. 3 Experiment 3.1 Data set We evaluate our method using the data from weibo.com, which is the biggest micro-blog service in China. We use the API provided by weibo.com1 to crawl 500,000 micro-blog texts of weibo.com, which contains 24,243,772 characters. To keep the experiment tractable, we first randomly choose 50,000 of all the texts as unlabeled data, which contain 2,420,037 characters. We manually segment 2038 randomly selected microblogs.We follow the segmentation standard as the PKU corpus. In micro-blog texts, the user names and URLs have fixed format. User names start with ’ @ ’, followed by Chinese characters, English letters, numbers and ’ ’, and terminated when meeting punctuations or blanks. URLs also match fixed patterns, which are shortened using ”http : / /t . cn /” plus six random English letters or numbers. Thus user names and URLs can be pre-processed separately. We follow this principle in following experiments. We use the benchmark datasets provided by the second International Chinese Word Segmentation Bakeoff2 as the labeled data. We choose the PKU data in our experiment because our baseline methods use the same segmentation standard. We compare our method with three baseline methods. The first two are both famous Chinese word segmentation tools: ICTCLAS3 and Stanford Chinese word segmenter4, which are widely used in NLP related to word segmentation. Stanford Chinese word segmenter is a CRF-based segmentation tool and its segmentation standard is chosen as the PKU standard, which is the same to ours. ICTCLAS, on the other hand, is a HMMbased Chinese word segmenter. Another baseline is Li and Sun (2009), which also uses punctuation in their semi-supervised framework.

The recall of out-of-vocabulary is also taken into consideration, which measures the ability of the model to correctly segment out of vocabulary words. 3.2 Main results methods on the development data. TABLE 4 summarizes the segmentation results. In TABLE 4, Li-Sun is the method in Li and Sun (2009). Maxent only uses the PKU data for training, with neither punctuation information nor self-training framework incorporated. The next 4 methods all require a 100 iteration of self-training. No-punc is the method that only uses self-training while no punctuation information is added. Nobalance is similar to ADD N. The only difference between No-balance and ADD-N is that the former does not balance label ’B’ and label ’N’ . The comparison of Maxent and No-punctuation shows that naively adding confident unlabeled instances does not guarantee to improve performance. The writing style and word formation of the source domain is different from target domain. When segmenting texts of the target domain using models trained on source domain, the performance will be hurt with more false segmented instances added into the training set. The comparison of Maxent, No-balance and ADD-N shows that considering punctuation as well as self-training does improve performance. Both the f-score and OOV-recall increase. By comparing No-balance and ADD-N alone we can find that we achieve relatively high f-score if we ignore tag balance issue, while slightly hurt the OOV-Recall. However, considering it will improve OOV-Recall by about +1.6% and the fscore +0.2%. We also experimented on different size of unlabeled data to evaluate the performance when adding unlabeled target domain data. TABLE 5 shows different f-scores and OOV-Recalls on different unlabeled data set. We note that when the number of texts changes from 0 to 50,000, the f-score and OOV both are improved. However, when unlabeled data changes to 200,000, the performance is a bit decreased, while still better than not using unlabeled data. This result comes from the fact that the method ’ADD-N’ only uses characters behind punctua179 Tabl152S0eiz 0:Segm0.8nP67ta245ion0p.8Rer6745f9om0a.8nF57c6e1witOh0 .d7Vi65f-2394Rernt size of unlabeled data tions from target domain. Taking more texts into consideration means selecting more characters labeling ’N’ from source domain to simulate those in target domain. If too many ’N’s are introduced, the training data will be biased against the true distribution of target domain. 3.3 Characters ahead of punctuations In the ”BN” tagging method mentioned above, we incorporate characters after punctuations from texts in micro-blog to enlarge training set.We also try an opposite approach, ”EN” tag, which uses ’E’ to represent ”End of word”, and ’N’ to rep- resent ”Not the end of word”. In this contrasting method, we only use charactersjust ahead ofpunctuations. We find that the two methods show similar results. Experiment results with ADD-N are shown in TABLE 6 . 5DU0an0lt a b0Tsiealzbe lde6:0.C8Fo7”m5BNpa”rO0itsOa.o7gVn7-3oRfBN0.8aFn”7E0dNEN”Ot0.aO.g7V6-3R 4 Related Work Recent studies show that character sequence labeling is an effective formulation of Chinese word segmentation (Low et al., 2005; Zhao et al., 2006a,b; Chen et al., 2006; Xue, 2003). These supervised methods show good results, however, are unable to incorporate information from new domain, where OOV problem is a big challenge for the research community. On the other hand unsupervised word segmentation Peng and Schuurmans (2001); Goldwater et al. (2006); Jin and Tanaka-Ishii (2006); Feng et al. (2004); Maosong et al. (1998) takes advantage of the huge amount of raw text to solve Chinese word segmentation problems. However, they usually are less accurate and more complicated than supervised ones. Meanwhile semi-supervised methods have been applied into NLP applications. Bickel et al. (2007) learns a scaling factor from data of source domain and use the distribution to resemble target domain distribution. Wu et al. (2009) uses a Domain adaptive bootstrapping (DAB) framework, which shows good results on Named Entity Recognition. Similar semi-supervised applications include Shen et al. (2004); Daum e´ III and Marcu (2006); Jiang and Zhai (2007); Weinberger et al. (2006). Besides, Sun and Xu (201 1) uses a sequence labeling framework, while unsupervised statistics are used as discrete features in their model, which prove to be effective in Chinese word segmentation. There are previous works using punctuations as implicit annotations. Riley (1989) uses it in sentence boundary detection. Li and Sun (2009) proposed a compromising solution to by using a clas- sifier to select the most confident characters. We do not follow this approach because the initial errors will dramatically harm the performance. Instead, we only add the characters after punctuations which are sure to be the beginning of words (which means labeling ’B’) into our training set. Sun and Xu (201 1) uses punctuation information as discrete feature in a sequence labeling framework, which shows improvement compared to the pure sequence labeling approach. Our method is different from theirs. We use characters after punctuations directly. 5 Conclusion In this paper we have presented an effective yet simple approach to Chinese word segmentation on micro-blog texts. In our approach, punctuation information of unlabeled micro-blog data is used, as well as a self-training framework to incorporate confident instances. Experiments show that our approach improves performance, especially in OOV-recall. Both the punctuation information and the self-training phase contribute to this improve- ment.

<p>Author: Zhiguo Wang ; Chengqing Zong ; Nianwen Xue</p><p>Abstract: For the cascaded task of Chinese word segmentation, POS tagging and parsing, the pipeline approach suffers from error propagation while the joint learning approach suffers from inefficient decoding due to the large combined search space. In this paper, we present a novel lattice-based framework in which a Chinese sentence is first segmented into a word lattice, and then a lattice-based POS tagger and a lattice-based parser are used to process the lattice from two different viewpoints: sequential POS tagging and hierarchical tree building. A strategy is designed to exploit the complementary strengths of the tagger and parser, and encourage them to predict agreed structures. Experimental results on Chinese Treebank show that our lattice-based framework significantly improves the accuracy of the three sub-tasks. 1</p><p>2 0.82041371 <a title="7-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Co-Regression_for_Cross-Language_Review_Rating_Prediction.html">81 acl-2013-Co-Regression for Cross-Language Review Rating Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Xiaojun Wan</p><p>Abstract: The task of review rating prediction can be well addressed by using regression algorithms if there is a reliable training set of reviews with human ratings. In this paper, we aim to investigate a more challenging task of crosslanguage review rating prediction, which makes use of only rated reviews in a source language (e.g. English) to predict the rating scores of unrated reviews in a target language (e.g. German). We propose a new coregression algorithm to address this task by leveraging unlabeled reviews. Evaluation results on several datasets show that our proposed co-regression algorithm can consistently improve the prediction results. 1</p><p>3 0.81260812 <a title="7-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Stem_Translation_with_Affix-Based_Rule_Selection_for_Agglutinative_Languages.html">330 acl-2013-Stem Translation with Affix-Based Rule Selection for Agglutinative Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Zhiyang Wang ; Yajuan Lu ; Meng Sun ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: Current translation models are mainly designed for languages with limited morphology, which are not readily applicable to agglutinative languages as the difference in the way lexical forms are generated. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for translating agglutinative languages by treating stems and affixes differently. We employ stem as the atomic translation unit to alleviate data spareness. In addition, we associate each stemgranularity translation rule with a distribution of related affixes, and select desirable rules according to the similarity of their affix distributions with given spans to be translated. Experimental results show that our approach significantly improves the translation performance on tasks of translating from three Turkic languages to Chinese.</p><p>4 0.78459132 <a title="7-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>5 0.77977496 <a title="7-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Unsupervised_Consonant-Vowel_Prediction_over_Hundreds_of_Languages.html">369 acl-2013-Unsupervised Consonant-Vowel Prediction over Hundreds of Languages</a></p>
<p>Author: Young-Bum Kim ; Benjamin Snyder</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we present a solution to one aspect of the decipherment task: the prediction of consonants and vowels for an unknown language and alphabet. Adopting a classical Bayesian perspective, we performs posterior inference over hundreds of languages, leveraging knowledge of known languages and alphabets to uncover general linguistic patterns of typologically coherent language clusters. We achieve average accuracy in the unsupervised consonant/vowel prediction task of 99% across 503 languages. We further show that our methodology can be used to predict more fine-grained phonetic distinctions. On a three-way classification task between vowels, nasals, and nonnasal consonants, our model yields unsu- pervised accuracy of 89% across the same set of languages.</p><p>6 0.77967077 <a title="7-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Robust_Compressive_Summarization_with_Dual_Decomposition_and_Multi-Task_Learning.html">157 acl-2013-Fast and Robust Compressive Summarization with Dual Decomposition and Multi-Task Learning</a></p>

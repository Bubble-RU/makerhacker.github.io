<p>Author: Egoitz Laparra ; German Rigau</p><p>Abstract: This paper presents a novel deterministic algorithm for implicit Semantic Role Labeling. The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate. The algorithm solves the implicit arguments sequentially, exploiting not only explicit but also the implicit arguments previously solved. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.</p><p>4 0.062198691 <a title="367-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Outsourcing_FrameNet_to_the_Crowd.html">265 acl-2013-Outsourcing FrameNet to the Crowd</a></p>
<p>Author: Marco Fossati ; Claudio Giuliano ; Sara Tonelli</p><p>Abstract: We present the first attempt to perform full FrameNet annotation with crowdsourcing techniques. We compare two approaches: the first one is the standard annotation methodology of lexical units and frame elements in two steps, while the second is a novel approach aimed at acquiring frames in a bottom-up fashion, starting from frame element annotation. We show that our methodology, relying on a single annotation step and on simplified role definitions, outperforms the standard one both in terms of accuracy and time.</p><p>5 0.060666528 <a title="367-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>
<p>Author: Nan Yang ; Shujie Liu ; Mu Li ; Ming Zhou ; Nenghai Yu</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore a novel bilingual word alignment approach based on DNN (Deep Neural Network), which has been proven to be very effective in various machine learning tasks (Collobert et al., 2011). We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.</p><p>6 0.060070582 <a title="367-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Transfer_of_Semantic_Role_Labeling_Models.html">98 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Transfer of Semantic Role Labeling Models</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria Skeppstedt</p><p>Abstract: For expanding a corpus of clinical text, annotated for named entities, a method that combines pre-tagging with a version of active learning is proposed. In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>4 0.6275534 <a title="367-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-WebAnno%3A_A_Flexible%2C_Web-based_and_Visually_Supported_System_for_Distributed_Annotations.html">385 acl-2013-WebAnno: A Flexible, Web-based and Visually Supported System for Distributed Annotations</a></p>

WebAnno offers annotation project management, freely configurable tagsets and the management of users in different roles. WebAnno uses modern web technology for visualizing and editing annotations in a web browser. It supports arbitrarily large documents, pluggable import/export filters, the curation of annotations across various users, and an interface to farming out annotations to a crowdsourcing platform. Currently WebAnno allows part-ofspeech, named entity, dependency parsing and co-reference chain annotations. The architecture design allows adding additional modes of visualization and editing, when new kinds of annotations are to be supported.</p><p>5 0.5974192 <a title="367-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Fluid_Construction_Grammar_for_Historical_and_Evolutionary_Linguistics.html">161 acl-2013-Fluid Construction Grammar for Historical and Evolutionary Linguistics</a></p>

We demonstrate how the AnnoMarket platform can be used to develop NLP applications with little or no programming, to index the results for enhanced browsing and search, and to evaluate performance. Utilising AnnoMarket is straightforward, since cloud infrastructural issues are dealt with by the platform, completely transparently to the user: load balancing, efficient data upload and storage, deployment on the virtual machines, security, and fault tolerance.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.82293981 <a title="367-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Universal_Conceptual_Cognitive_Annotation_%28UCCA%29.html">367 acl-2013-Universal Conceptual Cognitive Annotation (UCCA)</a></p>

<p>Author: Lis Pereira ; Erlyn Manguilimotan ; Yuji Matsumoto</p><p>Abstract: This study addresses issues of Japanese language learning concerning word combinations (collocations). Japanese learners may be able to construct grammatically correct sentences, however, these may sound “unnatural”. In this work, we analyze correct word combinations using different collocation measures and word similarity methods. While other methods use well-formed text, our approach makes use of a large Japanese language learner corpus for generating collocation candidates, in order to build a system that is more sensitive to constructions that are difficult for learners. Our results show that we get better results compared to other methods that use only wellformed text. 1</p><p>4 0.79391021 <a title="367-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Large_tagset_labeling_using_Feed_Forward_Neural_Networks._Case_study_on_Romanian_Language.html">216 acl-2013-Large tagset labeling using Feed Forward Neural Networks.

Research Institute for ?????????? ???????????? ?????? Dr?????????? Romanian Academy tufi s @ racai . ro Networks (Marques and Lopes, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et Standard methods for part-of-speech tagging suffer from data sparseness when used on highly inflectional languages (which require large lexical tagset inventories). For this reason, a number of alternative methods have been proposed over the years.

A second phase is aimed at recovering the full set of morpho-syntactic features. In this paper we present an alternative method to Tiered Tagging, based on local optimizations with Neural Networks and we show how, by properly encoding the input sequence in a general Neural Network architecture, we achieve results similar to the Tiered Tagging methodology, significantly faster and without requiring extensive linguistic knowledge as implied by the previously mentioned method. 1</p><p>5 0.76124209 <a title="367-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe Travatar, a forest-to-string machine translation (MT) engine based on tree transducers. It provides an open-source C++ implementation for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline, including rule extraction, tuning, decoding, and evaluation. There are a number of options for model training, and tuning includes advanced options such as hypergraph MERT, and training of sparse features through online learning. The training pipeline is modeled after that of the popular Moses decoder, so users familiar with Moses should be able to get started quickly. We perform a validation experiment of the decoder on EnglishJapanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy than translation using phrase-based and hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As auxiliary results, we also compare different syntactic parsers and alignment techniques that we tested in the process of developing the decoder.

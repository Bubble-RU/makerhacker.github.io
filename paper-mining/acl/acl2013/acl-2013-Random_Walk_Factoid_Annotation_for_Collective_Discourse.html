<p>Author: Rahul Jha ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic generation of scientific surveys starting from keywords provided by a user. We present a system that can take a topic query as input and generate a survey of the topic by first selecting a set of relevant documents, and then selecting relevant sentences from those documents. We discuss the issues of robust evaluation of such systems and describe an evaluation corpus we generated by manually extracting factoids, or information units, from 47 gold standard documents (surveys and tutorials) on seven topics in Natural Language Processing. We have manually annotated 2,625 sentences with these factoids (around 375 sentences per topic) to build an evaluation corpus for this task. We present evaluation results for the performance of our system using this annotated data.</p><p>3 0.073260717 <a title="293-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Combining_Intra-_and_Multi-sentential_Rhetorical_Parsing_for_Document-level_Discourse_Analysis.html">85 acl-2013-Combining Intra- and Multi-sentential Rhetorical Parsing for Document-level Discourse Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Shafiq Joty ; Giuseppe Carenini ; Raymond Ng ; Yashar Mehdad</p><p>Abstract: We propose a novel approach for developing a two-stage document-level discourse parser. Our parser builds a discourse tree by applying an optimal parsing algorithm to probabilities inferred from two Conditional Random Fields: one for intrasentential parsing and the other for multisentential parsing. We present two approaches to combine these two stages of discourse parsing effectively. A set of empirical evaluations over two different datasets demonstrates that our discourse parser significantly outperforms the stateof-the-art, often by a wide margin.</p><p>4 0.070977747 <a title="293-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Lazaridou ; Ivan Titov ; Caroline Sporleder</p><p>Abstract: We propose a joint model for unsupervised induction of sentiment, aspect and discourse information and show that by incorporating a notion of latent discourse relations in the model, we improve the prediction accuracy for aspect and sentiment polarity on the sub-sentential level. We deviate from the traditional view of discourse, as we induce types of discourse relations and associated discourse cues relevant to the considered opinion analysis task; consequently, the induced discourse relations play the role of opinion and aspect shifters. The quantitative analysis that we conducted indicated that the integration of a discourse model increased the prediction accuracy results with respect to the discourse-agnostic approach and the qualitative analysis suggests that the induced representations encode a meaningful discourse structure.</p><p>5 0.062852927 <a title="293-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Synthetic_Discourse_Data_via_Multi-task_Learning_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Recognition.html">229 acl-2013-Leveraging Synthetic Discourse Data via Multi-task Learning for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition</a></p>
<p>Author: Man Lan ; Yu Xu ; Zhengyu Niu</p><p>Abstract: To overcome the shortage of labeled data for implicit discourse relation recognition, previous works attempted to automatically generate training data by removing explicit discourse connectives from sentences and then built models on these synthetic implicit examples. However, a previous study (Sporleder and Lascarides, 2008) showed that models trained on these synthetic data do not generalize very well to natural (i.e. genuine) implicit discourse data. In this work we revisit this issue and present a multi-task learning based system which can effectively use synthetic data for implicit discourse relation recognition. Results on PDTB data show that under the multi-task learning framework our models with the use of the prediction of explicit discourse connectives as auxiliary learning tasks, can achieve an averaged F1 improvement of 5.86% over baseline models.</p><p>6 0.060751125 <a title="293-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Social_Text_Normalization_using_Contextual_Graph_Random_Walks.html">326 acl-2013-Social Text Normalization using Contextual Graph Random Walks</a></p>

<p>Author: Akiko Eriguchi ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In a multi-class document categorization using graph-based semi-supervised learning (GBSSL), it is essential to construct a proper graph expressing the relation among nodes and to use a reasonable categorization algorithm. Furthermore, it is also important to provide high-quality correct data as training data. In this context, we propose a method to construct a similarity graph by employing both surface information and latent information to express similarity between nodes and a method to select high-quality training data for GBSSL by means of the PageR- ank algorithm. Experimenting on Reuters21578 corpus, we have confirmed that our proposed methods work well for raising the accuracy of a multi-class document categorization.</p><p>4 0.47148377 <a title="293-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Text_Classification_based_on_the_Latent_Topics_of_Important_Sentences_extracted_by_the_PageRank_Algorithm.html">341 acl-2013-Text Classification based on the Latent Topics of Important Sentences extracted by the PageRank Algorithm</a></p>
<p>Author: Yukari Ogura ; Ichiro Kobayashi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a method to raise the accuracy of text classification based on latent topics, reconsidering the techniques necessary for good classification for example, to decide important sentences in a document, the sentences with important words are usually regarded as important sentences. In this case, tf.idf is often used to decide important words. On the other hand, we apply the PageRank algorithm to rank important words in each document. Furthermore, before clustering documents, we refine the target documents by representing them as a collection of important sentences in each document. We then classify the documents based on latent information in the documents. As a clustering method, we employ the k-means algorithm and inves– tigate how our proposed method works for good clustering. We conduct experiments with Reuters-21578 corpus under various conditions of important sentence extraction, using latent and surface information for clustering, and have confirmed that our proposed method provides better result among various conditions for clustering.</p><p>5 0.41477349 <a title="293-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Summarization_Through_Submodularity_and_Dispersion.html">333 acl-2013-Summarization Through Submodularity and Dispersion</a></p>
<p>Author: Anirban Dasgupta ; Ravi Kumar ; Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: We propose a new optimization framework for summarization by generalizing the submodular framework of (Lin and Bilmes, 2011). In our framework the summarization desideratum is expressed as a sum of a submodular function and a nonsubmodular function, which we call dispersion; the latter uses inter-sentence dissimilarities in different ways in order to ensure non-redundancy of the summary. We consider three natural dispersion functions and show that a greedy algorithm can obtain an approximately optimal summary in all three cases. We conduct experiments on two corpora—DUC 2004 and user comments on news articles—and show that the performance of our algorithm outperforms those that rely only on submodularity.</p><p>6 0.39350083 <a title="293-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Leveraging_Synthetic_Discourse_Data_via_Multi-task_Learning_for_Implicit_Discourse_Relation_Recognition.html">229 acl-2013-Leveraging Synthetic Discourse Data via Multi-task Learning for Implicit Discourse Relation Recognition</a></p>

<p>Author: Maria Yancheva ; Frank Rudzicz</p><p>Abstract: It is important that the testimony of children be admissible in court, especially given allegations of abuse. Unfortunately, children can be misled by interrogators or might offer false information, with dire consequences. In this work, we evaluate various parameterizations of five classifiers (including support vector machines, neural networks, and random forests) in deciphering truth from lies given transcripts of interviews with 198 victims of abuse between the ages of 4 and 7. These evaluations are performed using a novel set of syntactic features, including measures of complexity. Our results show that sentence length, the mean number of clauses per utterance, and the StajnerMitkov measure of complexity are highly informative syntactic features, that classification accuracy varies greatly by the age of the speaker, and that accuracy up to 91.7% can be achieved by support vector machines given a sufficient amount of data.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.72339368 <a title="293-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Random_Walk_Factoid_Annotation_for_Collective_Discourse.html">293 acl-2013-Random Walk Factoid Annotation for Collective Discourse</a></p>

Early experiments have shown encouraging results with an average of 0.75~0.87 precision in predicting relation pair equivalency and 0.78~0.98 precision in relation clustering. 1</p><p>5 0.6553092 <a title="293-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Translating_Dialectal_Arabic_to_English.html">359 acl-2013-Translating Dialectal Arabic to English</a></p>
<p>Author: Hassan Sajjad ; Kareem Darwish ; Yonatan Belinkov</p><p>Abstract: We present a dialectal Egyptian Arabic to English statistical machine translation system that leverages dialectal to Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) adaptation. In contrast to previous work, we first narrow down the gap between Egyptian and MSA by applying an automatic characterlevel transformational model that changes Egyptian to EG0, which looks similar to MSA. The transformations include morphological, phonological and spelling changes. The transformation reduces the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words from 5.2% to 2.6% and gives a gain of 1.87 BLEU points. Further, adapting large MSA/English parallel data increases the lexical coverage, reduces OOVs to 0.7% and leads to an absolute BLEU improvement of 2.73 points.</p><p>6 0.63750917 <a title="293-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Bayesian_Model_for_Joint_Unsupervised_Induction_of_Sentiment%2C_Aspect_and_Discourse_Representations.html">2 acl-2013-A Bayesian Model for Joint Unsupervised Induction of Sentiment, Aspect and Discourse Representations</a></p>

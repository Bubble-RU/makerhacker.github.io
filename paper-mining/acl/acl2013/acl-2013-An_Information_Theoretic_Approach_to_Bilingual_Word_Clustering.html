<p>Author: Kashyap Popat ; Balamurali A.R ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Expensive feature engineering based on WordNet senses has been shown to be useful for document level sentiment classification. A plausible reason for such a performance improvement is the reduction in data sparsity. However, such a reduction could be achieved with a lesser effort through the means of syntagma based word clustering. In this paper, the problem of data sparsity in sentiment analysis, both monolingual and cross-lingual, is addressed through the means of clustering. Experiments show that cluster based data sparsity reduction leads to performance better than sense based classification for sentiment analysis at document level. Similar idea is applied to Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA), and it is shown that reduction in data sparsity (after translation or bilingual-mapping) produces accuracy higher than Machine Translation based CLSA and sense based CLSA.</p><p>4 0.29001468 <a title="47-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>5 0.26686847 <a title="47-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>6 0.23026989 <a title="47-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Tingting Li ; Tiejun Zhao ; Andrew Finch ; Chunyue Zhang</p><p>Abstract: Machine Transliteration is an essential task for many NLP applications. However, names and loan words typically originate from various languages, obey different transliteration rules, and therefore may benefit from being modeled independently. Recently, transliteration models based on Bayesian learning have overcome issues with over-fitting allowing for many-to-many alignment in the training of transliteration models. We propose a novel coupled Dirichlet process mixture model (cDPMM) that simultaneously clusters and bilingually aligns transliteration data within a single unified model. The unified model decomposes into two classes of non-parametric Bayesian component models: a Dirichlet process mixture model for clustering, and a set of multinomial Dirichlet process models that perform bilingual alignment independently for each cluster. The experimental results show that our method considerably outperforms conventional alignment models.</p><p>6 0.67360747 <a title="47-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

In this study, we revisit this learning paradigm and apply it to the transliteration task. We show that alone, it performs worse than a statistical phrase-based machine translation engine, but the combination of both approaches outperforms each one taken separately, demonstrating the usefulness of the information captured by a so-called formal analogy.</p><p>3 0.90726089 <a title="47-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Improved_Lexical_Acquisition_through_DPP-based_Verb_Clustering.html">192 acl-2013-Improved Lexical Acquisition through DPP-based Verb Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Roi Reichart ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Subcategorization frames (SCFs), selectional preferences (SPs) and verb classes capture related aspects of the predicateargument structure. We present the first unified framework for unsupervised learning of these three types of information. We show how to utilize Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs), elegant probabilistic models that are defined over the possible subsets of a given dataset and give higher probability mass to high quality and diverse subsets, for clustering. Our novel clustering algorithm constructs a joint SCF-DPP DPP kernel matrix and utilizes the efficient sampling algorithms of DPPs to cluster together verbs with similar SCFs and SPs. We evaluate the induced clusters in the context of the three tasks and show results that are superior to strong baselines for each 1.</p><p>4 0.88811743 <a title="47-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Liheng Xu ; Kang Liu ; Siwei Lai ; Yubo Chen ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.</p><p>5 0.87839669 <a title="47-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Adaptive_Online_Training_of_Feature-Rich_Translation_Models.html">156 acl-2013-Fast and Adaptive Online Training of Feature-Rich Translation Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Spence Green ; Sida Wang ; Daniel Cer ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>same-paper 6 0.87799489 <a title="47-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>

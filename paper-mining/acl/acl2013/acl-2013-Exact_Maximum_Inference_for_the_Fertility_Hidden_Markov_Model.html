<p>Author: Thomas Schoenemann</p><p>Abstract: We derive variants of the fertility based models IBM-3 and IBM-4 that, while maintaining their zero and first order parameters, are nondeficient. Subsequently, we proceed to derive a method to compute a likely alignment and its neighbors as well as give a solution of EM training. The arising M-step energies are non-trivial and handled via projected gradient ascent. Our evaluation on gold alignments shows substantial improvements (in weighted Fmeasure) for the IBM-3. For the IBM4 there are no consistent improvements. Training the nondeficient IBM-5 in the regular way gives surprisingly good results.

<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Wanxiang Che ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We intro- duce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</p><p>4 0.21063541 <a title="143-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-A_Markov_Model_of_Machine_Translation_using_Non-parametric_Bayesian_Inference.html">10 acl-2013-A Markov Model of Machine Translation using Non-parametric Bayesian Inference</a></p>
<p>Author: Yang Feng ; Trevor Cohn</p><p>Abstract: Most modern machine translation systems use phrase pairs as translation units, allowing for accurate modelling of phraseinternal translation and reordering. However phrase-based approaches are much less able to model sentence level effects between different phrase-pairs. We propose a new model to address this imbalance, based on a word-based Markov model of translation which generates target translations left-to-right. Our model encodes word and phrase level phenomena by conditioning translation decisions on previous decisions and uses a hierarchical Pitman-Yor Process prior to provide dynamic adaptive smoothing. This mechanism implicitly supports not only traditional phrase pairs, but also gapping phrases which are non-consecutive in the source. Our experiments on Chinese to English and Arabic to English translation show consistent improvements over competitive baselines, of up to +3.4 BLEU.</p><p>5 0.18098189 <a title="143-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Decipherment_for_Machine_Translation_via_Hash_Sampling.html">307 acl-2013-Scalable Decipherment for Machine Translation via Hash Sampling</a></p>
<p>Author: Sujith Ravi</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian inference method to train statistical machine translation systems using only nonparallel corpora. Following a probabilistic decipherment approach, we first introduce a new framework for decipherment training that is flexible enough to incorporate any number/type of features (besides simple bag-of-words) as side-information used for estimating translation models. In order to perform fast, efficient Bayesian inference in this framework, we then derive a hash sampling strategy that is inspired by the work of Ahmed et al. (2012). The new translation hash sampler enables us to scale elegantly to complex models (for the first time) and large vocab- ulary/corpora sizes. We show empirical results on the OPUS data—our method yields the best BLEU scores compared to existing approaches, while achieving significant computational speedups (several orders faster). We also report for the first time—BLEU score results for a largescale MT task using only non-parallel data (EMEA corpus).</p><p>6 0.15833044 <a title="143-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>

<p>Author: Gourab Kundu ; Vivek Srikumar ; Dan Roth</p><p>Abstract: Given that structured output prediction is typically performed over entire datasets, one natural question is whether it is possible to re-use computation from earlier inference instances to speed up inference for future instances. Amortized inference has been proposed as a way to accomplish this. In this paper, first, we introduce a new amortized inference algorithm called the Margin-based Amortized Inference, which uses the notion of structured margin to identify inference problems for which previous solutions are provably optimal. Second, we introduce decomposed amortized inference, which is designed to address very large inference problems, where earlier amortization methods become less ef- fective. This approach works by decomposing the output structure and applying amortization piece-wise, thus increasing the chance that we can re-use previous solutions for parts of the output structure. These parts are then combined to a global coherent solution using Lagrangian relaxation. In our experiments, using the NLP tasks of semantic role labeling and entityrelation extraction, we demonstrate that with the margin-based algorithm, we need to call the inference engine only for a third of the test examples. Further, we show that the decomposed variant of margin-based amortized inference achieves a greater reduction in the number of inference calls.</p><p>5 0.60476983 <a title="143-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Nonconvex_Global_Optimization_for_Latent-Variable_Models.html">260 acl-2013-Nonconvex Global Optimization for Latent-Variable Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Matthew R. Gormley ; Jason Eisner</p><p>Abstract: Many models in NLP involve latent variables, such as unknown parses, tags, or alignments. Finding the optimal model parameters is then usually a difficult nonconvex optimization problem. The usual practice is to settle for local optimization methods such as EM or gradient ascent. We explore how one might instead search for a global optimum in parameter space, using branch-and-bound. Our method would eventually find the global maximum (up to a user-specified ?) if run for long enough, but at any point can return a suboptimal solution together with an upper bound on the global maximum. As an illustrative case, we study a generative model for dependency parsing. We search for the maximum-likelihood model parameters and corpus parse, subject to posterior constraints. We show how to formulate this as a mixed integer quadratic programming problem with nonlinear constraints. We use the Reformulation Linearization Technique to produce convex relaxations during branch-and-bound. Although these techniques do not yet provide a practical solution to our instance of this NP-hard problem, they sometimes find better solutions than Viterbi EM with random restarts, in the same time.</p><p>6 0.5883407 <a title="143-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Variational_Inference_for_Structured_NLP_Models.html">382 acl-2013-Variational Inference for Structured NLP Models</a></p>

<p>Author: lemao liu ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are modeled using a loglinear framework. Although the log-linear model achieves success in SMT, it still suffers from some limitations: (1) the features are required to be linear with respect to the model itself; (2) features cannot be further interpreted to reach their potential. A neural network is a reasonable method to address these pitfalls. However, modeling SMT with a neural network is not trivial, especially when taking the decoding efficiency into consideration. In this paper, we propose a variant of a neural network, i.e. additive neural networks, for SMT to go beyond the log-linear translation model. In addition, word embedding is employed as the input to the neural network, which encodes each word as a feature vector. Our model outperforms the log-linear translation models with/without embedding features on Chinese-to-English and Japanese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>5 0.91470122 <a title="143-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Wanxiang Che ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We intro- duce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</p><p>6 0.9139154 <a title="143-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Training_Nondeficient_Variants_of_IBM-3_and_IBM-4_for_Word_Alignment.html">354 acl-2013-Training Nondeficient Variants of IBM-3 and IBM-4 for Word Alignment</a></p>

<p>Author: Xuchen Yao ; Benjamin Van Durme ; Chris Callison-Burch ; Peter Clark</p><p>Abstract: Fast alignment is essential for many natural language tasks. But in the setting of monolingual alignment, previous work has not been able to align more than one sentence pair per second. We describe a discriminatively trained monolingual word aligner that uses a Conditional Random Field to globally decode the best alignment with features drawn from source and target sentences. Using just part-of-speech tags and WordNet as external resources, our aligner gives state-of-the-art result, while being an order-of-magnitude faster than the previous best performing system.</p><p>3 0.23248638 <a title="259-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>
<p>Author: Mengqiu Wang ; Wanxiang Che ; Christopher D. Manning</p><p>Abstract: Translated bi-texts contain complementary language cues, and previous work on Named Entity Recognition (NER) has demonstrated improvements in performance over monolingual taggers by promoting agreement of tagging decisions between the two languages. However, most previous approaches to bilingual tagging assume word alignments are given as fixed input, which can cause cascading errors. We observe that NER label information can be used to correct alignment mistakes, and present a graphical model that performs bilingual NER tagging jointly with word alignment, by combining two monolingual tagging models with two unidirectional alignment models. We intro- duce additional cross-lingual edge factors that encourage agreements between tagging and alignment decisions. We design a dual decomposition inference algorithm to perform joint decoding over the combined alignment and NER output space. Experiments on the OntoNotes dataset demonstrate that our method yields significant improvements in both NER and word alignment over state-of-the-art monolingual baselines.</p><p>4 0.20569894 <a title="259-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>5 0.20174943 <a title="259-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Cut_the_noise%3A_Mutually_reinforcing_reordering_and_alignments_for_improved_machine_translation.html">101 acl-2013-Cut the noise: Mutually reinforcing reordering and alignments for improved machine translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Karthik Visweswariah ; Mitesh M. Khapra ; Ananthakrishnan Ramanathan</p><p>Abstract: Preordering of a source language sentence to match target word order has proved to be useful for improving machine translation systems. Previous work has shown that a reordering model can be learned from high quality manual word alignments to improve machine translation performance. In this paper, we focus on further improving the performance of the reordering model (and thereby machine translation) by using a larger corpus of sentence aligned data for which manual word alignments are not available but automatic machine generated alignments are available. The main challenge we tackle is to generate quality data for training the reordering model in spite of the machine align- ments being noisy. To mitigate the effect of noisy machine alignments, we propose a novel approach that improves reorderings produced given noisy alignments and also improves word alignments using information from the reordering model. This approach generates alignments that are 2.6 f-Measure points better than a baseline supervised aligner. The data generated allows us to train a reordering model that gives an improvement of 1.8 BLEU points on the NIST MT-08 Urdu-English evaluation set over a reordering model that only uses manual word alignments, and a gain of 5.2 BLEU points over a standard phrase-based baseline.</p><p>6 0.19048424 <a title="259-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Qun Liu ; Zhaopeng Tu ; Shouxun Lin</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel compact representation called weighted bipartite hypergraph to exploit the fertility model, which plays a critical role in word alignment. However, estimating the probabilities of rules extracted from hypergraphs is an NP-complete problem, which is computationally infeasible. Therefore, we propose a divide-and-conquer strategy by decomposing a hypergraph into a set of independent subhypergraphs. The experiments show that our approach outperforms both 1-best and n-best alignments.</p><p>4 0.86225307 <a title="259-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Training_Nondeficient_Variants_of_IBM-3_and_IBM-4_for_Word_Alignment.html">354 acl-2013-Training Nondeficient Variants of IBM-3 and IBM-4 for Word Alignment</a></p>
<p>Author: Thomas Schoenemann</p><p>Abstract: We derive variants of the fertility based models IBM-3 and IBM-4 that, while maintaining their zero and first order parameters, are nondeficient. Subsequently, we proceed to derive a method to compute a likely alignment and its neighbors as well as give a solution of EM training. The arising M-step energies are non-trivial and handled via projected gradient ascent. Our evaluation on gold alignments shows substantial improvements (in weighted Fmeasure) for the IBM-3. For the IBM4 there are no consistent improvements. Training the nondeficient IBM-5 in the regular way gives surprisingly good results. Using the resulting alignments for phrase- based translation systems offers no clear insights w.r.t. BLEU scores.</p><p>5 0.82192171 <a title="259-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Exploiting_Qualitative_Information_from_Automatic_Word_Alignment_for_Cross-lingual_NLP_Tasks.html">145 acl-2013-Exploiting Qualitative Information from Automatic Word Alignment for Cross-lingual NLP Tasks</a></p>
<p>Author: Jose G.C. de Souza ; Miquel Espla-Gomis ; Marco Turchi ; Matteo Negri</p><p>Abstract: The use of automatic word alignment to capture sentence-level semantic relations is common to a number of cross-lingual NLP applications. Despite its proved usefulness, however, word alignment information is typically considered from a quantitative point of view (e.g. the number of alignments), disregarding qualitative aspects (the importance of aligned terms). In this paper we demonstrate that integrating qualitative information can bring significant performance improvements with negligible impact on system complexity. Focusing on the cross-lingual textual en- tailment task, we contribute with a novel method that: i) significantly outperforms the state of the art, and ii) is portable, with limited loss in performance, to language pairs where training data are not available.</p><p>6 0.8154037 <a title="259-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>

<p>Author: Chris Quirk ; Pallavi Choudhury</p><p>Abstract: Ambiguity preserving representations such as lattices are very useful in a number of NLP tasks, including paraphrase generation, paraphrase recognition, and machine translation evaluation. Lattices compactly represent lexical variation, but word order variation leads to a combinatorial explosion of states. We advocate hypergraphs as compact representations for sets of utterances describing the same event or object. We present a method to construct hypergraphs from sets of utterances, and evaluate this method on a simple recognition task. Given a set of utterances that describe a single object or event, we construct such a hypergraph, and demonstrate that it can recognize novel descriptions of the same event with high accuracy.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.78218943 <a title="259-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Non-Monotonic_Sentence_Alignment_via_Semisupervised_Learning.html">259 acl-2013-Non-Monotonic Sentence Alignment via Semisupervised Learning</a></p>

<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>6 0.7297138 <a title="259-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Coordination_Structures_in_Dependency_Treebanks.html">94 acl-2013-Coordination Structures in Dependency Treebanks</a></p>

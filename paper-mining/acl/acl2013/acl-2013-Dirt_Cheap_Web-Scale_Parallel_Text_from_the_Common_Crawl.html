<p>Author: Wang Ling ; Guang Xiang ; Chris Dyer ; Alan Black ; Isabel Trancoso</p><p>Abstract: In the ever-expanding sea of microblog data, there is a surprising amount of naturally occurring parallel text: some users create post multilingual messages targeting international audiences while others “retweet” translations. We present an efficient method for detecting these messages and extracting parallel segments from them. We have been able to extract over 1M Chinese-English parallel segments from Sina Weibo (the Chinese counterpart of Twitter) using only their public APIs. As a supplement to existing parallel training data, our automatically extracted parallel data yields substantial translation quality improvements in translating microblog text and modest improvements in translating edited news commentary.

<p>Author: Adrien Barbaresi</p><p>Abstract: We present a way to extract links from messages published on microblogging platforms and we classify them according to the language and possible relevance of their target in order to build a text corpus. Three platforms are taken into consideration: FriendFeed, identi.ca and Reddit, as they account for a relative diversity of user profiles and more importantly user languages. In order to explore them, we introduce a traversal algorithm based on user pages. As we target lesser-known languages, we try to focus on non-English posts by filtering out English text. Using mature open-source software from the NLP research field, a spell checker (as- pell) and a language identification system (langid .py), our case study and our benchmarks give an insight into the linguistic structure of the considered services.</p><p>4 0.19306307 <a title="120-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Task_Alternation_in_Parallel_Sentence_Retrieval_for_Twitter_Translation.html">338 acl-2013-Task Alternation in Parallel Sentence Retrieval for Twitter Translation</a></p>

By iteratively alternating between the tasks of retrieval and translation, an initial general-domain model is allowed to adapt to in-domain data. Adaptation is done by training the translation system on a few thousand sentences retrieved in the step before.

<p>Author: Haibo Li ; Jing Zheng ; Heng Ji ; Qi Li ; Wen Wang</p><p>Abstract: We propose a Name-aware Machine Translation (MT) approach which can tightly integrate name processing into MT model, by jointly annotating parallel corpora, extracting name-aware translation grammar and rules, adding name phrase table and name translation driven decoding. Additionally, we also propose a new MT metric to appropriately evaluate the translation quality of informative words, by assigning different weights to different words according to their importance values in a document. Experiments on Chinese-English translation demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach on enhancing the quality of overall translation, name translation and word alignment over a high-quality MT baseline1 .</p><p>6 0.15947929 <a title="120-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>

<p>Author: Sanjika Hewavitharana ; Dennis Mehay ; Sankaranarayanan Ananthakrishnan ; Prem Natarajan</p><p>Abstract: We describe a translation model adaptation approach for conversational spoken language translation (CSLT), which encourages the use of contextually appropriate translation options from relevant training conversations. Our approach employs a monolingual LDA topic model to derive a similarity measure between the test conversation and the set of training conversations, which is used to bias translation choices towards the current context. A significant novelty of our adaptation technique is its incremental nature; we continuously update the topic distribution on the evolving test conversation as new utterances become available. Thus, our approach is well-suited to the causal constraint of spoken conversations. On an English-to-Iraqi CSLT task, the proposed approach gives significant improvements over a baseline system as measured by BLEU, TER, and NIST. Interestingly, the incremental approach outperforms a non-incremental oracle that has up-front knowledge of the whole conversation.</p><p>5 0.76241201 <a title="120-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_bilingual_terminologies_from_comparable_corpora.html">154 acl-2013-Extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora</a></p>
<p>Author: Ahmet Aker ; Monica Paramita ; Rob Gaizauskas</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a method for extracting bilingual terminologies from comparable corpora. In our approach we treat bilingual term extraction as a classification problem. For classification we use an SVM binary classifier and training data taken from the EUROVOC thesaurus. We test our approach on a held-out test set from EUROVOC and perform precision, recall and f-measure evaluations for 20 European language pairs. The performance of our classifier reaches the 100% precision level for many language pairs. We also perform manual evaluation on bilingual terms extracted from English-German term-tagged comparable corpora. The results of this manual evaluation showed 60-83% of the term pairs generated are exact translations and over 90% exact or partial translations.</p><p>6 0.75286067 <a title="120-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Sean Moran ; Victor Lavrenko ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a scheme for optimally allocating a variable number of bits per LSH hyperplane. Previous approaches assign a constant number of bits per hyperplane. This neglects the fact that a subset of hyperplanes may be more informative than others. Our method, dubbed Variable Bit Quantisation (VBQ), provides a datadriven non-uniform bit allocation across hyperplanes. Despite only using a fraction of the available hyperplanes, VBQ outperforms uniform quantisation by up to 168% for retrieval across standard text and image datasets.</p><p>2 0.94972557 <a title="120-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Dependency_Parser_Adaptation_with_Subtrees_from_Auto-Parsed_Target_Domain_Data.html">112 acl-2013-Dependency Parser Adaptation with Subtrees from Auto-Parsed Target Domain Data</a></p>

This is a feature augmentation approach in which the new features are constructed based on subtree information extracted from the autoparsed target domain data. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we evaluate it on three pairs of source-target data, compared with several common baseline systems and previous approaches. Our approach achieves significant improvement on all the three pairs of data sets.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.94642973 <a title="120-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Dirt_Cheap_Web-Scale_Parallel_Text_from_the_Common_Crawl.html">120 acl-2013-Dirt Cheap Web-Scale Parallel Text from the Common Crawl</a></p>

It provides an open-source C++ implementation for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline, including rule extraction, tuning, decoding, and evaluation. There are a number of options for model training, and tuning includes advanced options such as hypergraph MERT, and training of sparse features through online learning. The training pipeline is modeled after that of the popular Moses decoder, so users familiar with Moses should be able to get started quickly. We perform a validation experiment of the decoder on EnglishJapanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy than translation using phrase-based and hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As auxiliary results, we also compare different syntactic parsers and alignment techniques that we tested in the process of developing the decoder.

<p>Author: Rafal Rak ; Andrew Rowley ; Jacob Carter ; Sophia Ananiadou</p><p>Abstract: Developing sophisticated NLP pipelines composed of multiple processing tools and components available through different providers may pose a challenge in terms of their interoperability. The Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) is an industry standard whose aim is to ensure such interoperability by defining common data structures and interfaces. The architecture has been gaining attention from industry and academia alike, resulting in a large volume ofUIMA-compliant processing components. In this paper, we demonstrate Argo, a Web-based workbench for the development and processing of NLP pipelines/workflows. The workbench is based upon UIMA, and thus has the potential of using many of the existing UIMA resources. We present features, and show examples, offacilitating the distributed development of components and the analysis of processing results. The latter includes annotation visualisers and editors, as well as serialisation to RDF format, which enables flexible querying in addition to data manipulation thanks to the semantic query language SPARQL. The distributed development feature allows users to seamlessly connect their tools to workflows running in Argo, and thus take advantage of both the available library of components (without the need of installing them locally) and the analytical tools.</p><p>6 0.93749404 <a title="120-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>

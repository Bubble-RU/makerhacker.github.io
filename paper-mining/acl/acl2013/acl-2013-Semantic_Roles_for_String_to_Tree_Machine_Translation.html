[sent-3, score-1.462]
</p><p>2 1 Introduction Statistical machine translation (SMT) has made considerable advances in using syntactic proper-  ties of languages in both the training and the decoding of translation systems. [sent-5, score-0.42]
</p><p>3 Over the past few years, many researchers have started to realize that incorporating semantic features of languages can also be effective in increasing the quality of translations, as they can model relationships that often are not derivable from syntactic structures. [sent-6, score-0.307]
</p><p>4 Wu and Fung (2009) demonstrated the promise of using features based on semantic predicateargument structure in machine translation, using these feature to re-rank machine translation output. [sent-7, score-0.493]
</p><p>5 In general, re-ranking approaches are limited by the set of translation hypotheses, leading to a desire to incorporate semantic features into the translation model used during MT decoding. [sent-8, score-0.58]
</p><p>6 Liu and Gildea (2010) introduced two types of semantic features for tree-to-string machine translation. [sent-9, score-0.228]
</p><p>7 These features model the reorderings and deletions of the semantic roles in the source sentence during decoding. [sent-10, score-0.438]
</p><p>8 They showed that addition of these semantic features helps improve the quality of translations. [sent-11, score-0.228]
</p><p>9 Since tree-to-string systems are trained on parse trees, they are constrained by the  tree structures and are generally outperformed by string-to-tree systems. [sent-12, score-0.087]
</p><p>10 (2012) integrated two discriminative feature-based models into a phrase-based SMT system, which used the semantic predicateargument structure of the source language. [sent-14, score-0.317]
</p><p>11 Their first model defined features based on the context of a verbal predicate, to predict the target translation for that verb. [sent-15, score-0.232]
</p><p>12 Their second model predicted the reordering direction between a predicate and its arguments from the source to the target sentence. [sent-16, score-0.555]
</p><p>13 (2010) use a head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) parser to add semantic representations to their translation rules. [sent-18, score-0.447]
</p><p>14 In this paper, we use semantic role labels to enrich a string-to-tree translation system, and show that this approach can increase the BLEU (Papineni et al. [sent-19, score-0.745]
</p><p>15 , 2004) translation rules from training data where the target side has been parsed and labeled with semantic roles. [sent-22, score-0.791]
</p><p>16 Our general method of adding information to the syntactic tree is similar to the “tree grafting” ap-  proach of Baker et al. [sent-23, score-0.184]
</p><p>17 We modify the rule extraction procedure of Galley et al. [sent-25, score-0.192]
</p><p>18 (2004) to produce rules representing the overall predicateargument structure of each verb, allowing us to model alternations in the mapping from syntax to semantics of the type described by Levin (1993). [sent-26, score-0.411]
</p><p>19 1 Semantic Role Labeling Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) is the task of identifying the arguments of the predicates in a sentence, and classifying them into different argument labels. [sent-28, score-0.248]
</p><p>20 Semantic roles can provide a level 419  Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t. [sent-29, score-0.21]
</p><p>21 ” and “The door opened”, the word door has two different syntac-  tic roles but only one semantic role in the two sentences. [sent-33, score-0.794]
</p><p>22 Semantic arguments can be classified into core and non-core arguments (Palmer et al. [sent-34, score-0.417]
</p><p>23 Non-core arguments add more information about the predicate but are not essential. [sent-37, score-0.542]
</p><p>24 Automatic semantic role labelers have been developed by training classifiers on hand annotated data (Gildea and Jurafsky, 2000; Srikumar and Roth, 2011; Toutanova et al. [sent-38, score-0.518]
</p><p>25 State-of-the-art semantic role labelers can predict the labels with accuracies of around 90%. [sent-40, score-0.641]
</p><p>26 (2004) using the parses produced by the splitmerge parser of Petrov et al. [sent-43, score-0.038]
</p><p>27 (2010), the refined nonterminals produced by the split-merge method can aid machine translation. [sent-46, score-0.202]
</p><p>28 Furthermore, in all of our experiments, we exclude unary rules during extraction by ensuring that no rules will have the  same span in the source side (Chung et al. [sent-47, score-0.637]
</p><p>29 4 Semantically Enriched Rules (Method 1) In this method, we tag the target trees in the training corpus with semantic role labels, and extract the translation rules from the tagged corpus. [sent-53, score-1.036]
</p><p>30 “Lending” is the predicate, “everybody” is argument 0, and “a hand” is argument 1 for the predicate. [sent-55, score-0.13]

</p><p>32 We only label the core arguments of each predicate, to make sure that the rules are not too specific to the training data. [sent-58, score-0.543]
</p><p>33 We attach each semantic label to the root of the subtree that it is labeling. [sent-59, score-0.319]
</p><p>34 Figure 1 shows an example target tree after attaching the semantic roles. [sent-60, score-0.371]
</p><p>35 We then run a GHKM rule extractor on the labeled training corpus and use the semantically enriched rules with a syntax-based decoder. [sent-61, score-0.544]
</p><p>36 5  Complete Semantic Rules with Added Feature (Method 2) This approach uses the semantic role labels to extract a set of special translation rules, that on the target side form the smallest tree fragments in which one predicate and all of its core arguments are present. [sent-63, score-1.578]
</p><p>37 These rules model the complete semantic structure of each predicate, and are used by the decoder in addition to the normal GHKM  rules, which are extracted separately. [sent-64, score-0.631]
</p><p>38 Starting by semantic role labeling the target parse trees, we modify the GHKM component of the system to extract a semantic rule for each predicate. [sent-65, score-0.998]
</p><p>39 We define labels p as the set of semantic role labels related to predicate p. [sent-66, score-1.008]
</p><p>40 That includes all 420  Nduevmber of rutelesst  M Bae tsh eol idn e 12 14231946204137915 41 43 24069 05178509  Table 1: The number of the translation rules used by the three experimented methods of the labels of the arguments of p, and the label of p itself. [sent-67, score-0.791]
</p><p>41 Then we add the following condition to the definition of the “frontier node” defined in Galley et al. [sent-68, score-0.043]
</p><p>42 (2004): A frontier node must have either all or none of the semantic role labels from labels p in its descendants in the tree. [sent-69, score-0.829]
</p><p>43 Adding this new condition, we extract one se-  mantic rule for each predicate, and for that rule we discard the labels related to the other predicates. [sent-70, score-0.472]
</p><p>44 This semantic rule will then have on its target side, the smallest tree fragment that contains all of the arguments of predicate p and the predicate itself. [sent-71, score-1.38]
</p><p>45 Figure 2 depicts an example of a complete semantic rule. [sent-72, score-0.296]
</p><p>46 Numbers following grammatical categories (for example, S-8 at the root) are the refined nonterminals produced by the split-merge parser. [sent-73, score-0.146]
</p><p>47 In general, the tree side of the rule may extend below the nodes with semantic role labels because of the general constraint on frontier nodes that they must have a continuous span in the source (Chinese) side. [sent-74, score-1.096]
</p><p>48 Also, the internal nodes of the rules (such as a node with PRED label in Figure 2) are removed because they are not used in decoding. [sent-75, score-0.352]
</p><p>49 We also extract the regular GHKM rules using the original definition of the frontier nodes, and add the semantic rules to them. [sent-76, score-1.045]
</p><p>50 To differentiate the semantic rules from the non-semantic ones, we add a new binary feature that is set to 1 for the semantic rules and to 0 for the rest of the rules. [sent-77, score-1.037]
</p><p>51 3  Experiments  Semantic role labeling was done using the PropBank standard (Palmer et al. [sent-78, score-0.292]
</p><p>52 Our labeler uses a maximum entropy classifier and for identification and classification of semantic roles, and has a percision of 90% and a recall of 88%. [sent-80, score-0.3]
</p><p>53 The features used for training the labeler are a subset of the features used by Gildea and Jurafsky (2000), Xue and Palmer (2004), and Pradhan et al. [sent-81, score-0.072]
</p><p>54 The corpus was drawn from the newswire texts available from LDC. [sent-85, score-0.038]
</p><p>55 1 We used a 392-sentence development set with four references for parameter tuning, and a 428-sentence test set with four references for testing. [sent-86, score-0.047]
</p><p>56 They are drawn from the newswire portion of NIST evaluation (2004, 2005, 2006). [sent-87, score-0.038]

</p><p>58 , 2003), length penalty, and number of rules used, was used for the experiments. [sent-90, score-0.269]
</p><p>59 In all of our experiments, we used the split-merge parsing method of Petrov et al. [sent-91, score-0.056]
</p><p>60 on the training corpus, and mapped the semantic roles from the original trees to the result of the split-merge parser. [sent-92, score-0.488]
</p><p>61 We used a syntax-based decoder with Earley parsing and cube pruning (Chiang, 2007). [sent-93, score-0.066]
</p><p>62 We used the Minimum Error Rate Training (Och, 2003) to tune the decoding parameters for the development set and tested the best weights that were found on the test set. [sent-94, score-0.115]
</p><p>63 We ran three sets of experiments: Baseline experiments, where we did not do any semantic role labeling prior to rule extraction and only extracted regular GHKM rules, experiments with our method of Section 2. [sent-95, score-0.828]
</p><p>64 4 (Method 1), and a set of experiments with our method of Section 2. [sent-96, score-0.056]
</p><p>65 Table 1 contains the numbers of the GHKM translation rules used by our three method. [sent-98, score-0.445]
</p><p>66 The rules were filtered by the development and the test to increase the decoding speed. [sent-99, score-0.384]
</p><p>67 The increases in  the number of rules were expected, but they were not big enough to significantly change the performance of the decoder. [sent-100, score-0.269]
</p><p>68 1 Results For every set of experiments, we ran MERT on the development set with 8 different starting weight vectors picked randomly. [sent-102, score-0.047]

</p><p>75 Method 1 system seems to behave slightly worse than the baseline and Method 2. [sent-126, score-0.053]
</p><p>76 The reason for this behavior is that the rules that were extracted from the semantic role labeled corpus could have isolated semantic roles in them which would not necessarily get connected to the right predicate or argument during decoding. [sent-127, score-1.534]
</p><p>77 In other words, it is possible for a rule to only contain one or some of the semantic arguments of a predicate, and not even include the predicate itself, and therefore there is no guarantee that the predicate will be translated with the right arguments and in the right order.

</p><p>84 The second example is a case where the baseline method generated the arguments in the wrong order (in the case of facing and development), but the translation by Method 2 has the correct order. [sent-138, score-0.468]

<p>Author: Mikhail Kozhevnikov ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has become one of the standard tasks of natural language processing and proven useful as a source of information for a number of other applications. We address the problem of transferring an SRL model from one language to another using a shared feature representation. This approach is then evaluated on three language pairs, demonstrating competitive performance as compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised SRL system and a cross-lingual annotation projection baseline. We also consider the contribution of different aspects of the feature representation to the performance of the model and discuss practical applicability of this method. 1 Background and Motivation Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009). Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages. As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language. A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed. On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data. It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster. On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch. There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages. This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language. The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages. Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links. However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a sourcelanguage model on it. An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language. This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages. McDonald et al. (201 1) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of- speech tags as the shared representation of words. A later extension of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance. In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example “in August” vs “in Britain”. However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen1190 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1 90–120 , tations, such as the cross-lingual clustering mentioned above or cross-lingual distributed word representations of Klementiev et al. (2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion. In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing crosslingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one. This approach yields an SRL model for a new language at a very low cost, effectively requiring only a source language model and parallel data. We evaluate on five (directed) language pairs EN-ZH, ZH-EN, EN-CZ, CZ-EN and EN-FR, where EN, FR, CZ and ZH denote English, French, Czech and Chinese, respectively. The transferred model is compared against two baselines: an unsupervised SRL system and a model trained on the output of a cross-lingual annotation projection system. In the next section we will describe our setup, then in section 3 present the shared feature representation we use, discuss the evaluation data and other technical aspects in section 4, present the results and conclude with an overview of related work. – 2 Setup The purpose of the study is not to develop a yet another semantic role labeling system any existing SRL system can (after some modification) be used in this setup but to assess the practical applicability of cross-lingual model transfer to this – – problem, compare it against the alternatives and identify its strong/weak points depending on a particular setup. 2.1 Semantic Role Labeling Model We consider the dependency-based version of semantic role labeling as described in Haji cˇ et al. (2009) and transfer an SRL model from one language to another. We only consider verbal predicates and ignore the predicate disambiguation stage. We also assume that the predicate identification information is available in most languages it can be obtained using a relatively simple heuristic based on part-of-speech tags. The model performs argument identification and classification (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) separately in a pipeline first each candidate is classified as being or not being a head of an argument phrase with respect to the predicate in question and then each of the arguments is assigned a role from a given inventory. The model is factorized over arguments the decisions regarding the classification of different arguments are made in– – – dependently of each other. With respect to the use of syntactic annotation we consider two options: using an existing dependency parser for the target language and obtaining one by means of cross-lingual transfer (see section 4.2). Following McDonald et al. (201 1), we assume that a part-of-speech tagger is available for the target language. 2.2 SRL in the Low-resource Setting Several approaches have been proposed to obtain an SRL model for a new language with little or no manual annotation. Unsupervised SRL models (Lang and Lapata, 2010) cluster the arguments of predicates in a given corpus according to their semantic roles. The performance of such models can be impressive, especially for those languages where semantic roles correlate strongly with syntactic relation of the argument to its predicate. However, assigning meaningful role labels to the resulting clusters requires additional effort and the model’s parameters generally need some adjustment for every language. If the necessary resources are already available for a closely related language, they can be utilized to facilitate the construction of a model for the target language. This can be achieved either by means of cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or by cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). This last approach is the one we are considering in this work, and the other two options are treated as baselines. The unsupervised model will be further referred to as UNSUP and the projection baseline as PROJ. 2.3 Evaluation Measures We use the F1 measure as a metric for the argument identification stage and accuracy as an aggregate measure of argument classification performance. When comparing to the unsupervised SRL system the clustering evaluation measures are used instead. These are purity and collocation 1191 N1Ximajx|Gj∩ Ci| CO =N1Xjmiax|Gj∩ Ci|, PU = where Ci is the set of arguments in the i-th induced cluster, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold cluster and N is the total number of arguments. We report the harmonic mean ofthe two (Lang and Lapata, 2011) and denote it F1c to avoid confusing it with the supervised metric. 3 Model Transfer The idea of this work is to abstract the model away from the particular source language and apply it to a new one. This setup requires that we use the same feature representation for both languages, for example part-of-speech tags and dependency relation labels should be from the same inventory. Some features are not applicable to certain lan- guages because the corresponding phenomena are absent in them. For example, consider a strongly inflected language and an analytic one. While the latter can usually convey the information encoded in the word form in the former one (number, gender, etc.), finding a shared feature representation for such information is non-trivial. In this study we will confine ourselves to those features that are applicable to all languages in question, namely: part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependency structures and representations of the word’s identity. 3.1 Lexical Information We train a model on one language and apply it to a different one. In order for this to work, the words of the two languages have to be mapped into a common feature space. It is also desirable that closely related words from both languages have similar representations in this space. Word mapping. The first option is simply to use the source language words as the shared representation. Here every source language word would have itself as its representation and every target word would map into a source word that corresponds to it. In other words, we supply the model with a gloss of the target sentence. The mapping (bilingual dictionary) we use is derived from a word-aligned parallel corpus, by identifying, for each word in the target language, the word in the source language it is most often aligned to. Cross-lingual clusters. There is no guarantee that each of the words in the evaluation data is present in our dictionary, nor that the corresponding source-language word is present in the training data, so the model would benefit from the ability to generalize over closely related words. This can, for example, be achieved by using cross-lingual word clusters induced in T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012). We incorporate these clusters as features into our model. 3.2 Syntactic Information Part-of-speech Tags. We map part-of-speech tags into the universal tagset following Petrov et al. (2012). This may have a negative effect on the performance of a monolingual model, since most part-of-speech tagsets are more fine-grained than the universal POS tags considered here. For example Penn Treebank inventory contains 36 tags and the universal POS tagset only 12. Since the finergrained POS tags often reflect more languagespecific phenomena, however, they would only be useful for very closely related languages in the cross-lingual setting. The universal part-of-speech tags used in evaluation are derived from gold-standard annotation for all languages except French, where predicted ones had to be used instead. Dependency Structure. Another important aspect of syntactic information is the dependency structure. Most dependency relation inventories are language-specific, and finding a shared representation for them is a challenging problem. One could map dependency relations into a simplified form that would be shared between languages, as it is done for part-of-speech tags in Petrov et al. (2012). The extent to which this would be useful, however, depends on the similarity of syntactic-semantic in– terfaces of the languages in question. In this work we discard the dependency relation labels where the inventories do not match and only consider the unlabeled syntactic dependency graph. Some discrepancies, such as variations in attachment order, may be present even there, but this does not appear to be the case with the datasets we use for evaluation. If a target language is poor in resources, one can obtain a dependency parser for the target language by means of cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). We 1192 take this into account and evaluate both using the original dependency structures and the ones obtained by means of cross-lingual model transfer. 3.3 The Model The model we use is based on that of Bj ¨orkelund et al. (2009). It is comprised of a set of linear classifiers trained using Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). The feature model was modified to accommodate the cross-lingual cluster features and the reranker component was not used. We do not model the interaction between different argument roles in the same predicate. While this has been found useful, in the cross-lingual setup one has to be careful with the assumptions made. For example, modeling the sequence of roles using a Markov chain (Thompson et al., 2003) may not work well in the present setting, especially between distant languages, as the order or arguments is not necessarily preserved. Most constraints that prove useful for SRL (Chang et al., 2007) also require customization when applied to a new language, and some rely on languagespecific resources, such as a valency lexicon. Taking into account the interaction between different arguments of a predicate is likely to improve the performance of the transferred model, but this is outside the scope of this work. 3.4 Feature Selection Compatibility of feature representations is necessary but not sufficient for successful model transfer. We have to make sure that the features we use are predictive of similar outcomes in the two languages as well. Depending on the pair of languages in question, different aspects of the feature representation will retain or lose their predictive power. We can be reasonably certain that the identity of an argument word is predictive of its semantic role in any language, but it might or might not be true of, for example, the word directly preceding the argument word. It is therefore important to pre- SCPDGylOespoSntreslTabunc1lra:obsFel-daitnguplrdoaeusntpagd-elronwfu-dcsopeyrnsd c.eylafguhtorsia mepgnrhs vent the model from capturing overly specific aspects of the source language, which we do by confining the model to first-order features. We also avoid feature selection, which, performed on the source language, is unlikely to help the model to better generalize to the target one. The experiments confirm that feature selection and the use of second-order features degrade the performance of the transferred model. 3.5 Feature Groups For each word, we use its part-of-speech tag, cross-lingual cluster id, word identity (glossed, when evaluating on the target language) and its dependency relation to its parent. Features associated with an argument word include the attributes of the predicate word, the argument word, its parent, siblings and children, and the words directly preceding and following it. Also included are the sequences of part-of-speech tags and dependency relations on the path between the predicate and the argument. Since we are also interested in the impact of different aspects of the feature representation, we divide the features into groups as summarized in table 1 and evaluate their respective contributions to the performance of the model. If a feature group is enabled the model has access to the corre– sponding source of information. For example, if only POS group is enabled, the model relies on the part-of-speech tags of the argument, the predicate and the words to the right and left of the argument word. If Synt is enabled too, it also uses the POS tags of the argument’s parent, children and siblings. Word order information constitutes an implicit group that is always available. It includes the Pos it ion feature, which indicates whether the argument is located to the left or to the right of the predicate, and allows the model to look up the attributes of the words directly preceding and following the argument word. The model we compare against the baselines uses all applicable feature groups (Deprel is only used in EN-CZ and CZ-EN experiments with original syntax). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Evaluation of the cross-lingual model transfer requires a rather specific kind of dataset. Namely, the data in both languages has to be annotated 1193 with the same set of semantic roles following the same (or compatible) guidelines, which is seldom the case. We have identified three language pairs for which such resources are available: EnglishChinese, English-Czech and English-French. The evaluation datasets for English and Chinese are those from the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji ˇc et al., 2009) (henceforth CoNLL-ST). Their annotation in the CoNLL-ST is not identical, but the guidelines for “core” semantic roles are similar (Kingsbury et al., 2004), so we evaluate only on core roles here. The data for the second language pair is drawn from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Haji ˇc et al., 2012), which we converted to a format similar to that of CoNLL-ST1 . The original annotation uses the tectogrammatical representation (Haji ˇc, 2002) and an inventory of semantic roles (or functors), most of which are interpretable across various predicates. Also note that the syntactic anno- tation of English and Czech in PCEDT 2.0 is quite similar (to the extent permitted by the difference in the structure of the two languages) and we can use the dependency relations in our experiments. For English-French, the English CoNLL-ST dataset was used as a source and the model was evaluated on the manually annotated dataset from van der Plas et al. (201 1). The latter contains one thousand sentences from the French part ofthe Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus, annotated with semantic roles following an adapted version of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) guidelines. The authors perform annotation projection from English to French, using a joint model of syntax and semantics and employing heuristics for filtering. We use a model trained on the output of this projection system as one of the baselines. The evaluation dataset is relatively small in this case, so we perform the transfer only one-way, from English to French. The part-of-speech tags in all datasets were replaced with the universal POS tags of Petrov et al. (2012). For Czech, we have augmented the map- pings to account for the tags that were not present in the datasets from which the original mappings were derived. Namely, tag “t” is mapped to “VERB” and “Y” to “PRON”. We use parallel data to construct a bilingual dictionary used in word mapping, as well as in the projection baseline. For English-Czech – 1see http://www.ml4nlp.de/code-and-data/treex2conll and English-French, the data is drawn from Europarl (Koehn, 2005), for English-Chinese from MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The word alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the intersection heuristic. – 4.2 Syntactic Transfer In the low-resource setting, we cannot always rely on the availability of an accurate dependency parser for the target language. If one is not available, the natural solution would be to use crosslingual model transfer to obtain it. Unfortunately, the models presented in the previous work, such as Zeman and Resnik (2008), McDonald et al. (201 1) and T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012), were not made available, so we reproduced the direct transfer algorithm of McDonald et al. (201 1), using Malt parser (Nivre, 2008) and the same set of features. We did not reimplement the projected transfer algorithm, however, and used the default training procedure instead of perceptron-based learning. The dependency structure thus obtained is, of course, only a rough approximation even a much more sophisticated algorithm may not perform well when transferring syntax between such languages as Czech and English, given the inherent difference in their structure. The scores are shown in table 2. We will henceforth refer to the syntactic annotations that were provided with the datasets as original, as opposed to the annotations obtained by means of syntactic transfer. – 4.3 Baselines Unsupervised Baseline: We are using a version of the unsupervised semantic role induction system of Titov and Klementiev (2012a) adapted to SetupUAS, % Table2:SyntaciE C ZcN HNt- rE ZaCFnN HZRsfer34 692567acuracy,unlabe dat- tachment score (percent). Note that in case of French we evaluate against the output of a supervised system, since manual annotation is not available for this dataset. This score does not reflect the true performance of syntactic transfer. 1194 the shared feature representation considered in order to make the scores comparable with those of the transfer model and, more importantly, to enable evaluation on transferred syntax. Note that the original system, tailored to a more expressive language-specific syntactic representation and equipped with heuristics to identify active/passive voice and other phenomena, achieves higher scores than those we report here. Projection Baseline: The projection baseline we use for English-Czech and English-Chinese is a straightforward one: we label the source side of a parallel corpus using the source-language model, then identify those verbs on the target side that are aligned to a predicate, mark them as predicates and propagate the argument roles in the same fashion. A model is then trained on the resulting training data and applied to the test set. For English-French we instead use the output of a fully featured projection model of van der Plas et al. (201 1), published in the CLASSiC project. 5 Results In order to ensure that the results are consistent, the test sets, except for the French one, were partitioned into five equal parts (of 5 to 10 thousand sentences each, depending on the dataset) and the evaluation performed separately on each one. All evaluation figures for English, Czech or Chinese below are the average values over the five subsets. In case of French, the evaluation dataset is too small to split it further, so instead we ran the evaluation five times on a randomly selected 80% sample of the evaluation data and averaged over those. In both cases the results are consistent over the subsets, the standard deviation does not exceed 0.5% for the transfer system and projection baseline and 1% for the unsupervised system. 5.1 Argument Identification We summarize the results in table 3. Argument identification is known to rely heavily on syntactic information, so it is unsurprising that it proves inaccurate when transferred syntax is used. Our simple projection baseline suffers from the same problem. Even with original syntactic information available, the performance of argument identification is moderate. Note that the model of (van der Plas et al., 2011), though relying on more expressive syntax, only outperforms the transferred system by 3% (F1) on this task.

Most unsupervised SRL approaches assume that the argument identification is performed by some external means, for example heuristically (Lang and Lapata, 2011). Such heuristics or unsupervised approaches to argument identification (Abend et al., 2009) can also be used in the present setup. 5.2 Argument Classification In the following tables, TRANS column contains the results for the transferred system, UNSUP for the unsupervised baseline and PROJ for projection baseline. We highlight in bold the higher score where the difference exceeds twice the maximum of the standard deviation estimates of the two results. Table 4 presents the unsupervised evaluation results.

In the more realistic scenario with transferred syn- tax, however, the transferred model proves more accurate. In table 5 we compare the transferred system with the projection baseline. It is easy to see that the scores vary strongly depending on the language pair, due to both the difference in the annotation scheme used and the degree of relatedness between the languages. The drop in performance when transferring the model to another language is large in every case, though, see table 6.

We also include the individual F1 scores for the top-10 most frequent labels for EN-CZ transfer with original syntax in table 7.

Table 8 contains the results for English-French. FeaturesOrigTrans ferent feature subsets, using original and transferred syntactic information. The fact that the model performs slightly better with transferred syntax may be explained by two factors. Firstly, as we already mentioned, the original syntactic annotation is also produced automatically. Secondly, in the model transfer setup it is more important how closely the syntacticsemantic interface on the target side resembles that on the source side than how well it matches the “true” structure of the target language, and in this respect a transferred dependency parser may have an advantage over one trained on target-language data. The high impact of the Glos s features here 1196 may be partly attributed to the fact that the mapping is derived from the same corpus as the evaluation data Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and partly by the similarity between English and French in terms of word order, usage of articles and prepositions. The moderate contribution of the crosslingual cluster features are likely due to the insufficient granularity of the clustering for this task. For more distant language pairs, the contributions of individual feature groups are less interpretable, so we only highlight a few observations. First of all, both EN-CZ and CZ-EN benefit noticeably from the use of the original syntactic annotation, including dependency relations, but not from the transferred syntax, most likely due to the low syntactic transfer performance. Both perform better when lexical information is available, although – – the improvement is not as significant as in the case of French only up to 5%. The situation with Chinese is somewhat complicated in that adding lexical information here fails to yield an improvement in terms of the metric considered. This is likely due to the fact that we consider only the core roles, which can usually be predicted with high accuracy based on syntactic information alone. – 6 Related Work Development of robust statistical models for core NLP tasks is a challenging problem, and adaptation of existing models to new languages presents a viable alternative to exhaustive annotation for each language. Although the models thus obtained are generally imperfect, they can be further refined for a particular language and domain using techniques such as active learning (Settles, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied ex- tensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wr o´blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011; Annesi and Basili, 2010; Tonelli and Pianta, 2008), dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Hwa et al., 2005) or temporal relation prediction (Spreyer and Frank, 2008). Interestingly, it has also been used to propagate morphosyntactic information between old and modern versions of the same language (Meyer, 2011). Cross-lingual model transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Durrett et al., 2012; Søgaard, 2011; Lopez et al., 2008) have also been receiving much attention recently. The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (201 1). A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation. There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; T ¨ackstr o¨m et al., 2012), but both work on word level. This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language. Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Haji ˇc, 2002). A side-effect ofusing adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks. Such representations are also likely to be useful in machine translation. Unsupervised semantic role labeling methods (Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Lorenzo and Cerisara, 2012) also constitute an alternative to cross-lingual model transfer. For an overview of of semi-supervised approaches we refer the reader to Titov and Klementiev (2012b). 7 Conclusion We have considered the cross-lingual model transfer approach as applied to the task of semantic role labeling and observed that for closely related languages it performs comparably to annotation projection approaches. It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages. While an1197 notation projection approaches require sentenceand word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary. Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient. In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example. Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language. Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language.

<p>Author: Oren Melamud ; Jonathan Berant ; Ido Dagan ; Jacob Goldberger ; Idan Szpektor</p><p>Abstract: Automatic acquisition of inference rules for predicates has been commonly addressed by computing distributional similarity between vectors of argument words, operating at the word space level. A recent line of work, which addresses context sensitivity of rules, represented contexts in a latent topic space and computed similarity over topic vectors. We propose a novel two-level model, which computes similarities between word-level vectors that are biased by topic-level context representations. Evaluations on a naturallydistributed dataset show that our model significantly outperforms prior word-level and topic-level models. We also release a first context-sensitive inference rule set.</p><p>5 0.19927721 <a title="314-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>
<p>Author: Graham Neubig</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we describe Travatar, a forest-to-string machine translation (MT) engine based on tree transducers. It provides an open-source C++ implementation for the entire forest-to-string MT pipeline, including rule extraction, tuning, decoding, and evaluation. There are a number of options for model training, and tuning includes advanced options such as hypergraph MERT, and training of sparse features through online learning. The training pipeline is modeled after that of the popular Moses decoder, so users familiar with Moses should be able to get started quickly. We perform a validation experiment of the decoder on EnglishJapanese machine translation, and find that it is possible to achieve greater accuracy than translation using phrase-based and hierarchical-phrase-based translation. As auxiliary results, we also compare different syntactic parsers and alignment techniques that we tested in the process of developing the decoder.

<p>Author: Jacob Andreas ; Andreas Vlachos ; Stephen Clark</p><p>Abstract: Semantic parsing is the problem of deriving a structured meaning representation from a natural language utterance. Here we approach it as a straightforward machine translation task, and demonstrate that standard machine translation components can be adapted into a semantic parser. In experiments on the multilingual GeoQuery corpus we find that our parser is competitive with the state of the art, and in some cases achieves higher accuracy than recently proposed purpose-built systems. These results support the use of machine translation methods as an informative baseline in semantic parsing evaluations, and suggest that research in semantic parsing could benefit from advances in machine translation.</p><p>4 0.70058364 <a title="314-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Travatar%3A_A_Forest-to-String_Machine_Translation_Engine_based_on_Tree_Transducers.html">361 acl-2013-Travatar: A Forest-to-String Machine Translation Engine based on Tree Transducers</a></p>

The system exploits a very simple but relevant discursive property, the argument coherence over different instances of a predicate. The algorithm solves the implicit arguments sequentially, exploiting not only explicit but also the implicit arguments previously solved. In addition, we empirically demonstrate that the algorithm obtains very competitive and robust performances with respect to supervised approaches that require large amounts of costly training data.</p><p>6 0.66760772 <a title="314-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Handling_Ambiguities_of_Bilingual_Predicate-Argument_Structures_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">180 acl-2013-Handling Ambiguities of Bilingual Predicate-Argument Structures for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-formalism transfer in parsing. We are interested in parsing constituencybased grammars such as HPSG and CCG using a small amount of data specific for the target formalism, and a large quantity of coarse CFG annotations from the Penn Treebank. While all of the target formalisms share a similar basic syntactic structure with Penn Treebank CFG, they also encode additional constraints and semantic features. To handle this apparent discrepancy, we design a probabilistic model that jointly generates CFG and target formalism parses. The model includes features of both parses, allowing trans- fer between the formalisms, while preserving parsing efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three constituency-based grammars CCG, HPSG, and LFG, augmented with the Penn Treebank-1. Our experiments show that across all three formalisms, the target parsers significantly benefit from the coarse annotations.1 —</p><p>same-paper 2 0.80046058 <a title="314-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Semantic_Roles_for_String_to_Tree_Machine_Translation.html">314 acl-2013-Semantic Roles for String to Tree Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Melania Duma ; Cristina Vertan ; Wolfgang Menzel</p><p>Abstract: Machine translation (MT) evaluation aims at measuring the quality of a candidate translation by comparing it with a reference translation. This comparison can be performed on multiple levels: lexical, syntactic or semantic. In this paper, we propose a new syntactic metric for MT evaluation based on the comparison of the dependency structures of the reference and the candidate translations. The dependency structures are obtained by means of a Weighted Constraints Dependency Grammar parser. Based on experiments performed on English to German translations, we show that the new metric correlates well with human judgments at the system level. 1</p><p>4 0.75069124 <a title="314-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-A_corpus-based_evaluation_method_for_Distributional_Semantic_Models.html">31 acl-2013-A corpus-based evaluation method for Distributional Semantic Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Abdellah Fourtassi ; Emmanuel Dupoux</p><p>Abstract: Evaluation methods for Distributional Semantic Models typically rely on behaviorally derived gold standards. These methods are difficult to deploy in languages with scarce linguistic/behavioral resources. We introduce a corpus-based measure that evaluates the stability of the lexical semantic similarity space using a pseudo-synonym same-different detection task and no external resources. We show that it enables to predict two behaviorbased measures across a range of parameters in a Latent Semantic Analysis model.</p><p>5 0.7314018 <a title="314-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Enlisting_the_Ghost%3A_Modeling_Empty_Categories_for_Machine_Translation.html">137 acl-2013-Enlisting the Ghost: Modeling Empty Categories for Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Bing Xiang ; Xiaoqiang Luo ; Bowen Zhou</p><p>Abstract: Empty categories (EC) are artificial elements in Penn Treebanks motivated by the government-binding (GB) theory to explain certain language phenomena such as pro-drop. ECs are ubiquitous in languages like Chinese, but they are tacitly ignored in most machine translation (MT) work because of their elusive nature. In this paper we present a comprehensive treatment of ECs by first recovering them with a structured MaxEnt model with a rich set of syntactic and lexical features, and then incorporating the predicted ECs into a Chinese-to-English machine translation task through multiple approaches, including the extraction of EC-specific sparse features. We show that the recovered empty categories not only improve the word alignment quality, but also lead to significant improvements in a large-scale state-of-the-art syntactic MT system.</p><p>6 0.61415732 <a title="314-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-A_Context_Free_TAG_Variant.html">4 acl-2013-A Context Free TAG Variant</a></p>

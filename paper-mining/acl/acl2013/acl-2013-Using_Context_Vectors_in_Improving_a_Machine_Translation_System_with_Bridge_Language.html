<p>Author: Ahmed El Kholy ; Nizar Habash ; Gregor Leusch ; Evgeny Matusov ; Hassan Sawaf</p><p>Abstract: An important challenge to statistical machine translation (SMT) is the lack of parallel data for many language pairs. One common solution is to pivot through a third language for which there exist parallel corpora with the source and target languages. Although pivoting is a robust technique, it introduces some low quality translations. In this paper, we present two language-independent features to improve the quality of phrase-pivot based SMT. The features, source connectivity strength and target connectivity strength reflect the quality of projected alignments between the source and target phrases in the pivot phrase table. We show positive results (0.6 BLEU points) on Persian-Arabic SMT as a case study.</p><p>3 0.32519484 <a title="374-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-ParaQuery%3A_Making_Sense_of_Paraphrase_Collections.html">271 acl-2013-ParaQuery: Making Sense of Paraphrase Collections</a></p>
<p>Author: Lili Kotlerman ; Nitin Madnani ; Aoife Cahill</p><p>Abstract: Pivoting on bilingual parallel corpora is a popular approach for paraphrase acquisition. Although such pivoted paraphrase collections have been successfully used to improve the performance of several different NLP applications, it is still difficult to get an intrinsic estimate of the quality and coverage of the paraphrases contained in these collections. We present ParaQuery, a tool that helps a user interactively explore and characterize a given pivoted paraphrase collection, analyze its utility for a particular domain, and compare it to other popular lexical similarity resources all within a single interface.</p><p>4 0.27533463 <a title="374-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Learning_a_Phrase-based_Translation_Model_from_Monolingual_Data_with_Application_to_Domain_Adaptation.html">223 acl-2013-Learning a Phrase-based Translation Model from Monolingual Data with Application to Domain Adaptation</a></p>
<p>Author: Jiajun Zhang ; Chengqing Zong</p><p>Abstract: Currently, almost all of the statistical machine translation (SMT) models are trained with the parallel corpora in some specific domains. However, when it comes to a language pair or a different domain without any bilingual resources, the traditional SMT loses its power. Recently, some research works study the unsupervised SMT for inducing a simple word-based translation model from the monolingual corpora. It successfully bypasses the constraint of bitext for SMT and obtains a relatively promising result. In this paper, we take a step forward and propose a simple but effective method to induce a phrase-based model from the monolingual corpora given an automatically-induced translation lexicon or a manually-edited translation dictionary. We apply our method for the domain adaptation task and the extensive experiments show that our proposed method can substantially improve the translation quality. 1</p><p>5 0.27118358 <a title="374-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Prune%3A_Context-Sensitive_Pruning_for_Syntactic_MT.html">226 acl-2013-Learning to Prune: Context-Sensitive Pruning for Syntactic MT</a></p>
<p>Author: Wenduan Xu ; Yue Zhang ; Philip Williams ; Philipp Koehn</p><p>Abstract: We present a context-sensitive chart pruning method for CKY-style MT decoding. Source phrases that are unlikely to have aligned target constituents are identified using sequence labellers learned from the parallel corpus, and speed-up is obtained by pruning corresponding chart cells. The proposed method is easy to implement, orthogonal to cube pruning and additive to its pruning power. On a full-scale Englishto-German experiment with a string-totree model, we obtain a speed-up of more than 60% over a strong baseline, with no loss in BLEU.</p><p>6 0.1839963 <a title="374-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Hierarchical_Phrase_Table_Combination_for_Machine_Translation.html">181 acl-2013-Hierarchical Phrase Table Combination for Machine Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Conghui Zhu ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Typical statistical machine translation systems are batch trained with a given training data and their performances are largely influenced by the amount of data. With the growth of the available data across different domains, it is computationally demanding to perform batch training every time when new data comes. In face of the problem, we propose an efficient phrase table combination method. In particular, we train a Bayesian phrasal inversion transduction grammars for each domain separately. The learned phrase tables are hierarchically combined as if they are drawn from a hierarchical Pitman-Yor process. The performance measured by BLEU is at least as comparable to the traditional batch training method. Furthermore, each phrase table is trained separately in each domain, and while computational overhead is significantly reduced by training them in parallel.</p><p>6 0.5576027 <a title="374-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Integrating_Translation_Memory_into_Phrase-Based_Machine_Translation_during_Decoding.html">201 acl-2013-Integrating Translation Memory into Phrase-Based Machine Translation during Decoding</a></p>

<p>Author: Sudha Bhingardive ; Samiulla Shaikh ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya</p><p>Abstract: Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) is one of the toughest problems in NLP, and in WSD, verb disambiguation has proved to be extremely difficult, because of high degree of polysemy, too fine grained senses, absence of deep verb hierarchy and low inter annotator agreement in verb sense annotation. Unsupervised WSD has received widespread attention, but has performed poorly, specially on verbs. Recently an unsupervised bilingual EM based algorithm has been proposed, which makes use only of the raw counts of the translations in comparable corpora (Marathi and Hindi). But the performance of this approach is poor on verbs with accuracy level at 25-38%. We suggest a modifica- tion to this mentioned formulation, using context and semantic relatedness of neighboring words. An improvement of 17% 35% in the accuracy of verb WSD is obtained compared to the existing EM based approach. On a general note, the work can be looked upon as contributing to the framework of unsupervised WSD through context aware expectation maximization.</p><p>3 0.7549988 <a title="374-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-The_Haves_and_the_Have-Nots%3A_Leveraging_Unlabelled_Corpora_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">345 acl-2013-The Haves and the Have-Nots: Leveraging Unlabelled Corpora for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>
<p>Author: Kashyap Popat ; Balamurali A.R ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Gholamreza Haffari</p><p>Abstract: Expensive feature engineering based on WordNet senses has been shown to be useful for document level sentiment classification. A plausible reason for such a performance improvement is the reduction in data sparsity. However, such a reduction could be achieved with a lesser effort through the means of syntagma based word clustering. In this paper, the problem of data sparsity in sentiment analysis, both monolingual and cross-lingual, is addressed through the means of clustering. Experiments show that cluster based data sparsity reduction leads to performance better than sense based classification for sentiment analysis at document level. Similar idea is applied to Cross Lingual Sentiment Analysis (CLSA), and it is shown that reduction in data sparsity (after translation or bilingual-mapping) produces accuracy higher than Machine Translation based CLSA and sense based CLSA.</p><p>4 0.75040251 <a title="374-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Bridging_Languages_through_Etymology%3A_The_case_of_cross_language_text_categorization.html">72 acl-2013-Bridging Languages through Etymology: The case of cross language text categorization</a></p>
<p>Author: Vivi Nastase ; Carlo Strapparava</p><p>Abstract: We propose the hypothesis that word etymology is useful for NLP applications as a bridge between languages. We support this hypothesis with experiments in crosslanguage (English-Italian) document categorization. In a straightforward bag-ofwords experimental set-up we add etymological ancestors of the words in the documents, and investigate the performance of a model built on English data, on Italian test data (and viceversa). The results show not only statistically significant, but a large improvement a jump of almost 40 points in F1-score over the raw (vanilla bag-ofwords) representation.</p><p>5 0.75024915 <a title="374-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Learning_to_Extract_International_Relations_from_Political_Context.html">224 acl-2013-Learning to Extract International Relations from Political Context</a></p>
<p>Author: Brendan O'Connor ; Brandon M. Stewart ; Noah A. Smith</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new probabilistic model for extracting events between major political actors from news corpora. Our unsupervised model brings together familiar components in natural language processing (like parsers and topic models) with contextual political information— temporal and dyad dependence—to infer latent event classes. We quantitatively evaluate the model’s performance on political science benchmarks: recovering expert-assigned event class valences, and detecting real-world conflict. We also conduct a small case study based on our model’s inferences.

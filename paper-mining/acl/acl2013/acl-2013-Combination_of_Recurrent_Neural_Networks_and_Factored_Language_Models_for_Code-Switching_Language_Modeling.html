<p>Author: lemao liu ; Taro Watanabe ; Eiichiro Sumita ; Tiejun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: Most statistical machine translation (SMT) systems are modeled using a loglinear framework. Although the log-linear model achieves success in SMT, it still suffers from some limitations: (1) the features are required to be linear with respect to the model itself; (2) features cannot be further interpreted to reach their potential. A neural network is a reasonable method to address these pitfalls. However, modeling SMT with a neural network is not trivial, especially when taking the decoding efficiency into consideration. In this paper, we propose a variant of a neural network, i.e. additive neural networks, for SMT to go beyond the log-linear translation model. In addition, word embedding is employed as the input to the neural network, which encodes each word as a feature vector. Our model outperforms the log-linear translation models with/without embedding features on Chinese-to-English and Japanese-to-English translation tasks.</p><p>3 0.18319786 <a title="84-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Adaptation_Data_Selection_using_Neural_Language_Models%3A_Experiments_in_Machine_Translation.html">35 acl-2013-Adaptation Data Selection using Neural Language Models: Experiments in Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Kevin Duh ; Graham Neubig ; Katsuhito Sudoh ; Hajime Tsukada</p><p>Abstract: Data selection is an effective approach to domain adaptation in statistical machine translation. The idea is to use language models trained on small in-domain text to select similar sentences from large general-domain corpora, which are then incorporated into the training data. Substantial gains have been demonstrated in previous works, which employ standard ngram language models. Here, we explore the use of neural language models for data selection. We hypothesize that the continuous vector representation of words in neural language models makes them more effective than n-grams for modeling un- known word contexts, which are prevalent in general-domain text. In a comprehensive evaluation of 4 language pairs (English to German, French, Russian, Spanish), we found that neural language models are indeed viable tools for data selection: while the improvements are varied (i.e. 0.1 to 1.7 gains in BLEU), they are fast to train on small in-domain data and can sometimes substantially outperform conventional n-grams.</p><p>4 0.16710125 <a title="84-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Smoothed_marginal_distribution_constraints_for_language_modeling.html">325 acl-2013-Smoothed marginal distribution constraints for language modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Cyril Allauzen ; Michael Riley</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for re-estimating parameters of backoff n-gram language models so as to preserve given marginal distributions, along the lines of wellknown Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing. Unlike Kneser-Ney, our approach is designed to be applied to any given smoothed backoff model, including models that have already been heavily pruned. As a result, the algorithm avoids issues observed when pruning Kneser-Ney models (Siivola et al., 2007; Chelba et al., 2010), while retaining the benefits of such marginal distribution constraints. We present experimental results for heavily pruned backoff ngram models, and demonstrate perplexity and word error rate reductions when used with various baseline smoothing methods. An open-source version of the algorithm has been released as part of the OpenGrm ngram library.1</p><p>5 0.16244259 <a title="84-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Word_Alignment_Modeling_with_Context_Dependent_Deep_Neural_Network.html">388 acl-2013-Word Alignment Modeling with Context Dependent Deep Neural Network</a></p>

We describe in detail how we adapt and extend the CD-DNNHMM (Dahl et al., 2012) method introduced in speech recognition to the HMMbased word alignment model, in which bilingual word embedding is discriminatively learnt to capture lexical translation information, and surrounding words are leveraged to model context information in bilingual sentences. While being capable to model the rich bilingual correspondence, our method generates a very compact model with much fewer parameters. Experiments on a large scale EnglishChinese word alignment task show that the proposed method outperforms the HMM and IBM model 4 baselines by 2 points in F-score.</p><p>6 0.13226949 <a title="84-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Improving_Text_Simplification_Language_Modeling_Using_Unsimplified_Text_Data.html">194 acl-2013-Improving Text Simplification Language Modeling Using Unsimplified Text Data</a></p>

Research Institute for ?????????? ???????????? ?????? Dr?????????? Romanian Academy tufi s @ racai . ro Networks (Marques and Lopes, 1996) and Conditional Random Fields (CRF) (Lafferty et Standard methods for part-of-speech tagging suffer from data sparseness when used on highly inflectional languages (which require large lexical tagset inventories). For this reason, a number of alternative methods have been proposed over the years. One of the most successful methods used for this task, ?????? ?????? ??????? ??????, 1999), exploits a reduced set of tags derived by removing several recoverable features from the lexicon morpho-syntactic descriptions. A second phase is aimed at recovering the full set of morpho-syntactic features. In this paper we present an alternative method to Tiered Tagging, based on local optimizations with Neural Networks and we show how, by properly encoding the input sequence in a general Neural Network architecture, we achieve results similar to the Tiered Tagging methodology, significantly faster and without requiring extensive linguistic knowledge as implied by the previously mentioned method. 1</p><p>4 0.70435077 <a title="84-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Scalable_Modified_Kneser-Ney_Language_Model_Estimation.html">308 acl-2013-Scalable Modified Kneser-Ney Language Model Estimation</a></p>

However, existing uncertainty cues are ineffective in social media context because of its specific characteristics. In this paper, we propose a variant of annotation scheme for uncertainty identification and construct the first uncertainty corpus based on tweets.

<p>Author: Heike Adel ; Ngoc Thang Vu ; Tanja Schultz</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM) and factored language models (FLM) to the task of language modeling for Code-Switching speech. We present a way to integrate partof-speech tags (POS) and language information (LID) into these models which leads to significant improvements in terms of perplexity. Furthermore, a comparison between RNNLMs and FLMs and a detailed analysis of perplexities on the different backoff levels are performed. Finally, we show that recurrent neural networks and factored language models can . be combined using linear interpolation to achieve the best performance. The final combined language model provides 37.8% relative improvement in terms of perplexity on the SEAME development set and a relative improvement of 32.7% on the evaluation set compared to the traditional n-gram language model. Index Terms: multilingual speech processing, code switching, language modeling, recurrent neural networks, factored language models</p><p>4 0.69649553 <a title="84-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Grounded_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">176 acl-2013-Grounded Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Hoifung Poon</p><p>Abstract: We present the first unsupervised approach for semantic parsing that rivals the accuracy of supervised approaches in translating natural-language questions to database queries. Our GUSP system produces a semantic parse by annotating the dependency-tree nodes and edges with latent states, and learns a probabilistic grammar using EM. To compensate for the lack of example annotations or question-answer pairs, GUSP adopts a novel grounded-learning approach to leverage database for indirect supervision. On the challenging ATIS dataset, GUSP attained an accuracy of 84%, effectively tying with the best published results by supervised approaches.</p><p>5 0.63697726 <a title="84-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Probabilistic_Sense_Sentiment_Similarity_through_Hidden_Emotions.html">284 acl-2013-Probabilistic Sense Sentiment Similarity through Hidden Emotions</a></p>
<p>Author: Mitra Mohtarami ; Man Lan ; Chew Lim Tan</p><p>Abstract: Sentiment Similarity of word pairs reflects the distance between the words regarding their underlying sentiments. This paper aims to infer the sentiment similarity between word pairs with respect to their senses. To achieve this aim, we propose a probabilistic emotionbased approach that is built on a hidden emotional model. The model aims to predict a vector of basic human emotions for each sense of the words. The resultant emotional vectors are then employed to infer the sentiment similarity of word pairs. We apply the proposed approach to address two main NLP tasks, namely, Indirect yes/no Question Answer Pairs inference and Sentiment Orientation prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</p><p>6 0.62982905 <a title="84-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Chinese_Parsing_Exploiting_Characters.html">80 acl-2013-Chinese Parsing Exploiting Characters</a></p>

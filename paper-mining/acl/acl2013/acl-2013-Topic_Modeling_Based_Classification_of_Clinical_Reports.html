<p>Author: Maria Skeppstedt</p><p>Abstract: For expanding a corpus of clinical text, annotated for named entities, a method that combines pre-tagging with a version of active learning is proposed. In order to facilitate annotation and to avoid bias, two alternative automatic pre-taggings are presented to the annotator, without revealing which of them is given a higher confidence by the pre-tagging system. The task of the annotator is to select the correct version among these two alternatives. To minimise the instances in which none of the presented pre-taggings is correct, the texts presented to the annotator are actively selected from a pool of unlabelled text, with the selection criterion that one of the presented pre-taggings should have a high probability of being correct, while still being useful for improving the result of an automatic classifier.</p><p>3 0.17736404 <a title="351-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Are_Semantically_Coherent_Topic_Models_Useful_for_Ad_Hoc_Information_Retrieval%3F.html">55 acl-2013-Are Semantically Coherent Topic Models Useful for Ad Hoc Information Retrieval?</a></p>

<p>Author: Xiaoming Lu ; Lei Xie ; Cheung-Chi Leung ; Bin Ma ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: We present an efficient approach for broadcast news story segmentation using a manifold learning algorithm on latent topic distributions. The latent topic distribution estimated by Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to represent each text block. We employ Laplacian Eigenmaps (LE) to project the latent topic distributions into low-dimensional semantic representations while preserving the intrinsic local geometric structure. We evaluate two approaches employing LDA and probabilistic latent semantic analysis (PLSA) distributions respectively. The effects of different amounts of training data and different numbers of latent topics on the two approaches are studied. Experimental re- sults show that our proposed LDA-based approach can outperform the corresponding PLSA-based approach. The proposed approach provides the best performance with the highest F1-measure of 0.7860.</p><p>6 0.11669245 <a title="351-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Incremental_Topic-Based_Translation_Model_Adaptation_for_Conversational_Spoken_Language_Translation.html">197 acl-2013-Incremental Topic-Based Translation Model Adaptation for Conversational Spoken Language Translation</a></p>

<p>Author: Dana Movshovitz-Attias ; William W. Cohen</p><p>Abstract: Statistical language models have successfully been used to describe and analyze natural language documents. Recent work applying language models to programming languages is focused on the task of predicting code, while mainly ignoring the prediction of programmer comments. In this work, we predict comments from JAVA source files of open source projects, using topic models and n-grams, and we analyze the performance of the models given varying amounts of background data on the project being predicted. We evaluate models on their comment-completion capability in a setting similar to codecompletion tools built into standard code editors, and show that using a comment completion tool can save up to 47% of the comment typing. 1 Introduction and Related Work Statistical language models have traditionally been used to describe and analyze natural language documents. Recently, software engineering researchers have adopted the use of language models for modeling software code. Hindle et al. (2012) observe that, as code is created by humans it is likely to be repetitive and predictable, similar to natural language. NLP models have thus been used for a variety of software development tasks such as code token completion (Han et al., 2009; Jacob and Tairas, 2010), analysis of names in code (Lawrie et al., 2006; Binkley et al., 2011) and mining software repositories (Gabel and Su, 2008). An important part of software programming and maintenance lies in documentation, which may come in the form of tutorials describing the code, or inline comments provided by the programmer. The documentation provides a high level description of the task performed by the code, and may William W. Cohen Computer Science Department Carnegie Mellon University wcohen @ c s .cmu .edu include examples of use-cases for specific code segments or identifiers such as classes, methods and variables. Well documented code is easier to read and maintain in the long-run but writing comments is a laborious task that is often overlooked or at least postponed by many programmers. Code commenting not only provides a summarization of the conceptual idea behind the code (Sridhara et al., 2010), but can also be viewed as a form of document expansion where the comment contains significant terms relevant to the described code. Accurately predicted comment words can therefore be used for a variety of linguistic uses including improved search over code bases using natural language queries, code categorization, and locating parts of the code that are relevant to a specific topic or idea (Tseng and Juang, 2003; Wan et al., 2007; Kumar and Carterette, 2013; Shepherd et al., 2007; Rastkar et al., 2011). A related and well studied NLP task is that of predicting natural language caption and commentary for images and videos (Blei and Jordan, 2003; Feng and Lapata, 2010; Feng and Lapata, 2013; Wu and Li, 2011). In this work, our goal is to apply statistical language models for predicting class comments. We show that n-gram models are extremely successful in this task, and can lead to a saving of up to 47% in comment typing. This is expected as n-grams have been shown as a strong model for language and speech prediction that is hard to improve upon (Rosenfeld, 2000). In some cases however, for example in a document expansion task, we wish to extract important terms relevant to the code regardless of local syntactic dependencies. We hence also evaluate the use of LDA (Blei et al., 2003) and link-LDA (Erosheva et al., 2004) topic models, which are more relevant for the term ex- traction scenario. We find that the topic model performance can be improved by distinguishing code and text tokens in the code. 35 Proce dinSgosfi oa,f tB huel 5g1arsita, An Anu gauls Mt 4e-e9ti n2g01 o3f. th ?c e2 A0s1s3oc Aiastsio cnia fotiron C fo mrp Cuotmatpiounta tlio Lninaglu Li sntgicusi,s ptaicgses 35–40, 2 Method 2.1 Models We train n-gram models (n = 1, 2, 3) over source code documents containing sequences of combined code and text tokens from multiple training datasets (described below). We use the Berkeley Language Model package (Pauls and Klein, 2011) with absolute discounting (Kneser-Ney smoothing; (1995)) which includes a backoff strategy to lower-order n-grams. Next, we use LDA topic models (Blei et al., 2003) trained on the same data, with 1, 5, 10 and 20 topics. The joint distribution of a topic mixture θ, and a set of N topics z, for a single source code document with N observed word tokens, d = {wi}iN=1, given the Dirichlet parameters α sa,n dd β, {isw th}erefore p(θ, z, w|α, β) = p(θ|α) Yp(z|θ)p(w|z, (1) β) Yw Under the models described so far, there is no distinction between text and code tokens. Finally, we consider documents as having a mixed membership of two entity types, code and text tokens, d = where tthexet text ws,o drd =s are tok}ens f,r{owm comment and string literals, and the code words include the programming language syntax tokens (e.g., publ ic, private, for, etc’ ) and all identifiers. In this case, we train link-LDA models (Erosheva et al., 2004) with 1, 5, 10 and 20 topics. Under the linkLDA model, the mixed-membership joint distribution of a topic mixture, words and topics is then ({wciode}iC=n1, {witext}iT=n1), p(θ, z, w|α, β) = p(θ|α) Y wYtext · p(ztext|θ)p(wtext|ztext,β)· (2) Y p(zcode|θ)p(wcode|zcode,β) wYcode where θ is the joint topic distribution, w is the set of observed document words, ztext is a topic associated with a text word, and zcode a topic associated with a code word. The LDA and link-LDA models use Gibbs sampling (Griffiths and Steyvers, 2004) for topic inference, based on the implementation of Balasubramanyan and Cohen (201 1) with single or multiple entities per document, respectively. 2.2 Testing Methodology Our goal is to predict the tokens of the JAVA class comment (the one preceding the class definition) in each of the test files. Each of the models described above assigns a probability to the next comment token. In the case of n-grams, the probability of a token word wi is given by considering previous words p(wi |wi−1 , . . . , w0). This probability is estimated given the previous n 1tokens as p(wi|wi−1, wi−(n−1)). For t|hwe topic models, we separate the docu- ..., − ment tokens into the class definition and the comment we wish to predict. The set of tokens of the class comment are all considered as text tokens. The rest of the tokens in the document are considered to be the class definition, and they may contain both code and text tokens (from string literals and other comments in the source file). We then compute the posterior probability of document topics by solving the following inference problem conditioned on the tokens wc, wr, wr p(θ,zr|wr,α,β) =p(θp,(zwr,rw|αr,|αβ),β) (3) This gives us an estimate of the document distribution, θ, with which we infer the probability of the comment tokens as p(wc|θ,β) = Xp(wc|z,β)p(z|θ) (4) Xz Following Blei et al. (2003), for the case of a single entity LDA, the inference problem from equation (3) can be solved by considering p(θ, z, w|α, β), as in equation (1), and by taking tph(eθ marginal )di,s atrsib iunti eoqnu aotfio othne ( 1d)o,c aunmde bnyt t toakkeinngs as a continuous mixture distribution for the set w = by integrating over θ and summing over the set of topics z wr, p(w|α,β) =Zp(θ|α)· (5) YwXzp(z|θ)p(w|z,β)!dθ For the case of link-LDA where the document is comprised of two entities, in our case code tokens and text tokens, we can consider the mixedmembership joint distribution θ, as in equation (2), and similarly the marginal distribution p(w|α, β) over bimoithla rclyod teh ean mda tregxint tlok deisntsri bfruotmion w pr(.w |Sαi,nβce) comment words in are all considered as text tokens they are sampled using text topics, namely ztext, in equation (4). wc 36 3 Experimental Settings 3.1 Data and Training Methodology We use source code from nine open source JAVA projects: Ant, Cassandra, Log4j, Maven, MinorThird, Batik, Lucene, Xalan and Xerces. For each project, we divide the source files into a training and testing dataset. Then, for each project in turn, we consider the following three main training scenarios, leading to using three training datasets. To emulate a scenario in which we are predicting comments in the middle of project development, we can use data (documented code) from the same project. In this case, we use the in-project training dataset (IN). Alternatively, if we train a comment prediction model at the beginning of the development, we need to use source files from other, possibly related projects. To analyze this scenario, for each of the projects above we train models using an out-of-project dataset (OUT) containing data from the other eight projects. Typically, source code files contain a greater amount ofcode versus comment text. Since we are interested in predicting comments, we consider a third training data source which contains more English text as well as some code segments. We use data from the popular Q&A; website StackOverflow (SO) where users ask and answer technical questions about software development, tools, algorithms, etc’ . We downloaded a dataset of all actions performed on the site since it was launched in August 2008 until August 2012. The data includes 3,453,742 questions and 6,858,133 answers posted by 1,295,620 users. We used only posts that are tagged as JAVA related questions and answers. All the models for each project are then tested on the testing set of that project. We report results averaged over all projects in Table 1. Source files were tokenized using the Eclipse JDT compiler tools, separating code tokens and identifiers. Identifier names (of classes, methods and variables), were further tokenized by camel case notation (e.g., ’minMargin’ was converted to ’min margin’). Non alpha-numeric tokens (e.g., dot, semicolon) were discarded from the code, as well as numeric and single character literals. Text from comments or any string literals within the code were further tokenized with the Mallet statistical natural language processing package (Mc- Callum, 2002). Posts from SO were parsed using the Apache Tika toolkit1 and then tokenized with the Mallet package. We considered as raw code tokens anything labeled using a   markup (as indicated by the SO users who wrote the post). 3.2 Evaluation Since our models are trained using various data sources the vocabularies used by each of them are different, making the comment likelihood given by each model incomparable due to different sets of out-of-vocabulary tokens. We thus evaluate models using a character saving metric which aims at quantifying the percentage of characters that can be saved by using the model in a word-completion settings, similar to standard code completion tools built into code editors. For a comment word with n characters, w = w1, . . . , wn, we predict the two most likely words given each model filtered by the first 0, . . . , n characters ofw. Let k be the minimal ki for which w is in the top two predicted word tokens where tokens are filtered by the first ki characters. Then, the number of saved characters for w is n k. In Table 1we report the average percentage o−f ksa.v Iend T Tcahbalera 1cte wrse per ocrotm thmee avnet using eearcchen not-f the above models. The final results are also averaged over the nine input projects. As an example, in the predicted comment shown in Table 2, taken from the project Minor-Third, the token entity is the most likely token according to the model SO trigram, out of tokens starting with the prefix ’en’ . The saved characters in this case are ’tity’ . − 4 Results Table 1 displays the average percentage of characters saved per class comment using each of the models. Models trained on in-project data (IN) perform significantly better than those trained on another data source, regardless of the model type, with an average saving of 47. 1% characters using a trigram model. This is expected, as files from the same project are likely to contain similar comments, and identifier names that appear in the comment of one class may appear in the code of another class in the same project. Clearly, in-project data should be used when available as it improves comment prediction leading to an average increase of between 6% for the worst model (26.6 for OUT unigram versus 33.05 for IN) and 14% for the best (32.96 for OUT trigram versus 47. 1for IN). 1http://tika.apache.org/ 37 Model n / topics n-gram LDA Link-LDA 1 2 3 20 10 5 1 20 10 5 1 IN 33.05 (3.62) 43.27 (5.79) 47.1 (6.87) 34.20 (3.63) 33.93 (3.67) 33.63 (3.67) 33.05 (3.62) 35.76 (3.95) 35.81 (4.12) 35.37 (3.98) 34.59 (3.92) OUT 26.6 (3.37) 31.52 (4.17) 32.96 (4.33) 26.79 (3.26) 26.8 (3.36) 26.86 (3.44) 26.6 (3.37) 28.03 (3.60) 28 (3.56) 28 (3.67) 27.82 (3.62) SO 27.8 (3.51) 33.29 (4.40) 34.56 (4.78) 27.25 (3.67) 27.22 (3.44) 27.34 (3.55) 27.8 (3.51) 28.08 (3.48) 28.12 (3.58) 27.94 (3.56) 27.9 (3.45) Table 1: Average percentage of characters saved per comment using n-gram, LDA and link-LDA models trained on three training sets: IN, OUT, and SO.

Saved characters are underlined. Of the out-of-project data sources, models using a greater amount of text (SO) mostly outperformed models based on more code (OUT). This increase in performance, however, comes at a cost of greater run-time due to the larger word dictionary associated with the SO data. Note that in the scope of this work we did not investigate the contribution of each of the background projects used in OUT, and how their relevance to the target prediction project effects their performance. The trigram model shows the best performance across all training data sources (47% for IN, 32% for OUT and 34% for SO). Amongst the tested topic models, link-LDA models which distinguish code and text tokens perform consistently better than simple LDA models in which all tokens are considered as text. We did not however find a correlation between the number of latent topics learned by a topic model and its performance. In fact, for each of the data sources, a different num- ber of topics gave the optimal character saving results. Note that in this work, all topic models are based on unigram tokens, therefore their results are most comparable with that of the unigram in Dataset n-gram link-LDA IN 2778.35 574.34 OUT 1865.67 670.34 SO 1898.43 638.55 Table 3: Average words per project for which each tested model completes the word better than the other. This indicates that each of the models is better at predicting a different set of comment words. Table 1, which does not benefit from the backoff strategy used by the bigram and trigram models. By this comparison, the link-LDA topic model proves more successful in the comment prediction task than the simpler models which do not distin- guish code and text tokens. Using n-grams without backoff leads to results significantly worse than any of the presented models (not shown). Table 2 shows a sample comment segment for which words were predicted using trigram models from all training sources and an in-project linkLDA. The comment is taken from the TrainExtractor class in the Minor-Third project, a machine learning library for annotating and categorizing text. Both IN models show a clear advantage in completing the project-specific word Train, compared to models based on out-of-project data (OUT and SO). Interestingly, in this example the trigram is better at completing the term namedentity given the prefix named. However, the topic model is better at completing the word extractor which refers to the target class. This example indicates that each model type may be more successful in predicting different comment words, and that combining multiple models may be advantageous. 38 This can also be seen by the analysis in Table 3 where we compare the average number of words completed better by either the best n-gram or topic model given each training dataset. Again, while n-grams generally complete more words better, a considerable portion of the words is better completed using a topic model, further motivating a hybrid solution. 5 Conclusions We analyze the use of language models for predicting class comments for source file documents containing a mixture of code and text tokens. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of using language models for comment completion, showing a saving of up to 47% of the comment characters. When available, using in-project training data proves significantly more successful than using out-of-project data. However, we find that when using out-of-project data, a dataset based on more words than code performs consistently better. The results also show that different models are better at predicting different comment words, which motivates a hybrid solution combining the advantages of multiple models.

<p>Author: Johann-Mattis List ; Steven Moran</p><p>Abstract: Given the increasing interest and development of computational and quantitative methods in historical linguistics, it is important that scholars have a basis for documenting, testing, evaluating, and sharing complex workflows. We present a novel open-source toolkit for quantitative tasks in historical linguistics that offers these features. This toolkit also serves as an interface between existing software packages and frequently used data formats, and it provides implementations of new and existing algorithms within a homogeneous framework. We illustrate the toolkit’s functionality with an exemplary workflow that starts with raw language data and ends with automatically calculated phonetic alignments, cognates and borrowings. We then illustrate evaluation metrics on gold standard datasets that are provided with the toolkit.</p><p>2 0.8067261 <a title="351-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-A_Stacking-based_Approach_to_Twitter_User_Geolocation_Prediction.html">20 acl-2013-A Stacking-based Approach to Twitter User Geolocation Prediction</a></p>
<p>Author: Bo Han ; Paul Cook ; Timothy Baldwin</p><p>Abstract: We implement a city-level geolocation prediction system for Twitter users. The system infers a user’s location based on both tweet text and user-declared metadata using a stacking approach. We demonstrate that the stacking method substantially outperforms benchmark methods, achieving 49% accuracy on a benchmark dataset. We further evaluate our method on a recent crawl of Twitter data to investigate the impact of temporal factors on model generalisation. Our results suggest that user-declared location metadata is more sensitive to temporal change than the text of Twitter messages. We also describe two ways of accessing/demoing our system.</p><p>same-paper 3 0.78294444 <a title="351-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Topic_Modeling_Based_Classification_of_Clinical_Reports.html">351 acl-2013-Topic Modeling Based Classification of Clinical Reports</a></p>

Some of these data are in the form of free text and require preprocessing to be able to used in automated systems. Efficient and effective use of this data could be vital to the speed and quality of health care. As a case study, we analyzed classification of CT imaging reports into binary categories. In addition to regular text classification, we utilized topic modeling of the entire dataset in various ways. Topic modeling of the corpora provides interpretable themes that exist in these reports. Representing reports according to their topic distributions is more compact than bag-of-words representation and can be processed faster than raw text in subsequent automated processes. A binary topic model was also built as an unsupervised classification approach with the assumption that each topic corresponds to a class. And, finally an aggregate topic classifier was built where reports are classified based on a single discriminative topic that is determined from the training dataset. Our proposed topic based classifier system is shown to be competitive with existing text classification techniques and provides a more efficient and interpretable representation.</p><p>4 0.77809334 <a title="351-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Extracting_Definitions_and_Hypernym_Relations_relying_on_Syntactic_Dependencies_and_Support_Vector_Machines.html">152 acl-2013-Extracting Definitions and Hypernym Relations relying on Syntactic Dependencies and Support Vector Machines</a></p>
<p>Author: Guido Boella ; Luigi Di Caro</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we present a technique to reveal definitions and hypernym relations from text. Instead of using pattern matching methods that rely on lexico-syntactic patterns, we propose a technique which only uses syntactic dependencies between terms extracted with a syntactic parser. The assumption is that syntactic information are more robust than patterns when coping with length and complexity of the sentences. Afterwards, we transform such syntactic contexts in abstract representations, that are then fed into a Support Vector Machine classifier. The results on an annotated dataset of definitional sentences demonstrate the validity of our approach overtaking current state-of-the-art techniques.</p><p>5 0.72985214 <a title="351-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Java_Framework_for_Multilingual_Definition_and_Hypernym_Extraction.html">6 acl-2013-A Java Framework for Multilingual Definition and Hypernym Extraction</a></p>

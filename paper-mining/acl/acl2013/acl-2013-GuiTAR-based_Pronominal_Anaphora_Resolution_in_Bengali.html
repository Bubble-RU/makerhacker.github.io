</p><p>3 Performance of each configuration is evaluated and experiment shows that the off-the-shelf AR system can be effectively used for Indic languages. [sent-10, score-0.022]
</p><p>4 1  Introduction  Little computational linguistics research has been done for anaphora resolution (AR) in Indic languages. [sent-11, score-0.461]
</p><p>5 Progress of the research through these works was difficult to quantify as most of the authors used their selfgenerated datasets and in some cases algorithms lack in required details to make them reproducible. [sent-21, score-0.02]
</p><p>6 Bengali has been taken as the reference  Utpal Garain Indian Statistical Institute 203, B. [sent-26, score-0.017]
</p><p>7 language and GuiTAR (Poesio, 2004) has been considered as the reference off-the-shelf system. [sent-30, score-0.017]
</p><p>8 Therefore, the central contribution of this paper is to develop required resources for Bengali and thereby providing them to GuiTAR for anaphora resolution. [sent-32, score-0.303]
</p><p>9 Finally, GuiTAR anaphora resolution module is replaced by a previously developed approach (which is primarily rule-based, Senapati, 2011; Senapati, 2012a) and performances of different configurations are compared. [sent-34, score-0.577]
</p><p>10 2  Language specific issues in GuiTAR  GuiTAR has two major modules namely, preprocessing and anaphora resolution (Kabadjov, 2007). [sent-35, score-0.537]
</p><p>11 In both of these modules modifications are required to fit it to Bengali. [sent-36, score-0.104]
</p><p>12 Let's first identify the components in both of these two modules where replacement/modifications are needed. [sent-37, score-0.04]
</p><p>13 Pre-processing: The purpose of this module is to make GuiTAR independent from input format specifications and variations. [sent-38, score-0.107]
</p><p>14 In case of text input, XML file generated by the LT-XML tool. [sent-40, score-0.05]
</p><p>15 The XML file contains the information like word boundaries (tokens), grammatical classes (part-ofspeech), and chunking information. [sent-41, score-0.091]
</p><p>16 From the XML format MAS-XML (Minimum Anaphoric Syntax - XML) is produced to include minimal information namely, noun phrase boundaries, utterance boundaries, categories of pronoun, number information, gender information, etc. [sent-42, score-0.115]
</p><p>17 All these aspects are to be addressed for Bengali so that for a given input discourse in Bengali, MAS-XML file can be generated correctly. [sent-43, score-0.074]
</p><p>18 The pronouns (personal and possessive) are resolved by using 126  Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t. [sent-46, score-0.217]
</p><p>19 c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 126–130, an implementation of MARS (Mitkov, 2002), whereas different algorithms are used for resolving definite descriptions, and proper nouns. [sent-48, score-0.022]
</p><p>20 In Mitkov’s algorithm whenever a pronoun is to be resolved, it finds a list of potential antecedents within a given ‘window’ and checks three types of syntactic agreements (i. [sent-49, score-0.19]
</p><p>21 , person, number and gender) between an antecedent and the pronoun. [sent-51, score-0.142]
</p><p>22 We introduce suitable modifications in this module so that the same implementation of MARS can work for Bengali. [sent-55, score-0.134]
</p><p>23 Table-1 categorizes all pronouns (522 in number) available in Bengali as observed in a corpus (Bengali corpus, undated) of 35 million words. [sent-59, score-0.218]
</p><p>24 1 Number Acquisition for Nouns In Bengali, a set of nominal suffixes (Bhattacharya, 1993) (inflections and classifier) are used to recognize the number (singular/plural) of noun. [sent-61, score-0.031]
</p><p>25 To identify the number of a noun, we check whether any of the nominal suffixes (indicating plurality) are attached with the noun. [sent-62, score-0.031]
</p><p>26 If found, the number of the noun is tagged as plural. [sent-63, score-0.065]
</p><p>27 From the corpus, we identified 17 such suffixes (e. [sent-64, score-0.031]
</p><p>28 2 Honorificity of Nouns The honorific agreement exists in Bengali. [sent-70, score-0.096]
</p><p>29 Honorificity of a noun is indicated by a word or expression with connotations conveying esteem or respect when used in addressing or referring to a person. [sent-71, score-0.067]
</p><p>30 In Bengali three degree of honorificity are observed for the second person and two for the third person (Majumdar, 2000; Sengupta, 2000). [sent-72, score-0.319]
</p><p>31 The second and third person pronouns have distinct forms for different degrees of  honorificity. [sent-73, score-0.252]
</p><p>32 Honorificity information is applicable for proper nouns (person) and nouns indicating relations like father, mother, teacher, etc. [sent-74, score-0.064]
</p><p>33 The honorificity information is identified by maintaining a list of terms which can be considered as honorific addressing terms (e. [sent-75, score-0.321]
</p><p>34 About 20 such terms are there in the list and we get these terms from analysis of the Bengali corpus. [sent-83, score-0.017]
</p><p>35 When these terms are used to add honorificity of a noun they appear either before or after the noun. [sent-84, score-0.226]
</p><p>36 Another additional way for identifying the honorificity information is to look at the inflection of the main verb which is inflected with ন/n (i. [sent-85, score-0.192]
</p><p>37 Honorificity is extracted during the preprocessing phase and added with the attribute hon =  . [sent-89, score-0.036]
</p><p>38 lowest degree of honor) based on their degree of honorificity. [sent-96, score-0.05]
</p><p>39 For pronouns, this information is available from the pronoun list (honorific singular and honorific plural) as shown in Table-1. [sent-97, score-0.219]
</p><p>40 4  GuiTAR for Bengali  The following sections explain the modifications needed to configure GuiTAR for Bengali. [sent-98, score-0.044]
</p><p>41 The tagger is trained with about tagged 10,000 sentences and is found to produce about 92% accuracy while tested on 2,000 sentences. [sent-101, score-0.031]
</p><p>42 A rule based Bengali chunker (De, 2011) is used to get chunking information. [sent-102, score-0.049]
</p><p>43 NEIs and their classes (person, location, and organization) are tagged 127  manually (we did not get any Bengali NEI tool). [sent-103, score-0.031]
</p><p>44 After adding all these information, the input text is formatted into GuiTAR specified input XML file and is converted into MAS-XML. [sent-104, score-0.066]
</p><p>45 This file contains other syntactic information: person, types of pronouns, number and honorificity. [sent-105, score-0.05]
</p><p>46 Information on person and types of pronouns comes from Table-1 . [sent-106, score-0.252]
</p><p>47 Number and honorificity  are identified as explained before. [sent-107, score-0.192]
</p><p>48 Gender information has little role in Bengali anaphora resolution and hence is not considered. [sent-108, score-0.461]
</p><p>49 2  GuiTAR-based Pronoun Resolution for Bengali GuiTAR resolves pronouns using MARS approach (Mitkov, 2002) that makes use of several agreements (based on person, number and gender). [sent-111, score-0.262]
</p><p>50 Certain changes are required here as gender agreement has no role. [sent-112, score-0.062]
</p><p>51 This agreement has been replaced by the honorific agreement. [sent-113, score-0.128]
</p><p>52 Moreover, the way pronouns are divided in MARS implementation is not always relevant for Bengali pronouns. [sent-114, score-0.223]
</p><p>53 For example, we do not differentiate between personal and possessive pronouns but they are separately treated in MARS. [sent-115, score-0.287]
</p><p>54 In our case, we have only considered the personal and reflexive pronouns while applying MARS based implementation for anaphora resolution. [sent-116, score-0.593]
</p><p>55 In case of more than one antecedent found, GuiTAR resolves it by using five antecedent indicators namely, aggregate score, immediate reference, collocational pattern, indicating verbs  and referential distance. [sent-117, score-0.475]
</p><p>56 For Bengali, the indicating verb indicator has no role in filtering the antecedents and hence removed. [sent-118, score-0.07]
</p><p>57 5  Data and data format  To evaluate the configured GuiTAR system the dataset provided by ICON 2011(ICON 2011) has been used. [sent-119, score-0.095]
</p><p>58 They provided annotated data (POS tagged, chunked and name entity tagged) for three Indian languages including Bengali. [sent-120, score-0.016]
</p><p>59 We have changed this format into GuiTAR specified XML format and finally checked/corrected manually. [sent-125, score-0.078]
</p><p>60 Table 2: Description of ICON 2011 data format The ICON 2011 data contains nine texts from different domains (Tourism, Story, News article, Sports). [sent-129, score-0.039]
</p><p>61 Table 3 shows the distribution of pronouns in the whole test data set for Bengali. [sent-132, score-0.201]
</p><p>62 The dataset contains 1647 pronouns out of them 706 are personal pronouns (including reflexive pronouns). [sent-134, score-0.489]
</p><p>63 As the MARS in GuiTAR resolves only personal pronouns, we have used only these personal pronouns for evaluation. [sent-135, score-0.361]
</p><p>64 Three different systems are configured as described below:  System-1 (Baseline): A baseline system is configured by considering the most recent noun phrase as the referent of a pronoun (the first noun phrase in the backward direction is the antecedent of a pronoun). [sent-136, score-0.428]
</p><p>65 System-2 (GuiTAR with MARS): In this configuration, GuiTAR is used with the modifications (as described in Sec. [sent-137, score-0.044]
</p><p>66 1) in its preprocessing module and the modified MARS (as described in Sec. [sent-139, score-0.104]
</p><p>67 System-3 (GuiTAR with new a PAR module): Under this configuration, GuiTAR is used with the modifications (as described in Sec. [sent-142, score-0.044]
</p><p>68 1) in its pre-processing module but MARS is replaced by a previously developed system (Senapati, 2011; Senapati, 2012a) for pronominal anaphora resolution in Bengali. [sent-144, score-0.61]
</p><p>69 a possible antecedent) the method first maintains a list of possible pronouns which the antecedent could attach with (note that any noun phrase cannot be referred by any pronoun). [sent-148, score-0.394]
</p><p>70 On encountering a pronoun, the method searches for the antecedents for which the pronoun is in the respective pro-  noun-lists. [sent-149, score-0.15]
</p><p>71 The evaluation has used five metrics namely, MUC, B3, CEAFM, CEAFE and BLANC. [sent-152, score-0.016]
</p><p>72 Results show that GuiTAR with MARS gives better result than the situation where the most recent antecedent is picked (i. [sent-154, score-0.142]
</p><p>73 When MARS is replaced by system-3, further improvement is achieved which is also statistically significant (p<0. [sent-159, score-0.032]
</p><p>74 1 Error analysis Analysis of errors shows that errors in number acquisition and identification of the honorificity are two major errors during preprocessing phase. [sent-162, score-0.3]
</p><p>75 These errors propagate and result in further errors during resolution. [sent-163, score-0.036]
</p><p>76 For example, some Bengali personal pronouns are ambiguous (sometimes they are anaphoric whereas in other  cases they may appear as non-anaphoric too). [sent-165, score-0.303]
</p><p>77 স/se are two examples of such pronouns in Bengali (Senapati, 2012b) and the present resolution system is not able to resolve such cases. [sent-167, score-0.379]
</p><p>78 7  Conclusion  The present experiment shows that GuiTAR which is one of the off-the-shelf anaphora resolution systems can be effectively configured for Bengali. [sent-168, score-0.517]
</p><p>79 Basic NLP information required by GuiTAR pre-processing module has been supplied mostly through automatic tools. [sent-169, score-0.088]
</p><p>80 It is also revealed that MARS based implementation in GuiTAR is not very suitable for Bengali because the antecedent indicators used by MARS are probably not very effective for Bengali. [sent-172, score-0.188]
</p><p>81 Addition of other resolution algorithms is definitely a future extension of this study. [sent-174, score-0.178]
</p><p>82 Resolution of non-personal pronouns (which were not considered here) would be addressed next. [sent-175, score-0.201]

However, most of the currently Chinese NLP tools or components still have a wide range of issues need to be further improved and developed.

<p>Author: Emmanuel Lassalle ; Pascal Denis</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a new method for significantly improving the performance of pairwise coreference models. Given a set of indicators, our method learns how to best separate types of mention pairs into equivalence classes for which we construct distinct classification models. In effect, our approach finds an optimal feature space (derived from a base feature set and indicator set) for discriminating coreferential mention pairs. Although our approach explores a very large space of possible feature spaces, it remains tractable by exploiting the structure of the hierarchies built from the indicators. Our exper- iments on the CoNLL-2012 Shared Task English datasets (gold mentions) indicate that our method is robust relative to different clustering strategies and evaluation metrics, showing large and consistent improvements over a single pairwise model using the same base features. Our best system obtains a competitive 67.2 of average F1 over MUC, and CEAF which, despite its simplicity, places it above the mean score of other systems on these datasets.

<p>Author: Apurbalal Senapati ; Utpal Garain</p><p>Abstract: This paper attempts to use an off-the-shelf anaphora resolution (AR) system for Bengali. The language specific preprocessing modules of GuiTAR (v3.0.3) are identified and suitably designed for Bengali. Anaphora resolution module is also modified or replaced in order to realize different configurations of GuiTAR. Performance of each configuration is evaluated and experiment shows that the off-the-shelf AR system can be effectively used for Indic languages. 1</p><p>2 0.7348516 <a title="177-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Multigraph_Clustering_for_Unsupervised_Coreference_Resolution.html">252 acl-2013-Multigraph Clustering for Unsupervised Coreference Resolution</a></p>

<p>Author: Greg Durrett ; David Hall ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Efficiently incorporating entity-level information is a challenge for coreference resolution systems due to the difficulty of exact inference over partitions. We describe an end-to-end discriminative probabilistic model for coreference that, along with standard pairwise features, enforces structural agreement constraints between specified properties of coreferent mentions. This model can be represented as a factor graph for each document that admits efficient inference via belief propagation. We show that our method can use entity-level information to outperform a basic pairwise system.</p><p>4 0.69580066 <a title="177-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Domain-Specific_Coreference_Resolution_with_Lexicalized_Features.html">130 acl-2013-Domain-Specific Coreference Resolution with Lexicalized Features</a></p>
<p>Author: Nathan Gilbert ; Ellen Riloff</p><p>Abstract: Most coreference resolvers rely heavily on string matching, syntactic properties, and semantic attributes of words, but they lack the ability to make decisions based on individual words. In this paper, we explore the benefits of lexicalized features in the setting of domain-specific coreference resolution. We show that adding lexicalized features to off-the-shelf coreference resolvers yields significant performance gains on four domain-specific data sets and with two types of coreference resolution architectures.</p><p>5 0.5896647 <a title="177-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Apposition_Extraction_with_Syntactic_and_Semantic_Constraints.html">205 acl-2013-Joint Apposition Extraction with Syntactic and Semantic Constraints</a></p>

<p>Author: Mohamed Amir Yosef ; Sandro Bauer ; Johannes Hoffart ; Marc Spaniol ; Gerhard Weikum</p><p>Abstract: Recent research has shown progress in achieving high-quality, very fine-grained type classification in hierarchical taxonomies. Within such a multi-level type hierarchy with several hundreds of types at different levels, many entities naturally belong to multiple types. In order to achieve high-precision in type classification, current approaches are either limited to certain domains or require time consuming multistage computations. As a consequence, existing systems are incapable of performing ad-hoc type classification on arbitrary input texts. In this demo, we present a novel Webbased tool that is able to perform domain independent entity type classification under real time conditions. Thanks to its efficient implementation and compacted feature representation, the system is able to process text inputs on-the-fly while still achieving equally high precision as leading state-ofthe-art implementations. Our system offers an online interface where natural-language text can be inserted, which returns semantic type labels for entity mentions. Further more, the user interface allows users to explore the assigned types by visualizing and navigating along the type-hierarchy.</p><p>3 0.55727553 <a title="177-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-Word_Association_Profiles_and_their_Use_for_Automated_Scoring_of_Essays.html">389 acl-2013-Word Association Profiles and their Use for Automated Scoring of Essays</a></p>
<p>Author: Beata Beigman Klebanov ; Michael Flor</p><p>Abstract: We describe a new representation of the content vocabulary of a text we call word association profile that captures the proportions of highly associated, mildly associated, unassociated, and dis-associated pairs of words that co-exist in the given text. We illustrate the shape of the distirbution and observe variation with genre and target audience. We present a study of the relationship between quality of writing and word association profiles. For a set of essays written by college graduates on a number of general topics, we show that the higher scoring essays tend to have higher percentages of both highly associated and dis-associated pairs, and lower percentages of mildly associated pairs of words. Finally, we use word association profiles to improve a system for automated scoring of essays.</p><p>4 0.54748297 <a title="177-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-An_Empirical_Examination_of_Challenges_in_Chinese_Parsing.html">44 acl-2013-An Empirical Examination of Challenges in Chinese Parsing</a></p>
<p>Author: Jonathan K. Kummerfeld ; Daniel Tse ; James R. Curran ; Dan Klein</p><p>Abstract: Aspects of Chinese syntax result in a distinctive mix of parsing challenges. However, the contribution of individual sources of error to overall difficulty is not well understood. We conduct a comprehensive automatic analysis of error types made by Chinese parsers, covering a broad range of error types for large sets of sentences, enabling the first empirical ranking of Chinese error types by their performance impact. We also investigate which error types are resolved by using gold part-of-speech tags, showing that improving Chinese tagging only addresses certain error types, leaving substantial outstanding challenges.</p><p>5 0.52610195 <a title="177-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Iterative_Transformation_of_Annotation_Guidelines_for_Constituency_Parsing.html">204 acl-2013-Iterative Transformation of Annotation Guidelines for Constituency Parsing</a></p>

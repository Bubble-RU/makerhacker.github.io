<p>Author: Barbara Plank ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is the task of extracting semantic relationships between entities in text. Recent studies on relation extraction are mostly supervised. The clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to. This is the problem of domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose to combine (i) term generalization approaches such as word clustering and latent semantic analysis (LSA) and (ii) structured kernels to improve the adaptability of relation extractors to new text genres/domains. The empirical evaluation on ACE 2005 domains shows that a suitable combination of syntax and lexical generalization is very promising for domain adaptation.</p><p>3 0.28827691 <a title="144-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Learning_Semantic_Textual_Similarity_with_Structural_Representations.html">222 acl-2013-Learning Semantic Textual Similarity with Structural Representations</a></p>

<p>Author: Trevor Cohn ; Lucia Specia</p><p>Abstract: Annotating linguistic data is often a complex, time consuming and expensive endeavour. Even with strict annotation guidelines, human subjects often deviate in their analyses, each bringing different biases, interpretations of the task and levels of consistency. We present novel techniques for learning from the outputs of multiple annotators while accounting for annotator specific behaviour. These techniques use multi-task Gaussian Processes to learn jointly a series of annotator and metadata specific models, while explicitly representing correlations between models which can be learned directly from data. Our experiments on two machine translation quality estimation datasets show uniform significant accuracy gains from multi-task learning, and consistently outperform strong baselines.</p><p>5 0.19285457 <a title="144-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-Transfer_Learning_for_Constituency-Based_Grammars.html">357 acl-2013-Transfer Learning for Constituency-Based Grammars</a></p>
<p>Author: Yuan Zhang ; Regina Barzilay ; Amir Globerson</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of cross-formalism transfer in parsing. We are interested in parsing constituencybased grammars such as HPSG and CCG using a small amount of data specific for the target formalism, and a large quantity of coarse CFG annotations from the Penn Treebank. While all of the target formalisms share a similar basic syntactic structure with Penn Treebank CFG, they also encode additional constraints and semantic features. To handle this apparent discrepancy, we design a probabilistic model that jointly generates CFG and target formalism parses. The model includes features of both parses, allowing trans- fer between the formalisms, while preserving parsing efficiency. We evaluate our approach on three constituency-based grammars CCG, HPSG, and LFG, augmented with the Penn Treebank-1. Our experiments show that across all three formalisms, the target parsers significantly benefit from the coarse annotations.1 â€”</p><p>6 0.17353675 <a title="144-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Recognizing_Identical_Events_with_Graph_Kernels.html">296 acl-2013-Recognizing Identical Events with Graph Kernels</a></p>

<p>Author: Goran Glavas ; Jan Snajder</p><p>Abstract: Identifying news stories that discuss the same real-world events is important for news tracking and retrieval. Most existing approaches rely on the traditional vector space model. We propose an approach for recognizing identical real-world events based on a structured, event-oriented document representation. We structure documents as graphs of event mentions and use graph kernels to measure the similarity between document pairs. Our experiments indicate that the proposed graph-based approach can outperform the traditional vector space model, and is especially suitable for distinguishing between topically similar, yet non-identical events.</p><p>6 0.46977848 <a title="144-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Transfer_Learning_for_Constituency-Based_Grammars.html">357 acl-2013-Transfer Learning for Constituency-Based Grammars</a></p>

A recognition algorithm due to Lautemann is known to be polynomial-time for graphs that are connected and of bounded degree. We present a more precise characterization of the algorithmâ€™s complexity, an optimization analogous to binarization of contextfree grammars, and some important implementation details, resulting in an algorithm that is practical for natural-language applications. The algorithm is part of Bolinas, a new software toolkit for HRG processing.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7582556 <a title="144-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Explicit_and_Implicit_Syntactic_Features_for_Text_Classification.html">144 acl-2013-Explicit and Implicit Syntactic Features for Text Classification</a></p>

<p>Author: Haonan Yu ; Jeffrey Mark Siskind</p><p>Abstract: We present a method that learns representations for word meanings from short video clips paired with sentences. Unlike prior work on learning language from symbolic input, our input consists of video of people interacting with multiple complex objects in outdoor environments. Unlike prior computer-vision approaches that learn from videos with verb labels or images with noun labels, our labels are sentences containing nouns, verbs, prepositions, adjectives, and adverbs. The correspondence between words and concepts in the video is learned in an unsupervised fashion, even when the video depicts si- multaneous events described by multiple sentences or when different aspects of a single event are described with multiple sentences. The learned word meanings can be subsequently used to automatically generate description of new video.</p><p>4 0.75296664 <a title="144-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-The_Effects_of_Lexical_Resource_Quality_on_Preference_Violation_Detection.html">344 acl-2013-The Effects of Lexical Resource Quality on Preference Violation Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesse Dunietz ; Lori Levin ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet are widely used in a multitude of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora such as treebanks. Often, the resources are used as-is, without question or examination. This practice risks missing significant performance gains and even entire techniques. This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations. We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector. With asis lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources. More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements.</p><p>5 0.69580477 <a title="144-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Automatic_Term_Ambiguity_Detection.html">62 acl-2013-Automatic Term Ambiguity Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Tyler Baldwin ; Yunyao Li ; Bogdan Alexe ; Ioana R. Stanoi</p><p>Abstract: While the resolution of term ambiguity is important for information extraction (IE) systems, the cost of resolving each instance of an entity can be prohibitively expensive on large datasets. To combat this, this work looks at ambiguity detection at the term, rather than the instance, level. By making a judgment about the general ambiguity of a term, a system is able to handle ambiguous and unambiguous cases differently, improving throughput and quality. To address the term ambiguity detection problem, we employ a model that combines data from language models, ontologies, and topic modeling. Results over a dataset of entities from four product domains show that the proposed approach achieves significantly above baseline F-measure of 0.96.</p><p>6 0.67455083 <a title="144-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Reconstructing_an_Indo-European_Family_Tree_from_Non-native_English_Texts.html">299 acl-2013-Reconstructing an Indo-European Family Tree from Non-native English Texts</a></p>

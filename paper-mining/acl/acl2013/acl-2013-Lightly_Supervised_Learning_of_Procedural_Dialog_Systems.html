</p><p>9 In this paper, we present a new approach for learning procedural dialog systems from taskoriented textual resources in combination with  light, non-expert supervision. [sent-25, score-0.867]

[sent-36, score-0.841]
</p><p>11 Next, we present an approach that uses example user intent statements to simulate dialog interactions, and learns how to best map user utterances to nodes in these induced dialog trees. [sent-42, score-2.18]
</p><p>12 When combined, these approaches produce a complete dialog system that can engage in conversations by automatically moving between the nodes of a large collection of induced dialog trees. [sent-43, score-1.702]
</p><p>13 Experiments in the Windows Office help domain demonstrate that it is possible to build an effective end-to-end dialog system. [sent-44, score-0.794]
</p><p>14 We evaluate the dialog tree construction and dialog management components in isolation, demonstrating high accuracy (in the 80-90% range). [sent-45, score-1.668]
</p><p>15 2  Overview of Approach  Our task-oriented dialog system understands user utterances by mapping them to nodes in dialog trees generated from instructional text. [sent-48, score-2.067]

</p><p>21 Dialog Management To understand user intent and provide task assistance, we need a dialog management approach that specifies what the system should do and say. [sent-64, score-1.148]
</p><p>22 We adopt a simple approach that at all times maintains an index into a node in a dialog tree. [sent-65, score-0.9]
</p><p>23 Specifically, we learn classifiers that, given the dialog interaction history, predict how to pick the next tree node from the space of all nodes in the dialog trees that define the task knowledge. [sent-78, score-1.872]
</p><p>24 The resulting approach allows for significant flexibility in traversing the dialog trees. [sent-81, score-0.794]

</p><p>28 3  Building Dialog Trees from Instructions  Our first problem is to convert sets of instructions for user goals to dialog trees, as shown in Figure  2. [sent-90, score-1.295]
</p><p>29 In addition, we manually associate each node in a dialog tree with a training set of 10 queries. [sent-92, score-0.953]

</p><p>34 In the next few sections of the paper, we outline an overall system component design demonstrating how queries and topics are mapped to the dialog trees in Figure 3. [sent-137, score-0.95]
</p><p>35 The figure shows manyto-one relations between queries and topics, oneto-many relations between topics and goals, goals and instructions, and one-to-one relations between topics and dialog trees. [sent-138, score-1.082]
</p><p>36 Experimental Setup As described in Section 2, our dataset consists of 76 goals grouped into 30 topics (average 2-3 goals per topic) for a total of  246 instructions (average 3 instructions per goal). [sent-147, score-0.647]
</p><p>37 We manually label all instructions with user action au categories. [sent-148, score-0.569]
</p><p>38 The example instructions with corresponding user action labels are shown in Figure 2 (left) . [sent-154, score-0.518]

</p><p>46 Problem Definition Given an initial query, the dialog system initializes to a state s0, searches for the deepest relevant node given a query, and maps the query to a node on a topic ti, goal gj or action ak level in the dialog tree fi, as shown in Figure 4. [sent-227, score-2.505]

</p><p>50 We join these dialog trees representing different topics into a dialog network by introducing a global root. [sent-234, score-1.683]
</p><p>51 Within the network, we aim to find (1) an initial dialog state s0 that maximizes the probability of state given a query p(s0 |q, θ); and (2) the deepest relevant node v ∈ V on topic ti, goal gj or adceetipoens ak depth nino tdheev vtr ∈ee. [sent-235, score-1.465]

</p><p>59 Experimental Setup For each dialog tree, nodes corresponding to single instructions were hand-annotated with a small set of user queries, as described in Section 3. [sent-275, score-1.211]
</p><p>60 Results The initial dialog state classification model of finding a single node given an initial query is described in Eq. [sent-277, score-1.171]
</p><p>61 We chose two simple baselines: (1) randomly select a node in a dialog network and (2) use a tfidf 1-best Stemming, stopword removal and including top 10 tf-idf results as features led to a 19% increase in accuracy on an action node level over baseline (2). [sent-279, score-1.216]
</p><p>62 Adding the following features led to an overall 26% improvement: query overlap with a system prompt (PO), query overlap with other node queries (QO), and query overlap with its parent queries (QHistO) . [sent-280, score-0.939]
</p><p>63 For nodes deeper in the network, the task ofmapping a user query to an action becomes more challenging. [sent-282, score-0.572]

</p><p>67 5  Understanding Query Refinements  We also developed a classifier model for mapping followup queries to the nodes in a dialog network, while maintaining a dialog state that summarizes the history of the current interaction. [sent-289, score-1.841]

</p><p>70 We aim to find a new dialog state s0 that pairs a node from the dialog tree with  updated history information, thereby undergoing a dialog state update. [sent-294, score-2.734]
</p><p>71 We learn a linear classifier that models p(s0|q0, q, as, θ), the dialog state update distribution, qwhere we constrain the new state s0 to contain the new utterance q0 we are interpreting. [sent-295, score-1.003]
</p><p>72 An append action defines a dialog state update when transitioning from a node to its children at any depth in the same dialog tree e. [sent-298, score-2.175]

</p><p>81 Dialog State Update Model We use a log-linear model to maximize a dialog state distribution over the space of all nodes in a dialog network:  p(s0|q0,q,asθ) =Pse00PeiPθiiφθii(φs0i,(qs00,0a,qs0,,qa)s,q), Optimization is doneP  Pas  (4)  described in Section 3. [sent-339, score-1.743]
</p><p>82 Experimental Setup Ideally, dialog systems should be evaluated relative to large volumes of real user interaction data. [sent-340, score-1.016]
</p><p>83 Our query log data, however, does not include dialog turns, and so we  turn to simulated user behavior to test our system. [sent-341, score-1.127]
</p><p>84 To define a state s we sample a query q from a set of queries per node v and get a corresponding system action as for this node; to define a state s0, we sample a new query q0 from another node v0 ∈ V, v v0 which is sampled using a prior probability bi vased towards append: p(append)=0. [sent-345, score-0.937]
</p><p>85 This prior distribution defines a dialog strategy where the user primarily continues the current goal and rarely resets. [sent-349, score-1.051]
</p><p>86 Results Table 4 reports results for dialog state updates for topic, goal and action nodes. [sent-352, score-1.15]

</p><p>92 There is no model of dialog management or user interaction, and the approach does not use any machine learning. [sent-408, score-1.013]
</p><p>93 In contrast, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate it is possible to learn complete, interactive dialog systems using instructional texts (and nonexpert annotation). [sent-409, score-0.934]

<p>Author: Angeliki Metallinou ; Dan Bohus ; Jason Williams</p><p>Abstract: In spoken dialog systems, statistical state tracking aims to improve robustness to speech recognition errors by tracking a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states. Current approaches based on generative or discriminative models have different but important shortcomings that limit their accuracy. In this paper we discuss these limitations and introduce a new approach for discriminative state tracking that overcomes them by leveraging the problem structure. An offline evaluation with dialog data collected from real users shows improvements in both state tracking accuracy and the quality of the posterior probabilities. Features that encode speech recognition error patterns are particularly helpful, and training requires rel- atively few dialogs.</p><p>3 0.29800847 <a title="230-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Recommendation_Dialogs_by_Extracting_Information_from_User_Reviews.html">168 acl-2013-Generating Recommendation Dialogs by Extracting Information from User Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Svitlana Volkova ; Pallavi Choudhury ; Chris Quirk ; Bill Dolan ; Luke Zettlemoyer</p><p>Abstract: Procedural dialog systems can help users achieve a wide range of goals. However, such systems are challenging to build, currently requiring manual engineering of substantial domain-specific task knowledge and dialog management strategies. In this paper, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn procedural dialog systems given only light supervision, of the type that can be provided by non-experts. We consider domains where the required task knowledge exists in textual form (e.g., instructional web pages) and where system builders have access to statements of user intent (e.g., search query logs or dialog interactions). To learn from such textual resources, we describe a novel approach that first automatically extracts task knowledge from instructions, then learns a dialog manager over this task knowledge to provide assistance. Evaluation in a Microsoft Office domain shows that the individual components are highly accurate and can be integrated into a dialog system that provides effective help to users.</p><p>2 0.91377616 <a title="230-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Discriminative_state_tracking_for_spoken_dialog_systems.html">124 acl-2013-Discriminative state tracking for spoken dialog systems</a></p>
<p>Author: Angeliki Metallinou ; Dan Bohus ; Jason Williams</p><p>Abstract: In spoken dialog systems, statistical state tracking aims to improve robustness to speech recognition errors by tracking a posterior distribution over hidden dialog states. Current approaches based on generative or discriminative models have different but important shortcomings that limit their accuracy. In this paper we discuss these limitations and introduce a new approach for discriminative state tracking that overcomes them by leveraging the problem structure. An offline evaluation with dialog data collected from real users shows improvements in both state tracking accuracy and the quality of the posterior probabilities. Features that encode speech recognition error patterns are particularly helpful, and training requires rel- atively few dialogs.</p><p>3 0.7153098 <a title="230-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Recommendation_Dialogs_by_Extracting_Information_from_User_Reviews.html">168 acl-2013-Generating Recommendation Dialogs by Extracting Information from User Reviews</a></p>

<p>Author: Nina Dethlefs ; Helen Hastie ; Heriberto Cuayahuitl ; Oliver Lemon</p><p>Abstract: Surface realisers in spoken dialogue systems need to be more responsive than conventional surface realisers. They need to be sensitive to the utterance context as well as robust to partial or changing generator inputs. We formulate surface realisation as a sequence labelling task and combine the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) with semantic trees. Due to their extended notion of context, CRFs are able to take the global utterance context into account and are less constrained by local features than other realisers. This leads to more natural and less repetitive surface realisation. It also allows generation from partial and modified inputs and is therefore applicable to incremental surface realisation. Results from a human rating study confirm that users are sensitive to this extended notion of context and assign ratings that are significantly higher (up to 14%) than those for taking only local context into account.</p><p>6 0.35821947 <a title="230-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Grounded_Unsupervised_Semantic_Parsing.html">176 acl-2013-Grounded Unsupervised Semantic Parsing</a></p>

<p>Author: Brian Roark ; Cyril Allauzen ; Michael Riley</p><p>Abstract: We present an algorithm for re-estimating parameters of backoff n-gram language models so as to preserve given marginal distributions, along the lines of wellknown Kneser-Ney (1995) smoothing. Unlike Kneser-Ney, our approach is designed to be applied to any given smoothed backoff model, including models that have already been heavily pruned. As a result, the algorithm avoids issues observed when pruning Kneser-Ney models (Siivola et al., 2007; Chelba et al., 2010), while retaining the benefits of such marginal distribution constraints. We present experimental results for heavily pruned backoff ngram models, and demonstrate perplexity and word error rate reductions when used with various baseline smoothing methods. An open-source version of the algorithm has been released as part of the OpenGrm ngram library.1</p><p>3 0.76812083 <a title="230-lda-3" href="./acl-2013-A_System_for_Summarizing_Scientific_Topics_Starting_from_Keywords.html">23 acl-2013-A System for Summarizing Scientific Topics Starting from Keywords</a></p>
<p>Author: Rahul Jha ; Amjad Abu-Jbara ; Dragomir Radev</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of automatic generation of scientific surveys starting from keywords provided by a user. We present a system that can take a topic query as input and generate a survey of the topic by first selecting a set of relevant documents, and then selecting relevant sentences from those documents. We discuss the issues of robust evaluation of such systems and describe an evaluation corpus we generated by manually extracting factoids, or information units, from 47 gold standard documents (surveys and tutorials) on seven topics in Natural Language Processing. We have manually annotated 2,625 sentences with these factoids (around 375 sentences per topic) to build an evaluation corpus for this task. We present evaluation results for the performance of our system using this annotated data.</p><p>4 0.72371089 <a title="230-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven_Learning_for_Open_Question_Answering.html">272 acl-2013-Paraphrase-Driven Learning for Open Question Answering</a></p>
<p>Author: Anthony Fader ; Luke Zettlemoyer ; Oren Etzioni</p><p>Abstract: We study question answering as a machine learning problem, and induce a function that maps open-domain questions to queries over a database of web extractions. Given a large, community-authored, question-paraphrase corpus, we demonstrate that it is possible to learn a semantic lexicon and linear ranking function without manually annotating questions. Our approach automatically generalizes a seed lexicon and includes a scalable, parallelized perceptron parameter estimation scheme. Experiments show that our approach more than quadruples the recall of the seed lexicon, with only an 8% loss in precision.</p><p>5 0.61190277 <a title="230-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Sentiment_Relevance.html">318 acl-2013-Sentiment Relevance</a></p>
<p>Author: Christian Scheible ; Hinrich Schutze</p><p>Abstract: A number of different notions, including subjectivity, have been proposed for distinguishing parts of documents that convey sentiment from those that do not. We propose a new concept, sentiment relevance, to make this distinction and argue that it better reflects the requirements of sentiment analysis systems. We demonstrate experimentally that sentiment relevance and subjectivity are related, but different. Since no large amount of labeled training data for our new notion of sentiment relevance is available, we investigate two semi-supervised methods for creating sentiment relevance classifiers: a distant supervision approach that leverages structured information about the domain of the reviews; and transfer learning on feature representations based on lexical taxonomies that enables knowledge transfer. We show that both methods learn sentiment relevance classifiers that perform well.</p><p>6 0.61061025 <a title="230-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Generating_Synthetic_Comparable_Questions_for_News_Articles.html">169 acl-2013-Generating Synthetic Comparable Questions for News Articles</a></p>

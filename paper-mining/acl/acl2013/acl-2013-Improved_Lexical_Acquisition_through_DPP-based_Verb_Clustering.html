<p>Author: Lin Sun ; Diana McCarthy ; Anna Korhonen</p><p>Abstract: Although diathesis alternations have been used as features for manual verb classification, and there is recent work on incorporating such features in computational models of human language acquisition, work on large scale verb classification has yet to examine the potential for using diathesis alternations as input features to the clustering process. This paper proposes a method for approximating diathesis alternation behaviour in corpus data and shows, using a state-of-the-art verb clustering system, that features based on alternation approximation outperform those based on independent subcategorization frames. Our alternation-based approach is particularly adept at leveraging information from less frequent data.</p><p>3 0.1699253 <a title="192-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>
<p>Author: Manaal Faruqui ; Chris Dyer</p><p>Abstract: We present an information theoretic objective for bilingual word clustering that incorporates both monolingual distributional evidence as well as cross-lingual evidence from parallel corpora to learn high quality word clusters jointly in any number of languages. The monolingual component of our objective is the average mutual information of clusters of adjacent words in each language, while the bilingual component is the average mutual information of the aligned clusters. To evaluate our method, we use the word clusters in an NER system and demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in F1 score when using bilingual word clusters instead of monolingual clusters.</p><p>4 0.15150237 <a title="192-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Embedding_Semantic_Similarity_in_Tree_Kernels_for_Domain_Adaptation_of_Relation_Extraction.html">134 acl-2013-Embedding Semantic Similarity in Tree Kernels for Domain Adaptation of Relation Extraction</a></p>
<p>Author: Barbara Plank ; Alessandro Moschitti</p><p>Abstract: Relation Extraction (RE) is the task of extracting semantic relationships between entities in text. Recent studies on relation extraction are mostly supervised. The clear drawback of supervised methods is the need of training data: labeled data is expensive to obtain, and there is often a mismatch between the training data and the data the system will be applied to. This is the problem of domain adaptation. In this paper, we propose to combine (i) term generalization approaches such as word clustering and latent semantic analysis (LSA) and (ii) structured kernels to improve the adaptability of relation extractors to new text genres/domains. The empirical evaluation on ACE 2005 domains shows that a suitable combination of syntax and lexical generalization is very promising for domain adaptation.</p><p>5 0.14229058 <a title="192-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-A_Multi-Domain_Translation_Model_Framework_for_Statistical_Machine_Translation.html">11 acl-2013-A Multi-Domain Translation Model Framework for Statistical Machine Translation</a></p>
<p>Author: Rico Sennrich ; Holger Schwenk ; Walid Aransa</p><p>Abstract: While domain adaptation techniques for SMT have proven to be effective at improving translation quality, their practicality for a multi-domain environment is often limited because of the computational and human costs of developing and maintaining multiple systems adapted to different domains. We present an architecture that delays the computation of translation model features until decoding, allowing for the application of mixture-modeling techniques at decoding time. We also de- scribe a method for unsupervised adaptation with development and test data from multiple domains. Experimental results on two language pairs demonstrate the effectiveness of both our translation model architecture and automatic clustering, with gains of up to 1BLEU over unadapted systems and single-domain adaptation.</p><p>6 0.14120017 <a title="192-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-The_Haves_and_the_Have-Nots%3A_Leveraging_Unlabelled_Corpora_for_Sentiment_Analysis.html">345 acl-2013-The Haves and the Have-Nots: Leveraging Unlabelled Corpora for Sentiment Analysis</a></p>

<p>Author: Aline Villavicencio ; Marco Idiart ; Robert Berwick ; Igor Malioutov</p><p>Abstract: Hierarchical Bayesian Models (HBMs) have been used with some success to capture empirically observed patterns of under- and overgeneralization in child language acquisition. However, as is well known, HBMs are “ideal”learningsystems, assumingaccess to unlimited computational resources that may not be available to child language learners. Consequently, it remains crucial to carefully assess the use of HBMs along with alternative, possibly simpler, candidate models. This paper presents such an evaluation for a language acquisi- tion domain where explicit HBMs have been proposed: the acquisition of English dative constructions. In particular, we present a detailed, empiricallygrounded model-selection comparison of HBMs vs. a simpler alternative based on clustering along with maximum likelihood estimation that we call linear competition learning (LCL). Our results demonstrate that LCL can match HBM model performance without incurring on the high computational costs associated with HBMs.</p><p>4 0.65041983 <a title="192-lsi-4" href="./acl-2013-Post-Retrieval_Clustering_Using_Third-Order_Similarity_Measures.html">281 acl-2013-Post-Retrieval Clustering Using Third-Order Similarity Measures</a></p>

Within this context, we propose a new methodology that adapts the classical K-means algorithm to a third-order similarity measure initially developed for NLP tasks. Results obtained with the definition of a new stopping criterion over the ODP-239 and the MORESQUE gold standard datasets evidence that our proposal outperforms all reported text-based approaches.</p><p>5 0.58530539 <a title="192-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>

<p>Author: Phillippe Langlais</p><p>Abstract: Analogical learning over strings is a holistic model that has been investigated by a few authors as a means to map forms of a source language to forms of a target language. In this study, we revisit this learning paradigm and apply it to the transliteration task. We show that alone, it performs worse than a statistical phrase-based machine translation engine, but the combination of both approaches outperforms each one taken separately, demonstrating the usefulness of the information captured by a so-called formal analogy.</p><p>4 0.66712493 <a title="192-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Mining_Opinion_Words_and_Opinion_Targets_in_a_Two-Stage_Framework.html">244 acl-2013-Mining Opinion Words and Opinion Targets in a Two-Stage Framework</a></p>
<p>Author: Liheng Xu ; Kang Liu ; Siwei Lai ; Yubo Chen ; Jun Zhao</p><p>Abstract: This paper proposes a novel two-stage method for mining opinion words and opinion targets. In the first stage, we propose a Sentiment Graph Walking algorithm, which naturally incorporates syntactic patterns in a Sentiment Graph to extract opinion word/target candidates. Then random walking is employed to estimate confidence of candidates, which improves extraction accuracy by considering confidence of patterns. In the second stage, we adopt a self-learning strategy to refine the results from the first stage, especially for filtering out high-frequency noise terms and capturing the long-tail terms, which are not investigated by previous methods. The experimental results on three real world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach compared with stateof-the-art unsupervised methods.</p><p>5 0.65484804 <a title="192-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Fast_and_Adaptive_Online_Training_of_Feature-Rich_Translation_Models.html">156 acl-2013-Fast and Adaptive Online Training of Feature-Rich Translation Models</a></p>

Manning</p><p>Abstract: We present a fast and scalable online method for tuning statistical machine translation models with large feature sets. The standard tuning algorithm—MERT—only scales to tens of features. Recent discriminative algorithms that accommodate sparse features have produced smaller than expected translation quality gains in large systems. Our method, which is based on stochastic gradient descent with an adaptive learning rate, scales to millions of features and tuning sets with tens of thousands of sentences, while still converging after only a few epochs. Large-scale experiments on Arabic-English and Chinese-English show that our method produces significant translation quality gains by exploiting sparse features. Equally important is our analysis, which suggests techniques for mitigating overfitting and domain mismatch, and applies to other recent discriminative methods for machine translation. 1</p><p>6 0.65174568 <a title="192-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-An_Information_Theoretic_Approach_to_Bilingual_Word_Clustering.html">47 acl-2013-An Information Theoretic Approach to Bilingual Word Clustering</a></p>

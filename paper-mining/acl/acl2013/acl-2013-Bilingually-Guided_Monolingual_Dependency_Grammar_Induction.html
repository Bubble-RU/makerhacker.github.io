</p><p>2 We induced dependency gram-  mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28. [sent-9, score-0.754]
</p><p>3 As alternative strategies, methods which utilize raw texts have been investigated recently, including unsupervised methods which use only raw texts (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; William et  al. [sent-19, score-0.239]
</p><p>4 And there are a lot of efforts have also been devoted to bilingual projection (Chen et al. [sent-22, score-0.684]
</p><p>5 In dependency grammar induction, unsupervised methods achieve continuous improvements in recent years (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Bod, 2006; William et al. [sent-26, score-0.579]
</p><p>6 ), an unsupervised model usually suffers from two drawbacks, i. [sent-30, score-0.27]
</p><p>7 , 2005; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Jiang and Liu, 2010) seems a promising substitute for languages with a large amount of bilingual sentences and an existing parser of the counterpart language. [sent-34, score-0.236]
</p><p>8 , 2012), a better dependency grammar can be easily induced, if syntactic isomorphism is largely maintained between target and source languages. [sent-39, score-0.34]
</p><p>9 Considering this, we propose a novel strategy for automatically inducing a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance  of bilingually-projected dependency information, which integrates the advantage of bilingual projection into the unsupervised framework. [sent-44, score-1.643]
</p><p>10 A randomly-initialized monolingual treebank evolves in a self-training iterative procedure, and the grammar parameters are tuned to simultaneously maximize both the monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood of the evolving treebank. [sent-45, score-0.622]
</p><p>11 The monolingual likelihood is similar to the optimization objectives of conventional unsupervised models, while the bilinguallyprojected likelihood is the product of the projected probabilities of dependency trees. [sent-46, score-0.885]
</p><p>12 In addition, since both likelihoods are fundamentally factorized into dependency edges (of the hypothesis tree), the computational complexi-  ty approaches to unsupervised models, while with much faster convergence. [sent-48, score-0.437]
</p><p>13 We evaluate the final automatically-induced dependency parsing model on 5 languages. [sent-49, score-0.309]
</p><p>14 Experimental results show that our method significantly outperforms previous work based on unsupervised method or indirect/direct dependency projection, where we see an average improvement of 28. [sent-50, score-0.437]
</p><p>15 5% over unsupervised baseline on all languages, and the improvements are 3. [sent-51, score-0.239]
</p><p>16 2  Unsupervised Dependency Grammar Induction  In this section, we introduce the unsupervised objective and the unsupervised training algorithm which is used as the framework of our bilinguallyguided method. [sent-59, score-0.72]
</p><p>17 Unlike previous unsupervised work (Klein and Manning, 2004; Smith and Eisner, 2005; Bod, 2006), we select a self-training approach (similar to hard EM method) to train the unsupervised model. [sent-60, score-0.511]
</p><p>18 And the framework of our unsupervised model builds a random treebank on the monolingual corpus firstly for initialization and trains a discriminative parsing model on it. [sent-61, score-0.657]
</p><p>19 Let’s introduce the parsing objective firstly: Define ei as the ith word in monolingual sentence E; deij denotes the word pair dependency relationship (ei → ej). [sent-64, score-0.832]
</p><p>20 Z(deij ) is a normalizing constant:  +  Z(deij)  = Xexp(Xλn· fn(deij,y)) Xy  (2)  Xn  Given a sentence E, parsing a dependency tree  is to find a dependency tree DE with maximum probability PE:  PE= argDmEaxdeiYj∈DEPr(+|deij)  (3)  2. [sent-67, score-0.552]

</p><p>27 3  Bilingual Projection of Dependency Grammar  In this section, we introduce our projection objective and training algorithm which trains the model with arc instances. [sent-80, score-0.885]
</p><p>28 Because of the heterogeneity between different languages and word alignment errors, projection methods may contain a lot of noises. [sent-81, score-0.603]
</p><p>29 So we extract projected discrete dependency arc instances instead of treebank as training set for the projected grammar induction model. [sent-85, score-1.057]
</p><p>30 1 Projection Objective Correspondingly, we select an objective which has the same form with the unsupervised one: φ(λ) =  X  logPr(+|de)  +deX∈DXP  logPr(−|de) deX X∈DN  (7)  where DP is the positive dependency arc instance  set, which is obtained by direct projection methods (Hwa et al. [sent-87, score-1.258]
</p><p>31 2 Projection Algorithm Basically, the training procedure in line 2,7 of Algorithm 1 can be divided into smaller iterative steps, and Algorithm 2 outlines the training step of projection model with instances. [sent-90, score-0.84]
</p><p>32 4  Bilingually-Guided Dependency Grammar Induction  This section presents our bilingually-guided grammar induction model, which incorporates unsupervised framework and bilingual projection model through a joint approach. [sent-94, score-1.218]
</p><p>33 We believe that unsupervised model and projection model can complement each other and a joint model which takes better use of both unsupervised parse trees and projected dependency arcs can give us a better parser. [sent-98, score-1.533]
</p><p>34 Based on the idea, we propose a novel strategy for training monolingual grammar induction model with the guidance of unsupervised and bilingually-projected dependency information. [sent-99, score-0.949]
</p><p>35 Figure 1 outlines our bilingual-guided grammar induction process in its entirety. [sent-100, score-0.323]
</p><p>36 In our method, we select compatible objectives for unsupervised and projection models, in order to they can share the same grammar parameters. [sent-101, score-0.992]
</p><p>37 Then we incorporate projection model into our iterative unsupervised framework, and jointly optimize unsupervised and projection objectives with evolv-  ing treebank and constant projection information respectively. [sent-102, score-2.39]
</p><p>38 In this way, our bilingually-guided model’s parameters are tuned to simultaneously maximizing both monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood by 4 steps: 1. [sent-103, score-0.286]
</p><p>39 Randomly build treebank on target sentences for initialization, and get the projected arc instances through projection from bitext. [sent-104, score-0.957]
</p><p>40 Train the bilingually-guided grammar induction model by multi-objective optimization method with unsupervised objective and projection objective on treebank and projected arc instances respectively. [sent-106, score-1.796]
</p><p>41 The unsupervised objective is optimized by the loop—”tree bank→optimized model→new tree lboaonpk—”. [sent-111, score-0.45]
</p><p>42 Ttrheee  unsupervised model gets projection constraint implicitly from those parse trees which contain information from projection part. [sent-113, score-1.398]
</p><p>43 The projection objective is optimized by the circulation—”projected instances→optimized model”, these projected inisntasntacnecse ws→il o npotitm change once we get tph reomje. [sent-114, score-0.904]
</p><p>44 , 2003), because the input of the projection objective is static. [sent-116, score-0.698]
</p><p>45 And α is a mixing coefficient which reflects the relative confidence between the unsupervised and projection objectives. [sent-119, score-0.803]
</p><p>46 When α = 1it is the unsupervised objective function in Formula (6). [sent-123, score-0.373]
</p><p>47 Contrary, if α = 0, it is the projection objective function (Formula (7)) for projected instances. [sent-124, score-0.865]
</p><p>48 With this approach, we can optimize the mixed parsing model by maximizing the objective in Formula (9). [sent-125, score-0.29]
</p><p>49 And it incorporates unsupervised framework and projection model algorithm together. [sent-131, score-0.867]
</p><p>50 It is grounded on the work which uses features in the unsupervised model (BergKirkpatrick et al. [sent-132, score-0.27]
</p><p>51 In line 1, 2 we get projected dependency instances from source side according to projection methods and build a random treebank (step 1). [sent-134, score-1.101]
</p><p>52 Then we train an initial model with projection instances in line 3. [sent-135, score-0.7]
</p><p>53 From line 4-9, the objective is optimized with a generic optimization step in the subroutine climb(·, ·, ·, ·, ·). [sent-136, score-0.277]
</p><p>54 Then we calculate the gradient and optimize the joint objective according to the evolved treebank and projected instances (step 2). [sent-139, score-0.47]
</p><p>55 , 2002) can be described as: if there is a pair of source words with a dependency relationship, the corresponding aligned words in target sentence can be considered as having the same dependency relationship equivalently (e. [sent-147, score-0.396]
</p><p>56 For edge deij : wordi is the parent word and wordj  is the child word, similar to ”pos”. [sent-152, score-0.323]
</p><p>57 for dependency projection and annotation, which requires a small set of dependency annotated corpus of target language. [sent-154, score-0.96]
</p><p>58 , 2012) is an effective way to improve unsupervised parsing. [sent-157, score-0.239]
</p><p>59 (2012) selects a selective sharing model to make better use of grammar information in multi-sources. [sent-162, score-0.212]
</p><p>60 Due to similar reasons, many works are devoted to POS projection (Yarowsky et al. [sent-163, score-0.564]
</p><p>61 (2009), and some further improve the projection by a graphbased projection (Das and Petrov, 2011). [sent-170, score-1.128]
</p><p>62 Our model differs from the approaches above in its emphasis on utilizing information from both sides of bilingual corpus in an unsupervised training framework, while most of the work above only utilize the information from a single side. [sent-171, score-0.425]
</p><p>63 6  Experiments  In this section, we evaluate the performance of the MST dependency parser (McDonald et al. [sent-172, score-0.23]
</p><p>64 For all languages, we only use English-target parallel data: we take the FBIS English-Chinese bitext as bilingual corpus for English-Chinese dependency projection which contains 239K sentence pairs with about 8. [sent-177, score-0.915]
</p><p>65 The source sentences are then parsed by an implementation of 2nd-ordered MST model of McDonald and Pereira (2006), which is trained on dependency trees extracted from Penn Treebank. [sent-182, score-0.29]
</p><p>66 Training Regime In experiments, we use the projection method proposed by Jiang and Liu  (2010) to provide the projection instances. [sent-185, score-1.128]
</p><p>67 And we train the projection part α = 0 first for initialization, on which the whole model will be trained. [sent-186, score-0.628]
</p><p>68 Baselines We compare our method against three kinds of different approaches: unsupervised method (Klein and Manning, 2004); singlesource direct projection methods (Hwa et al. [sent-188, score-0.838]
</p><p>69 , 2005; Jiang and Liu, 2010); multi-source indirect projection methods with multi-sources (M1068  6610. [sent-189, score-0.564]
</p><p>70 Compare against Unsupervised Baseline Experimental results show that our unsupervised framework’s performance approaches to the DMV method. [sent-214, score-0.239]
</p><p>71 And the bilingually-guided model can promote the unsupervised method consistency over all languages. [sent-215, score-0.27]
</p><p>72 Compare against Projection Baselines For all languages, the model consistently outperforms on direct projection baseline. [sent-218, score-0.63]
</p><p>73 33 Table 2: The directed dependency accuracy with different parameter of our model and the baselines. [sent-245, score-0.229]
</p><p>74 The first section of the table (row 3-7) shows the results of the baselines: a unsupervised method baseline (Klein and Manning, 2004)(DMV); a single-source projection method baseline (Hwa et al. [sent-246, score-0.803]
</p><p>75 The second section of the table (row 8) presents the result of our unsupervised framework (unsuper). [sent-250, score-0.239]
</p><p>76 The results in Figure 3 prove that our unsupervised framework α = 1can promote the grammar induction if it has a good start (well initialization), and it will be better once we incorporate the information from the projection side (α = 0. [sent-254, score-1.067]
</p><p>77 And the maximum points are not in α = 1, which implies that projection information is still available for the unsupervised framework even if we employ the projection model as the initialization. [sent-256, score-1.398]
</p><p>78 3 Effects of the Size of Training Corpus To investigate how the size of the training corpus influences the result, we train the model on extracted bilingual corpus with varying sizes: 10K, 50K, 100K, 150K and 200K sentences pairs. [sent-262, score-0.219]
</p><p>79 9)  noise rate  Figure 5: Performance on different projection quality (average of 5 languages, α = 0. [sent-264, score-0.602]
</p><p>80 The noise rate is the percentage of the projected instances being messed up. [sent-266, score-0.243]
</p><p>81 That is, because our  method not only utilizes the projection information but also avails itself of the monolingual corpus. [sent-269, score-0.661]
</p><p>82 4 Effect of Projection Quality The projection quality can be influenced by the quality of the source parsing, alignments, projection methods, corpus quality and many other factors. [sent-271, score-1.128]
</p><p>83 In order to detect the effects of varying projection qualities on our approach, we simulate the complex projection procedure by messing up the projected instances randomly with different noise rates. [sent-272, score-1.411]
</p><p>84 The result suggests that our method can solve some problems which are caused by projection noise. [sent-279, score-0.564]
</p><p>85 The results seem supporting our unsupervised optimization method when α is in the range of (0, 0. [sent-283, score-0.276]
</p><p>86 It implies that the unsupervised structure information is useful, but it seems creating a negative effect on the model when α is greater than 0. [sent-285, score-0.27]
</p><p>87 Because the unsupervised part can gain constraints from the projection part. [sent-287, score-0.803]
</p><p>88 But with the increase of α, the strength of constraint dwindles, and the unsupervised part will gradually lose control. [sent-288, score-0.239]
</p><p>89 And bad unsupervised part pulls the full model down. [sent-289, score-0.27]
</p><p>90 7  Conclusion and Future Work  This paper presents a bilingually-guided strategy for automatic dependency grammar induction, which adopts an unsupervised skeleton and leverages the bilingually-projected dependency information during optimization. [sent-290, score-0.811]
</p><p>91 By simultaneously maximizing the monolingual likelihood and bilingually-projected likelihood in the EM procedure, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction. [sent-291, score-1.209]
</p><p>92 Experiments on 5 languages show that the novel  strategy significantly outperforms previous unsupervised or bilingually-projected models. [sent-292, score-0.312]
</p><p>93 Since its computational complexity approaches to the skeleton unsupervised model (with much fewer iterations), and the bilingual text aligned to 1070  resource-rich languages is easy to obtain, such a hybrid method seems to be a better choice for automatic grammar induction. [sent-293, score-0.571]
</p><p>94 It also indicates that the combination of bilingual constraint and unsupervised methodology has a promising prospect for grammar induction. [sent-294, score-0.501]

However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations. Experiments showed that our methods improve the performances greatly on projections between English and Chinese.</p><p>3 0.36021829 <a title="70-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>4 0.30252945 <a title="70-tfidf-4" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Transfer_of_Semantic_Role_Labeling_Models.html">98 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Transfer of Semantic Role Labeling Models</a></p>
<p>Author: Mikhail Kozhevnikov ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has become one of the standard tasks of natural language processing and proven useful as a source of information for a number of other applications. We address the problem of transferring an SRL model from one language to another using a shared feature representation. This approach is then evaluated on three language pairs, demonstrating competitive performance as compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised SRL system and a cross-lingual annotation projection baseline. We also consider the contribution of different aspects of the feature representation to the performance of the model and discuss practical applicability of this method. 1 Background and Motivation Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009). Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages. As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language. A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed. On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data. It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster. On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch. There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages. This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language. The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages. Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links. However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a sourcelanguage model on it. An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language. This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages. McDonald et al. (201 1) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of- speech tags as the shared representation of words. A later extension of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance. In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example “in August” vs “in Britain”. However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen1190 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ?

(2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion. In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing crosslingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one. This approach yields an SRL model for a new language at a very low cost, effectively requiring only a source language model and parallel data. We evaluate on five (directed) language pairs EN-ZH, ZH-EN, EN-CZ, CZ-EN and EN-FR, where EN, FR, CZ and ZH denote English, French, Czech and Chinese, respectively. The transferred model is compared against two baselines: an unsupervised SRL system and a model trained on the output of a cross-lingual annotation projection system. In the next section we will describe our setup, then in section 3 present the shared feature representation we use, discuss the evaluation data and other technical aspects in section 4, present the results and conclude with an overview of related work. – 2 Setup The purpose of the study is not to develop a yet another semantic role labeling system any existing SRL system can (after some modification) be used in this setup but to assess the practical applicability of cross-lingual model transfer to this – – problem, compare it against the alternatives and identify its strong/weak points depending on a particular setup. 2.1 Semantic Role Labeling Model We consider the dependency-based version of semantic role labeling as described in Haji cˇ et al. (2009) and transfer an SRL model from one language to another. We only consider verbal predicates and ignore the predicate disambiguation stage. We also assume that the predicate identification information is available in most languages it can be obtained using a relatively simple heuristic based on part-of-speech tags. The model performs argument identification and classification (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) separately in a pipeline first each candidate is classified as being or not being a head of an argument phrase with respect to the predicate in question and then each of the arguments is assigned a role from a given inventory. The model is factorized over arguments the decisions regarding the classification of different arguments are made in– – – dependently of each other. With respect to the use of syntactic annotation we consider two options: using an existing dependency parser for the target language and obtaining one by means of cross-lingual transfer (see section 4.2). Following McDonald et al. (201 1), we assume that a part-of-speech tagger is available for the target language. 2.2 SRL in the Low-resource Setting Several approaches have been proposed to obtain an SRL model for a new language with little or no manual annotation. Unsupervised SRL models (Lang and Lapata, 2010) cluster the arguments of predicates in a given corpus according to their semantic roles. The performance of such models can be impressive, especially for those languages where semantic roles correlate strongly with syntactic relation of the argument to its predicate. However, assigning meaningful role labels to the resulting clusters requires additional effort and the model’s parameters generally need some adjustment for every language. If the necessary resources are already available for a closely related language, they can be utilized to facilitate the construction of a model for the target language. This can be achieved either by means of cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or by cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). This last approach is the one we are considering in this work, and the other two options are treated as baselines. The unsupervised model will be further referred to as UNSUP and the projection baseline as PROJ. 2.3 Evaluation Measures We use the F1 measure as a metric for the argument identification stage and accuracy as an aggregate measure of argument classification performance. When comparing to the unsupervised SRL system the clustering evaluation measures are used instead. These are purity and collocation 1191 N1Ximajx|Gj∩ Ci| CO =N1Xjmiax|Gj∩ Ci|, PU = where Ci is the set of arguments in the i-th induced cluster, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold cluster and N is the total number of arguments. We report the harmonic mean ofthe two (Lang and Lapata, 2011) and denote it F1c to avoid confusing it with the supervised metric. 3 Model Transfer The idea of this work is to abstract the model away from the particular source language and apply it to a new one. This setup requires that we use the same feature representation for both languages, for example part-of-speech tags and dependency relation labels should be from the same inventory. Some features are not applicable to certain lan- guages because the corresponding phenomena are absent in them. For example, consider a strongly inflected language and an analytic one. While the latter can usually convey the information encoded in the word form in the former one (number, gender, etc.), finding a shared feature representation for such information is non-trivial. In this study we will confine ourselves to those features that are applicable to all languages in question, namely: part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependency structures and representations of the word’s identity. 3.1 Lexical Information We train a model on one language and apply it to a different one. In order for this to work, the words of the two languages have to be mapped into a common feature space. It is also desirable that closely related words from both languages have similar representations in this space. Word mapping. The first option is simply to use the source language words as the shared representation. Here every source language word would have itself as its representation and every target word would map into a source word that corresponds to it. In other words, we supply the model with a gloss of the target sentence. The mapping (bilingual dictionary) we use is derived from a word-aligned parallel corpus, by identifying, for each word in the target language, the word in the source language it is most often aligned to. Cross-lingual clusters. There is no guarantee that each of the words in the evaluation data is present in our dictionary, nor that the corresponding source-language word is present in the training data, so the model would benefit from the ability to generalize over closely related words. This can, for example, be achieved by using cross-lingual word clusters induced in T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012). We incorporate these clusters as features into our model. 3.2 Syntactic Information Part-of-speech Tags. We map part-of-speech tags into the universal tagset following Petrov et al. (2012). This may have a negative effect on the performance of a monolingual model, since most part-of-speech tagsets are more fine-grained than the universal POS tags considered here. For example Penn Treebank inventory contains 36 tags and the universal POS tagset only 12. Since the finergrained POS tags often reflect more languagespecific phenomena, however, they would only be useful for very closely related languages in the cross-lingual setting. The universal part-of-speech tags used in evaluation are derived from gold-standard annotation for all languages except French, where predicted ones had to be used instead. Dependency Structure. Another important aspect of syntactic information is the dependency structure. Most dependency relation inventories are language-specific, and finding a shared representation for them is a challenging problem. One could map dependency relations into a simplified form that would be shared between languages, as it is done for part-of-speech tags in Petrov et al. (2012). The extent to which this would be useful, however, depends on the similarity of syntactic-semantic in– terfaces of the languages in question. In this work we discard the dependency relation labels where the inventories do not match and only consider the unlabeled syntactic dependency graph. Some discrepancies, such as variations in attachment order, may be present even there, but this does not appear to be the case with the datasets we use for evaluation. If a target language is poor in resources, one can obtain a dependency parser for the target language by means of cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). We 1192 take this into account and evaluate both using the original dependency structures and the ones obtained by means of cross-lingual model transfer. 3.3 The Model The model we use is based on that of Bj ¨orkelund et al. (2009). It is comprised of a set of linear classifiers trained using Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). The feature model was modified to accommodate the cross-lingual cluster features and the reranker component was not used. We do not model the interaction between different argument roles in the same predicate. While this has been found useful, in the cross-lingual setup one has to be careful with the assumptions made. For example, modeling the sequence of roles using a Markov chain (Thompson et al., 2003) may not work well in the present setting, especially between distant languages, as the order or arguments is not necessarily preserved. Most constraints that prove useful for SRL (Chang et al., 2007) also require customization when applied to a new language, and some rely on languagespecific resources, such as a valency lexicon. Taking into account the interaction between different arguments of a predicate is likely to improve the performance of the transferred model, but this is outside the scope of this work. 3.4 Feature Selection Compatibility of feature representations is necessary but not sufficient for successful model transfer. We have to make sure that the features we use are predictive of similar outcomes in the two languages as well. Depending on the pair of languages in question, different aspects of the feature representation will retain or lose their predictive power. We can be reasonably certain that the identity of an argument word is predictive of its semantic role in any language, but it might or might not be true of, for example, the word directly preceding the argument word. It is therefore important to pre- SCPDGylOespoSntreslTabunc1lra:obsFel-daitnguplrdoaeusntpagd-elronwfu-dcsopeyrnsd c.eylafguhtorsia mepgnrhs vent the model from capturing overly specific aspects of the source language, which we do by confining the model to first-order features. We also avoid feature selection, which, performed on the source language, is unlikely to help the model to better generalize to the target one. The experiments confirm that feature selection and the use of second-order features degrade the performance of the transferred model. 3.5 Feature Groups For each word, we use its part-of-speech tag, cross-lingual cluster id, word identity (glossed, when evaluating on the target language) and its dependency relation to its parent. Features associated with an argument word include the attributes of the predicate word, the argument word, its parent, siblings and children, and the words directly preceding and following it. Also included are the sequences of part-of-speech tags and dependency relations on the path between the predicate and the argument. Since we are also interested in the impact of different aspects of the feature representation, we divide the features into groups as summarized in table 1 and evaluate their respective contributions to the performance of the model. If a feature group is enabled the model has access to the corre– sponding source of information. For example, if only POS group is enabled, the model relies on the part-of-speech tags of the argument, the predicate and the words to the right and left of the argument word. If Synt is enabled too, it also uses the POS tags of the argument’s parent, children and siblings. Word order information constitutes an implicit group that is always available. It includes the Pos it ion feature, which indicates whether the argument is located to the left or to the right of the predicate, and allows the model to look up the attributes of the words directly preceding and following the argument word. The model we compare against the baselines uses all applicable feature groups (Deprel is only used in EN-CZ and CZ-EN experiments with original syntax). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Evaluation of the cross-lingual model transfer requires a rather specific kind of dataset. Namely, the data in both languages has to be annotated 1193 with the same set of semantic roles following the same (or compatible) guidelines, which is seldom the case. We have identified three language pairs for which such resources are available: EnglishChinese, English-Czech and English-French. The evaluation datasets for English and Chinese are those from the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji ˇc et al., 2009) (henceforth CoNLL-ST). Their annotation in the CoNLL-ST is not identical, but the guidelines for “core” semantic roles are similar (Kingsbury et al., 2004), so we evaluate only on core roles here. The data for the second language pair is drawn from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Haji ˇc et al., 2012), which we converted to a format similar to that of CoNLL-ST1 . The original annotation uses the tectogrammatical representation (Haji ˇc, 2002) and an inventory of semantic roles (or functors), most of which are interpretable across various predicates. Also note that the syntactic anno- tation of English and Czech in PCEDT 2.0 is quite similar (to the extent permitted by the difference in the structure of the two languages) and we can use the dependency relations in our experiments. For English-French, the English CoNLL-ST dataset was used as a source and the model was evaluated on the manually annotated dataset from van der Plas et al. (201 1). The latter contains one thousand sentences from the French part ofthe Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus, annotated with semantic roles following an adapted version of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) guidelines. The authors perform annotation projection from English to French, using a joint model of syntax and semantics and employing heuristics for filtering. We use a model trained on the output of this projection system as one of the baselines. The evaluation dataset is relatively small in this case, so we perform the transfer only one-way, from English to French. The part-of-speech tags in all datasets were replaced with the universal POS tags of Petrov et al. (2012). For Czech, we have augmented the map- pings to account for the tags that were not present in the datasets from which the original mappings were derived. Namely, tag “t” is mapped to “VERB” and “Y” to “PRON”. We use parallel data to construct a bilingual dictionary used in word mapping, as well as in the projection baseline. For English-Czech – 1see http://www.ml4nlp.de/code-and-data/treex2conll and English-French, the data is drawn from Europarl (Koehn, 2005), for English-Chinese from MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The word alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the intersection heuristic. – 4.2 Syntactic Transfer In the low-resource setting, we cannot always rely on the availability of an accurate dependency parser for the target language. If one is not available, the natural solution would be to use crosslingual model transfer to obtain it. Unfortunately, the models presented in the previous work, such as Zeman and Resnik (2008), McDonald et al. (201 1) and T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012), were not made available, so we reproduced the direct transfer algorithm of McDonald et al. (201 1), using Malt parser (Nivre, 2008) and the same set of features. We did not reimplement the projected transfer algorithm, however, and used the default training procedure instead of perceptron-based learning. The dependency structure thus obtained is, of course, only a rough approximation even a much more sophisticated algorithm may not perform well when transferring syntax between such languages as Czech and English, given the inherent difference in their structure. The scores are shown in table 2. We will henceforth refer to the syntactic annotations that were provided with the datasets as original, as opposed to the annotations obtained by means of syntactic transfer. – 4.3 Baselines Unsupervised Baseline: We are using a version of the unsupervised semantic role induction system of Titov and Klementiev (2012a) adapted to SetupUAS, % Table2:SyntaciE C ZcN HNt- rE ZaCFnN HZRsfer34 692567acuracy,unlabe dat- tachment score (percent). Note that in case of French we evaluate against the output of a supervised system, since manual annotation is not available for this dataset. This score does not reflect the true performance of syntactic transfer. 1194 the shared feature representation considered in order to make the scores comparable with those of the transfer model and, more importantly, to enable evaluation on transferred syntax. Note that the original system, tailored to a more expressive language-specific syntactic representation and equipped with heuristics to identify active/passive voice and other phenomena, achieves higher scores than those we report here. Projection Baseline: The projection baseline we use for English-Czech and English-Chinese is a straightforward one: we label the source side of a parallel corpus using the source-language model, then identify those verbs on the target side that are aligned to a predicate, mark them as predicates and propagate the argument roles in the same fashion. A model is then trained on the resulting training data and applied to the test set. For English-French we instead use the output of a fully featured projection model of van der Plas et al. (201 1), published in the CLASSiC project. 5 Results In order to ensure that the results are consistent, the test sets, except for the French one, were partitioned into five equal parts (of 5 to 10 thousand sentences each, depending on the dataset) and the evaluation performed separately on each one. All evaluation figures for English, Czech or Chinese below are the average values over the five subsets. In case of French, the evaluation dataset is too small to split it further, so instead we ran the evaluation five times on a randomly selected 80% sample of the evaluation data and averaged over those. In both cases the results are consistent over the subsets, the standard deviation does not exceed 0.5% for the transfer system and projection baseline and 1% for the unsupervised system. 5.1 Argument Identification We summarize the results in table 3. Argument identification is known to rely heavily on syntactic information, so it is unsurprising that it proves inaccurate when transferred syntax is used. Our simple projection baseline suffers from the same problem. Even with original syntactic information available, the performance of argument identification is moderate. Note that the model of (van der Plas et al., 2011), though relying on more expressive syntax, only outperforms the transferred system by 3% (F1) on this task.

Most unsupervised SRL approaches assume that the argument identification is performed by some external means, for example heuristically (Lang and Lapata, 2011). Such heuristics or unsupervised approaches to argument identification (Abend et al., 2009) can also be used in the present setup. 5.2 Argument Classification In the following tables, TRANS column contains the results for the transferred system, UNSUP for the unsupervised baseline and PROJ for projection baseline. We highlight in bold the higher score where the difference exceeds twice the maximum of the standard deviation estimates of the two results. Table 4 presents the unsupervised evaluation results.

In the more realistic scenario with transferred syn- tax, however, the transferred model proves more accurate. In table 5 we compare the transferred system with the projection baseline. It is easy to see that the scores vary strongly depending on the language pair, due to both the difference in the annotation scheme used and the degree of relatedness between the languages. The drop in performance when transferring the model to another language is large in every case, though, see table 6.

Table 8 contains the results for English-French. FeaturesOrigTrans ferent feature subsets, using original and transferred syntactic information. The fact that the model performs slightly better with transferred syntax may be explained by two factors. Firstly, as we already mentioned, the original syntactic annotation is also produced automatically. Secondly, in the model transfer setup it is more important how closely the syntacticsemantic interface on the target side resembles that on the source side than how well it matches the “true” structure of the target language, and in this respect a transferred dependency parser may have an advantage over one trained on target-language data. The high impact of the Glos s features here 1196 may be partly attributed to the fact that the mapping is derived from the same corpus as the evaluation data Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and partly by the similarity between English and French in terms of word order, usage of articles and prepositions. The moderate contribution of the crosslingual cluster features are likely due to the insufficient granularity of the clustering for this task. For more distant language pairs, the contributions of individual feature groups are less interpretable, so we only highlight a few observations. First of all, both EN-CZ and CZ-EN benefit noticeably from the use of the original syntactic annotation, including dependency relations, but not from the transferred syntax, most likely due to the low syntactic transfer performance. Both perform better when lexical information is available, although – – the improvement is not as significant as in the case of French only up to 5%. The situation with Chinese is somewhat complicated in that adding lexical information here fails to yield an improvement in terms of the metric considered. This is likely due to the fact that we consider only the core roles, which can usually be predicted with high accuracy based on syntactic information alone. – 6 Related Work Development of robust statistical models for core NLP tasks is a challenging problem, and adaptation of existing models to new languages presents a viable alternative to exhaustive annotation for each language. Although the models thus obtained are generally imperfect, they can be further refined for a particular language and domain using techniques such as active learning (Settles, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied ex- tensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wr o´blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011; Annesi and Basili, 2010; Tonelli and Pianta, 2008), dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Hwa et al., 2005) or temporal relation prediction (Spreyer and Frank, 2008). Interestingly, it has also been used to propagate morphosyntactic information between old and modern versions of the same language (Meyer, 2011). Cross-lingual model transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Durrett et al., 2012; Søgaard, 2011; Lopez et al., 2008) have also been receiving much attention recently. The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (201 1). A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation. There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; T ¨ackstr o¨m et al., 2012), but both work on word level. This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language. Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Haji ˇc, 2002). A side-effect ofusing adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks. Such representations are also likely to be useful in machine translation. Unsupervised semantic role labeling methods (Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Lorenzo and Cerisara, 2012) also constitute an alternative to cross-lingual model transfer. For an overview of of semi-supervised approaches we refer the reader to Titov and Klementiev (2012b). 7 Conclusion We have considered the cross-lingual model transfer approach as applied to the task of semantic role labeling and observed that for closely related languages it performs comparably to annotation projection approaches. It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages. While an1197 notation projection approaches require sentenceand word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary. Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient. In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example. Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language. Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language.

<p>Author: Kai Liu ; Yajuan Lu ; Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel strategy for automatic induction of a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency. By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>2 0.88457263 <a title="70-lsi-2" href="./acl-2013-Enhanced_and_Portable_Dependency_Projection_Algorithms_Using_Interlinear_Glossed_Text.html">136 acl-2013-Enhanced and Portable Dependency Projection Algorithms Using Interlinear Glossed Text</a></p>
<p>Author: Ryan Georgi ; Fei Xia ; William D. Lewis</p><p>Abstract: As most of the world’s languages are under-resourced, projection algorithms offer an enticing way to bootstrap the resources available for one resourcepoor language from a resource-rich language by means of parallel text and word alignment. These algorithms, however, make the strong assumption that the language pairs share common structures and that the parse trees will resemble one another. This assumption is useful but often leads to errors in projection. In this paper, we will address this weakness by using trees created from instances of Interlinear Glossed Text (IGT) to discover patterns of divergence between the lan- guages. We will show that this method improves the performance of projection algorithms significantly in some languages by accounting for divergence between languages using only the partial supervision of a few corrected trees.</p><p>3 0.87950528 <a title="70-lsi-3" href="./acl-2013-Cross-lingual_Projections_between_Languages_from_Different_Families.html">97 acl-2013-Cross-lingual Projections between Languages from Different Families</a></p>

However, these methods confronted the difficulty of syntactic differences between languages especially when the pair of languages varies greatly. To make the projection method well-generalize to diverse languages pairs, we enhance the projection method based on word alignments by introducing target-language word representations as features and proposing a novel noise removing method based on these word representations.

<p>Author: Mikhail Kozhevnikov ; Ivan Titov</p><p>Abstract: Semantic Role Labeling (SRL) has become one of the standard tasks of natural language processing and proven useful as a source of information for a number of other applications. We address the problem of transferring an SRL model from one language to another using a shared feature representation. This approach is then evaluated on three language pairs, demonstrating competitive performance as compared to a state-of-the-art unsupervised SRL system and a cross-lingual annotation projection baseline. We also consider the contribution of different aspects of the feature representation to the performance of the model and discuss practical applicability of this method. 1 Background and Motivation Semantic role labeling has proven useful in many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering (Shen and Lapata, 2007; Kaisser and Webber, 2007), textual entailment (Sammons et al., 2009), machine translation (Wu and Fung, 2009; Liu and Gildea, 2010; Gao and Vogel, 2011) and dialogue systems (Basili et al., 2009; van der Plas et al., 2009). Multiple models have been designed to automatically predict semantic roles, and a considerable amount of data has been annotated to train these models, if only for a few more popular languages. As the annotation is costly, one would like to leverage existing resources to minimize the human effort required to construct a model for a new language. A number of approaches to the construction of semantic role labeling models for new languages have been proposed. On one end of the scale is unsupervised SRL, such as Grenager and Manning (2006), which requires some expert knowledge, but no labeled data. It clusters together arguments that should bear the same semantic role, but does not assign a particular role to each cluster. On the other end is annotating a new dataset from scratch. There are also intermediate options, which often make use of similarities between languages. This way, if an accurate model exists for one language, it should help simplify the construction of a model for another, related language. The approaches in this third group often use parallel data to bridge the gap between languages. Cross-lingual annotation projection systems (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009), for example, propagate information directly via word alignment links. However, they are very sensitive to the quality of parallel data, as well as the accuracy of a sourcelanguage model on it. An alternative approach, known as cross-lingual model transfer, or cross-lingual model adaptation, consists of modifying a source-language model to make it directly applicable to a new language. This usually involves constructing a shared feature representation across the two languages. McDonald et al. (201 1) successfully apply this idea to the transfer of dependency parsers, using part-of- speech tags as the shared representation of words. A later extension of T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012) enriches this representation with cross-lingual word clusters, considerably improving the performance. In the case of SRL, a shared representation that is purely syntactic is likely to be insufficient, since structures with different semantics may be realized by the same syntactic construct, for example “in August” vs “in Britain”. However with the help of recently introduced cross-lingual word represen1190 Proce dingsS o f ita h,e B 5u1lgsta Arinan,u Aaulg Musete 4ti-n9g 2 o0f1 t3h.e ? Ac s2s0o1ci3a Atiosnso fcoirat Cio nm foprut Caotimonpaulta Lti nognuails Lti cnsg,u piasgteics 1 90–120 , tations, such as the cross-lingual clustering mentioned above or cross-lingual distributed word representations of Klementiev et al. (2012), we may be able to transfer models of shallow semantics in a similar fashion. In this work we construct a shared feature representation for a pair of languages, employing crosslingual representations of syntactic and lexical information, train a semantic role labeling model on one language and apply it to the other one. This approach yields an SRL model for a new language at a very low cost, effectively requiring only a source language model and parallel data. We evaluate on five (directed) language pairs EN-ZH, ZH-EN, EN-CZ, CZ-EN and EN-FR, where EN, FR, CZ and ZH denote English, French, Czech and Chinese, respectively. The transferred model is compared against two baselines: an unsupervised SRL system and a model trained on the output of a cross-lingual annotation projection system. In the next section we will describe our setup, then in section 3 present the shared feature representation we use, discuss the evaluation data and other technical aspects in section 4, present the results and conclude with an overview of related work. – 2 Setup The purpose of the study is not to develop a yet another semantic role labeling system any existing SRL system can (after some modification) be used in this setup but to assess the practical applicability of cross-lingual model transfer to this – – problem, compare it against the alternatives and identify its strong/weak points depending on a particular setup. 2.1 Semantic Role Labeling Model We consider the dependency-based version of semantic role labeling as described in Haji cˇ et al. (2009) and transfer an SRL model from one language to another. We only consider verbal predicates and ignore the predicate disambiguation stage. We also assume that the predicate identification information is available in most languages it can be obtained using a relatively simple heuristic based on part-of-speech tags. The model performs argument identification and classification (Johansson and Nugues, 2008) separately in a pipeline first each candidate is classified as being or not being a head of an argument phrase with respect to the predicate in question and then each of the arguments is assigned a role from a given inventory. The model is factorized over arguments the decisions regarding the classification of different arguments are made in– – – dependently of each other. With respect to the use of syntactic annotation we consider two options: using an existing dependency parser for the target language and obtaining one by means of cross-lingual transfer (see section 4.2). Following McDonald et al. (201 1), we assume that a part-of-speech tagger is available for the target language. 2.2 SRL in the Low-resource Setting Several approaches have been proposed to obtain an SRL model for a new language with little or no manual annotation. Unsupervised SRL models (Lang and Lapata, 2010) cluster the arguments of predicates in a given corpus according to their semantic roles. The performance of such models can be impressive, especially for those languages where semantic roles correlate strongly with syntactic relation of the argument to its predicate. However, assigning meaningful role labels to the resulting clusters requires additional effort and the model’s parameters generally need some adjustment for every language. If the necessary resources are already available for a closely related language, they can be utilized to facilitate the construction of a model for the target language. This can be achieved either by means of cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) or by cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). This last approach is the one we are considering in this work, and the other two options are treated as baselines. The unsupervised model will be further referred to as UNSUP and the projection baseline as PROJ. 2.3 Evaluation Measures We use the F1 measure as a metric for the argument identification stage and accuracy as an aggregate measure of argument classification performance. When comparing to the unsupervised SRL system the clustering evaluation measures are used instead. These are purity and collocation 1191 N1Ximajx|Gj∩ Ci| CO =N1Xjmiax|Gj∩ Ci|, PU = where Ci is the set of arguments in the i-th induced cluster, Gj is the set of arguments in the jth gold cluster and N is the total number of arguments. We report the harmonic mean ofthe two (Lang and Lapata, 2011) and denote it F1c to avoid confusing it with the supervised metric. 3 Model Transfer The idea of this work is to abstract the model away from the particular source language and apply it to a new one. This setup requires that we use the same feature representation for both languages, for example part-of-speech tags and dependency relation labels should be from the same inventory. Some features are not applicable to certain lan- guages because the corresponding phenomena are absent in them. For example, consider a strongly inflected language and an analytic one. While the latter can usually convey the information encoded in the word form in the former one (number, gender, etc.), finding a shared feature representation for such information is non-trivial. In this study we will confine ourselves to those features that are applicable to all languages in question, namely: part-of-speech tags, syntactic dependency structures and representations of the word’s identity. 3.1 Lexical Information We train a model on one language and apply it to a different one. In order for this to work, the words of the two languages have to be mapped into a common feature space. It is also desirable that closely related words from both languages have similar representations in this space. Word mapping. The first option is simply to use the source language words as the shared representation. Here every source language word would have itself as its representation and every target word would map into a source word that corresponds to it. In other words, we supply the model with a gloss of the target sentence. The mapping (bilingual dictionary) we use is derived from a word-aligned parallel corpus, by identifying, for each word in the target language, the word in the source language it is most often aligned to. Cross-lingual clusters. There is no guarantee that each of the words in the evaluation data is present in our dictionary, nor that the corresponding source-language word is present in the training data, so the model would benefit from the ability to generalize over closely related words. This can, for example, be achieved by using cross-lingual word clusters induced in T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012). We incorporate these clusters as features into our model. 3.2 Syntactic Information Part-of-speech Tags. We map part-of-speech tags into the universal tagset following Petrov et al. (2012). This may have a negative effect on the performance of a monolingual model, since most part-of-speech tagsets are more fine-grained than the universal POS tags considered here. For example Penn Treebank inventory contains 36 tags and the universal POS tagset only 12. Since the finergrained POS tags often reflect more languagespecific phenomena, however, they would only be useful for very closely related languages in the cross-lingual setting. The universal part-of-speech tags used in evaluation are derived from gold-standard annotation for all languages except French, where predicted ones had to be used instead. Dependency Structure. Another important aspect of syntactic information is the dependency structure. Most dependency relation inventories are language-specific, and finding a shared representation for them is a challenging problem. One could map dependency relations into a simplified form that would be shared between languages, as it is done for part-of-speech tags in Petrov et al. (2012). The extent to which this would be useful, however, depends on the similarity of syntactic-semantic in– terfaces of the languages in question. In this work we discard the dependency relation labels where the inventories do not match and only consider the unlabeled syntactic dependency graph. Some discrepancies, such as variations in attachment order, may be present even there, but this does not appear to be the case with the datasets we use for evaluation. If a target language is poor in resources, one can obtain a dependency parser for the target language by means of cross-lingual model transfer (Zeman and Resnik, 2008). We 1192 take this into account and evaluate both using the original dependency structures and the ones obtained by means of cross-lingual model transfer. 3.3 The Model The model we use is based on that of Bj ¨orkelund et al. (2009). It is comprised of a set of linear classifiers trained using Liblinear (Fan et al., 2008). The feature model was modified to accommodate the cross-lingual cluster features and the reranker component was not used. We do not model the interaction between different argument roles in the same predicate. While this has been found useful, in the cross-lingual setup one has to be careful with the assumptions made. For example, modeling the sequence of roles using a Markov chain (Thompson et al., 2003) may not work well in the present setting, especially between distant languages, as the order or arguments is not necessarily preserved. Most constraints that prove useful for SRL (Chang et al., 2007) also require customization when applied to a new language, and some rely on languagespecific resources, such as a valency lexicon. Taking into account the interaction between different arguments of a predicate is likely to improve the performance of the transferred model, but this is outside the scope of this work. 3.4 Feature Selection Compatibility of feature representations is necessary but not sufficient for successful model transfer. We have to make sure that the features we use are predictive of similar outcomes in the two languages as well. Depending on the pair of languages in question, different aspects of the feature representation will retain or lose their predictive power. We can be reasonably certain that the identity of an argument word is predictive of its semantic role in any language, but it might or might not be true of, for example, the word directly preceding the argument word. It is therefore important to pre- SCPDGylOespoSntreslTabunc1lra:obsFel-daitnguplrdoaeusntpagd-elronwfu-dcsopeyrnsd c.eylafguhtorsia mepgnrhs vent the model from capturing overly specific aspects of the source language, which we do by confining the model to first-order features. We also avoid feature selection, which, performed on the source language, is unlikely to help the model to better generalize to the target one. The experiments confirm that feature selection and the use of second-order features degrade the performance of the transferred model. 3.5 Feature Groups For each word, we use its part-of-speech tag, cross-lingual cluster id, word identity (glossed, when evaluating on the target language) and its dependency relation to its parent. Features associated with an argument word include the attributes of the predicate word, the argument word, its parent, siblings and children, and the words directly preceding and following it. Also included are the sequences of part-of-speech tags and dependency relations on the path between the predicate and the argument. Since we are also interested in the impact of different aspects of the feature representation, we divide the features into groups as summarized in table 1 and evaluate their respective contributions to the performance of the model. If a feature group is enabled the model has access to the corre– sponding source of information. For example, if only POS group is enabled, the model relies on the part-of-speech tags of the argument, the predicate and the words to the right and left of the argument word. If Synt is enabled too, it also uses the POS tags of the argument’s parent, children and siblings. Word order information constitutes an implicit group that is always available. It includes the Pos it ion feature, which indicates whether the argument is located to the left or to the right of the predicate, and allows the model to look up the attributes of the words directly preceding and following the argument word. The model we compare against the baselines uses all applicable feature groups (Deprel is only used in EN-CZ and CZ-EN experiments with original syntax). 4 Evaluation 4.1 Datasets and Preprocessing Evaluation of the cross-lingual model transfer requires a rather specific kind of dataset. Namely, the data in both languages has to be annotated 1193 with the same set of semantic roles following the same (or compatible) guidelines, which is seldom the case. We have identified three language pairs for which such resources are available: EnglishChinese, English-Czech and English-French. The evaluation datasets for English and Chinese are those from the CoNLL Shared Task 2009 (Haji ˇc et al., 2009) (henceforth CoNLL-ST). Their annotation in the CoNLL-ST is not identical, but the guidelines for “core” semantic roles are similar (Kingsbury et al., 2004), so we evaluate only on core roles here. The data for the second language pair is drawn from the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank 2.0 (Haji ˇc et al., 2012), which we converted to a format similar to that of CoNLL-ST1 . The original annotation uses the tectogrammatical representation (Haji ˇc, 2002) and an inventory of semantic roles (or functors), most of which are interpretable across various predicates. Also note that the syntactic anno- tation of English and Czech in PCEDT 2.0 is quite similar (to the extent permitted by the difference in the structure of the two languages) and we can use the dependency relations in our experiments. For English-French, the English CoNLL-ST dataset was used as a source and the model was evaluated on the manually annotated dataset from van der Plas et al. (201 1). The latter contains one thousand sentences from the French part ofthe Europarl (Koehn, 2005) corpus, annotated with semantic roles following an adapted version of PropBank (Palmer et al., 2005) guidelines. The authors perform annotation projection from English to French, using a joint model of syntax and semantics and employing heuristics for filtering. We use a model trained on the output of this projection system as one of the baselines. The evaluation dataset is relatively small in this case, so we perform the transfer only one-way, from English to French. The part-of-speech tags in all datasets were replaced with the universal POS tags of Petrov et al. (2012). For Czech, we have augmented the map- pings to account for the tags that were not present in the datasets from which the original mappings were derived. Namely, tag “t” is mapped to “VERB” and “Y” to “PRON”. We use parallel data to construct a bilingual dictionary used in word mapping, as well as in the projection baseline. For English-Czech – 1see http://www.ml4nlp.de/code-and-data/treex2conll and English-French, the data is drawn from Europarl (Koehn, 2005), for English-Chinese from MultiUN (Eisele and Chen, 2010). The word alignments were obtained using GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003) and the intersection heuristic. – 4.2 Syntactic Transfer In the low-resource setting, we cannot always rely on the availability of an accurate dependency parser for the target language. If one is not available, the natural solution would be to use crosslingual model transfer to obtain it. Unfortunately, the models presented in the previous work, such as Zeman and Resnik (2008), McDonald et al. (201 1) and T ¨ackstr o¨m et al. (2012), were not made available, so we reproduced the direct transfer algorithm of McDonald et al. (201 1), using Malt parser (Nivre, 2008) and the same set of features. We did not reimplement the projected transfer algorithm, however, and used the default training procedure instead of perceptron-based learning. The dependency structure thus obtained is, of course, only a rough approximation even a much more sophisticated algorithm may not perform well when transferring syntax between such languages as Czech and English, given the inherent difference in their structure. The scores are shown in table 2. We will henceforth refer to the syntactic annotations that were provided with the datasets as original, as opposed to the annotations obtained by means of syntactic transfer. – 4.3 Baselines Unsupervised Baseline: We are using a version of the unsupervised semantic role induction system of Titov and Klementiev (2012a) adapted to SetupUAS, % Table2:SyntaciE C ZcN HNt- rE ZaCFnN HZRsfer34 692567acuracy,unlabe dat- tachment score (percent). Note that in case of French we evaluate against the output of a supervised system, since manual annotation is not available for this dataset. This score does not reflect the true performance of syntactic transfer. 1194 the shared feature representation considered in order to make the scores comparable with those of the transfer model and, more importantly, to enable evaluation on transferred syntax. Note that the original system, tailored to a more expressive language-specific syntactic representation and equipped with heuristics to identify active/passive voice and other phenomena, achieves higher scores than those we report here. Projection Baseline: The projection baseline we use for English-Czech and English-Chinese is a straightforward one: we label the source side of a parallel corpus using the source-language model, then identify those verbs on the target side that are aligned to a predicate, mark them as predicates and propagate the argument roles in the same fashion. A model is then trained on the resulting training data and applied to the test set. For English-French we instead use the output of a fully featured projection model of van der Plas et al. (201 1), published in the CLASSiC project. 5 Results In order to ensure that the results are consistent, the test sets, except for the French one, were partitioned into five equal parts (of 5 to 10 thousand sentences each, depending on the dataset) and the evaluation performed separately on each one. All evaluation figures for English, Czech or Chinese below are the average values over the five subsets. In case of French, the evaluation dataset is too small to split it further, so instead we ran the evaluation five times on a randomly selected 80% sample of the evaluation data and averaged over those. In both cases the results are consistent over the subsets, the standard deviation does not exceed 0.5% for the transfer system and projection baseline and 1% for the unsupervised system. 5.1 Argument Identification We summarize the results in table 3. Argument identification is known to rely heavily on syntactic information, so it is unsurprising that it proves inaccurate when transferred syntax is used. Our simple projection baseline suffers from the same problem. Even with original syntactic information available, the performance of argument identification is moderate. Note that the model of (van der Plas et al., 2011), though relying on more expressive syntax, only outperforms the transferred system by 3% (F1) on this task.

Most unsupervised SRL approaches assume that the argument identification is performed by some external means, for example heuristically (Lang and Lapata, 2011). Such heuristics or unsupervised approaches to argument identification (Abend et al., 2009) can also be used in the present setup. 5.2 Argument Classification In the following tables, TRANS column contains the results for the transferred system, UNSUP for the unsupervised baseline and PROJ for projection baseline.

In the more realistic scenario with transferred syn- tax, however, the transferred model proves more accurate. In table 5 we compare the transferred system with the projection baseline. It is easy to see that the scores vary strongly depending on the language pair, due to both the difference in the annotation scheme used and the degree of relatedness between the languages. The drop in performance when transferring the model to another language is large in every case, though, see table 6.

The source language scores for English vary between language pairs because of the difference in syntactic annotation and role subset used. We also include the individual F1 scores for the top-10 most frequent labels for EN-CZ transfer with original syntax in table 7.

Table 8 contains the results for English-French. FeaturesOrigTrans ferent feature subsets, using original and transferred syntactic information. The fact that the model performs slightly better with transferred syntax may be explained by two factors. Firstly, as we already mentioned, the original syntactic annotation is also produced automatically. Secondly, in the model transfer setup it is more important how closely the syntacticsemantic interface on the target side resembles that on the source side than how well it matches the “true” structure of the target language, and in this respect a transferred dependency parser may have an advantage over one trained on target-language data. The high impact of the Glos s features here 1196 may be partly attributed to the fact that the mapping is derived from the same corpus as the evaluation data Europarl (Koehn, 2005) and partly by the similarity between English and French in terms of word order, usage of articles and prepositions. The moderate contribution of the crosslingual cluster features are likely due to the insufficient granularity of the clustering for this task. For more distant language pairs, the contributions of individual feature groups are less interpretable, so we only highlight a few observations. First of all, both EN-CZ and CZ-EN benefit noticeably from the use of the original syntactic annotation, including dependency relations, but not from the transferred syntax, most likely due to the low syntactic transfer performance. Both perform better when lexical information is available, although – – the improvement is not as significant as in the case of French only up to 5%. The situation with Chinese is somewhat complicated in that adding lexical information here fails to yield an improvement in terms of the metric considered. This is likely due to the fact that we consider only the core roles, which can usually be predicted with high accuracy based on syntactic information alone. – 6 Related Work Development of robust statistical models for core NLP tasks is a challenging problem, and adaptation of existing models to new languages presents a viable alternative to exhaustive annotation for each language. Although the models thus obtained are generally imperfect, they can be further refined for a particular language and domain using techniques such as active learning (Settles, 2010; Chen et al., 2011). Cross-lingual annotation projection (Yarowsky et al., 2001) approaches have been applied ex- tensively to a variety of tasks, including POS tagging (Xi and Hwa, 2005; Das and Petrov, 2011), morphology segmentation (Snyder and Barzilay, 2008), verb classification (Merlo et al., 2002), mention detection (Zitouni and Florian, 2008), LFG parsing (Wr o´blewska and Frank, 2009), information extraction (Kim et al., 2010), SRL (Pad o´ and Lapata, 2009; van der Plas et al., 2011; Annesi and Basili, 2010; Tonelli and Pianta, 2008), dependency parsing (Naseem et al., 2012; Ganchev et al., 2009; Smith and Eisner, 2009; Hwa et al., 2005) or temporal relation prediction (Spreyer and Frank, 2008). Interestingly, it has also been used to propagate morphosyntactic information between old and modern versions of the same language (Meyer, 2011). Cross-lingual model transfer methods (McDonald et al., 2011; Zeman and Resnik, 2008; Durrett et al., 2012; Søgaard, 2011; Lopez et al., 2008) have also been receiving much attention recently. The basic idea behind model transfer is similar to that of cross-lingual annotation projection, as we can see from the way parallel data is used in, for example, McDonald et al. (201 1). A crucial component of direct transfer approaches is the unified feature representation. There are at least two such representations of lexical information (Klementiev et al., 2012; T ¨ackstr o¨m et al., 2012), but both work on word level. This makes it hard to account for phenomena that are expressed differently in the languages considered, for example the syntactic function of a certain word may be indicated by a preposition, inflection or word order, depending on the language. Accurate representation of such information would require an extra level of abstraction (Haji ˇc, 2002). A side-effect ofusing adaptation methods is that we are forced to use the same annotation scheme for the task in question (SRL, in our case), which in turn simplifies the development of cross-lingual tools for downstream tasks. Such representations are also likely to be useful in machine translation. Unsupervised semantic role labeling methods (Lang and Lapata, 2010; Lang and Lapata, 2011; Titov and Klementiev, 2012a; Lorenzo and Cerisara, 2012) also constitute an alternative to cross-lingual model transfer. For an overview of of semi-supervised approaches we refer the reader to Titov and Klementiev (2012b). 7 Conclusion We have considered the cross-lingual model transfer approach as applied to the task of semantic role labeling and observed that for closely related languages it performs comparably to annotation projection approaches. It allows one to quickly construct an SRL model for a new language without manual annotation or language-specific heuristics, provided an accurate model is available for one of the related languages along with a certain amount of parallel data for the two languages. While an1197 notation projection approaches require sentenceand word-aligned parallel data and crucially depend on the accuracy of the syntactic parsing and SRL on the source side of the parallel corpus, cross-lingual model transfer can be performed using only a bilingual dictionary. Unsupervised SRL approaches have their advantages, in particular when no annotated data is available for any of the related languages and there is a syntactic parser available for the target one, but the annotation they produce is not always sufficient. In applications such as Information Retrieval it is preferable to have precise labels, rather than just clusters of arguments, for example. Also note that when applying cross-lingual model transfer in practice, one can improve upon the performance of the simplistic model we use for evaluation, for example by picking the features manually, taking into account the properties of the target language. Domain adaptation techniques can also be employed to adjust the model to the target language.

<p>Author: Sean Moran ; Victor Lavrenko ; Miles Osborne</p><p>Abstract: We introduce a scheme for optimally allocating a variable number of bits per LSH hyperplane. Previous approaches assign a constant number of bits per hyperplane. This neglects the fact that a subset of hyperplanes may be more informative than others. Our method, dubbed Variable Bit Quantisation (VBQ), provides a datadriven non-uniform bit allocation across hyperplanes. Despite only using a fraction of the available hyperplanes, VBQ outperforms uniform quantisation by up to 168% for retrieval across standard text and image datasets.</p><p>6 0.59040225 <a title="70-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Simpler_unsupervised_POS_tagging_with_bilingual_projections.html">323 acl-2013-Simpler unsupervised POS tagging with bilingual projections</a></p>

<p>Author: Jiwei Li ; Claire Cardie ; Sujian Li</p><p>Abstract: Product reviews are now widely used by individuals and organizations for decision making (Litvin et al., 2008; Jansen, 2010). And because of the profits at stake, people have been known to try to game the system by writing fake reviews to promote target products. As a result, the task of deceptive review detection has been gaining increasing attention. In this paper, we propose a generative LDA-based topic modeling approach for fake review detection. Our model can aptly detect the subtle dif- ferences between deceptive reviews and truthful ones and achieves about 95% accuracy on review spam datasets, outperforming existing baselines by a large margin.</p><p>2 0.88253379 <a title="70-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Combination_of_Recurrent_Neural_Networks_and_Factored_Language_Models_for_Code-Switching_Language_Modeling.html">84 acl-2013-Combination of Recurrent Neural Networks and Factored Language Models for Code-Switching Language Modeling</a></p>
<p>Author: Heike Adel ; Ngoc Thang Vu ; Tanja Schultz</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the application of recurrent neural network language models (RNNLM) and factored language models (FLM) to the task of language modeling for Code-Switching speech. We present a way to integrate partof-speech tags (POS) and language information (LID) into these models which leads to significant improvements in terms of perplexity. Furthermore, a comparison between RNNLMs and FLMs and a detailed analysis of perplexities on the different backoff levels are performed. Finally, we show that recurrent neural networks and factored language models can . be combined using linear interpolation to achieve the best performance. The final combined language model provides 37.8% relative improvement in terms of perplexity on the SEAME development set and a relative improvement of 32.7% on the evaluation set compared to the traditional n-gram language model.

<p>Author: Alan Akbik ; Oresti Konomi ; Michail Melnikov</p><p>Abstract: The use ofdeep syntactic information such as typed dependencies has been shown to be very effective in Information Extraction. Despite this potential, the process of manually creating rule-based information extractors that operate on dependency trees is not intuitive for persons without an extensive NLP background. In this system demonstration, we present a tool and a workflow designed to enable initiate users to interactively explore the effect and expressivity of creating Information Extraction rules over dependency trees. We introduce the proposed five step workflow for creating information extractors, the graph query based rule language, as well as the core features of the PROP- MINER tool.</p><p>same-paper 4 0.83687854 <a title="70-lda-4" href="./acl-2013-Bilingually-Guided_Monolingual_Dependency_Grammar_Induction.html">70 acl-2013-Bilingually-Guided Monolingual Dependency Grammar Induction</a></p>
<p>Author: Kai Liu ; Yajuan Lu ; Wenbin Jiang ; Qun Liu</p><p>Abstract: This paper describes a novel strategy for automatic induction of a monolingual dependency grammar under the guidance of bilingually-projected dependency. By moderately leveraging the dependency information projected from the parsed counterpart language, and simultaneously mining the underlying syntactic structure of the language considered, it effectively integrates the advantages of bilingual projection and unsupervised induction, so as to induce a monolingual grammar much better than previous models only using bilingual projection or unsupervised induction. We induced dependency gram- mar for five different languages under the guidance of dependency information projected from the parsed English translation, experiments show that the bilinguallyguided method achieves a significant improvement of 28.5% over the unsupervised baseline and 3.0% over the best projection baseline on average.</p><p>5 0.81802118 <a title="70-lda-5" href="./acl-2013-Modeling_of_term-distance_and_term-occurrence_information_for_improving_n-gram_language_model_performance.html">247 acl-2013-Modeling of term-distance and term-occurrence information for improving n-gram language model performance</a></p>
<p>Author: Tze Yuang Chong ; Rafael E. Banchs ; Eng Siong Chng ; Haizhou Li</p><p>Abstract: In this paper, we explore the use of distance and co-occurrence information of word-pairs for language modeling. We attempt to extract this information from history-contexts of up to ten words in size, and found it complements well the n-gram model, which inherently suffers from data scarcity in learning long history-contexts. Evaluated on the WSJ corpus, bigram and trigram model perplexity were reduced up to 23.5% and 14.0%, respectively. Compared to the distant bigram, we show that word-pairs can be more effectively modeled in terms of both distance and occurrence. 1</p><p>6 0.72472584 <a title="70-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Argument_Inference_from_Relevant_Event_Mentions_in_Chinese_Argument_Extraction.html">56 acl-2013-Argument Inference from Relevant Event Mentions in Chinese Argument Extraction</a></p>

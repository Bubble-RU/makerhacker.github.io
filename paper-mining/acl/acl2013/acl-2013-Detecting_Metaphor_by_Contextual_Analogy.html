<p>Author: Zornitsa Kozareva</p><p>Abstract: Metaphor is an important way of conveying the affect of people, hence understanding how people use metaphors to convey affect is important for the communication between individuals and increases cohesion if the perceived affect of the concrete example is the same for the two individuals. Therefore, building computational models that can automatically identify the affect in metaphor-rich texts like “The team captain is a rock.”, “Time is money.”, “My lawyer is a shark.” is an important challenging problem, which has been of great interest to the research community. To solve this task, we have collected and manually annotated the affect of metaphor-rich texts for four languages. We present novel algorithms that integrate triggers for cognitive, affective, perceptual and social processes with stylistic and lexical information. By running evaluations on datasets in English, Spanish, Russian and Farsi, we show that the developed affect polarity and valence prediction technology of metaphor-rich texts is portable and works equally well for different languages.</p><p>3 0.54971051 <a title="116-tfidf-3" href="./acl-2013-Computational_considerations_of_comparisons_and_similes.html">88 acl-2013-Computational considerations of comparisons and similes</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Guofu Li</p><p>Abstract: Just as observing is more than just seeing, comparing is far more than mere matching. It takes understanding, and even inventiveness, to discern a useful basis for judging two ideas as similar in a particular context, especially when our perspective is shaped by an act of linguistic creativity such as metaphor, simile or analogy. Structured resources such as WordNet offer a convenient hierarchical means for converging on a common ground for comparison, but offer little support for the divergent thinking that is needed to creatively view one concept as another. We describe such a means here, by showing how the web can be used to harvest many divergent views for many familiar ideas. These lateral views complement the vertical views of WordNet, and support a system for idea exploration called Thesaurus Rex. We show also how Thesaurus Rex supports a novel, generative similarity measure for WordNet. 1 Seeing is Believing (and Creating) Similarity is a cognitive phenomenon that is both complex and subjective, yet for practical reasons it is often modeled as if it were simple and objective. This makes sense for the many situations where we want to align our similarity judgments with those of others, and thus focus on the same conventional properties that others are also likely to focus upon. This reliance on the consensus viewpoint explains why WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has proven so useful as a basis for computational measures of lexico-semantic similarity Guofu Li School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D2, Ireland. l .guo fu . l gmai l i @ .com (e.g. see Pederson et al. 2004, Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006; Seco et al. 2006). These measures reduce the similarity of two lexical concepts to a single number, by viewing similarity as an objective estimate of the overlap in their salient qualities. This convenient perspective is poorly suited to creative or insightful comparisons, but it is sufficient for the many mundane comparisons we often perform in daily life, such as when we organize books or look for items in a supermarket. So if we do not know in which aisle to locate a given item (such as oatmeal), we may tacitly know how to locate a similar product (such as cornflakes) and orient ourselves accordingly. Yet there are occasions when the recognition of similarities spurs the creation of similarities, when the act of comparison spurs us to invent new ways of looking at an idea. By placing pop tarts in the breakfast aisle, food manufacturers encourage us to view them as a breakfast food that is not dissimilar to oatmeal or cornflakes. When ex-PM Tony Blair published his memoirs, a mischievous activist encouraged others to move his book from Biography to Fiction in bookshops, in the hope that buyers would see it in a new light. Whenever we use a novel metaphor to convey a non-obvious viewpoint on a topic, such as “cigarettes are time bombs”, the comparison may spur us to insight, to see aspects of the topic that make it more similar to the vehicle (see Ortony, 1979; Veale & Hao, 2007). In formal terms, assume agent A has an insight about concept X, and uses the metaphor X is a Y to also provoke this insight in agent B. To arrive at this insight for itself, B must intuit what X and Y have in common. But this commonality is surely more than a standard categorization of X, or else it would not count as an insight about X. To understand the metaphor, B must place X 660 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 6 0–670, in a new category, so that X can be seen as more similar to Y. Metaphors shape the way we per- ceive the world by re-shaping the way we make similarity judgments. So if we want to imbue computers with the ability to make and to understand creative metaphors, we must first give them the ability to look beyond the narrow viewpoints of conventional resources. Any measure that models similarity as an objective function of a conventional worldview employs a convergent thought process. Using WordNet, for instance, a similarity measure can vertically converge on a common superordinate category of both inputs, and generate a single numeric result based on their distance to, and the information content of, this common generalization. So to find the most conventional ways of seeing a lexical concept, one simply ascends a narrowing concept hierarchy, using a process de Bono (1970) calls vertical thinking. To find novel, non-obvious and useful ways of looking at a lexical concept, one must use what Guilford (1967) calls divergent thinking and what de Bono calls lateral thinking. These processes cut across familiar category boundaries, to simultaneously place a concept in many different categories so that we can see it in many different ways. de Bono argues that vertical thinking is selective while lateral thinking is generative. Whereas vertical thinking concerns itself with the “right” way or a single “best” way of looking at things, lateral thinking focuses on producing alternatives to the status quo. To be as useful for creative tasks as they are for conventional tasks, we need to re-imagine our computational similarity measures as generative rather than selective, expansive rather than reductive, divergent as well as convergent and lateral as well as vertical. Though WordNet is ideally structured to support vertical, convergent reasoning, its comprehensive nature means it can also be used as a solid foundation for building a more lateral and divergent model of similarity. Here we will use the web as a source of diverse perspectives on familiar ideas, to complement the conventional and often narrow views codified by WordNet. Section 2 provides a brief overview of past work in the area of similarity measurement, before section 3 describes a simple bootstrapping loop for acquiring richly diverse perspectives from the web for a wide variety of familiar ideas. These perspectives are used to enhance a Word- Net-based measure of lexico-semantic similarity in section 4, by broadening the range of informative viewpoints the measure can select from. Similarity is thus modeled as a process that is both generative and selective. This lateral-andvertical approach is evaluated in section 5, on the Miller & Charles (1991) data-set. A web app for the lateral exploration of diverse viewpoints, named Thesaurus Rex, is also presented, before closing remarks are offered in section 6. 2 Related Work and Ideas WordNet’s taxonomic organization of nounsenses and verb-senses – in which very general categories are successively divided into increasingly informative sub-categories or instancelevel ideas – allows us to gauge the overlap in information content, and thus of meaning, of two lexical concepts. We need only identify the deepest point in the taxonomy at which this content starts to diverge. This point of divergence is often called the LCS, or least common subsumer, of two concepts (Pederson et al., 2004). Since sub-categories add new properties to those they inherit from their parents – Aristotle called these properties the differentia that stop a category system from trivially collapsing into itself – the depth of a lexical concept in a taxonomy is an intuitive proxy for its information content. Wu & Palmer (1994) use the depth of a lexical concept in the WordNet hierarchy as such a proxy, and thereby estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as twice the depth of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual depths. Leacock and Chodorow (1998) instead use the length of the shortest path between two concepts as a proxy for the conceptual distance between them. To connect any two ideas in a hierarchical system, one must vertically ascend the hierarchy from one concept, change direction at a potential LCS, and then descend the hierarchy to reach the second concept. (Aristotle was also first to suggest this approach in his Poetics). Leacock and Chodorow normalize the length of this path by dividing its size (in nodes) by twice the depth of the deepest concept in the hierarchy; the latter is an upper bound on the distance between any two concepts in the hierarchy. Negating the log of this normalized length yields a corresponding similarity score. While the role of an LCS is merely implied in Leacock and Chodorow’s use of a shortest path, the LCS is pivotal nonetheless, and like that of Wu & Palmer, the approach uses an essentially vertical reasoning process to identify a single “best” generalization. Depth is a convenient proxy for information content, but more nuanced proxies can yield 661 more rounded similarity measures. Resnick (1995) draws on information theory to define the information content of a lexical concept as the negative log likelihood of its occurrence in a corpus, either explicitly (via a direct mention) or by presupposition (via a mention of any of its sub-categories or instances). Since the likelihood of a general category occurring in a corpus is higher than that of any of its sub-categories or instances, such categories are more predictable, and less informative, than rarer categories whose occurrences are less predictable and thus more informative. The negative log likelihood of the most informative LCS of two lexical concepts offers a reliable estimate of the amount of infor- mation shared by those concepts, and thus a good estimate of their similarity. Lin (1998) combines the intuitions behind Resnick’s metric and that of Wu and Palmer to estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as an information ratio: twice the information content of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual information contents. Jiang and Conrath (1997) consider the converse notion of dissimilarity, noting that two lexical concepts are dissimilar to the extent that each contains information that is not shared by the other. So if the information content of their most informative LCS is a good measure of what they do share, then the sum of their individual information contents, minus twice the content of their most informative LCS, is a reliable estimate of their dissimilarity. Seco et al. (2006) presents a minor innovation, showing how Resnick’s notion of information content can be calculated without the use of an external corpus. Rather, when using Resnick’s metric (or that of Lin, or Jiang and Conrath) for measuring the similarity of lexical concepts in WordNet, one can use the category structure of WordNet itself to estimate infor- mation content. Typically, the more general a concept, the more descendants it will possess. Seco et al. thus estimate the information content of a lexical concept as the log of the sum of all its unique descendants (both direct and indirect), divided by the log of the total number of concepts in the entire hierarchy. Not only is this intrinsic view of information content convenient to use, without recourse to an external corpus, Seco et al. show that it offers a better estimate of information content than its extrinsic, corpus-based alternatives, as measured relative to average human similarity ratings for the 30 word-pairs in the Miller & Charles (1991) test set. A similarity measure can draw on other sources of information besides WordNet’s category structures. One might eke out additional information from WordNet’s textual glosses, as in Lesk (1986), or use category structures other than those offered by WordNet. Looking beyond WordNet, entries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are not only connected by a dense topology of lateral links, they are also organized by a rich hierarchy of overlapping categories. Strube and Ponzetto (2006) show how Wikipedia can support a measure of similarity (and relatedness) that better approximates human judgments than many WordNet-based measures. Nonetheless, WordNet can be a valuable component of a hybrid measure, and Agirre et al. (2009) use an SVM (support vector machine) to combine information from WordNet with information harvested from the web. Their best similarity measure achieves a remarkable 0.93 correlation with human judgments on the Miller & Charles word-pair set. Similarity is not always applied to pairs of concepts; it is sometimes analogically applied to pairs of pairs of concepts, as in proportional analogies of the form A is to B as C is to D (e.g., hacks are to writers as mercenaries are to soldiers, or chisels are to sculptors as scalpels are to surgeons). In such analogies, one is really assessing the similarity of the unstated relationship between each pair of concepts: thus, mercenaries are soldiers whose allegiance is paid for, much as hacks are writers with income-driven loyalties; sculptors use chisels to carve stone, while surgeons use scalpels to cut or carve flesh. Veale (2004) used WordNet to assess the similarity of A:B to C:D as a function of the combined similarity of A to C and of B to D. In contrast, Turney (2005) used the web to pursue a more divergent course, to represent the tacit relationships of A to B and of C to D as points in a highdimensional space. The dimensions of this space initially correspond to linking phrases on the web, before these dimensions are significantly reduced using singular value decomposition. In the infamous SAT test, an analogy A:B::C:D has four other pairs of concepts that serve as likely distractors (e.g. singer:songwriter for hack:writer) and the goal is to choose the most appropriate C:D pair for a given A:B pairing. Using variants of Wu and Palmer (1994) on the 374 SAT analogies of Turney (2005), Veale (2004) reports a success rate of 38–44% using only WordNet-based similarity. In contrast, Turney (2005) reports up to 55% success on the same analogies, partly because his approach aims 662 to match implicit relations rather than explicit concepts, and in part because it uses a divergent process to gather from the web as rich a perspec- tive as it can on these latent relationships. 2.1 Clever Comparisons Create Similarity Each of these approaches to similarity is a user of information, rather than a creator, and each fails to capture how a creative comparison (such as a metaphor) can spur a listener to view a topic from an atypical perspective. Camac & Glucksberg (1984) provide experimental evidence for the claim that “metaphors do not use preexisting associations to achieve their effects [… ] people use metaphors to create new relations between concepts.” They also offer a salutary reminder of an often overlooked fact: every comparison exploits information, but each is also a source of new information in its own right. Thus, “this cola is acid” reveals a different perspective on cola (e.g. as a corrosive substance or an irritating food) than “this acid is cola” highlights for acid (such as e.g., a familiar substance) Veale & Keane (1994) model the role of similarity in realizing the long-term perlocutionary effect of an informative comparison. For example, to compare surgeons to butchers is to encourage one to see all surgeons as more bloody, … crude or careless. The reverse comparison, of butchers to surgeons, encourages one to see butchers as more skilled and precise. Veale & Keane present a network model of memory, called Sapper, in which activation can spread between related concepts, thus allowing one concept to prime the properties of a neighbor. To interpret an analogy, Sapper lays down new activation-carrying bridges in memory between analogical counterparts, such as between surgeon & butcher, flesh & meat, and scalpel & cleaver. Comparisons can thus have lasting effects on how Sapper sees the world, changing the pattern of activation that arises when it primes a concept. Veale (2003) adopts a similarly dynamic view of similarity in WordNet, showing how an analogical comparison can result in the automatic addition of new categories and relations to WordNet itself. Veale considers the problem of finding an analogical mapping between different parts of WordNet’s noun-sense hierarchy, such as between instances of Greek god and Norse god, or between the letters of different alphabets, such as of Greek and Hebrew. But no structural similarity measure for WordNet exhibits enough discernment to e.g. assign a higher similarity to Zeus & Odin (each is the supreme deity of its pantheon) than to a pairing of Zeus and any other Norse god, just as no structural measure will assign a higher similarity to Alpha & Aleph or to Beta & Beth than to any random letter pairing. A fine-grained category hierarchy permits fine-grained similarity judgments, and though WordNet is useful, its sense hierarchies are not especially fine-grained. However, we can automatically make WordNet subtler and more discerning, by adding new fine-grained categories to unite lexical concepts whose similarity is not reflected by any existing categories. Veale (2003) shows how a property that is found in the glosses of two lexical concepts, of the same depth, can be combined with their LCS to yield a new fine-grained parent category, so e.g. “supreme” + deity = Supreme-deity (for Odin, Zeus, Jupiter, etc.) and “1 st” + letter = 1st-letter (for Alpha, Aleph, etc.) Selected aspects of the textual similarity of two WordNet glosses – the key to similarity in Lesk (1986) – can thus be reified into an explicitly categorical WordNet form. 3 Divergent (Re)Categorization To tap into a richer source of concept properties than WordNet’s glosses, we can use web ngrams. Consider these descriptions of a cowboy from the Google n-grams (Brants & Franz, 2006). The numbers to the right are Google frequency counts. a lonesome cowboy 432 a mounted cowboy 122 a grizzled cowboy 74 a swaggering cowboy 68 To find the stable properties that can underpin a meaningful fine-grained category for cowboy, we must seek out the properties that are so often presupposed to be salient of all cowboys that one can use them to anchor a simile, such as</p><p>5 0.17254059 <a title="116-tfidf-5" href="./acl-2013-The_Effects_of_Lexical_Resource_Quality_on_Preference_Violation_Detection.html">344 acl-2013-The Effects of Lexical Resource Quality on Preference Violation Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesse Dunietz ; Lori Levin ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet are widely used in a multitude of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora such as treebanks. Often, the resources are used as-is, without question or examination. This practice risks missing significant performance gains and even entire techniques. This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations. We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector. With asis lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources. More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements.</p><p>6 0.12913522 <a title="116-tfidf-6" href="./acl-2013-Align%2C_Disambiguate_and_Walk%3A_A_Unified_Approach_for_Measuring_Semantic_Similarity.html">43 acl-2013-Align, Disambiguate and Walk: A Unified Approach for Measuring Semantic Similarity</a></p>

<p>Author: Tony Veale ; Guofu Li</p><p>Abstract: Just as observing is more than just seeing, comparing is far more than mere matching. It takes understanding, and even inventiveness, to discern a useful basis for judging two ideas as similar in a particular context, especially when our perspective is shaped by an act of linguistic creativity such as metaphor, simile or analogy. Structured resources such as WordNet offer a convenient hierarchical means for converging on a common ground for comparison, but offer little support for the divergent thinking that is needed to creatively view one concept as another. We describe such a means here, by showing how the web can be used to harvest many divergent views for many familiar ideas. These lateral views complement the vertical views of WordNet, and support a system for idea exploration called Thesaurus Rex. We show also how Thesaurus Rex supports a novel, generative similarity measure for WordNet. 1 Seeing is Believing (and Creating) Similarity is a cognitive phenomenon that is both complex and subjective, yet for practical reasons it is often modeled as if it were simple and objective. This makes sense for the many situations where we want to align our similarity judgments with those of others, and thus focus on the same conventional properties that others are also likely to focus upon. This reliance on the consensus viewpoint explains why WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998) has proven so useful as a basis for computational measures of lexico-semantic similarity Guofu Li School of Computer Science and Informatics, University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin D2, Ireland. l .guo fu . l gmai l i @ .com (e.g. see Pederson et al. 2004, Budanitsky & Hirst, 2006; Seco et al. 2006). These measures reduce the similarity of two lexical concepts to a single number, by viewing similarity as an objective estimate of the overlap in their salient qualities. This convenient perspective is poorly suited to creative or insightful comparisons, but it is sufficient for the many mundane comparisons we often perform in daily life, such as when we organize books or look for items in a supermarket. So if we do not know in which aisle to locate a given item (such as oatmeal), we may tacitly know how to locate a similar product (such as cornflakes) and orient ourselves accordingly. Yet there are occasions when the recognition of similarities spurs the creation of similarities, when the act of comparison spurs us to invent new ways of looking at an idea. By placing pop tarts in the breakfast aisle, food manufacturers encourage us to view them as a breakfast food that is not dissimilar to oatmeal or cornflakes. When ex-PM Tony Blair published his memoirs, a mischievous activist encouraged others to move his book from Biography to Fiction in bookshops, in the hope that buyers would see it in a new light. Whenever we use a novel metaphor to convey a non-obvious viewpoint on a topic, such as “cigarettes are time bombs”, the comparison may spur us to insight, to see aspects of the topic that make it more similar to the vehicle (see Ortony, 1979; Veale & Hao, 2007). In formal terms, assume agent A has an insight about concept X, and uses the metaphor X is a Y to also provoke this insight in agent B. To arrive at this insight for itself, B must intuit what X and Y have in common. But this commonality is surely more than a standard categorization of X, or else it would not count as an insight about X. To understand the metaphor, B must place X 660 Proce dingSsof oifa, th Beu 5l1gsarti Aan,An u aglu Mste 4e-ti9n2g 0 o1f3 t.he ?c A2s0s1o3ci Aatsiosonc fioartio Cno fmorpu Ctoamtiopnuatalt Lioin gauli Lsitnicgsu,i psatgices 6 0–670, in a new category, so that X can be seen as more similar to Y. Metaphors shape the way we per- ceive the world by re-shaping the way we make similarity judgments. So if we want to imbue computers with the ability to make and to understand creative metaphors, we must first give them the ability to look beyond the narrow viewpoints of conventional resources. Any measure that models similarity as an objective function of a conventional worldview employs a convergent thought process. Using WordNet, for instance, a similarity measure can vertically converge on a common superordinate category of both inputs, and generate a single numeric result based on their distance to, and the information content of, this common generalization. So to find the most conventional ways of seeing a lexical concept, one simply ascends a narrowing concept hierarchy, using a process de Bono (1970) calls vertical thinking. To find novel, non-obvious and useful ways of looking at a lexical concept, one must use what Guilford (1967) calls divergent thinking and what de Bono calls lateral thinking. These processes cut across familiar category boundaries, to simultaneously place a concept in many different categories so that we can see it in many different ways. de Bono argues that vertical thinking is selective while lateral thinking is generative. Whereas vertical thinking concerns itself with the “right” way or a single “best” way of looking at things, lateral thinking focuses on producing alternatives to the status quo. To be as useful for creative tasks as they are for conventional tasks, we need to re-imagine our computational similarity measures as generative rather than selective, expansive rather than reductive, divergent as well as convergent and lateral as well as vertical. Though WordNet is ideally structured to support vertical, convergent reasoning, its comprehensive nature means it can also be used as a solid foundation for building a more lateral and divergent model of similarity. Here we will use the web as a source of diverse perspectives on familiar ideas, to complement the conventional and often narrow views codified by WordNet. Section 2 provides a brief overview of past work in the area of similarity measurement, before section 3 describes a simple bootstrapping loop for acquiring richly diverse perspectives from the web for a wide variety of familiar ideas. These perspectives are used to enhance a Word- Net-based measure of lexico-semantic similarity in section 4, by broadening the range of informative viewpoints the measure can select from. Similarity is thus modeled as a process that is both generative and selective. This lateral-andvertical approach is evaluated in section 5, on the Miller & Charles (1991) data-set. A web app for the lateral exploration of diverse viewpoints, named Thesaurus Rex, is also presented, before closing remarks are offered in section 6. 2 Related Work and Ideas WordNet’s taxonomic organization of nounsenses and verb-senses – in which very general categories are successively divided into increasingly informative sub-categories or instancelevel ideas – allows us to gauge the overlap in information content, and thus of meaning, of two lexical concepts. We need only identify the deepest point in the taxonomy at which this content starts to diverge. This point of divergence is often called the LCS, or least common subsumer, of two concepts (Pederson et al., 2004). Since sub-categories add new properties to those they inherit from their parents – Aristotle called these properties the differentia that stop a category system from trivially collapsing into itself – the depth of a lexical concept in a taxonomy is an intuitive proxy for its information content. Wu & Palmer (1994) use the depth of a lexical concept in the WordNet hierarchy as such a proxy, and thereby estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as twice the depth of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual depths. Leacock and Chodorow (1998) instead use the length of the shortest path between two concepts as a proxy for the conceptual distance between them. To connect any two ideas in a hierarchical system, one must vertically ascend the hierarchy from one concept, change direction at a potential LCS, and then descend the hierarchy to reach the second concept. (Aristotle was also first to suggest this approach in his Poetics). Leacock and Chodorow normalize the length of this path by dividing its size (in nodes) by twice the depth of the deepest concept in the hierarchy; the latter is an upper bound on the distance between any two concepts in the hierarchy. Negating the log of this normalized length yields a corresponding similarity score. While the role of an LCS is merely implied in Leacock and Chodorow’s use of a shortest path, the LCS is pivotal nonetheless, and like that of Wu & Palmer, the approach uses an essentially vertical reasoning process to identify a single “best” generalization. Depth is a convenient proxy for information content, but more nuanced proxies can yield 661 more rounded similarity measures. Resnick (1995) draws on information theory to define the information content of a lexical concept as the negative log likelihood of its occurrence in a corpus, either explicitly (via a direct mention) or by presupposition (via a mention of any of its sub-categories or instances). Since the likelihood of a general category occurring in a corpus is higher than that of any of its sub-categories or instances, such categories are more predictable, and less informative, than rarer categories whose occurrences are less predictable and thus more informative. The negative log likelihood of the most informative LCS of two lexical concepts offers a reliable estimate of the amount of infor- mation shared by those concepts, and thus a good estimate of their similarity. Lin (1998) combines the intuitions behind Resnick’s metric and that of Wu and Palmer to estimate the similarity of two lexical concepts as an information ratio: twice the information content of their LCS divided by the sum of their individual information contents. Jiang and Conrath (1997) consider the converse notion of dissimilarity, noting that two lexical concepts are dissimilar to the extent that each contains information that is not shared by the other. So if the information content of their most informative LCS is a good measure of what they do share, then the sum of their individual information contents, minus twice the content of their most informative LCS, is a reliable estimate of their dissimilarity. Seco et al. (2006) presents a minor innovation, showing how Resnick’s notion of information content can be calculated without the use of an external corpus. Rather, when using Resnick’s metric (or that of Lin, or Jiang and Conrath) for measuring the similarity of lexical concepts in WordNet, one can use the category structure of WordNet itself to estimate infor- mation content. Typically, the more general a concept, the more descendants it will possess. Seco et al. thus estimate the information content of a lexical concept as the log of the sum of all its unique descendants (both direct and indirect), divided by the log of the total number of concepts in the entire hierarchy. Not only is this intrinsic view of information content convenient to use, without recourse to an external corpus, Seco et al. show that it offers a better estimate of information content than its extrinsic, corpus-based alternatives, as measured relative to average human similarity ratings for the 30 word-pairs in the Miller & Charles (1991) test set. A similarity measure can draw on other sources of information besides WordNet’s category structures. One might eke out additional information from WordNet’s textual glosses, as in Lesk (1986), or use category structures other than those offered by WordNet. Looking beyond WordNet, entries in the online encyclopedia Wikipedia are not only connected by a dense topology of lateral links, they are also organized by a rich hierarchy of overlapping categories. Strube and Ponzetto (2006) show how Wikipedia can support a measure of similarity (and relatedness) that better approximates human judgments than many WordNet-based measures. Nonetheless, WordNet can be a valuable component of a hybrid measure, and Agirre et al. (2009) use an SVM (support vector machine) to combine information from WordNet with information harvested from the web. Their best similarity measure achieves a remarkable 0.93 correlation with human judgments on the Miller & Charles word-pair set. Similarity is not always applied to pairs of concepts; it is sometimes analogically applied to pairs of pairs of concepts, as in proportional analogies of the form A is to B as C is to D (e.g., hacks are to writers as mercenaries are to soldiers, or chisels are to sculptors as scalpels are to surgeons). In such analogies, one is really assessing the similarity of the unstated relationship between each pair of concepts: thus, mercenaries are soldiers whose allegiance is paid for, much as hacks are writers with income-driven loyalties; sculptors use chisels to carve stone, while surgeons use scalpels to cut or carve flesh. Veale (2004) used WordNet to assess the similarity of A:B to C:D as a function of the combined similarity of A to C and of B to D. In contrast, Turney (2005) used the web to pursue a more divergent course, to represent the tacit relationships of A to B and of C to D as points in a highdimensional space. The dimensions of this space initially correspond to linking phrases on the web, before these dimensions are significantly reduced using singular value decomposition. In the infamous SAT test, an analogy A:B::C:D has four other pairs of concepts that serve as likely distractors (e.g. singer:songwriter for hack:writer) and the goal is to choose the most appropriate C:D pair for a given A:B pairing. Using variants of Wu and Palmer (1994) on the 374 SAT analogies of Turney (2005), Veale (2004) reports a success rate of 38–44% using only WordNet-based similarity. In contrast, Turney (2005) reports up to 55% success on the same analogies, partly because his approach aims 662 to match implicit relations rather than explicit concepts, and in part because it uses a divergent process to gather from the web as rich a perspec- tive as it can on these latent relationships. 2.1 Clever Comparisons Create Similarity Each of these approaches to similarity is a user of information, rather than a creator, and each fails to capture how a creative comparison (such as a metaphor) can spur a listener to view a topic from an atypical perspective. Camac & Glucksberg (1984) provide experimental evidence for the claim that “metaphors do not use preexisting associations to achieve their effects [… ] people use metaphors to create new relations between concepts.” They also offer a salutary reminder of an often overlooked fact: every comparison exploits information, but each is also a source of new information in its own right. Thus, “this cola is acid” reveals a different perspective on cola (e.g. as a corrosive substance or an irritating food) than “this acid is cola” highlights for acid (such as e.g., a familiar substance) Veale & Keane (1994) model the role of similarity in realizing the long-term perlocutionary effect of an informative comparison. For example, to compare surgeons to butchers is to encourage one to see all surgeons as more bloody, … crude or careless. The reverse comparison, of butchers to surgeons, encourages one to see butchers as more skilled and precise. Veale & Keane present a network model of memory, called Sapper, in which activation can spread between related concepts, thus allowing one concept to prime the properties of a neighbor. To interpret an analogy, Sapper lays down new activation-carrying bridges in memory between analogical counterparts, such as between surgeon & butcher, flesh & meat, and scalpel & cleaver. Comparisons can thus have lasting effects on how Sapper sees the world, changing the pattern of activation that arises when it primes a concept. Veale (2003) adopts a similarly dynamic view of similarity in WordNet, showing how an analogical comparison can result in the automatic addition of new categories and relations to WordNet itself. Veale considers the problem of finding an analogical mapping between different parts of WordNet’s noun-sense hierarchy, such as between instances of Greek god and Norse god, or between the letters of different alphabets, such as of Greek and Hebrew. But no structural similarity measure for WordNet exhibits enough discernment to e.g. assign a higher similarity to Zeus & Odin (each is the supreme deity of its pantheon) than to a pairing of Zeus and any other Norse god, just as no structural measure will assign a higher similarity to Alpha & Aleph or to Beta & Beth than to any random letter pairing. A fine-grained category hierarchy permits fine-grained similarity judgments, and though WordNet is useful, its sense hierarchies are not especially fine-grained. However, we can automatically make WordNet subtler and more discerning, by adding new fine-grained categories to unite lexical concepts whose similarity is not reflected by any existing categories. Veale (2003) shows how a property that is found in the glosses of two lexical concepts, of the same depth, can be combined with their LCS to yield a new fine-grained parent category, so e.g. “supreme” + deity = Supreme-deity (for Odin, Zeus, Jupiter, etc.) and “1 st” + letter = 1st-letter (for Alpha, Aleph, etc.) Selected aspects of the textual similarity of two WordNet glosses – the key to similarity in Lesk (1986) – can thus be reified into an explicitly categorical WordNet form. 3 Divergent (Re)Categorization To tap into a richer source of concept properties than WordNet’s glosses, we can use web ngrams. Consider these descriptions of a cowboy from the Google n-grams (Brants & Franz, 2006). The numbers to the right are Google frequency counts. a lonesome cowboy 432 a mounted cowboy 122 a grizzled cowboy 74 a swaggering cowboy 68 To find the stable properties that can underpin a meaningful fine-grained category for cowboy, we must seek out the properties that are so often presupposed to be salient of all cowboys that one can use them to anchor a simile, such as</p><p>5 0.46807486 <a title="116-lsi-5" href="./acl-2013-The_Effects_of_Lexical_Resource_Quality_on_Preference_Violation_Detection.html">344 acl-2013-The Effects of Lexical Resource Quality on Preference Violation Detection</a></p>
<p>Author: Jesse Dunietz ; Lori Levin ; Jaime Carbonell</p><p>Abstract: Lexical resources such as WordNet and VerbNet are widely used in a multitude of NLP tasks, as are annotated corpora such as treebanks. Often, the resources are used as-is, without question or examination. This practice risks missing significant performance gains and even entire techniques. This paper addresses the importance of resource quality through the lens of a challenging NLP task: detecting selectional preference violations. We present DAVID, a simple, lexical resource-based preference violation detector. With asis lexical resources, DAVID achieves an F1-measure of just 28.27%. When the resource entries and parser outputs for a small sample are corrected, however, the F1-measure on that sample jumps from 40% to 61.54%, and performance on other examples rises, suggesting that the algorithm becomes practical given refined resources. More broadly, this paper shows that resource quality matters tremendously, sometimes even more than algorithmic improvements.</p><p>6 0.32450548 <a title="116-lsi-6" href="./acl-2013-Understanding_Verbs_based_on_Overlapping_Verbs_Senses.html">366 acl-2013-Understanding Verbs based on Overlapping Verbs Senses</a></p>

<p>Author: Abhijit Mishra ; Pushpak Bhattacharyya ; Michael Carl</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we introduce Translation Difficulty Index (TDI), a measure of difficulty in text translation. We first define and quantify translation difficulty in terms of TDI. We realize that any measure of TDI based on direct input by translators is fraught with subjectivity and adhocism. We, rather, rely on cognitive evidences from eye tracking. TDI is measured as the sum of fixation (gaze) and saccade (rapid eye movement) times of the eye. We then establish that TDI is correlated with three properties of the input sentence, viz. length (L), degree of polysemy (DP) and structural complexity (SC). We train a Support Vector Regression (SVR) system to predict TDIs for new sentences using these features as input. The prediction done by our framework is well correlated with the empirical gold standard data, which is a repository of < L, DP, SC > and TDI pairs for a set of sentences. The primary use of our work is a way of “binning” sentences (to be translated) in “easy”, “medium” and “hard” categories as per their predicted TDI. This can decide pricing of any translation task, especially useful in a scenario where parallel corpora for Machine Translation are built through translation crowdsourcing/outsourcing. This can also provide a way of monitoring progress of second language learners.</p><p>same-paper 2 0.7766338 <a title="116-lda-2" href="./acl-2013-Detecting_Metaphor_by_Contextual_Analogy.html">116 acl-2013-Detecting Metaphor by Contextual Analogy</a></p>

<p>Author: Malte Nuhn ; Julian Schamper ; Hermann Ney</p><p>Abstract: In this paper we address the problem of solving substitution ciphers using a beam search approach. We present a conceptually consistent and easy to implement method that improves the current state of the art for decipherment of substitution ciphers and is able to use high order n-gram language models. We show experiments with 1:1 substitution ciphers in which the guaranteed optimal solution for 3-gram language models has 38.6% decipherment error, while our approach achieves 4.13% decipherment error in a fraction of time by using a 6-gram language model. We also apply our approach to the famous Zodiac-408 cipher and obtain slightly bet- ter (and near to optimal) results than previously published. Unlike the previous state-of-the-art approach that uses additional word lists to evaluate possible decipherments, our approach only uses a letterbased 6-gram language model. Furthermore we use our algorithm to solve large vocabulary substitution ciphers and improve the best published decipherment error rate based on the Gigaword corpus of 7.8% to 6.0% error rate.</p><p>6 0.72596878 <a title="116-lda-6" href="./acl-2013-Joint_Word_Alignment_and_Bilingual_Named_Entity_Recognition_Using_Dual_Decomposition.html">210 acl-2013-Joint Word Alignment and Bilingual Named Entity Recognition Using Dual Decomposition</a></p>
